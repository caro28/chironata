          <p>ORDERICUS VITALIS, in his personal and literary history, as <lb/>
            well as in the annals which compose the most valuable part <lb/>
            of his voluminous work, forms a connecting link between <lb/>
            the English and Norman writers of the eleventh and twelfth <lb/>
            centuries. Born in England, and having received the <lb/>
            first rudiments of learning at Shrewsbury, he was removed <lb/>
            at an early age to a monastery in Normandy, in which he <lb/>
            completed his education, and passed the rest of his life <lb/>
            in the duties of his monastic profession and in literary <lb/>
            labours. These, as M. Guizot has remarked were " espe­ <lb/>
            cially devoted to the glory of Normandy and, doubtless, <lb/>
            that was the field on which all his immediate associations <lb/>
            led him to dwell with the greatest freedom, and to cultivate <lb/>
            in its minutest details.</p>
          <p>But Ordericus did not forget his native country; he so <lb/>
            gloried in the name of "Englishman" that it is added to <lb/>
            his Norman designation of "monk of St. Evroult" in his <lb/>
            autograph manuscript; and the accounts he gives of English <lb/>
            affairs generally, during the reigns of the three first Norman <lb/>
            kings, interspersed with local and personal matters of con­ <lb/>
            siderable interest, exhibit the same careful research, if they , <lb/>
            are not so diffuse, as the portion of his work devoted to <note type="footnote"> * Notice sur Orderic Vital, prefixed to the French translation of our <lb/>
            author's History, </note> <pb n="iv"/>
             </p>
          <p>Normandy. He undertook a journey to England for the <lb/>
            express purpose of collecting materials, and his connection <lb/>
            with the family of the great Earl of Shrewsbury, who had <lb/>
            possessions in both countries, would give him access to <lb/>
            precise information on English affairs. In point of fact, he <lb/>
            alternately transports his readers from Normandy to <lb/>
            England, and from England to Normandy, two states which <lb/>
            may be considered to have formed in his time almost an <lb/>
            united kingdom, and he treats the affairs of both with nearly <lb/>
            equal precision.</p>
          <p>There is a peculiar advantage in studying English history <lb/>
            from such a point of view, during a period when many of its <lb/>
            most eminent characters were playing a distinguished part <lb/>
            in both countries. England was surrendering to the inva­ <lb/>
            ders her broad acres and free institutions, and the churches <lb/>
            and monasteries were being filled and remodelled by Norman <lb/>
            ecclesiastics, while she was adopting the feudal tenures, the <lb/>
            rules of chivalry, and the habits and manners of the con­ <lb/>
            querors, and their magnificent architecture was employed in <lb/>
            raising stately cathedrals, abbeys, and castles in all quarters. <lb/>
            On these subjects, and others connected with the changes <lb/>
            then taking place in the social and dynastic system of Eng­ <lb/>
            land, Ordericus was better qualified to throw strong light <lb/>
            than any English- historian of the time. The advanced <lb/>
            stages of his education, and almost all the associations of <lb/>
            his maturer life were foreign. His family ties had been <lb/>
            somewhat rudely severed, and be was torn from his native <lb/>
            country at an age when it would hardly fail to leave <lb/>
            some impression on so intelligent a mind; and it appears <lb/>
            from several passages in his work that he fondly cherished <lb/>
            recollections of it in the land of the stranger. What thus <lb/>
            remained of English feeling probably contributed, in com­ <lb/>
            bination with his natural honesty and simplicity of cha­ <lb/>
            racter, to the general impartiality of his narrative of English <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            affairs, and the sympathy he betrays for the sufferings of <lb/>
            his countrymen and their patriotic struggles against Nor­ <lb/>
            man usurpation.</p>
          <p>While such are our authors claims to the consideration <lb/>
            of the students of history his works have hitherto received in <lb/>
            England a share of attention very disproportionate to that <lb/>
            which they have obtained in France. The History of <lb/>
            Ordericus Vitalis has never yet been published in England, <lb/>
            and private enterprise is now employed in carrying into <lb/>
            effect, in a popular shape, what both a royal commission <lb/>
            and a literary association have alike failed in accomplishing. <lb/>
            In France, the original text of Ordericus was printed, as <lb/>
            early as the year 1619, in Duchesne's Collection of the <lb/>
            Norman Historians, published at Paris, but it was never re­ <lb/>
            printed in this country; and besides its being suited only <lb/>
            to readers of erudition, the work has now become some­ <lb/>
            what scarce. Within the last thirty years, however, no <lb/>
            less than two distinct editions of Ordericus have been <lb/>
            published at Paris under the auspices of the Historical <lb/>
            Society of France. The first, which commenced in 1826, is <lb/>
            a French version, accompanied by a few notes explain­ <lb/>
            ing localities, by M. Louis du Bois. It is prefixed by a <lb/>
            Notice from the pen of M. Guizot, who was then Pro­ <lb/>
            fessor of Modern History in the Academy of Paris, giving <lb/>
            particulars of the several manuscripts of Ordericus now <lb/>
            extant, a short account of the author's life, and an estimate <lb/>
            of his character, which it has been thought desirable to <lb/>
            translate and print as an introduction to the present work.</p>
          <p>In 1838, the French Historical Society undertook an <lb/>
            edition of the original text of Ordericus, which was confided <lb/>
            to the editorial care of M. Auguste Le Prevost. Four <lb/>
            volumes octavo have been already published at Paris, con­ <lb/>
            taining twelve books of the History, and the thirteenth is <lb/>
            announced to be in the press. This work does great credit <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            to all concerned in it, being edited and printed with extreme <lb/>
            accuracy, after a laborious collation of the best manuscripts <lb/>
            and illustrated by a vast number of valuable notes. The <lb/>
            translation now presented to the English reader is based <lb/>
            upon this edition of the author's text, compared, from time <lb/>
            to time, with that of Duchesne, in which, as elsewhere ob­ <lb/>
            served, there are numerous errors. Free use has been made <lb/>
            of the notes appended to the last Paris edition, and some <lb/>
            are added, having in general more especial reference to <lb/>
            English affairs.</p>

          </head>
          <p>OF all the works published in our collection,1 that of Ordericus <lb/>
            Vitalis is the most extensive, a sure proof of the claims it pos­ <lb/>
            sesses to more than ordinary attention. The annals of that age <lb/>
            are generally characterised by the brevity of their details, and the <lb/>
            dryness of their style. It would seem that the genius of the <lb/>
            author was so dull and barren that it satisfied itself with simply <lb/>
            accepting the facts presented to his notice, without being alive to <lb/>
            any necessity of accounting for them, of connecting them with <lb/>
            other circumstances, or of adding the reflections required to give <lb/>
            them further consistency than the mere order of dates. In those <lb/>
            times of darkness and isolation, the life of man was so confined, <lb/>
            and his views so circumscribed, that even curiosity seemed <lb/>
            to have lost its influence, and an elevated position, or a stirring <lb/>
            career, supplied the only situations in which the intellectual <lb/>
            horizon was extended, and an earnest desire for information <lb/>
            excited ; but those who found themselves by birth or accident in <lb/>
            such unusual circumstances devoted all their time and efforts to <lb/>
            action, and were too much occupied in playing their part in the <lb/>
            history of the times to give themselves any trouble about writing <lb/>
            it. Among the men of rank who flourished in the age of which <lb/>
            we are collecting memorials, two bishops, Gregory of Tours, and <lb/>
            William of Tyre, are the only persons who found leisure to bequeath <lb/>
            to posterity any lengthened account of events, the character of <lb/>
            which their situation led them to penetrate; their histories there­ <lb/>
            fore, the most extensive we have yet published, are also, regard <lb/>
            being had to the difference of the times, the most interesting, the <lb/>
            most useful, and the most rich in valuable details. Ordericus Vitalis <note type="footnote"> 1 Collection des Mémoires relatifs à l'Histoire de France, published by <lb/>
            the Historical Society of France, from 1834 to 1352. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            exhibits, if not in the same degree, at least the same kind of <lb/>
            superiority over the writers of his own age; which is the more <lb/>
            remarkable in his case, because no external circumstances, no <lb/>
            advantages of position, contributed to rouse or sustain the activity <lb/>
            of his mind. A simple monk, buried in the depths of the most <lb/>
            secluded forests of Normandy, his own genius, his instinctive <lb/>
            ardour for acquiring information, the patience with which he <lb/>
            pursued his researches, supplied the incentives and the opportu­ <lb/>
            nities for collecting materials for his vast undertaking.</p>
          <p>Ordericus was born in England on the fifteenth of February, <lb/>
            1075, at Attingham,1 on the banks of the Severn, the residence of <lb/>
            his father Odelirius, a native of Orleans, who, at the time of the <lb/>
            Norman conquest, was a follower of Roger de Montgomery, after­ <lb/>
            wards created Earl of Shrewsbury, to whose household he <lb/>
            continued to be attached in the character of one of his council. <lb/>
            Ordericus received the name of his godfather, a Saxon priest and <lb/>
            curate of the parish, who both baptized him and undertook the <lb/>
            office of sponsor. At the age of five years, Ordericus was sent to <lb/>
            school at Shrewsbury, where he learnt reading, grammar, and the <lb/>
            chants used in the church, under a master whose name was <lb/>
            Siegward.2 It would appear that his own father was a man of <lb/>
            some learning, a clerk, and a priest, for at that time, particularly <lb/>
            in England, priests were not absolutely forbidden to marry. But <lb/>
            a more perfect state of life was known, and Odelirius, who was <lb/>
            now become a widower, thought it his duty not only to renounce <lb/>
            himself all worldly attachments, but to withdraw from them his <lb/>
            eldest son Ordericus, then ten years old. He therefore devoted <lb/>
            him as well as himself to the religious life, and retired to a <lb/>
            monastery in Great Britain.3 Shortly afterwards, however, his <lb/>
            mind became disturbed by the obstacles which family ties were <note type="footnote"> 1 Atcham, a village near Shrewsbury, where the Terne falls into the <lb/>
            Severn. Our author tells us, book v. c. 1, that he was born on the 14th of <lb/>
            the calends of March, which answers to the sixteenth of February. He <lb/>
            was baptized on the Saturday of Easter, the 4th of April following. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Siward, “ a noble priest,” as our author calls him. He was of Anglo- <lb/>
            Danish extraction, connected with the blood-royal of the Saxon kings, and <lb/>
            also, it would appear, in some way with the Earl of Shrewsbury, the patron <lb/>
            of Odelirius. Siward had built a small wooden church in the suburbs of <lb/>
            that town, which becoming the property of Odelirius, was given by him for <lb/>
            the site of the stately Benedictine abbey founded there by the earl. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Odelirius assumed the monastic habit, after the death of his patron, in <lb/>
            the abbey he had lately assisted in founding at Shrewsbury, where he also <lb/>
            entered his yougest son, Benedict, to be brought up as a monk. He <lb/>
            further endowed the abbey with one half of all the estates which the earl <lb/>
            had conferred upon him, reserving the other moiety to his remaining son <lb/>
            Everard, our authors second brother, to be held as a fief under the abbey. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            calculated to offer to his salvation, and he thought that neither <lb/>
            his own nor his son's would be secure if they remained in the <lb/>
            same monastery. In order, therefore, to render their separation <lb/>
            more entire and more irrevocable,1 he made him cross the sea, <lb/>
            sending him to Normandy under the care of a monk named <lb/>
            Ragnold, where Ordericus, making an endowment of thirty silver <lb/>
            marks, entered the abbey of Ouche, belonging to the rule of St. <lb/>
            Benedict, and founded by St. Evroult, an Orleanais saint, for whom <lb/>
            Odelirius, as his countryman, felt especial veneration. This <lb/>
            abbey, which at a later period took its founder's name, stood in <lb/>
            that part of the diocese of Lisieux which is now included in the <lb/>
            department of the Orne. Buried in the bosom of forests, enriched <lb/>
            since the eleventh century with a considerable library, and in­ <lb/>
            habited by monks who were the friends of learning, the abbey of <lb/>
            Ouche was a retreat well calculated to foster the studious turn of <lb/>
            mind which, it is said, was already remarked in the young novice. <lb/>
            John, the sub-prior of the abbey, had the charge of his education, <lb/>
            and formed a strong attachment for him ; he also gained the good­ <lb/>
            will of the rest of the monks, and among others that of Mainier, <lb/>
            then abbot of St. Evroult. Ordericus entered the monastery in the <lb/>
            year 1085. The year following, on the 22nd of September, the <lb/>
            feast of St. Maurice, he received the tonsure, changing at the <lb/>
            same time his English name of Ordericus for that of Vitalis, one <lb/>
            of the companions of the saint whose memory was that day <lb/>
            observed. On the 15th of March, 1091, Gilbert Maminot, bishop <lb/>
            of Lisieux, admitted him to the order of sub-deacon at the request <lb/>
            of Serlo d'Orgères, the then abbot of St. Evroult; and two years <lb/>
            afterwards, on the 26th of March, 1093, Serlo himself, having <lb/>
            then become bishop of Lisieux, ordained him deacon. Ordericus <lb/>
            was then eighteen years of age. All the records of those ancient <lb/>
            times concur in informing us with what holy fear truly pious men <lb/>
            then regarded the duties of the priesthood, how they shrunk <lb/>
            from undertaking them, and often only consented to accept the <lb/>
            office upon the express command of their superiors. It was not <lb/>
            till fifteen years afterwards, the 21st of December, 1107, that <note type="footnote"> I Our author pays an affectionate tribute to his father's memory in book <lb/>
            v. c. 14 of the following History, where he says that he never saw him <lb/>
            again after this early separation. See also book v. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The name Ordericus, is also variously written Odericus, Udalricus, <lb/>
            &amp;c. The last seems to point to the priest from whom our author derived <lb/>
            his name of baptism, being, as well as his schoolmaster, of Scandinavian <lb/>
            extraction. He tells us that it was changed to Vital-is because his former <lb/>
            name appeared barbarous to the Normans. There seems an impropriety <lb/>
            in the common practice of combining his name of baptism with that of his <lb/>
            profession, as the latter superseded the former. He always calls himself <lb/>
            simply Vitalis, but there is authority for using both names in the oldest <lb/>
            MSS. of his works. </note> <lb/>

            William Bonne-Ame, archbishop of Rouen laid on Ordericus, as <lb/>
            he tells us himself, "the burden of the priesthood.”1</p>
          <p>Such are the simple facts which the writings of this excellent <lb/>
            monk supply concerning his own life. Taking no part in worldly <lb/>
            affairs, and equally a stranger to the high places of his own pro­ <lb/>
            fession, we find him never quitting his retirement but, on one <lb/>
            occasion, to attend a general chapter of the order of St. Benedict <lb/>
            convoked by the abbot of Cluni, and for two journeys, one to <lb/>
            Worcester,2 the other to Cambray, both, as it would appear, under­ <lb/>
            taken for the purpose of procuring information necessary in the <lb/>
            prosecution of his literary works. These formed the sole employ­ <lb/>
            ment of his life, and he does not appear to have pushed his labours <lb/>
            to extreme old age, for he tells us, at the close of his history, that <lb/>
            he had reached his sixty-seventh year, and the thirty-fourth of <lb/>
            his ministry in the priesthood, when he felt himself compelled by <lb/>
            age and infirmities to bring his work to a close; and it is scarcely <lb/>
            probable that, after a career so occupied, release from labour very <lb/>
            long preceded that from life. We ought then, if I am not mis­ <lb/>
            taken, to place the death of Ordericus Vitalis in the year 1141, or <lb/>
            at the latest in 1142. The authors of the Histoire Litteraire de la <lb/>
            France have fixed the year 1143 as the period at which his work <lb/>
            concluded; but they are evidently under a mistake, for at the <lb/>
            end of his last book Ordericus speaks of Stephen king of England <lb/>
            as being at that time in confinement, but that prince, who was <lb/>
            made prisoner at the battle of Lincoln on the 20th of February, <lb/>
            1141, was exchanged in the month of November of the same year. <lb/>
            Again, he mentions the death of John, bishop of Lisieux, as having <lb/>
            occurred so recently that his successor was not yet appointed; <lb/>
            and the bishop died on the 21st of May, 1141. Besides which, he <lb/>
            reckons eleven years from the election of Pope Innocent II., which <lb/>
            took place in the month of February, 1130. Everything therefore <lb/>
            concurs in pointing out the year 1141 as the period at which <lb/>
            Ordericus found himself under the necessity of terminating the <lb/>
            labours to which his life was consecrated.</p>
          <p>His work, devoted in an especial manner to the glory of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, comprised originally but the seven last books, in which <lb/>
            Norman history, in point of fact, holds the first place. At a later <lb/>
            period he added four books, the present third, fourth, fifth, and <lb/>
            sixth, to enable himself to give fuller particulars of some events, <note type="footnote"> 1 He was ordained priest on the feast of St. Thomas, 1107, in company <lb/>
            with one hundred and twenty others, being then, as he tells us, thirty-three <lb/>
            years of age. Book xi. c. 30, and book xiii. at the end. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 During this journey to England our author also spent some weeks at <lb/>
            Croyland Abbey, where, as he tells us, he collected the materials for several <lb/>
            chapters of his fourth book, and, at the request of the monks, composed <lb/>
            the epitaph on Earl Waltheof. See book iv. c. 15—17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            as well as to connect the glory of Normandy with that of the <lb/>
            abbey of Ouche,on the foundation and progress of which the new <lb/>
            books enter into minute details. Furthermore, having a due <lb/>
            regard to his own character, and ambitious of the honour of <lb/>
            bequeathing to posterity a complete universal history, from the <lb/>
            birth of Jesus Christ to his own day, he composed the first and <lb/>
            second books, containing long extracts from the Gospels and the <lb/>
            Acts of the Apostles, and legends which give an account of the <lb/>
            establishment of Christianity in Asia and Africa, as well as in <lb/>
            Europe, concluding the whole with short chronicles, or rather <lb/>
            tables of the emperors and popes. Then, at last, Ordericus con­ <lb/>
            sidered his work complete, and gave it the title of an Ecclesiastical <lb/>
            History, a title which singularly exhibits, as we have elsewhere <lb/>
            observed, how far the church had then become the centre of <lb/>
            society.</p>
          <p>It is plain enough that the way in which his work was put <lb/>
            together has contributed in no small degree to the confusion which <lb/>
            reigns throughout the writings of the monk of St. Evroult: his <lb/>
            whole object having been to make collections from all quarters of <lb/>
            facts, traditions, adventures, acts, and letters, his work repeatedly <lb/>
            changed its form and its object while under his hands, and he <lb/>
            gave himself but little trouble, except to find a place in it, no <lb/>
            matter in what order, for all the stores of information he had <lb/>
            gathered. Accordingly, on more than one occasion his materials <lb/>
            seem thrown together pell-mell, as chance or opportunity brought <lb/>
            them into the author's power ; sometimes he interrupts the course <lb/>
            of his narrative by dividing the account of a particular event into <lb/>
            distinct portions, separated by long intervals; and, at others, he <lb/>
            repeats the same story in different parts of his work ; so that the <lb/>
            reader is continually surprised by the strange manner in which <lb/>
            times, and places, and subjects, the most distant and the most <lb/>
            incongruous, are brought together. No sort of art or method <lb/>
            appears to have been used in combining this prodigious mass of <lb/>
            facts, and when the work is considered as a whole, from a single <lb/>
            point of view, one cannot fail, on a first impression, of being most <lb/>
            sensible of this striking confusion. But this irregular surface covers <lb/>
            a mine of real wealth. No book contains so much and such valu­ <lb/>
            able information on the history of the eleventh and twelfth <lb/>
            centuries, on the political state, both civil and religious, of society <lb/>
            in the west of Europe, and on the manners of the times, whether <lb/>
            feudal, monastic, or popular. In his genuine honesty and native <lb/>
            frankness, Ordericus makes no attempt to argue anything, to <lb/>
            conceal anything: he tells his story, and gives his opinion; he <lb/>
            blames or approves, without any other idea but that of publishing <lb/>
            what he knows and what he thinks. Simple, credulous, and <lb/>
            having no pretensions to be considered a sagacious observer, or a <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            critic, still he was independent and sincere-rare merits among <lb/>
            the monkish chroniclers of his own age, who, besides, are quite as <lb/>
            deficient as himself in those qualities wherein he failed.</p>
          <p>The History of Ordericus has not hitherto been translated; the <lb/>
            version which we now present to the public is the work of M. <lb/>
            Louis du Bois, of Lisieux, a man of letters, whose modesty is <lb/>
            equal to his diligence, and who, having devoted himself to all <lb/>
            that is interesting in connection with Normandy, his native <lb/>
            country, is already well known by some useful works on the <lb/>
            antiquities and statistics of that fine province. The principal <lb/>
            difficulties which lie in the way of the readers of Ordericus <lb/>
            Vitalis arise from the vast variety of minute circumstances, of <lb/>
            distant allusions, and of geographical references, connected with <lb/>
            Normandy. It was, therefore, of importance that the translation <lb/>
            should be made on the very spot, among the recollections to <lb/>
            which it would give rise, and by a person capable of explaining <lb/>
            the local obscurities, so to speak, of the text, in short but <lb/>
            frequent notes. M. Du Bois, having kindly undertaken this <lb/>
            minute task, will best be able to give an account of his pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, and we therefore propose to close this notice by sub­ <lb/>
            joining an exact copy of the report with which he has favoured <lb/>
            us, respecting the manuscripts of the historians of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            the labours of which they were the object, and the researches to <lb/>
            which he has devoted himself.'</p>
          <p>" In the earliest manuscripts of Ordericus Vitalis. his work <lb/>
            takes the title of Orderici Vitalis Angli Monachi Uticensis Historia <lb/>
            Ecclesiastica. It is thus entitled in a manuscript which came <lb/>
            from the abbey of St. Evroult itself, and, as we are inclined to <lb/>
            believe, in the authors own hand-writing, of which we shall pre­ <lb/>
            sently speak more in detail. Duchesne was unaware of the exis­ <lb/>
            ence of this autograph, and printed his edition from more recent <lb/>
            manuscripts, under the title of Orderici Vitalis Angligence Coenobii <lb/>
            Uticensis Monachi, libri xiii.</p>
          <p>"The autograph manuscript of the abbey of St. Evroult served <lb/>
            in former times for the original of the different copies which <lb/>
            were dispersed of this important history.</p>
          <p>" In the beginning of the sixteenth centuary, a monk of St. <note type="footnote"> 1 M. Du Bois was the author of an able article on the life of Ordericus <lb/>
            Vitalis, published in 1822 in the Bibliographie Universelle, which has <lb/>
            supplied the materials for the present notice. It would appear from <lb/>
            some expressions at the close of the article, that he then contemplated <lb/>
            using the result of his researches in publishing a corrected edition of the <lb/>
            text of Ordericus, lamenting, however, that, at that time, the publication <lb/>
            of works of erudition, particularly in Latin, was a difficult enterprise for an <lb/>
            individual. He seems to have changed his intention, and four years after­ <lb/>
            wards began to publish his translation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            Evroult (probably Vallin), made a copy of this manuscript, which <lb/>
            was then composed of four volumes, and in a perfect state. The <lb/>
            copy formed also four volumes, in a handwriting which, though <lb/>
            not very close, was almost illegible. According to Charles du <lb/>
            Jardin, prior of the abbey of St. Evroult in 1717, the two first <lb/>
            volumes of this copy were then at the abbey of St. Ouen, at <lb/>
            Rouen, and the two others at that of Glanfeuil-sur-Loire. I have <lb/>
            reason to think that the prior Du Jardin was mistaken ; the two <lb/>
            volumes now in the library at Rouen, which were brought from <lb/>
            St. Ouen, are the two last of the work, containing the seven <lb/>
            last books.</p>
          <p>" The royal library possesses the following MSS. of Ordericus: <lb/>
            No. 5122, MS. de Bigot; the one which Duchesne used. No. <lb/>
            5123, MS. de Colbert, two volumes. No. 5124, MS. de Baluz, two <lb/>
            volumes, containing only the five first books.</p>
          <p>[These MSS. are in folio, written on paper, and all of the six­ <lb/>
            teenth century.]</p>
          <p>No. 5506, MS. de Colbert, as No. 5123. 2 volumes on vellum, <lb/>
            containing only the six first books.</p>
          <p>" There is also in the same library, No. 4861, a MS. on vellum <lb/>
            in folio, mixed with others which came from Bigot, and containing <lb/>
            a fragment entitled: Fragmentum ex Orderici Vitalis histori libro <lb/>
            tertio de novis monachorum Cistercentium, et aliorum illius sœculi <lb/>
            institutis. This copy is the more curious because it is of the <lb/>
            thirteenth century.</p>
          <p>“Independently of these different copies, which are more or <lb/>
            less faulty, and even incomplete, there is in the library of St. <lb/>
            Germain-des-Pres, a copy of the three first books, bequeathed to <lb/>
            it by Coaslin de Cambout, and made in the sixteenth century, at <lb/>
            the time when the autograph was still perfect, by Vallin, a <lb/>
            monk- of St Evroult, who dedicated it to his abbot Felix de Brie.</p>
          <p>The most valuable manuscript of Ordericus Vitalis was pre­ <lb/>
            served in the abbey in which he wrote his history. We have now <lb/>
            indeed only the fragments of this autograph, but even the frag­ <lb/>
            ments are precious. I had the pleasure of saving them from <lb/>
            imminent danger of destruction at L'Aigle in 1799. just after I was <lb/>
            nominated by the assembly librarian of the central school of the <lb/>
            Orme, and I hastened to deposit them in the establishment com­ <lb/>
            mitted to my care. The manuscript forms a quarto volume, written <lb/>
            on parchment, which the monks of St. Evroult, in their negligence, <lb/>
            during the seventeenth century, took no care to have fresh bound <lb/>
            until they had suffered great part to decay and be lost. We know <lb/>
            that it was perfect at the commencement of the preceding century, <lb/>
            because a copy of it was then made, which, though unfortunately <lb/>
            marked by blanks and omissions, is still of great value. What <lb/>
            remains of this autograph is as follows : book vii., four leaves ; <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            books ix., x., xi., xii., and xiii., are complete, except the four or five <lb/>
            last leaves.</p>
          <p>"I feel certain that this valuable manuscript is really an <lb/>
            autogragh, as the monks of St. Evoult believed it to be from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance of its having been inserted in a catalogue taken shortly <lb/>
            after the death of Ordericus Vitalis. Among many reasons that <lb/>
            might be offered in justification of this opinion, I shall confine <lb/>
            myself to these : the manuscript is not illustrated ; it is written <lb/>
            on common parchment, in small sheets; it is in general very clear, <lb/>
            but there are places in which it has been corrected; and since <lb/>
            the twelfth century, that is a few years only after the death of <lb/>
            the author, it passed for having been written with his own hand <lb/>
            a short time before. I insist the more on these points, because at <lb/>
            the period when this manuscript saw the light the abbey possessed <lb/>
            very skilful copyists who have left magnificent copies of some <lb/>
            of the Fathers of the church, and several other works, all tran­ <lb/>
            scribed with great beauty on the finest vellum, and in a folio <lb/>
            shape. Assuredly therefore, if they had made a transcript of <lb/>
            Ordericus, it would have had all the embellishments which the <lb/>
            historian of their own community of St. Evroult, and the <lb/>
            achievements of the Normans, so justly merited.</p>
          <p>" M. La Croix du Maine is the first of our bibliographers who <lb/>
            called attention to Ordericus Vitalis. He remarks, with justice, <lb/>
            that good manuscripts of this historian have been always scarce ; <lb/>
            that even John Bale does not mention him in his list of English <lb/>
            authors, nor do other compilers of biography and literary history. <lb/>
            It appears from what La Croix du Maine says further, that he had <lb/>
            in his possession a fine manuscript of Ordericus, which he intended <lb/>
            to publish ; but this intention was never carried into effect.</p>
          <p>" It was not till the year 1619 that the learned Andrew Du­ <lb/>
            chesne published his Ordericus Vitalis in the collection to which <lb/>
            he gave the title of, Histories Normannorum scriptores antiqui. The <lb/>
            thirteen books of the Ecclesiastical History are the most impor­ <lb/>
            tant work contained in this valuable collection, now become scarce <lb/>
            and dear : they fill 606 pages of the volume. Duchesne printed <lb/>
            his edition from the manuscript of J. Bigot: unfortunately he <lb/>
            omitted to collate it with the other manuscripts to which he <lb/>
            might have had access, and more especially with the autograph <lb/>
            in the library of St. Evroult. He even increased the confusion <lb/>
            by taking no pains with the marginal dates he affixed, so that <lb/>
            events quite different in point of time and character are often <lb/>
            marked with the same date.</p>
          <p>" These deficiencies, which were generally acknowledged, in­ <lb/>
            duced Bessin, the Benedictine, to whom we are indebted for the <lb/>
            Concilia Rotomagensis Provincial, fol. 1717, to undertake a new <lb/>
            and better edition of Duchesne's Ordericus. With this view, he <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            had made a great number of corrections on a copy of the edition <lb/>
            of 1619 by collating it with a manuscript then the property of M. <lb/>
            Mareste, advocate-general to the chamber of accounts of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. He had besides, in 1722, the valuable assistance of Charles <lb/>
            du Jardin, prior of the abbey of St. Evroult, who had made great <lb/>
            proficiency in calligraphical studies. All was ready for the press, <lb/>
            and the bookseller, Behourt, was on the point of undertaking the <lb/>
            work, when the death of Bessin, which happened in 1726, put an <lb/>
            end to this useful publication, and the project was no further <lb/>
            thought of. I have had the advantage of the labours of Bessin <lb/>
            and Du Jardin, and the volume they prepared for publication has <lb/>
            been of essential service; but still I found that even after the care <lb/>
            it had received from these learned and indefatigable Benedictins, <lb/>
            there was much to reap, and I trust I have been able to do so <lb/>
            with some profit.</p>
          <p>“ The learned and judicious authors of that great work, the Col­ <lb/>
            lection of the Historians of France, did not omit including in it so <lb/>
            important a writer as Ordericus; they have accomplished this <lb/>
            successfully by dividing their extracts in the following manner:- <lb/>
            Extracts from books i., iii., v., vi., and vii., in tome ix., pp. 10 to <lb/>
            18; from books i., iii. vii., in tome x., in pp. 234 to 236 ; from <lb/>
            books i., iii., iv., v., vi., and vii., in tome xi., pp. 221 to 248 ; and <lb/>
            from books i. and iv. to xiii., in tome xii, pp. 285 to 770.</p>
          <p>“Dom Bouquet made the first of these extracts; those contained <lb/>
            in tome xii., which are the longest and the most interesting, are <lb/>
            the work of M. Briae, who has not incurred the censures justly <lb/>
            applied to his predecessor.</p>
          <p>" After these learned labours, there still remained some useful <lb/>
            objects to be obtained.</p>
          <p>" As I have before remarked, I did not fail to take advantage of <lb/>
            what had been accomplished by Bessin and Du Jardin ; but <lb/>
            besides this, I have made use of some new observations procured <lb/>
            from St. Evroult, have made a collation of the different manu­ <lb/>

            with the assistance of two accomplished Normans, whose learning <lb/>
            is only equalled by their obliging disposition, M. Auguste Le <lb/>
            Prevost,who is in possession of very valuable collections, relating <lb/>
            to the history of Normandy, and M. Theodore Liquet, who has <lb/>
            been kind enough to communicate to me the manuscript of the <lb/>
            library at Rouen, of which he is the keeper.</p>
          <p>“ Some important corrections and numerous additions have <lb/>
            been the fruits of these labours. Besides, a long study of the <lb/>
            antiquities, the history, and the geography of Normandy has <lb/>
            placed at my disposal a vast mass of information, which I trust <lb/>
            will throw some light on our author's statements. The number <lb/>
            of explanatory notes appended at the bottom of the pages form <lb/>

            the best proof of the pains I have for twenty years bestowed on <lb/>
            this undertaking. Still, however, I dare not flatter myself that I <lb/>
            have cleared up all the obscurities, filled up all the gaps, and <lb/>
            ascertained exactly all the names of places and proper names. <lb/>
            The difficulties have been enormous; but I have used all the <lb/>
            means in my power to overcome them.</p>
          <p>" However this may be, it may be asserted with truth that, of <lb/>
            all our ancient provinces, there is none in comparison with Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, which has been the scene of such celebrated events, and <lb/>
            given birth to such distinguished men, none which can boast so <lb/>
            many and such excellent historians; and that of all these his­ <lb/>
            torians, Ordericus Vitalis is the most important, while, though <lb/>
            continually quoted, his work has never been translated, nor even <lb/>
            correctly published."</p>

          </head>
          <p>FORMER writers, from early times, carefully remarking the <lb/>
            occurrences of the passing age, have noted the good or <lb/>
            evil which befell mankind for a warning to others ; and <lb/>
            while thus continually aiming to benefit posterity, they" <lb/>
            heaped volume upon volume. We see, for instance, that <lb/>
            this was done by Moses, Daniel, and the other sacred <lb/>
            writers; and we discover the same object in the works of <lb/>
            Dares of Phrygia,1 Pompeius Trogus,2 and other gentile <lb/>
            historians; of Eusebius,3 Orosius, who wrote the History <note type="footnote"> I Considering the age in which Ordericus Vitalis lived, we need not be <lb/>
            surprised at finding him place Dares of Phrygia at the head of the writers <lb/>
            of profane history. A Trojan priest of that name is said to have composed <lb/>
            an account of the Trojan War; the history, however, attributed to him <lb/>
            is a spurious composition, and its origin may be placed somewhere between <lb/>
            the fifth and eighth centuries; but it was so much in vogue in the middle <lb/>
            ages, that a translation in French verse was current in the eleventh <lb/>
            century. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pompeius Trogus, a Roman historian, flourished in the time of Au­ <lb/>
            gustus. He wrote a history of the Macedonian empire, of which we have <lb/>
            only an Epitome by Justin. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Eusebius (Pamphilus) became bishop of Cæsnrea, A.D. 313, and died </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>

            of the World ;1 of Bedo the Englishman, Paul of Monte <lb/>
            Cassino,2 and the rest of the ecclesiastical writers. I <lb/>
            peruse their accounts with delight, I praise and admire the <lb/>
            elegance and usefulness of their works, and recommend the <lb/>
            learned of our age to imitate their invaluable remains. <lb/>
            But, without presuming to dictate to others, at least I <lb/>
            contend against self-indulgence in enervating sloth, and, <lb/>
            rousing myself to exertion, desire to undertake some work <lb/>
            which may be acceptable to my immediate superiors.3 In my <lb/>
            account of the restoration of the monastery of St. Evroult,4 <lb/>
            written by the command of Abbot Roger, I adhered faith­ <lb/>
            fully to the simple truth, choosing to speak frankly of the <lb/>
            great men of this perverse age, whether good or bad, and <lb/>
            relying solely on lily honesty of purpose, without making <lb/>
            any pretensions to a polished style or the gifts of eloquence.</p>
          <p>My present object is to treat of what passes under our <note type="footnote"> about 338. He has left a number of works, displaying great learning and <lb/>
            ability, the best known being his Ecclesiastical History," which has met <lb/>
            with three Latin translators, and an English translation from the original <lb/>
            Greek is published in the Ecclesiastical Library," uniformly with the <lb/>
            present series. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Orosius (Paul), a Spanish ecclesiastic, born at Tarragona, who <lb/>
            flourished in the fifth century. By the advice of St. Augustine, he <lb/>
            undertook his “ History of the World,” here called the “ Ormesta;” an <lb/>
            unintelligible word, unless, as some commentators have conjectured, it is a <lb/>
            corruption of Hormisdas, an additional name of Orosius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Better known as Paul the Deacon; he died in the monastery of Monte <lb/>

            diocese of Lisieux in Normandy, near the limits of the present departments <lb/>

            own observation, or we are called upon to endure. For it <lb/>
            is fitting that as new events continually occur they should <lb/>
            be carefully committed to writing, to the praise of God; <lb/>
            and thus, as the history of the past has been handed down <lb/>
            to us by preceding writers, so also a relation of what is <lb/>
            going on around us should be transmitted to future gene­ <lb/>
            rations by the pen of contemporaries. I propose to treat <lb/>
            of ecclesiastical affairs with the modesty becoming a <lb/>
            humble son of the church; and to the best of my ability, <lb/>
            diligently treading in the steps of the ancient fathers, I <lb/>
            shall search out and give to the world the modern history <lb/>
            of Christendom, venturing to call my unpretending work <lb/>
            " An Ecclesiastical History."</p>
          <p>Confined to my cloister by the vows which have volun­ <lb/>
            tarily bound me to the strict observance of the monastic <lb/>
            rule, I am unable to make researches into the affairs of <lb/>
            Alexandria, Greece, or Rome, and others worthy to be <lb/>
            related; but I labour, by God's help, to unfold with truth <lb/>
            contemporary events for the instruction of posterity,-both <lb/>
            such as have passed under my own observation, and those <lb/>
            which, occurring in neighbouring countries, have come to <lb/>
            my knowledge. I firmly believe, however, from observation <lb/>
            of the past, that some one will arise with far more penetra­ <lb/>
            tion than myself, and more capable of examining the course <lb/>
            of worldly affairs, who will perhaps extract from my pages, <lb/>
            and from those of others of the same class, what he thinks <lb/>
            worthy of being inserted in his chronicle or history for the <lb/>
            information of posterity.</p>
          <p>I derive confidence from having begun my work by the <lb/>
            express command of the venerable Abbot Roger,1 when he <lb/>

            among many thousand women, Mary, the royal virgin, <lb/>
            descended from the house of king David, and wonderfully <lb/>
            endowed with the fulness of grace. This blessed Virgin, <lb/>
            thus adorned with distinguished virtues, having been <lb/>
            miraculously espoused to that just man, Joseph, saluted by <lb/>
            the archangel Gabriel, and overshadowed by the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost, conceived without sin, and brought forth without <lb/>
            pain, on the eighth of the calends of January (25th of <lb/>
            December), the Saviour, who was the desire of all nations. <lb/>
            Thus our Lord Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem, a city <lb/>
            of Juda, at the time of the first census, when Cirinus1 was <lb/>
            governor of Syria, according to the order of all the pro­ <lb/>
            phecies which had announced his coming. Glorious signs, <lb/>
            as the sacred oracles relate, appeared in heaven at the <lb/>
            birth of Christ, and the angels with pious thanksgivings <lb/>
            for the salvation of man, sang: " Glory to God in the <lb/>
            highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!"2 <lb/>
            Thus, in the forty-second year of the reign of Cæsar <lb/>
            Augustus, twenty-eight years after the deaths of Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra and Anthony, when Egypt became a Roman pro­ <lb/>
            vince, in the third year of the 193rd olympiad, and 752 <lb/>
            years after the foundation of Rome, that is to say, at the <lb/>
            time when Octavianus Cæsar, having restored order among <lb/>
            all the nations of the earth, and, by God's providence, <lb/>
            established a most firm and secure peace, Jesus Christ, <lb/>
            the Son of God, consecrated by his advent the sixth age <lb/>
            of the world. From the creation to the birth of Christ, <lb/>
            we reckon 3952 years, according to the correct Hebrew <lb/>
            chronology; after the computation of Isidore, bishop of <lb/>
            Seville, and some other doctors, there are 5154 years ; again, <lb/>
            according to the calculation of Eusebius of Cæsarea and <lb/>
            Saint Jerome, we find 5231 years between the birth of <lb/>
            Adam and the eighteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar, when <lb/>
            Christ suffered on the cross.</p>

            redeem the servant of sin from a well-merited death by <lb/>
            the undeserved death of his own Son! For our merciful <lb/>

            similitude, was grieved at his fall, and decreed, in his secret <lb/>

            himself, should visit the condemned servant in prison, and <lb/>

          <p>THUS, the Son of God, made man, remained what he <lb/>
            was, and took upon him what he was not, without confusion <lb/>
            or division of substance; but ruling all things, with the <lb/>
            Father and the Holy Ghost, by his divinity, and enduring <lb/>
            all the infirmities of our flesh by the assumption of huma­ <lb/>
            nity. The law which he had given by Moses, he kept <lb/>
            inviolate; and, himself a lawgiver, fulfilled all righteousness. <lb/>
            Thus, on the eighth day, he was circumcised, and on the <lb/>
            fortieth, was presented to his Father in the temple, with the <lb/>
            legal offering.1</p>
          <p>Although the Virgin Mother wrapped her divine Son <lb/>
            in swaddling clothes, although tight bandages swathed his <lb/>
            feet and hands, although the tender infant, concealed within <lb/>
            a narrow manger, uttered the cries of that human misery <lb/>
            which it was the will of the Father that he should take <lb/>
            upon himself; yet the High God was manifested by a new <lb/>
            star appearing in the heavens, and the eastern Magi, thus <lb/>
            guided, sought for him at Bethlehem, found him cradled in <lb/>
            a manger, and worshipped him as God. The wise men then <lb/>
            opened their treasures, and presented to Christ three costly <lb/>
            presents, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, thus proclaiming <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke ii. 21, 24. </note> <pb n="8"/>

            him King of kings, true God, and mortal man. The first <lb/>
            fruits of the election of the Gentiles were consecrated in <lb/>
            those who hastened to Christ in Bethlehem from Saba, and <lb/>
            from other nations scattered through the world. Being <lb/>
            warned by an angel in a dream that they should not return <lb/>
            to Herod, they departed, rejoicing, into their own country <lb/>
            another way.1</p>
          <p>When the days of her purification were accomplished, the <lb/>
            holy Virgin Mother presented herself in the temple, and, <lb/>
            offering the child to God his Father, Simeon, that just and <lb/>
            devout man, took him up in his arms. Although bowed <lb/>
            with age, he rejoiced in God, because he had now before <lb/>
            his eyes the long-expected Saviour of the nations, revealed <lb/>
            to him by the Holy Ghost; he took him in his hands, <lb/>
            announced to the people that he was the Master of life and <lb/>
            death, and blessed him before the admiring multitude who <lb/>
            leaped for joy.</p>
          <p>Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, came into <lb/>
            the temple at that moment rejoicing; this widow, endowed <lb/>
            with every virtue, knew that Christ was there, and an­ <lb/>
            nounced to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem, that the Saviour was come. His parents offered for <lb/>
            him the sacrifice of a pair of turtle-doves or two young <lb/>
            pigeons,-a figure of the spotless purity and the gentle <lb/>
            simplicity of the church.2</p>
          <p>Behold, then, how not only the angels in heaven, but also <lb/>
            mortals of every age and of both sexes, gave their testimony <lb/>
            to the Lord born,in the flesh. The Virgin Mary, conceived <lb/>
            by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, brought forth her <lb/>
            child, suckled him, and, by his aid, effectually ministered to <lb/>
            all his wants. John, leaping for joy in his mother's womb, <lb/>
            saluted the Lord, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Ghost, <lb/>
            spoke three times in prophetic language of the Messiah <lb/>
            and his mother. The angels glorified God who had become <lb/>
            incarnate for the redemption of man, rejoicing to see us <lb/>
            redeemed and added to their number. The shepherds, <lb/>
            instructed by the angelic visitation, hasten to Bethlehem <lb/>

            an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes. The hearts of <lb/>
            the shepherds, when they heard from the heralds the tidings <lb/>
            of Christ, were filled with joy and wonder. Zacharias and <lb/>
            Simeon, both righteous men, at the end of their earthly <lb/>
            career, confess their belief in Christ, and predict his future <lb/>
            history; and the blessed Anna, bending with years, partakes <lb/>
            of their love of Christ.1</p>
          <p>But, while the righteous were rejoicing with exceeding <lb/>
            great joy, the impious Herod, hearing strange rumours, was <lb/>
            troubled, and commanded that all the children that were in <lb/>
            Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years <lb/>
            old and under, should be slain. When, therefore, Joseph <lb/>
            had taken Jesus and his immaculate mother into Egypt, <lb/>
            the fury of Herod vented itself in the massacre of the <lb/>
            infants, and the fields of Bethlehem were watered with the <lb/>
            blood of the innocents.2 But Christ received into his own <lb/>
            mansions those who were slain in his stead, where they <lb/>
            enjoy everlasting felicity.</p>

          <p>OUR Saviour dwelt on the earth thirty-two years and <lb/>
            three months, but he was without sin, and spake no <lb/>
            guile; and he alone among the dead was found free from <lb/>
            guilt. At the beginning of his thirtieth year, he went <lb/>
            down to the river Jordan, received the sacrament of baptism <lb/>
            at the hands of John, and by so doing, sanctified the waters, <lb/>
            and set his disciples an example of the most perfect <lb/>
            humility. While Jesus was praying after his baptism, the <lb/>
            heavens were opened unto him, and the Holy Ghost was <lb/>
            seen to descend upon him in a bodily shape like a dove, <lb/>
            and the voice of his Father was heard from heaven: " This <lb/>
            is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."3 John <lb/>

            shape, and God the Father proclaimed from heaven his Son <lb/>
            to him. Thus the mystery of the Trinity was manifested <lb/>
            to the blessed forerunner in our Saviour's baptism.</p>
          <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the twelfth year of his age, was <lb/>
            found in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, not <lb/>
            teaching them, but asking them questions. He was baptized <lb/>
            at the age of thirty, and thenceforth proved his divine mission <lb/>
            by miracles. During the space of three years He performed <lb/>
            miracles and taught his disciples.1 This triennial period <lb/>
            shadows forth the sacrament of our baptism, by means of <lb/>
            faith in the Holy Trinity, and the operation of the legal <lb/>
            decalogue. Our divine Lawgiver also teaches men, by his <lb/>
            example, that they should not venture to speak in public or <lb/>
            preach at too early an age, or eagerly covet preferment; <lb/>
            but be content to wait humbly for the proper and ap­ <lb/>
            pointed time for their admission to the priesthood, or the <lb/>
            office of teaching.</p>

          <p>IT is now my purpose to examine the series of our <lb/>
            Lord's miracles recorded in the four gospels, giving a faith­ <lb/>
            ful compendium which may serve easily to recall them to <lb/>
            the mind. I shall trace the succession of events as the four <lb/>
            evangelists have related them, and, by His help who makes <lb/>
            eloquent the tongues of infants, I hope to sum them up in <lb/>
            a short account. As I have determined to give a correct <lb/>
            chronography, it is right that I should begin with endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing diligently to fix exact dates, as the holy evangelists, <lb/>
            and other historians, long ago supplied them in their <lb/>
            writings.</p>
          <p>Octavianus Cæsar Augustus, nephew of Caius Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar by his sister Octavia, succeeded his uncle as the <lb/>
            second emperor of Rome, and reigned fifty-six years and six <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke ii. 42, 46 ; iii. 23. </note> <pb n="11"/>

            months ;1 in the forty-second year of whose reign Christ was <lb/>
            born. Tiberius Caesar, the step-son of Augustus, being the <lb/>
            son of his wife Livia by a former husband, reigned twenty- <lb/>
            three years; in his eighteenth year Christ redeemed the <lb/>
            world by suffering on the cross.2 After the death of Herod, <lb/>
            the son of Antipater of Ascalon, who for twenty-four years <lb/>
            usurped the throne of Judea, his son Archelaus exercised his <lb/>
            tyrannical authority over the Jews for the space of ten <lb/>
            years; St. Matthew tells us that Joseph, after his return <lb/>
            from Egypt in obedience to the commands of the angel, <lb/>
            being afraid of Archelaus, turned aside into Galilee with <lb/>
            the child and his mother, and dwelt at Nazareth. But Ar­ <lb/>
            chelaus, on account of his intolerable cruelty, being accused <lb/>
            by the Jews before Augustus, was deprived of power and <lb/>
            banished for life to Vienne, a town of Gaul, where he died.4 <lb/>
            In order to weaken the kingdom of Judea, Augustus <lb/>
            divided it into tetrarchates for the brothers of Archelaus. <lb/>
            Moreover, Pilate, in the twelfth year of the reign of Tibe­ <lb/>
            rius, was sent into Judea, to undertake the government of <lb/>
            that country; he remained there for ten consecutive years <lb/>
            until about the time of the death of the emperor. Herod, <lb/>
            Philip, and Lysanias, as St. Luke relates, shared the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Judea with Pilate; they were the sons of the <lb/>
            elder Herod, during whose reign the Lord came into the <lb/>
            world.5</p>
          <p>The whole period of our Lord's teaching on earth was <lb/>
            confined within the space of four years. During that time, <lb/>
            as Josephus tells us, after Annas was deposed, the following <lb/>
            Jewish high priests succeeded each other: Ismaël, son of <lb/>
            Baffus ; Eleazar, son of the high priest Ananias; Simon, son <note type="footnote"> 1 Augustus only reigned in reality from the time of the battle of Actium <lb/>
            (Sept. 2, A.U.C. 723) until his death (Aug. 19, 767). The general opinion <lb/>
            is, that we ought to place the birth of Jesus Christ in 749, and conse­ <lb/>

            Maccabees, was killed by Herod, and the succession of the <lb/>
            high priests, according to the law, ceased. But St. Hippo­ <lb/>
            lytus reckons 230 years as the time that the kingdom of <lb/>
            the Persians lasted, and 300 years as the duration of that <lb/>
            of the Macedonians, and then thirty years until Christ; that <lb/>
            is to say, he computes 560 years from the commencement <lb/>
            of the reign of Cyrus, king of the Persians, until the <lb/>
            advent of our Lord. Enlightened by these researches on <lb/>

            servants to bear it to the governor of the feast. By this <lb/>
            beginning of miracles Jesus manifested forth his glory to <lb/>
            his disciples, and pointed out the alteration in the carnal <lb/>
            meaning of the old law, which by the grace of the Holy <lb/>
            Spirit he transformed into newness of life.1</p>
          <p>Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted <lb/>
            of the devil, who was astonished at seeing in him the man <lb/>
            of incomparable righteousness. He fasted forty days and <lb/>
            forty nights, and thus taught us by his example how the <lb/>
            just may overcome the whole race of demons by fasting and <lb/>
            prayer. The old serpent had overcome the first Adam by <lb/>
            his appetite, vain glory, and unlawful desires ; he made use of <lb/>
            other stratagems to tempt the second Adam, by whom he <lb/>
            was repulsed three times; he fled, and, behold, angels came <lb/>
            and ministered to the Son of God, who will reward in <lb/>
            paradise with eternal felicity the conquerors of Satan.2</p>
          <p>Our Lord, with his mother and his brethren, went down <lb/>
            to Capernaum, and continued there not many days. From <lb/>
            thence, when the time of the Jews' passover was at hand, <lb/>
            he went up to Jerusalem, and entered into the temple, <lb/>
            where he found those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, <lb/>
            and the money-changers sitting; all these he drove out, <lb/>
            in a wonderful manner.3</p>
          <p>At the passover, on the feast-day, many believed in his <lb/>
            name, when they saw the miracles which he did. Then a <lb/>
            man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the <lb/>
            Jews, came to Jesus by night, desiring to confer with <lb/>
            him secretly. He was therefore worthy of being instructed <lb/>
            in the efficacy of baptism, regeneration by water and the <lb/>
            Spirit, how Christ was to descend into hell and ascend <lb/>
            into heaven, the typical lifting up of the brazen serpent in <lb/>
            the wilderness, and the unmerited passion of the Son of <lb/>
            man.4</p>
          <p>After these things, the Lord came into Judea, and there <lb/>
            tarried with his disciples, and performed many wonderful <lb/>
            miracles of healing. But John was baptizing in Enon, <lb/>

            gave a true testimony in answer to the inquiries of his dis­ <lb/>
            ciples and the Jews concerning Christ. Then Jesus left <lb/>
            Judea, and departed again into Galilee, passing through <lb/>
            Samaria.1 In a city of SaUl aria, which is called Sichar, <lb/>
            near to the parcel of ground which Jacob gave to his son <lb/>
            Joseph, there was a well called Jacob's well. Jesus, there­ <lb/>
            fore, being wearied with his journey, sat on the well, about <lb/>
            the sixth hour, and held a mystical conversation with a <lb/>
            Samaritan woman. The Samaritans receiving the Saviour <lb/>
            with joy, besought him that he would tarry with them, and <lb/>
            he abode there two days; and many devout persons believed <lb/>
            on him.2 From thence Jesus returned in the power of the <lb/>
            Spirit into Galilee; and there went out a fame of him <lb/>
            through all the region round about. He taught in their <lb/>
            synagogues, being glorified of all.3</p>
          <p>At Nazareth he went into the synagogue on the sabbath- <lb/>
            day, to read; and, standing up, he unrolled the book of the <lb/>
            prophet Isaiah,4 and found the place where this prophecy <lb/>
            is written: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because <lb/>
            he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." <lb/>
            When he had closed the book, he gave it again to the <lb/>
            minister, and sat down, saying : " This day is this scripture <lb/>
            fulfilled in your ears;" and all wondered at the gracious <lb/>
            words which proceeded out of his mouth. Jesus himself <lb/>
            testified that a prophet bath no honour in his own country. <lb/>
            That this assertion was true he proved by many examples, <lb/>
            drawn from the Old Testament, saying: " Many widows were <lb/>
            in Israel, when great famine was throughout all the land; <lb/>
            but unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto a woman <lb/>
            of Sarepta; many lepers were left in want and affliction, <lb/>
            and none of them was cleansed in Jordan by Eliseus the <lb/>
            prophet, saving Naaman the Syrian." All they in the <lb/>
            synagogue, when they heard the words of the Lord, were <lb/>
            filled with wrath. Confirming the truth he had spoken by <lb/>
            a sacrilegious act, they rose up against him, and in their <lb/>
            fury thrust out of the city the chief Physician of souls, <lb/>
            and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city <note type="footnote"> 1 John in. 22—36; iv. 3, 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 John iv. 5—42. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. iv. 12; Mark i. 14, 28; Luke iv. 14, 15; John iv. 3, 43—45. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Luke iv. 17. </note> <pb n="15"/>

            was built, that they might cast him down. headlong. But <lb/>
            he, passing through the midst of them, went his way, and <lb/>
            came down to Capernaum.1</p>
          <p>Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee, and a ruler, whose son <lb/>
            was sick at Capernaum, besought him as he was coming out <lb/>
            of Judæa into Galilee, that he would come down and heal <lb/>
            his son. Then said Jesus unto him: "Go thy way; thy son <lb/>
            liveth." The sick man immediately recovered; the father <lb/>
            believed the word that Jesus had spoken, returned to his <lb/>
            home the next day, and there found his son in perfect <lb/>
            health, to the great joy of his family; and learning what <lb/>
            had happened, himself believed and his whole house. This, <lb/>
            as St. John says, is "the second miracle that Jesus did, when <lb/>
            he was come out of Judea into Galilee." 2</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN Jesus had heard that John was cast into pri­ <lb/>
            son, he left Nazareth, which signifies a flower, and dwelt <lb/>
            in Capernaum, a name that means a beautiful city, and <lb/>
            signifies the Church. Now Nazareth, which gave the <lb/>
            surname of Nazarene to Christ, is a small town in Galilee, <lb/>
            near Mount Thabor. But Capernaum is a strong city in <lb/>
            " Galilee of the Gentiles," situate near the lake Gennesa­ <lb/>
            reth, "in the borders of Zabulon. and Nephthali," where the <lb/>
            Hebrews were first made captives by the Assyrians.3</p>
          <p>From that time, that is to say, after that John was <lb/>
            put in prison, Jesus began to preach, because the voice <lb/>
            being uttered, the word follows, and the law ceasing the <lb/>
            gospel follows, as the sun succeeds the dawn of day. <lb/>
            "Repent," said he, " for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</p>
          <p>Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw Simon Peter, <lb/>
            and Andrew his brother, and the sons of Zebedee, James <lb/>
            and John, and calling them, they straightway left their nets <lb/>

            possesses to the grace of God.1</p>
          <p>Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their syna­ <lb/>
            gogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and <lb/>
            healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease, <lb/>
            among the people. And his fame went throughout all <lb/>
            Syria, a country extending from the Euphrates to the great <lb/>
            sea, from Cappadocia to Egypt. They brought unto him <lb/>
            all sick people that were taken with divers diseases, both <lb/>
            of the mind and body, and torments, that is to say, acute <lb/>
            sufferings, and those which were possessed with devils, and <lb/>
            those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and <lb/>
            he healed them.2</p>
          <p>Great multitudes therefore followed him from Galilee, <lb/>
            and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, <lb/>
            and from beyond Jordan. In doing this they were actuated <lb/>
            by different motives; some went to Jesus as disciples, on <lb/>
            account of his heavenly mission; others, to be cured of <lb/>
            their infirmities ; others, hearing the favourable reports <lb/>
            that were spread abroad, and which excited their curiosity, <lb/>
            wished to know by experience if all that was said of him <lb/>
            were true; some followed him from envy, wishing " to catch <lb/>
            him in his words," and accuse him; others, again, for the <lb/>
            sake of obtaining food for the body.3</p>
          <p>Jesus, seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain; <lb/>
            and when he was set, his disciples came unto him. He, <lb/>
            who in ancient times had given utterance to the prophets, <lb/>
            now opened his own lips to preach to them a long discourse, <lb/>
            full of all perfection, in which he beautifully and profitably <lb/>
            instructed and enlightened the apostles. Thus he who bad <lb/>
            given the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, now taught his <lb/>
            disciples in Galilee, on Mount Tbabor, and implanted in <lb/>
            their hearts the principles of perfect righteousness. He <lb/>
            discoursed fully on the eight beatitudes, and the other com­ <lb/>
            mandments of the law, which he came not to " destroy, <lb/>
            but to fulfil;" telling them that the precepts of the new <lb/>
            law were more strict than those of the Old Testament, as <lb/>
            they required men to love even their enemies ; that alms <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. iv. 17—22; Mark i. 14—20; Luke v. 1—11. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. iv. 23, 24; Luke iv. 40—44. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. iv. 25; Mark in. 7, 8; Luke vi. 17—19. </note> <pb n="17"/>

            were to be given in secret; and he laid down many other <lb/>
            rules of a perfect life. This true Teacher of teachers con­ <lb/>
            cluded his incomparable discourse, by remarking on the <lb/>
            treasure to be laid up in heaven; that no man can serve <lb/>
            two masters; on the fowls of the air, and the lilies of the <lb/>
            field; the mote and the beam in the eye; on casting your <lb/>
            pearls before swine; on our entry into life through the strait <lb/>
            gate ; that we must beware of false prophets; and that we <lb/>
            must build our house upon a rock.1</p>
          <p>When Jesus had ended these words of perfection, the <lb/>
            multitudes were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught <lb/>
            them like God, who has authority over all things, and not <lb/>
            as the Scribes and Pharisees, who were the blind slaves of <lb/>
            the law of Moses, and could only teach the little they were <lb/>
            capable of understanding.2</p>
          <p>When he was come down from the mountain, great <lb/>
            multitudes followed him. And a leper worshipping him, <lb/>
            and beseeching him to cure him of his leprosy, the Saviour <lb/>
            touched him with his hand, and immediately made him <lb/>
            clean, commanding him to go and shew himself to the <lb/>
            priests, and to " offer the gifts required by the law." In <lb/>
            which command the necessity of confession and penance for <lb/>
            sin is implied.3</p>
          <p>At Capernaum he approved the faith of the centurion <lb/>
            and, at his entreaty, healed, by a word only, his servant <lb/>
            who lay at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. <lb/>
            On a sabbath day, while he was teaching in the synagogue, <lb/>
            a man possessed with a devil cried out: " What have we to <lb/>
            do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth ? Art thou come to <lb/>
            destroy us ? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of <lb/>
            God." And Jesus rebuked him, saying: " Hold thy peace, <lb/>
            and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had <lb/>
            torn him, he came out of him;" and the man was healed, to <lb/>
            the great amazement of all those who were present.5</p>
          <p>And forthwith, when he was come out of the synagogue, <lb/>
            he entered into the house of Simon, where he saw Simon's <lb/>

            wife's mother lying sick of a fever. At the request of her <lb/>
            friends, he " took her by the hand, and immediately the <lb/>
            fever left her; " and she arose in perfect health, and thank­ <lb/>
            fully ministered to her divine Physician.1</p>
          <p>At even, when the Still was setting, they brought unto <lb/>
            him many that were possessed with devils, and sick of <lb/>
            divers diseases, and the true Physician " laid his hands on <lb/>
            every one of them, cast out the spirits with his word, and <lb/>
            healed all that were sick." By the setting of the sun the <lb/>
            death of our Lord was foreshadowed; which happened <lb/>
            when the Gentiles were delivered from the power of Satan, <lb/>
            through faith, and when those who were sick with the dis­ <lb/>
            ease of sin were healed by the remedy of a reformed <lb/>
            life.2</p>

          <p>WHEN Jesus saw great multitudes about him, late <lb/>
            in the evening, he commanded his disciples to go over <lb/>
            unto the other side of the lake; and when he was <lb/>
            entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. It was but <lb/>
            right that, as he had performed miracles upon the land, he <lb/>
            should exhibit the same power upon the water, in order <lb/>
            to prove himself master both of the earth and the sea. <lb/>
            As soon, therefore, as he had got on board, he caused the <lb/>
            sea to be greatly agitated, the winds to blow, and the waves <lb/>
            to rise. His body was indeed asleep, but his mind remained <lb/>
            awake; and when this tempest arose, his disciples awoke him, <lb/>
            saying: " Lord, save us; we perish." Then he arose, com­ <lb/>
            manded the winds and the sea to be still, and there was a <lb/>
            great calm.3</p>
          <p>Thus does the same Emmanuel exert his power every day <lb/>
            on the troubled sea of the world, while the vessel of his church <lb/>
            is tossed about by the storms of so many different tribulations, <lb/>
            and its safety is almost endangered by the extremity of the <lb/>
            peril to which it is exposed. But when he is invoked with <lb/>
            faith and tears by his true followers, he soon listens to their <lb/>
            prayers for succour, and helps them in a marvellous manner, <lb/>
            by virtue of his divine nature, presently removing the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. viii. 14, 15; Mark i. 29—31; Luke iv. 38, 39. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. viii. 16, 17; Mark i. 32—34; Luke iv. 40, 41. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. viii. 18, 23—27; Mark iv. 35—39; Luke viii. 22—24. </note> <pb n="19"/>

            trials which beset them, and strengthening them with his <lb/>
            arm.</p>
          <p>When he had crossed the lake to come into the country <lb/>
            of the Gergesenes, two men possessed with devils, exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly fierce, came out of the tombs, and running up to him, <lb/>
            cried out: " What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou <lb/>
            Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the <lb/>
            time ? If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the <lb/>
            herd of swine." And he said unto them, " Go." Then the <lb/>
            devils immediately entered into the swine, and cast the <lb/>
            whole herd into the lake. In this manner a herd of about <lb/>
            two thousand swine, driven into the sea by a legion of <lb/>
            devils, was drowned; and they that kept them fled, and <lb/>
            coming into the city, told everything. The Gergesenes, <lb/>
            seeing how the two men had been healed, and their swine <lb/>
            cast into the sea, were beyond measure affrighted; and <lb/>
            foolishly came forth from their city to beseech the Lord that <lb/>
            be would depart out of their coasts.1</p>
          <p>Gerasa is a town in Arabia,2 beyond Jordan, close to <lb/>
            Mount Gilead; it belonged to the tribe of Manasses, and is <lb/>
            at no great distance from the sea of Tiberias, in which the <lb/>
            swine were drowned. The name signifies ejecting the <lb/>
            inhabitants, or, the stranger approaching ; in allusion to the <lb/>
            Gentiles, whom the Son of God came into the world to <lb/>
            save, when he had clothed himself with human flesh. <lb/>
            The two men whom the legion of devils had possessed, <lb/>
            represent two nations, the Jews and the Gentiles, who <lb/>
            were governed by the whole body of sins." They lived <lb/>
            in tombs, because they were the servants of dead works, <lb/>
            that is to say, of sin. The impotence of Satan is plainly <lb/>
            manifested in this circumstance, that he was not even able <lb/>
            to injure the swine without the permission of God. It is <lb/>
            worthy of notice, that, while those who are predestinated <lb/>
            to eternal life turn to the Lord, and, by the use of a sound <lb/>
            understanding, save themselves; filthy and proud idol- <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. viii. 28—34 ; Mark v. 1—17; Luke viii. 26—37. Ordericus <lb/>

            ness, here designated by the word swine, are condemned <lb/>
            to live polluted in the stagnant pond of their foul <lb/>
            deeds.</p>
          <p>Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came <lb/>
            into Capernaum. While be was there, so great a multi­ <lb/>
            tude came to him to hear his word that they filled the house <lb/>
            where he was. Then four men brought to him one afflicted <lb/>
            with the palsy; and having uncovered the roof of the <lb/>
            house, they let down before Jesus the bed whereon the sick <lb/>
            of the palsy lay. Our merciful Lord, perceiving the faith of <lb/>
            the bearers, forgave the sins of the paralytic man, and said <lb/>
            to him, although the Scribes were murmuring against him: <lb/>
            " Arise, take up thy bed, and go thy way unto thine house." <lb/>
            And immediately he arose, took up his bed before them all, <lb/>
            and returned to his own home.1</p>
          <p>As Jesus passed forth from thence, he called to him a man, <lb/>
            named Matthei, sitting at the receipt of custom ; the man <lb/>
            followed him, and from the mean station of a publican was <lb/>
            raised to the high office of an apostle and an evangelist. As <lb/>
            Jesus sat at meat in the house of Levi, the Pharisees <lb/>
            murmured, and spoke to him in reproachful terms, because . <lb/>
            be ate with publicans and sinners; but the benign Teacher, <lb/>
            perceiving their evil thoughts, uttered this useful maxim: <lb/>
            " They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are <lb/>
            sick. I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to <lb/>
            repentance."2 Our Lord frequented the society of sinners, <lb/>
            in order that, by teaching his hosts, he might invite and <lb/>
            lead them to the heavenly feast.</p>
          <p>When Jesus was talking with the disciples of John, <lb/>
            and was rebuked by the Pharisees, because his own dis­ <lb/>
            ciples did not fast like the followers of John, he drew a <lb/>
            suitable comparison from the example of the children of <lb/>
            the bridechamber, who could not mourn as long as the <lb/>
            bridegroom was with them; from the story of the piece <lb/>
            of new cloth, which must not be joined to an old garment; <lb/>
            and of the new wine, which must not be put into old <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. ix. 1—7; Mark ii. 3—12; Luke v. 18—26. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. ix. 9—13; Mark ii. 14—17; Luke v. 27—32. “Our author <lb/>

            bottles.1 He thus proves that the severe observances of <lb/>
            the new law are not to be required of carnal men who have <lb/>
            not yet been regenerated, until it be plainly manifest that <lb/>
            this spiritual renovation has taken place in them, through <lb/>
            the mystery of the passion and resurrection of our Lord.</p>
          <p>While Jesus was speaking to the multitudes, Jairus, a ruler <lb/>
            of the synagogue, came near him, threw himself at his feet, <lb/>
            and worshipped him, saying: " Lord, my daughter is even <lb/>
            now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she <lb/>
            shall live." The good Physician arose, and immediately <lb/>
            followed him. But a great multitude surrounded and pressed <lb/>
            upon him, and a woman which was diseased with an issue of <lb/>
            blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon physi­ <lb/>
            cians (by which term are meant the false theologians or <lb/>
            philosophers, and the doctors of the secular laws), neither <lb/>
            could be healed of any, came behind him, and touched the <lb/>
            hem of his garment; for she said within herself: " If I may <lb/>
            but touch his garment, I shall be whole." But Jesus turned <lb/>
            him about, and when he saw her, he said: " Daughter, be of <lb/>
            good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole." And <lb/>
            straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she <lb/>
            was made whole. And when Jesus came into the ruler's <lb/>
            house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, <lb/>
            he said: " Give place; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth." <lb/>
            And they laughed him to scorn. But when the people were <lb/>
            put forth, he went into the chamber, but suffered no man <lb/>
            to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father <lb/>
            and the mother of the maiden; and he took the damsel by <lb/>
            the hand, and commanded her to arise, and that some­ <lb/>
            thing should be given her to eat. And the fame hereof <lb/>
            went abroad into all that land. Jairus, whose name <lb/>
            signifies illuminating, or illuminated, represents Moses and <lb/>
            the other doctors of the law; the damsel, about twelve <lb/>
            years of age, is the symbol of the synagogue; the woman <lb/>
            with the issue of blood is the emblem of the church of the <lb/>
            Gentiles, which had before received the faith through Christ, <lb/>
            and was graciously saved from the corruptions of idolatry <lb/>
            and carnal pleasures. Lastly : as the young maiden is said <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. ix. 14—17; Mark ii. 18—22; Luke v. 33—39. Utres, “ wine­ <lb/>

          <p>Jesus departing thence, two blind men followed him, <lb/>
            crying: " Thou Son of David, have mercy on us." And <lb/>
            when he was come into the house, he touched their eyes, <lb/>
            and theyagain saw the light of heaven.1</p>
          <p>As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb <lb/>
            man, possessed with a devil. And when the devil was cast out, <lb/>
            the dumb spake; and the multitudes marvelled, saying, " It <lb/>
            was never so seen in Israel." But the Pharisees said, " He <lb/>
            casteth out devils through the prince of the devils." 2</p>
          <p>The multitudes sought Jesus in the desert place, and <lb/>
            when they had found him they wished to stay him, that <lb/>
            -he should not depart from them.3</p>
          <p>As the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, <lb/>
            Jesus entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, <lb/>
            and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the <lb/>
            land, into the lake of Genesareth. And he sat down, <lb/>
            and taught the people out of the ship. Now when he had <lb/>
            left speaking, he said unto Simon, who had toiled all the <lb/>
            night in vain: " Launch out into the deep, and let down <lb/>
            your nets for a draught." And when they had this done, <lb/>
            they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net <lb/>
            brake with the weight.4</p>
          <p>In those days he went out into a mountain to pray, and <lb/>
            continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, <lb/>
            he called unto him his disciples; and of them he chose <lb/>
            twelve, whom also he named Apostles, that is to say, "sent." <lb/>
            Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; Simon <lb/>
            Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, <lb/>
            and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas <lb/>
            and Matthew ; James, the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus ; <lb/>
            Simon, the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed <lb/>
            him.5</p>
          <p>The sacred number of the apostles is not free from <lb/>
            mystery; for the number twelve designates those who were <lb/>
            to preach faith in the Holy Trinity throughout the four <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. ix. 27—31.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Matt. ix. 32—34. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Mark i. 35—37; Luke iv. 42.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Luke V. 1—6. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Matt. x. 1—4; Mark III. 13—19; Luke VI. 12—16. </note> <pb n="23"/>

            quarters of the world. The quartenary number tripled <lb/>
            makes the number twelve, which figure was often used <lb/>
            before for many purposes. The apostles are represented by <lb/>
            the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve princes of the people of <lb/>
            Israel, the twelve springs found in Elim, the twelve jewels <lb/>
            of the priest's vestment, the twelve loaves of shew-bread, <lb/>
            the twelve spies sent by Moses, the twelve stones of the <lb/>
            altar, the twelve stones taken out of the river Jordan, the <lb/>
            twelve oxen that supported the brazen sea, the twelve stars <lb/>
            in the crown of the bride, and the twelve foundations and <lb/>
            twelve gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, described in the <lb/>
            book of Revelation. They were prefigured by many other <lb/>
            signs excellently adapted to make known to the nations the <lb/>
            mysteries of God.</p>

          <p>THE glorious Emmanuel went about all Galilee, preach­ <lb/>
            ing the gospel in all the villages, towns, and cities, <lb/>
            that is to say, both to small and great, without re­ <lb/>
            spect of persons. He did not regard the power of the <lb/>
            nobles, but the salvation of believers; and, after his <lb/>
            teaching, sweet as honey, he healed every sickness and <lb/>
            every disease, that those whom his discourses could not <lb/>
            persuade, might be convinced by the greatness of his <lb/>
            works. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved <lb/>
            with compassion on them, because they fainted and lay <lb/>
            down, as sheep having no shepherd. He therefore called <lb/>
            unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them power to <lb/>
            cast out unclean spirits, and to heal all manner of sickness ; <lb/>
            and he said to them, "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom <lb/>
            of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, raise the dead, <lb/>
            cleanse the lepers, cast out devils; freely ye have re­ <lb/>
            ceived, freely give. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor <lb/>
            brass in your purses; nor scrip for your journey; neither <lb/>
            two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves." 1 Their heavenly <lb/>
            Master gave them many more profitable admonitions, which <lb/>
            his faithful historians, Matthew and Luke, have handed <lb/>
            down to us in their writings.</p>
          <p>Jesus went into a city of Galilee, called Nain, which <lb/>
            is situate not far from Endor, about two miles south of <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. ix. 35, 36; x. 1, 7—10; Mark vi. 6—9. </note> <pb n="24"/>

            Mount Thabor. Now when he came nigh to the gate of the <lb/>
            city, surrounded by a great multitude, they were carrying <lb/>
            out the corpse of a young man, who was the only son of a <lb/>
            widow; and when the Lord saw her weeping, he had com­ <lb/>
            passion on her, and said unto her, " Weep not." And he <lb/>
            came and touched the bier, and they that bare him stood <lb/>
            still, and he said to the dead man, " Young man, I say unto <lb/>
            thee, Arise! ”And he immediately revived, and sitting up <lb/>
            began to speak; and the Giver of life delivered him to his <lb/>
            mother in perfect health. And there came a fear on all <lb/>
            who witnessed this miracle,1 it being the will of God that <lb/>
            a great multitude should follow the Lord; and much people <lb/>
            accompany the widow, in order that, there being many. <lb/>
            witnesses of this great miracle, many might be found to <lb/>
            give praise to God.</p>
          <p>Now when John bad heard, in Herod's prison, the works <lb/>
            of Christ, he sent from thence two of his disciples, that they <lb/>
            might diligently inquire of the wisdom of God, what were <lb/>
            the secrets of the divine will. And when the messengers of <lb/>
            John were departed, Jesus began to say many things con­ <lb/>
            cerning the greatness of John, and likened the generation of <lb/>
            the Jews to children sitting in the market-place. Then began <lb/>
            he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works <lb/>
            were done, because they repented not on hearing him <lb/>
            preach. Hitherto he had reproved the whole Jewish race <lb/>
            in common, but now he reprimanded each of their cities by <lb/>
            name, especially Chorazin, that is to say, my mystery; Beth­ <lb/>
            saida, that is to say, the house of fruits ; and Capharnaum, <lb/>
            because they would not be converted when they saw these <lb/>
            signs and mighty works.2</p>
          <p>After this Jesus returned thanks to God his Father, <lb/>
            because he had hid his secrets from the wise men of this <lb/>
            world, but had revealed them unto babes.3</p>
          <p>When the Pharisees reproved his disciples, because, <lb/>
            as they went on the sabbath day through the corn-fields, <lb/>
            they plucked the ears of corn and did eat, rubbing them <lb/>
            in their hands; our Saviour excused them, inasmuch as <lb/>
            they had followed the example set by David and Abiathar <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke vii. 11—16. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xi. 2—24; Luke vii. 18—32; x. 13—15. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xi. 25; Luke x. 21. </note> <pb n="25"/>

            the high priest, saying: " The sabbath was made for man, <lb/>
            and not man for the sabbath. Therefore, the Son of man <lb/>
            is Lord also of the sabbath." 1</p>
          <p>On another sabbath he entered into the synagogue, and <lb/>
            healed a man whose right hand was withered. But the <lb/>
            Pharisees, moved with envy at the glory Jesus had gained <lb/>
            by his many miracles, went out straightway and took counsel <lb/>
            with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy <lb/>
            him. Wherefore Jesus withdrew himself thence, and great <lb/>
            multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. Then was <lb/>
            brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb, <lb/>
            and he healed him, insomuch that he both spake and saw. <lb/>
            But when the Scribes and Pharisees wished to depre­ <lb/>
            ciate the works of Christ, by a false interpretation, de­ <lb/>
            siring him to show them a sign from heaven, he spoke to <lb/>
            them words of profound wisdom and spiritual comfort, by <lb/>
            which he reproved the wicked and taught the good. He <lb/>
            told them that to an evil generation no sign should be <lb/>
            given, but the sign of the prophet Jonas, and he set before <lb/>
            them, in comparison with themselves, the queen of the <lb/>
            south, who came from the uttermost parts of the earth to <lb/>
            hear the wisdom of Solomon, and the Ninevites who re­ <lb/>
            pented.2</p>
          <p>When his mother and his brethren stood without, <lb/>
            desiring to speak with him, he stretched forth his band <lb/>
            toward his disciples, and said: " Whoever shall do the will <lb/>
            of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, <lb/>
            and sister, and mother."3</p>
          <p>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by <lb/>
            the sea-side, and great multitudes were gathered together <lb/>
            unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat, and spake <lb/>
            many things in parables unto the multitude that stood on <lb/>
            the shore. From the husbandman, who went forth to sow, <lb/>
            he took occasion to show the similarity of his own labours ; <lb/>
            and of the seed itself, part perished, because some fell by <lb/>

            among thorns, and was choked by divers accidents ; but <lb/>
            other fell on good ground, and yielded much fruit. What <lb/>
            these things mean, I shall explain in a few sentences : The <lb/>
            seed is the word of God; the sower is Christ; the birds <lb/>
            are the demons; the way is a depraved mind, worn and <lb/>
            dried up by the continual circulation of evil thoughts; the <lb/>
            rock represents the hardness of a reprobate soul; the good <lb/>
            ground represents the gentleness of an obedient spirit, but <lb/>
            the sun the heat of a cruel persecution; the thorns are the <lb/>
            hearts of those who are tormented by the desire to become <lb/>
            rich; the good ground is a devout and faithful soul which <lb/>
            brings forth fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, <lb/>
            some thirty-fold.1 He who, in all his actions, has eternity <lb/>
            constantly in view, bears fruit an hundred-fold; he that <lb/>
            bears fruit sixty-fold performs works perfected by sound <lb/>
            doctrine, signified by the numbers six and ten; the fruit <lb/>
            increased thirty-fold typifies faith with sound doctrine, by <lb/>
            the numbers three and ten. Or in other words: the fruit <lb/>
            multiplied a hundred-fold, recalls to our mind the virgins <lb/>
            and martyrs, either in their sanctity of life or contempt <lb/>
            of death ;2 the fruit multiplied sixty times is that of widows, <lb/>
            on account of the internal calm which they enjoy, because <lb/>
            they have not to struggle against the desires of the flesh. <lb/>
            It is the custom to allow persons of sixty years of age to <lb/>
            repose after their warfare. But the fruit multiplied thirty- <lb/>
            fold is that of married people; because this is the age fit <lb/>
            for contending with the world.</p>
          <p>After this, the true Prophet, seeing the multitudes that <lb/>
            were gathered together unto him, spake other parables unto <lb/>
            them, of the good seed that was sown and the tares, of the <lb/>
            grain of mustard seed, and of the leaven which the woman <lb/>
            took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was <lb/>
            leavened. Our Saviour, sitting in the boat, is like a rich <lb/>
            master of a house, who refreshes his guests with different <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xiii. 1—23 ; Mark iv. 1, 20 ; Luke viii. 4—15. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This passage is extracted from St. Augustine, Quæst. Evang. lib. L <lb/>

            kinds of food, that each of them may take those which his <lb/>
            stomach requires. So our Lord makes use of different para­ <lb/>

          <p>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the <lb/>
            house; and when his disciples questioned him on the <lb/>
            subject, he expounded to them the parable of the tares. <lb/>
            He also, at the same time, added and explained to them <lb/>
            the figurative meaning of the parables of the treasure hid <lb/>
            in a field; of the merchantman and the pearl; and of the <lb/>
            nets cast into the sea. From thence he came into his own <lb/>

            that all were astonished.2</p>

          <p>WHEN our Saviour, invited by a Pharisee, was eating <lb/>
            in his house, a woman, which was a sinner, began to <lb/>
            wash his feet with her tears, as he sat at the table, and <lb/>
            did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and anointed <lb/>
            them with ointment. All the things that she had unlawfully <lb/>
            made use of when leading a life of sin, she now in her <lb/>
            repentant state sacrificed entirely to God; all the seductions <lb/>
            she possessed in herself, she now converted into offerings to <lb/>
            heaven. The Pharisee, swelling with false righteousness, <lb/>
            rebuked the sick woman for her infirmity, and the Physician <lb/>
            for affording her relief. Hence arose the parable of the two <lb/>
            debtors; and the man was convicted by his own admission, <lb/>
            like the madman who carries the cord with which he is to <lb/>
            be bound. The Judge, to whose eyes the most secret <lb/>
            things are naked and open, noted the deserts of the penitent <lb/>
            sinner, and rebuked the wickedness of the unjust Pharisee. <lb/>
            He then forgave the sins of Mary, because, as he himselr <lb/>
            testified, she loved much ; saying to her: " Thy faith bath <lb/>
            saved thee; go in peace.”3</p>
          <p>While the Lord and his disciples were thus preaching, <lb/>
            certain women, that is to say, Mary, called Magdalene, <lb/>
            Joanna, the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, <lb/>
            with many others, inspired by God, followed him and minis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xiii. 24, 35; Mark iv. 26—33; Luke XIII. 18—21. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xiii. 36—58; Mark iv. 34; vi. 1—6. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Luke vii. 36—50; Hebrews iv. 13. </note> <pb n="28"/>

            tered unto him of their substance. It was a custom among <lb/>
            the Jews, and was not considered wrong, for women, according <lb/>
            to this national institution, to furnish their teachers with food <lb/>
            and raiment. This custom, St. Paul tells us, he rejected, <lb/>
            because he feared it might be an occasion of scandal to the <lb/>
            Gentiles. Susanna signifies, a lily; Joanna, the gracious, <lb/>
            or merciful, Lord; Mary, the bitter sea; Magdalene, a tower. <lb/>
            From the signification of these names, it may be clearly <lb/>
            perceived what privileges are conferred upon the hand-maids <lb/>
            of the Lord .for their meritorious services.1</p>
          <p>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus <lb/>
            went up to Jerusalem. He there healed, at the sheep­ <lb/>
            pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, a <lb/>
            certain man, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. <lb/>
            In the water of this pool the priests washed the flesh of <lb/>
            the victims which they offered in sacrifice to God, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the law. This pool had five porches, in which lay <lb/>
            a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, <lb/>
            waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the <lb/>
            Lord went down (at a certain season) into the pool, and <lb/>
            troubled the water; whosoever then first, after the troubling <lb/>
            of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever <lb/>
            disease he had. At Christ's command, the man was imme­ <lb/>
            diately made whole, and took up his bed; and on the <lb/>
            same day was the sabbath. The Jews, therefore, beginning <lb/>
            to murmur and blaspheme, Jesus, the wisdom of the Father, <lb/>
            answering them, as St. John, the divine, relates, manifested <lb/>
            the mysteries of his divinity in various ways, and bore a re­ <lb/>
            markable testimony to his shining light John, and to Moses.2</p>
          <p>At that time Herod, the tetrarch, heard of the fame of <lb/>
            Jesus, and said unto his servants: " This is John the Bap­ <lb/>
            tist ; he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works <lb/>
            do shew forth themselves in him!" For Herod had laid <lb/>
            hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for <lb/>
            the sake of Herodias, whom he had taken from his brother <lb/>
            Philip, and had married, in spite of the remonstrances of <lb/>
            John. This cunning and adulterous king would have put <lb/>
            to death the herald of truth, but he feared the multitude, <lb/>
            because they treated the prophet of God with great venera­ <lb/>
            tion. Herod was also afraid of John, because he knew him <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxvii. 55; Mark xv. 40, 41; Luke viii. 1—3.</note> <note type="footnote">2 John v. 1—47. </note> <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. IX.]</note><lb/>
            to be a just and holy man; but he was overcome by his <lb/>
            passion for the woman, and God's righteous judgment so <lb/>
            ordered it that the desire of the adulteress made him shed <lb/>
            the blood of the holy prophet. Herod on his birth-day <lb/>
            made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief <lb/>
            estates of Galilee ; and when the daughter of Herodias <lb/>
            came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat <lb/>
            with him, the king promised with an oath to give her what­ <lb/>
            soever she would ask of him. She, being before instructed <lb/>
            by her perfidious mother, requested that he would give her <lb/>
            in a charger the head of John the Baptist. The cruel king <lb/>
            sent an executioner, and commanded him to cut off the head <lb/>
            of the messenger of Christ, which was brought in a charger <lb/>
            to the young woman, who was to be thus rewarded for her <lb/>
            talent in dancing, and the viands were thus polluted with <lb/>
            blood at this impure festival. But the disciples of John <lb/>
            buried his body in Samaria, and coming to Jesus, told him <lb/>
            all that had happened. Our Saviour, when he heard of the <lb/>
            execution of John the Baptist, his servant, departed, and <lb/>
            crossing the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias, <lb/>
            retired into a desert place apart; not because he dreaded <lb/>
            death, but because he wished to spare his enemies the crime <lb/>
            of adding another murder to the one already committed, <lb/>
            should the sight of his many miracles rouse their deadly <lb/>
            zeal.1 He, therefore, chose to put off the day of his death <lb/>
            until the time of the passover, and thus afford us an example <lb/>
            of evading the sudden attacks of traitors.</p>
          <p>When the people heard of his departure, they followed <lb/>
            him on foot; and Jesus, seeing a great multitude, was moved <lb/>
            with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. <lb/>
            And when it was evening, he took five barley-loaves and two <lb/>
            fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and <lb/>
            gave them to his disciples to set before the multitude, <lb/>
            whom he had previously commanded to sit down on the <lb/>
            green grass. The apostles ministered to the wants of five <lb/>
            thousand men, beside women and children, who did all eat <lb/>
            and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that <lb/>
            remained twelve baskets full.2 All these things are full of <lb/>
            mysteries. Jesus leaves Judea, and comes into the desert <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xiv. 1—13; Mark vi. 14—32; Luke iii. 19, 20; ix. 7—10. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xiv. 13—21; Mark vi. 33—44; Luke ix. 11—17; John vi. 1—13. </note> <pb n="30"/>

            of the Gentiles ; the people follow him; moved with com­ <lb/>
            passion, he heals their sick; he feeds them with the five <lb/>
            barley-loaves of the Mosaic law, and with the two fishes, <lb/>
            which are the figure of the prophets and of the psalms. He <lb/>
            performed this miracle in the evening, signifying the close <lb/>
            of time, when the Sun of righteousness set for us.</p>
          <p>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle <lb/>
            that Jesus did, said : “ This is of a truth that prophet that <lb/>
            should come into the world." When Jesus, therefore, per­ <lb/>
            ceived that they would come and take him by force to make <lb/>
            him a king, he constrained his disciples to get into a ship, <lb/>
            and to go before him unto the other side of the sea; and <lb/>
            when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a <lb/>
            mountain apart to pray. When the evening was come, <lb/>
            the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, <lb/>
            and they toiled nearly the whole night in rowing, for the <lb/>
            wind was contrary. In the fourth watch of the night, <lb/>
            when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty fur­ <lb/>
            longs, he cometh unto them walking upon the sea; and <lb/>
            when they saw him, they were troubled, because they <lb/>
            supposed it had been a spirit, and they cried out for fear; <lb/>
            but straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying: " It is I; be <lb/>
            not afraid." " Lord, said Peter, " if it be thou, bid me come <lb/>
            unto thee on the water." And he said, " Come." And when <lb/>
            Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the <lb/>
            water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind bois­ <lb/>
            terous, he was afraid; and, beginning to sink, he cried, <lb/>
            saying, " Lord, save me.” And immediately Jesus stretched <lb/>
            forth his hand, and caught him, because he called to him <lb/>
            in the hour of danger, and said unto him: " 0 thou of <lb/>
            little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" And when they <lb/>
            were come into the ship, the wind ceased; and those, who <lb/>
            saw this worshipped him, and confessed that he was the Son <lb/>
            of God.'</p>
          <p>It is necessary to remark that St. John describes the <lb/>
            miracle of the loaves as having taken place near the time of <lb/>
            the passover; but St. Matthew and St. Mark relate that it <lb/>
            happened immediately after the beheading of St. John the <lb/>
            Baptist; from which we may conclude that St. John was <lb/>
            beheaded shortly before Easter, and that, in the year follow- <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xiv. 22—33; Mark vi. 45—51; John vi. 14—21. </note> <pb n="31"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. IX.]</note><lb/>
            ing, when the time of the passover was again at hand the <lb/>
            mystery of the passion of our Lord was accomplished. <lb/>
            Jesus with his disciples came into the land of Genne­ <lb/>
            sareth, where he was received with joy by the men of <lb/>
            that place, and he healed their sick. For the merciful <lb/>
            kindness of their Saviour drew them to him; and they sent <lb/>
            out into all that country round about, and brought unto <lb/>
            him all that were diseased, and besought him that they <lb/>
            might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as <lb/>
            touched were made perfectly whole.1</p>
          <p>In the same place he had many disputes with the scribes <lb/>
            and Pharisees, which came from Jerusalem, and refuted the <lb/>
            superstitious traditions of the elders.2</p>
          <p>The multitudes took shipping, and came to Capernaum, <lb/>
            seeking for Jesus ; and he said to them : “Verily, verily, I <lb/>
            say unto you: Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, <lb/>
            but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. <lb/>
            Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat <lb/>
            which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Soil of man <lb/>
            shall give unto you; for him bath God the Father sealed." <lb/>
            These, and many other like things about the bread from <lb/>
            heaven and eternal life, said he in the synagogue, as he <lb/>
            taught in Capernaum; but the Jews, whose heart was of <lb/>
            stone, did not understand them. They therefore said: <lb/>
            This is an hard saying." Many of his disciples, blinded <lb/>
            by malice, began to murmur against him, and were so <lb/>
            offended at his words that they went back, and walked no <lb/>
            more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve: " Will <lb/>
            ye also go away ?” Simon Peter answered him: " Lord, to <lb/>
            whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life. <lb/>
            And we believe, and are sure that thou art Christ, the Son <lb/>
            of God." 3</p>
          <p>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he <lb/>
            would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill <lb/>
            him. Then, as the historian St. John relates, his relations, <lb/>
            who, in compliance with the Jewish custom, were called <lb/>
            "his brethren," invited him to go with them to the feast of <lb/>
            tabernacles, that he might show himself openly to the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xiv. 34—36; Mark vi. 53—56. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xv. 1—9; Mark vii. 1—13. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 John vi. 22—69. </note> <pb n="32"/>

            world. And when they, who sought for worldly glory, set <lb/>
            out on their journey, he abode still in Galilee. Now <lb/>
            about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up, and taught <lb/>
            in the temple, and all the Jews marvelled at his doctrine. <lb/>
            The Pharisees heard that the people differed in opinion <lb/>
            respecting him, and sent officers to take him; but no man <lb/>
            laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.1 In <lb/>
            the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and <lb/>
            cried, saying: " If any man thirst, let him come unto me, <lb/>
            and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture bath <lb/>
            said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." <lb/>
            This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on <lb/>
            him should receive ; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, <lb/>
            because that Jesus was not yet glorified. Many of the <lb/>
            people, when they heard this saying, said: " Of a truth this <lb/>
            is the Prophet." Others said: " This is the Christ." But <lb/>
            some said; " Shall Christ come out of Galilee ? Hath not <lb/>
            the Scripture said that Christ cometh of the seed of David, <lb/>
            and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was ?" So <lb/>
            there was a division among the people because of him. <lb/>
            But the officers, who had been sent by the chief priests <lb/>
            and Pharisees to take Jesus, when they heard his sayings, <lb/>
            forgot the purpose for which they were sent, and returned <lb/>
            without any accusation against him, but full of admiration. <lb/>
            When, therefore, the cruel magistrates harshly demanded of <lb/>
            their officers why they had not brought the Teacher of life <lb/>
            bound before them, they, taught by divine inspiration, bore <lb/>
            true testimony concerning the doctrine of Christ; for their <lb/>
            answer to those who sent them was: " Never man spake <lb/>
            like this man." And we must not be astonished at this, <lb/>
            when we consider that he who spoke to them was both God <lb/>
            and than. But as these proud rulers of the people endea­ <lb/>
            voured wickedly to suppress the truth, Nicodemus put a <lb/>
            stop to their criminal efforts by the authority of the law; <lb/>
            so that, their designs being frustrated, they returned home, <lb/>
            void of faith, and without deriving any benefit from this <lb/>
            conference.2</p>
          <p>From thence Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives; <lb/>
            and early in the morning he came again into the temple, <lb/>
            where he sat down, and taught all the people that came <note type="footnote"> 1 John vii. 1—30.</note> <note type="footnote">2 John vii. 37—53. </note> <pb n="33"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. IX.]</note><lb/>
            unto him. And they brought unto him a woman taken in <lb/>
            adultery, who, though condemned by strict justice, was <lb/>
            absolved by the sweetness of his mercy. Pharisaic craft <lb/>
            had reckoned on ensnaring Christ, and lowering him in the <lb/>
            eyes of the people, by exhibiting him as either harsh, or <lb/>
            disregarding the law. For if he had condemned the accused <lb/>
            woman, in obedience to the law of Moses, they would have <lb/>
            charged him with cruelty, and taunted him with forgetting <lb/>
            to show that mercy which he was continually preaching; <lb/>
            and would thus have rendered him odious to the people by <lb/>
            whom he was beloved. If, on the contrary, he had forbid­ <lb/>
            dell them to stone the adulteress, from a love of clemency, <lb/>
            they would have accused him of being an enemy to the law <lb/>
            and of encouraging crime. But he, the true Wisdom, <lb/>
            broke the snares of these wicked men like the threads of a <lb/>
            spider's web, in virtue of his supreme authority. He said <lb/>
            unto them: " He that is without sin among you, let him <lb/>
            first cast a stone at her." In the first part of the sentence, <lb/>
            we discover the feeling of a compassionate observer; in the <lb/>
            second, the sentence of a just judge. Stooping down, he <lb/>
            wrote on the ground with his finger, and his word, as a two­ <lb/>
            edged sword, pierced the conscience of these insidious men: <lb/>
            thus he completely satisfied the severity of justice and the <lb/>
            gentleness of mercy. At last these crafty questioners, <lb/>
            struck with shame at the equity of the sentence pro­ <lb/>
            nounced, left the adulterous woman, and, beginning at the <lb/>
            eldest, went out one by one. Then the Supreme Judge <lb/>
            kindly lifted up the accused woman, thus left alone with <lb/>
            him: "Go,” he said unto her, "and sin no more." See <lb/>
            how his mercy pardons past sins, while his justice forbids <lb/>
            the presumption of sinning any more.1</p>
          <p>In the treasury, Jesus spake unto them of his being the <lb/>
            true light of the world, expatiated on the nature of liberty, <lb/>
            on his own exaltation, on the servitude of sin, and on false­ <lb/>
            hood and truth. The enraged Jews, in answer to the <lb/>
            blessed words of Christ, replied: “ Thou art a Samaritan, <lb/>
            and hast a devil." Notwithstanding, however, their inju­ <lb/>
            rious language, he replied with patience, instructed them <lb/>
            with humility, and taught the knowledge of divine things to <lb/>
            those who were to be saved. But they, becoming infuriated, <note type="footnote"> 1 John viii. 1—11. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            collected stones to cast at him; but Jesus hid himself, and <lb/>
            went out of the templet</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CH. X. The pool of Siloam—The transfiguration.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>As he passed by, seeing a man which was blind from <lb/>
            his birth, he spat on the ground, and making clay of the <lb/>
            spittle, anointed the eyes of the blind man, and said unto <lb/>
            him: " Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.” He went his way, <lb/>
            therefore, and washed, and came seeing. This was done <lb/>
            on a sabbath-day; and in consequence, a great division <lb/>
            arose among the Jews. The man whose eyes were opened <lb/>
            was cast out of the synagogue, because he bare witness to <lb/>
            him from whom he had received his sight; but was after­ <lb/>
            wards recognized and received by him whom he loved with <lb/>
            so much reason. Then Jesus related to them the parable <lb/>
            of the door of the sheepfold, of the shepherd and his flock, <lb/>
            and of the good pastor and the hireling. Many of the <lb/>
            Jews received his words; but a great number, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, lightly rejected them.2</p>
          <p>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of <lb/>
            Tyre and Sidon; where a woman of Canaan earnestly <lb/>
            entreated him that he would heal her daughter, who was <lb/>
            grievously vexed with a devil. His disciples besought him <lb/>
            [to send her away] ; but, after some hesitation, he granted <lb/>
            her prayer, and having commended the faith and humi­ <lb/>
            lity of the mother, freed the daughter from the power of the <lb/>
            demon.3</p>
          <p>And departing from the coasts of Tyre, the chief city of <lb/>
            the Canaanites, he came by Sidon, a town of Phœnicia, unto <lb/>
            the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Deca­ <lb/>
            polis. He there took aside from the multitude one that was <lb/>
            deaf, and had an impediment in his speech, and, putting <lb/>
            his fingers into his ears, he spat, and touched his tongue, <lb/>
            and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said unto him: <lb/>
            " Ephphatha,” that is, Be opened. And straightway his ears <lb/>
            were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and <lb/>
            he spake plain. And those who were witnesses of this <lb/>
            miracle were astonished, saying: " He bath done all things <note type="footnote"> 1 John viii. 12—59.</note> <note type="footnote">2 John ix.; x. 1—21. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xv. 21—28; Mark vii. 24—30. </note> <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. X.]</note><lb/>
            well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to <lb/>
            speak.”1</p>
          <p>Jesus came nigh unto the sea of Galilee, and went up <lb/>
            into a mountain, and taught the great multitudes that came <lb/>
            unto him. And they cast at Jesus' feet those that were <lb/>
            dumb, lame, blind, maimed, and many others, and he healed <lb/>
            them; insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they <lb/>
            saw the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind <lb/>
            see.2 In the same manner the Lord works spiritually in <lb/>
            his holy church, and by his grace a multitude of sinners are <lb/>
            saved every day. The dumb are those who refuse to sing <lb/>
            praises to the Lord, and who do not confess a belief in him. <lb/>
            The blind are those who do not understand, although they <lb/>
            obey. The deaf are those who will not obey, even though <lb/>
            they understand. The lame are those who neglect to fulfil <lb/>
            the divine precepts, and walk through the devious paths of <lb/>
            wickedness. Such are the men who are healed every day <lb/>
            by the grace of God, and are guided into the way that leads <lb/>
            to life eternal. Those who feared the Lord, and were eye- <lb/>
            witnesses of these corporeal signs, magnified the King of <lb/>
            sabaoth with joy. Now also the faithful rejoice in the con­ <lb/>
            version of sinners, and devoutly glorify the Lord God of <lb/>
            Israel, who doeth all good things.</p>
          <p>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said: "I <lb/>
            have compassion on the multitude, because they continue <lb/>
            with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I <lb/>
            will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the <lb/>
            way." He then commanded the multitude to sit down on <lb/>
            the ground, and taking seven loaves and a few little fishes, <lb/>
            gave thanks, brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the <lb/>
            disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were <lb/>
            filled; and they took up of the broken meat that was left <lb/>
            seven baskets full. And they that did eat were four <lb/>
            thousand men, beside women and children. And he sent <lb/>
            away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts <lb/>

            reth. Here the Sadducees and the Pharisees, tempting him, <lb/>
            desired that he would shew them a sign from heaven, for <lb/>
            they made light of the great miracle he had performed in <lb/>
            feeding four thousand men with seven loaves, and filling <note type="footnote"> 1 Mark vii. 31—37.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Matt. xv. 29—31. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>

            seven baskets with the fragments that remained. But he <lb/>
            reproved their insolence; and refusing to give them any <lb/>
            other sign than that of the prophet Jonas, left them, and <lb/>
            entering into the ship again, departed to the other side.1</p>
          <p>At Bethsaida, they besought him to touch a blind man. <lb/>
            And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of <lb/>
            the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his <lb/>
            hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught. And he <lb/>
            said: " I see men as trees walking." Jesus put his hands <lb/>
            again upon his eyes, and he was restored, and began to see <lb/>
            every thing clearly. Our Lord then said to him: " Go unto <lb/>
            thine house; and if thou enter the town, thou shalt not <lb/>
            tell it to any one."2</p>
          <p>And Jesus went out, and came into the towns of Cæsarea <lb/>
            Philippi; and by the way he asked his disciples what <lb/>
            men thought concerning him ? And they answered: <lb/>
            “Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; <lb/>
            and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets." He saith <lb/>
            unto them : " But whom say ye that I am ?’ And Simon <lb/>
            Peter answered and said: " Thou art the Christ, the SOIl of <lb/>
            the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him: <lb/>
            “ Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood bath <lb/>
            not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. <lb/>
            And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock <lb/>
            I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not pre­ <lb/>
            vail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the <lb/>
            kingdom of heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on <lb/>
            earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt <lb/>
            loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." He then charged <lb/>
            his disciples that they should tell no man that he was <lb/>
            Jesus the Christ. From that time forth began Jesus to <lb/>
            shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests <lb/>
            and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third <lb/>
            day. Then Peter, taking him aside, from excessive love <lb/>
            began to rebuke him, saying: " Be it far from thee, Lord; <lb/>
            this shall not be unto thee." But he turned, and said unto <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xv. 32—39; xvi. 1—4; Mark viii. 1—13. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mark vii. 22—26. We read in St. Mark: “ And he sent him away <lb/>
            to his house, saying, ‘ Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the <lb/>
            town.’” </note> <pb n="37"/>

            Peter: " Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence <lb/>
            unto me, for thou savourest not the things that be of God, <lb/>
            but those that be of men.” After the Lord had shown to <lb/>
            his disciples the mystery of his passion and resurrection, <lb/>
            he exhorted them, as well as the people, to follow the <lb/>
            example of his passion, and promised them the reward <lb/>
            provided for those who suffer.1</p>
          <p>After six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his <lb/>
            brother, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart <lb/>
            by themselves ; and he was transfigured before them. And <lb/>
            his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment became as <lb/>
            white as snow. And there appeared unto them Moses and <lb/>
            Elias, talking with him ; and, behold, a bright cloud over­ <lb/>
            shadowed them; and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which <lb/>
            said: " This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; <lb/>
            hear ye him.” And when the disciples heard it, they fell <lb/>
            on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and <lb/>
            touched them, and said: "Arise, and be not afraid." And <lb/>
            when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save <lb/>
            Jesus only. And as they came down from the mountain, <lb/>
            Jesus charged them, saying:. " Tell the vision to no man, <lb/>
            until the Son of man be risen again from the dead." Then, <lb/>
            in answer to their inquiry, he told them that Elias was <lb/>
            come already; and they understood that he spake unto <lb/>
            them of John the Baptist.2</p>
          <p>On the next day, when he was come to the multitude, <lb/>
            straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were <lb/>
            greatly amazed, and, running to him, saluted him. Then a <lb/>
            certain man of the company came to him, and threw him­ <lb/>
            self down on his knees, saying: " Lord, have mercy on my <lb/>
            son, for he is lunatic from his infancy, and sore vexed; for <lb/>
            ofttimes the devil bath cast him into the fire, and into the <lb/>
            waters, to destroy him; and I brought him to thy disciples, <lb/>
            and they could not cure him." And when Jesus had com­ <lb/>
            manded the sick child to be brought, while he was yet com­ <lb/>
            ing, the evil spirit threw him down and tare him ; and he fell <lb/>
            on the ground, and wallowed foaming. Jesus rebuked the <lb/>
            foul spirit, and charged him to come out of him, and to <lb/>
            enter no more into him. And the spirit cried, and rent <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xvi. 13—28; Mark viii. 27—38; Luke ix. 18—27. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xvii. 1—13; Mark ix. 2—13; Luke ix. 28—36. </note> <pb n="38"/>

            him sore, and came out of him, and he fell on the ground <lb/>
            as one dead, insomuch that many said that he was <lb/>
            dead. But Jesus, took him by the hand, lifted him up, and <lb/>
            delivered him whole to his father. Afterwards, when the <lb/>
            disciples asked him privately why they could not heal him, <lb/>
            he said unto them: "Because of your unbelief; for verily <lb/>
            I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, <lb/>
            ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence, and it shall <lb/>
            remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. How­ <lb/>
            beit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.”1</p>
          <p>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto <lb/>
            them: " The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of <lb/>
            men, and they shall kill him ; and the third day he shall <lb/>
            rise again." And they were exceeding sorry.2</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AND when they were come to Capernaum, they that <lb/>
            received tribute money came to Peter, and said: "Doth <lb/>
            not your Master pay tribute ? " He saith, "Yes." And <lb/>
            when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, <lb/>
            saying: " Of whom do the kings of the earth take tribute ? <lb/>
            of their own children, or of strangers ?" Peter saith unto <lb/>
            him: " Of strangers." Christ was the Son of a King, both <lb/>
            according to the flesh and the Spirit, whether we consider <lb/>
            him as born of the seed of David, or as the Word of the <lb/>
            Almighty Father. Therefore, as the son of a king, he was <lb/>
            not obliged to pay tribute money; but he who had taken <lb/>
            upon him the humility of the flesh wished to fulfil all <lb/>
            righteousness. In every kingdom, it is clear, children are <lb/>
            free from taxation : Jesus saith unto Peter: " Then are the <lb/>
            children free. Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, <lb/>
            go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that <lb/>
            first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou <lb/>
            shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them <lb/>
            for me and thee."3 This fish is the figure of Christ; the <lb/>
            sea represents mortal life; the tribute money, or the two <lb/>
            drachms, means confession, which is given for Peter as for a <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xvii. 14—21; Mark ix. 14—29; Luke ix. 37—42. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xvii. 22, 23; Mark ix. 30—32. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xvii. 24—27. </note> <pb n="39"/>

            sinner, but for Christ as for a Lamb without spot and <lb/>
            guiltless. <lb/>
            g</p>
          <p>Then there arose a reasoning among the apostles, which <lb/>
            of them should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And <lb/>
            Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst <lb/>
            of them, and said: " Verily I say unto you, Except ye be <lb/>
            converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter <lb/>
            into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall <lb/>
            humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in <lb/>
            the kingdom of heaven;" adding other precepts, concern­ <lb/>
            ing humility and gentleness, avoiding to offend little children, <lb/>
            and correcting a brother mildly. He then spoke to them of <lb/>
            paternal kindness, and set before them the parable of the <lb/>
            king who forgave his servant the debt of ten thousand <lb/>
            talents, when he besought him, and of that same servant <lb/>
            who refused to acquit a fellow servant who owed him an <lb/>
            hundred pence. The discourse, after payment of the tribute, <lb/>
            in commendation of humility and innocence, and teaching us <lb/>
            how to correct and pardon, being ended, the righteous <lb/>
            Teacher departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of <lb/>
            Judea beyond Jordan; and great multitudes followed him; <lb/>
            and he healed them there.1</p>
          <p>When the Pharisees asked him if it were lawful for a <lb/>
            man to put away his wife, he referred to the fixed Jaw of <lb/>
            marriage, saying: " What God bath joined together, let not <lb/>
            man put asunder." 2</p>
          <p>Then were there brought unto him little children, that <lb/>
            he should put his hands on them, and pray: and his disci­ <lb/>
            ples rebuked those that brought them. But Jesus was <lb/>
            much displeased, and said unto them: " Suffer the little <lb/>
            children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such <lb/>
            is the kingdom of heaven."3</p>
          <p>A young man asked him, kneeling, the way to eternal <lb/>
            salvation; when, after instructing him in the command­ <lb/>
            ments of the law, he added: "If thou wilt be perfect, <lb/>
            go, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou <lb/>
            shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow <lb/>
            me." But when he heard that saying, he went away <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xviii. 1—35; xix. 1, 2; Mark ix. 33-49; Luke ix. 46—48 </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xix. 3—6; Mark x. 2-9. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xix. 13, 14; Mark x. 13, 14; Luke xviii. 15, 16. </note> <pb n="40"/>

            sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Then said Jesus: <lb/>
            " Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter <lb/>
            into the kingdom of heaven. It is easier for a camel to go <lb/>
            through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the <lb/>
            kingdom of God." Peter, hearing what was said in praise of <lb/>
            voluntary poverty, self-complacently said to the Lord: " Be­ <lb/>
            hold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we <lb/>
            have therefore ?" And Jesus said unto them: " Verily I say <lb/>
            unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration <lb/>
            when the SOIl of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, <lb/>
            shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes <lb/>
            of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or bre­ <lb/>
            thren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or <lb/>
            lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and <lb/>
            shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall <lb/>
            be last; and the last shall be first.”1</p>
          <p>He then set before them the parable of the householder, <lb/>
            who took labourers into his vineyard at different hours of the <lb/>
            day, but gave to all of them the same hire, one penny, begin­ <lb/>
            ning from the last unto the first.2 These different hours of <lb/>
            the day are understood to represent typically the past ages. <lb/>
            Abel laboured at day-break, Noe at the third hour, Abraham <lb/>
            at the sixth, and the lawgiver Moses at the ninth. At the <lb/>
            “ eleventh hour " Christ came, rebuked the Gentiles, because <lb/>
            they stood idle in the great market-place of this world, and <lb/>
            commanded them to work by faith in the vineyard of his <lb/>
            church. Or, these different hours may also be likened to the <lb/>
            several stages of a man’s life. The morning represents <lb/>
            childhood; the third hour of the day, youth; the sixth <lb/>
            hour is emblematical of manhood; the ninth, of old age ; the <lb/>
            eleventh, of decrepitude, or superannuation. At all these <lb/>
            ages conversions take place; and the converts are rewarded <lb/>
            with the penny of everlasting life. A modern poet thus <lb/>
            speaks of this similitude :— <lb/>
            When the sun sinks in the west, <lb/>
            And the vineyard-labourers claim <lb/>
            Wages due and grateful rest, <lb/>
            Their reward is all the same; <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xix. 16 —30; Mark x. 17—31; Luke xviii. 18—30. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xx. 1—8. </note> <pb n="41"/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XII. Third year of Christ's ministry—In Judea— After leaving Galilee.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THUS far I have attentively examined, for a salutary <lb/>
            exercise, as I have been able to gather from the writings <lb/>
            of the evangelists, and endeavoured to relate briefly, the <lb/>
            works which our Lord performed during the first two years <lb/>
            of his mission. It is now my duty to search out the acts of <lb/>
            his third year, and briefly to recount the important and <lb/>
            memorable deeds of our Lord after his departure from Galilee <lb/>
            into Judea, that he might accomplish in Jerusalem the <lb/>
            mystery of his Fathers dispensation, and reveal to us by <lb/>
            his own ineffable operation the hidden things of the law and <lb/>
            the prophets. He, indeed, at first taught in the eastern parts <lb/>
            of Judea, beyond Jordan; but afterwards on this side of it, <lb/>
            when he went to Jericho and Jerusalem. For although <lb/>
            the whole kingdom of the Jews was generally called Judea, <lb/>
            to distinguish it from other countries, yet the southern part <lb/>
            was more especially named Judea, as distinct from Samaria, <lb/>
            Galilee, Decapolis, and the other districts of the same <lb/>
            province.</p>
          <p>Jesus, on his way to Jerusalem, privately foretold his <lb/>
            passion to his disciples. Then the mother of Zebedee's <lb/>
            children desired him to grant that her two sons might <lb/>
            sit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his <lb/>
            left, in his kingdom.But he taught them to be patient <lb/>
            and lowly, and he himself set an example of perfect righteous­ <lb/>
            ness for them to follow. In answer to John's inquiry, <lb/>
            he commanded him not to forbid any one to perform miracles <lb/>
            in his name.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xx. 17—28; Mark x. 32—45; Luke ix. 49, 50. </note> <pb n="42"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note>As he was drawing nigh unto Jerusalem, he sent <lb/>
            messengers before his face into a village of the Samari­ <lb/>
            tans; but they did not receive them. However, when <lb/>
            James and John wished him to command fire to come down <lb/>
            from heaven upon the heads of the men who had treated <lb/>
            him with scorn, he rebuked his disciples, saying: “ Ye <lb/>
            know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son <lb/>
            of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save <lb/>
            them.”1</p>
          <p>After these things the Lord appointed seventy-two <lb/>
            disciples, and sent them, two and two, into every city and <lb/>
            place whither he himself would come, and gave them <lb/>
            directions to whom and how they were to preach. He <lb/>
            then upbraided the cities that would not believe in his <lb/>
            name. And when the seventy-two disciples returned <lb/>
            again with joy to him, the Lord charged them not to <lb/>
            rejoice in this, that the spirits were subject unto them, <lb/>
            but because their names were written in heaven; he <lb/>
            referred all praise to his Father, and called the eyes of the <lb/>
            disciples blessed, because they saw those things which <lb/>
            many just men and kings before them had desired to see, <lb/>
            but had not seen.2</p>
          <p>When a lawyer asked him a question, tempting him, <lb/>
            lie showed him what to do in order to inherit eternal life, <lb/>
            and mentioned the case of the man who " went down from <lb/>
            Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves," proving <lb/>
            to them all that the Samaritan, who, when the priest and <lb/>
            the Levite passed by on the other side, went to the <lb/>
            assistance of the man who had been wounded by the <lb/>
            thieves, was his neighbour, because he had compassion on <lb/>
            him.3</p>
          <p>In a certain village, a woman named Martha received <lb/>
            Jesus into her house, and when she complained to him <lb/>
            that her sister had left her to serve alone, and would not <lb/>
            help her, he put a stop to her murmurs by asserting that <lb/>
            Mary had " chosen the good part." 4</p>
          <p>St. Matthew, in the Lord's prayer, gives the seven <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke ix. 51—56. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Luke x. 1—24; we here read, " other seventy also." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xxii. 34—40; Mark xii. 28—34; Luke x. 25—37. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Luke x. 38—42. </note> <pb n="43"/>

            petitions in the following words:—Our Father which art <lb/>
            in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy <lb/>
            will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our <lb/>
            daily bread. And forgive its our debts, as we forgive our <lb/>
            debtors. And lead its not into temptation, but deliver us from <lb/>
            evil. Amen. In the first three petitions we pray for things <lb/>
            eternal, but in the last four for things temporal, which <lb/>
            are, however, necessary in order to acquire those that are <lb/>
            eternal.</p>
          <p>Now St. Luke has but five requests, thus:—Our Father, <lb/>
            Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Give us day by <lb/>
            day our daily bread; and forgive its our sins, for we also <lb/>
            forgive every one that is indebted to its. And lead us not <lb/>
            into temptation. Thus we see seven petitions, according to <lb/>
            St. Matthew, reduced to five in St. Luke's gospel: for in­ <lb/>
            stance, the name of God is sanctified in the Spirit; but the <lb/>
            kingdom of God is to come in the resurrection of the flesh. <lb/>
            He then adds three others, for the daily bread, for the <lb/>
            remission of sins, and for avoiding temptation. All that <lb/>
            man requires in this life and the next may be understood to <lb/>
            be embraced by these petitions.1 For this reason, when the <lb/>
            disciples said to Jesus, " Lord, teach us to pray," he not <lb/>
            only gave them a form of prayer, but taught them to pray <lb/>
            frequently and with importunity. He admonished them to <lb/>
            persevere constantly in their petitions to Heaven, and related <lb/>
            to them the parable of the friend who requested the loan of <lb/>
            three loaves at midnight. He advised them to " ask, seek, <lb/>
            and knock;” he, therefore, exhorted them to ask for the <lb/>
            bread of the word of God, by which the friend, that is to <lb/>
            say, the soul, is nourished; to seek for the friend who gives <lb/>
            abundantly, that is to say, the Lord; to knock at the door <lb/>
            of divine mercy, through which they enter the treasury of <lb/>
            wisdom, where the celestial joys are kept. The word bread <lb/>
            is understood to signify charity, with which the stone, that is <lb/>
            to say, the hardness of avarice, is contrasted. The fish repre­ <lb/>
            sents the faith of invisible baptism, on account of the water <lb/>
            used, or because it is caught in invisible places, and is im­ <lb/>
            perishable by the waves of this world that roar around <lb/>
            it; with this the venomous serpent is contrasted; this last <lb/>
            is the figure of perfidy or incredulity. The egg is the em- <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. vi. 9—13; Luke xi. 1—13. </note> <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            blem of hope ; because the egg is not yet a perfect foetus, <lb/>
            but we hope to see it become one by being hatched. Now <lb/>
            despair is the reverse of hope; it has for its image the <lb/>
            scorpion, which strikes the unwary with its envenomed <lb/>
            sting from behind, and the secret puncture causes sudden <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>Our Saviour accused the Pharisees of blasphemy and <lb/>
            ingratitude for the acts of mercy which they witnessed. He <lb/>
            took the illustration of the armed man who was overcome <lb/>
            by a man stronger than himself, and spoke of the unclean <lb/>
            spirit that returned into the man, with seven other spirits <lb/>
            more wicked than himself.1 When a certain woman <lb/>
            lifted up her voice, and said, that the womb that bare <lb/>
            him was blessed, he answered that he who kept the <lb/>
            word of God was blessed.2 When he had healed the man <lb/>
            on whom three miracles were performed at the same time <lb/>
            (being blind he saw, dumb he spoke, possessed with a devil <lb/>
            was freed), he, who was the truth itself, gave them many <lb/>
            precepts conducive to salvation, repelled with the. weapons <lb/>
            of reason the Pharisees who tempted him, told them that <lb/>
            a lighted candle was not to be put under a bushel, but on a <lb/>
            candlestick; and taught them that the eye ought to be <lb/>
            singled</p>
          <p>When the Pharisee, who had besought him to dine with <lb/>
            him, marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner, <lb/>
            after the manner of the Jews, Jesus observed that external <lb/>
            ablutions did not purify their inward parts, which were foul <lb/>
            with sins, and repeating, “Woe to the Pharisees," six times, <lb/>
            added a long list of their evil deeds</p>
          <p>He also charged his disciples to take heed of the leaven <lb/>
            of hypocrisy, not to be afraid of them that can only kill <lb/>
            the body; and, in the hour of persecution, to take no <lb/>
            thought what they should say.5</p>
          <p>When one of the company requested him to divide the <lb/>
            inheritance between him and his brother, he related the <lb/>
            parable of the rich miser. He then warned his disciples to <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xii. 31—45; Mark iii. 22—30; Luke xi. 15—26. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Luke xi. 27, 28. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xii. 22—30; Mark iii. 22—30; Luke xL 14, 29—36. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Matt, xxiii. 13—38; Luke xi. 37—52. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Matt. xvi. 6—12; Mark viii. 15; Luke xii. 1—12. </note> <pb n="45"/>

            avoid, like the fowls of the air, being careful for meat <lb/>
            and raiment.1 Having promised the kingdom to the little <lb/>
            flock, he, commanded them to sell all that they possessed, <lb/>
            and all they acquired, and to give alms; telling them that <lb/>
            their loins ought to be girded about, and their lamps burn­ <lb/>
            ing. He also commanded them to watch, mentioning the <lb/>
            case of the two servants, the one good, the other bad; and <lb/>
            declared that the servant, which knew his lord's will, but did <lb/>
            it not, should be beaten with many stripes, while he that <lb/>
            knew not should be beaten with few stripes.2</p>
          <p>He told them that he was come to send fire- on the <lb/>
            earth, by reason of their divisions ; that, as they could <lb/>
            discern the face of the sky, they ought to discern the signs <lb/>
            of the times; and recommended them to consent to the <lb/>
            demands of their adversary, while they were in the way.3</p>
          <p>When he was told that Pilate had put to death some <lb/>
            of the Galileans, Jesus, answering, said, that all should <lb/>
            likewise perish, unless they repented; or be like the eighteen <lb/>
            who were crushed by the fall of the tower in Siloam. In <lb/>
            the parable of the barren fig-tree, he warns those who <lb/>
            defer the hour of repentance.4</p>
          <p>He made straight on the sabbath-day a woman who had <lb/>
            been bowed together eighteen years; and when some of <lb/>
            them murmured, because Jesus had healed on that day, he <lb/>
            silenced them by saying that an ox must be led away to <lb/>
            watering on the sabbath ; and all the people rejoiced for <lb/>
            the glorious things that were done by him.5</p>
          <p>Comparing the kingdom of God to a grain of mustard <lb/>
            seed and to leaven, he spoke of the few that enter <lb/>
            in at the strait gate, and said: " There are last which <lb/>
            shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."6 The <lb/>
            Lord then called Herod a " fox," a name by which heretics <lb/>
            are designated, on account of the deceitful and insidious <lb/>
            character of their conduct; and reproved Jerusalem because <lb/>
            it refused to seek the protection of his wings.7 He <lb/>
            healed, on the sabbath-day, a certain man which had the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. vi. 25—34; Luke xii. 13—31. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Luke xii. 32—48.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Luke xii. 49—59. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Luke xiii. 1—9.</note> <note type="footnote">5 Luke xiii. 10—17. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Matt. xiii. 31—33; Mark iv. 30, 31; Luke xiii. 18—30. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Luke xiii. 31—35. </note> <pb n="46"/>

            dropsy, ridding him as it were of a fountain of humours; <lb/>
            and when the Pharisees objected, he confounded them by <lb/>
            asking if they did not [on the sabbath-day] pull an ass or <lb/>
            an ox out of a pit into which it had fallen. He taught <lb/>
            them to practise humility, not seeking the first places at a <lb/>
            feast; and to bid to their table, not the rich, but the poor, <lb/>
            who could not return their hospitality.1</p>

            <title type="sub">On. XIII. Parables and discourses of Christ.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Lord Jesus Christ, employing various means to <lb/>
            further the salvation of man, gives us the parable of those <lb/>
            that were bidden to a supper; but, as they all sought to be <lb/>
            excused, they were not considered worthy of such an honour. <lb/>
            The first refused the invitation, because he had bought a <lb/>
            piece of ground; representing those who through love of <lb/>
            worldly things, make no account of heavenly things. <lb/>
            Another, who was prevented by his five yoke of oxen, is the <lb/>
            type of those curious persons, who, influenced by the <lb/>
            bodily senses, scrutinize external things only, and, while <lb/>
            they remark the life of others, and neglect the care ot <lb/>
            their own souls, refuse to take their place at the banquet <lb/>
            of eternal salvation. The third, who refused to be present <lb/>
            on account of his recent marriage, is the image of all persons <lb/>
            who allow themselves to be caught in the meshes of carnal <lb/>
            pleasure. Thus, while one man is occupied with the cares <lb/>
            of this world, another is tormented by incessantly thinking <lb/>
            of the actions of his neighbours, a third allows his mind <lb/>
            to be defiled by the pleasures of the flesh; but all equally <lb/>
            disdain to hasten to the banquet of eternal life.2</p>
          <p>Our Saviour told the great multitudes that went with <lb/>
            him, that they must not only give up all their connections, <lb/>
            but their own life, and take up the cross and follow him. <lb/>
            That they might not fail, be suggested that they ought to <lb/>
            act like the man who, “ intending to build a tower, sitteth <lb/>
            down first and counteth the cost, and proposed the example <lb/>
            of the two kings who were going to make war against each <lb/>
            other.3</p>
          <p>When they murmured because be kept company with <lb/>
            sinners, he spake unto them the parable of the lost <lb/>
            sheep, and of the piece of silver; the owners of which <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xiv. 1—14.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Luke xiv. 16—24.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Luke xiv. 25—32. </note> <pb n="47"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIII.]</note><lb/>
            were as joyful at finding them as they were sorrowful <lb/>
            at having lost them. He told them that there would be <lb/>
            likewise joy in the presence of the angels of God over <lb/>
            the salvation of one sinner that repenteth. But true <lb/>
            penitence consists in contrition for sins committed, and a <lb/>
            resolution not to repeat what is now lamented. He who <lb/>
            has done what is forbidden, ought also, in order to satisfy <lb/>
            the will of God, to deny himself what is permitted.1</p>
          <p>The Lord then gave them the parable of the frugal and <lb/>
            prodigal sons, shewing them how the prodigal son returned <lb/>
            to his father, who received him with the greatest kindness, <lb/>
            and kissed him; how he put the best robe upon him, <lb/>
            that is to say, the garb of innocence; gave him the ring <lb/>
            of sincere faith, and put shoes on his feet, that is to say, <lb/>
            ordained him to preach the gospel. In thus adorning the <lb/>
            hands and feet of the convert, the Lord typified good <lb/>
            works and missions. The father, having killed the fatted <lb/>
            calf, made a great supper. Now his elder son, that is to <lb/>
            say, the Jewish people, as he drew nigh to the house from <lb/>
            the field, which represents external observances, heard <lb/>
            music and dancing, that is to say, remarked that the sons <lb/>
            of the church, full of the Holy Ghost, preached the gospel <lb/>
            with harmonious voice. Having obtained information <lb/>
            respecting the cause of these signs of joy, he was angry with <lb/>
            his father, complaining that he had killed the fatted calf <lb/>
            for the son who had devoured his living with harlots, and <lb/>
            had a greater regard for him than for himself.2</p>
          <p>After this our Lord introduced the case of the unjust <lb/>
            steward, who, by a crafty device, reduced what was due to <lb/>
            his lord.3</p>
          <p>He declared that we cannot serve God and mammon; <lb/>
            rebuked the avaricious Pharisees, telling them that the law <lb/>
            and the prophets were until John the Baptist; and then <lb/>
            related the parable of the unmerciful rich man who was <lb/>
            clothed in purple, and the poor beggar, showing, from the <lb/>
            fate of the merely selfish, what will be that of such as live <lb/>
            by robbery.4</p>
          <p>After saying, "Woe to the man by whom the offence <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xv. 1—10.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Luke xv. 11—32. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Luke xvi. 1—8.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Luke xvi. 13—31. </note> <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            cometh," he commanded [Peter] to forgive a repentant <lb/>
            brother " until seventy times seven." 1</p>
          <p>The apostles, beseeching him to increase their faith, <lb/>
            are taught how they might remove a sycamine-tree; and <lb/>
            drawing a comparison between them and the servant plough­ <lb/>
            ing or feeding cattle, the Lord informs them that they <lb/>
            must confess themselves " unprofitable servants," even <lb/>
            when they shall have done all those things which were <lb/>
            commanded.3</p>
          <p>As Jesus went to Jerusalem, he passed through the <lb/>
            midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a <lb/>
            certain village, he cleansed ten men that were lepers, but <lb/>
            only one of them, and he a stranger, returned to give glory <lb/>
            to God.'</p>
          <p>It being enquired when the kingdom of God should come, <lb/>
            Jesus answered that it would not come with observation, <lb/>
            and he compared the advent of the Son of man to a flash of <lb/>
            lightning. He told them that the day of judgment ought to <lb/>
            be continually the object of the thoughts of men, as it would <lb/>
            come suddenly upon them ; and he likened that day to the <lb/>
            days of Noe and Lot, when death unexpectedly came upon <lb/>
            mankind, He also spake of the two persons, either in bed, <lb/>
            or at the mill, or in the field, one of whom would be chosen <lb/>
            and the other left. The bed is the figure of the church in <lb/>
            a state of rest; our Saviour speaks of two as of two persons ; <lb/>
            but we must understand the expression to mean two states <lb/>
            of the affections; for he who, for God's sake, practices con­ <lb/>
            tinence, so that, living without any worldly cares, he may <lb/>
            keep his thoughts bent upon the things that be of God, will <lb/>
            be admitted by him to happiness eternal. He, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, who, from love of the praise of men, although free <lb/>
            from the corruption of other vices, tarnishes the purity of <lb/>
            the monastic life to which he is devoted, will be left to <lb/>
            eternal misery; as Jeremiah intimates in his Lamenta­ <lb/>
            ti.ons, when he describes the fall of an idle and sinful soul, <lb/>
            under the figure of Judea, in these words: " The adversaries <lb/>
            saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths."4 The two women <lb/>
            grinding at the mill (in allusion to the revolutions of tem- <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt, xviii. 21, 22; Luke xvii. 1—4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xvii. 20; Luke xvii. 5—10. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Luke xvii. 11—19.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Lament. i. 7. </note> <pb n="49"/>

            poral affairs), represent the vulgar who ought to be governed <lb/>
            by their teachers, as women are by their husbands, and, <lb/>
            by their labours in various arts, minister to the service <lb/>
            of the church. One of them will be taken because she <lb/>
            enters the wedded state only from a desire to have children, <lb/>
            and makes use of her worldly substance to obtain heavenly <lb/>
            :riches; while she who marries for the sake of carnal enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment will be rejected. But whosoever shall offer their earthly <lb/>
            goods to the church or to the poor, in the name of our <lb/>
            Lord's redemption, shall have them multiplied. The two <lb/>
            men in the field represent the labourers in the ministry of <lb/>
            the church, performing their duties as in the field of God. <lb/>
            The one that shall have published the word of God sincerely <lb/>
            will be chosen; but he that shall have preached Christ im­ <lb/>
            perfectly and carelessly will be left.1</p>
          <p>These three classes of persons constitute the church, <lb/>
            which is divided into two distinct portions-the adopted <lb/>
            and the rejected. For this reason the prophet Ezekiel <lb/>
            saw three men delivered-Noah, Daniel, and Job,2 in <lb/>
            whom are shadowed the preachers of the gospel, the conti­ <lb/>
            nent, and married people. For Noah guided the ark on the <lb/>
            waters, and therefore represents those who govern; Daniel, <lb/>
            retaining the gift of abstinence even at the court of a <lb/>
            king, showed how continent men live; but Job, although <lb/>
            united to a wife by the bonds of marriage, and obliged to <lb/>
            take care of his own house, pleased God, and thus worthily <lb/>
            represents the class of good married people. To teach that <lb/>
            men ought always to pray and not to faint, the Lord spake <lb/>
            the parable of the widow who importuned the unjust judge <lb/>
            to avenge her of her adversary, and obtained, by incessant <lb/>
            supplication and weariness of the judge, what she solicited <lb/>
            with such pertinacity.3</p>
          <p>By showing us how the Pharisee and the publican prayed <lb/>
            in the temple, he teaches us not to extol our merits, but to <lb/>
            confess our sins. The righteous pray without ceasing that <lb/>
            they may be avenged of their enemies, so that all the wicked <lb/>
            should perish. Now the wicked perish in two different ways; <lb/>
            by being converted to righteousness, or in losing by punish­ <lb/>
            ment the power to do wrong.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xvii. 20—37.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Ezek. xiv. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Luke xviii. 1—8.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Luke xviii. 9—14. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL.

          <p><note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note>The Lord then foretold that be was to be delivered to <lb/>
            the Gentiles at Jerusalem, and suffer on the cross ; and <lb/>
            when they were come nigh unto Jericho, he beard the <lb/>
            cries of a blind man who sat by the wayside, begging. <lb/>
            Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought unto <lb/>
            him; and as soon as he had learned the request of the <lb/>
            blind man, he mercifully restored his sight.1</p>
          <p>And as Jesus passed through Jericho, he saw Zac­ <lb/>
            cheus, the chief among the publicans, who had climbed <lb/>
            up into a tree, and received hospitality at the house of this <lb/>
            man, who wished very much to see him. And when the <lb/>
            Jews murmured, saying that he was gone to be guest <lb/>
            with a man that is a sinner, Zaccheus, in the sincerity <lb/>
            of his faith, said unto the Lord: " Behold, Lord, the half <lb/>
            my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any­ <lb/>
            thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him four­ <lb/>
            fold." And Jesus said unto him: " This day is salvation <lb/>
            come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abra­ <lb/>
            ham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that <lb/>
            which was lost.” 2</p>
          <p>He then spake the parable of a certain nobleman who <lb/>
            went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, <lb/>
            and to return, after he bad delivered ten pounds to his <lb/>
            servants to trade with. When he was returned, the first <lb/>
            came, saying: “ Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds." <lb/>
            This first servant is the order of teachers sent to the circum­ <lb/>
            cised ; he received one pound for the purpose of trade, <lb/>
            because he is commanded to preach " one Lord, one faith, <lb/>
            one baptism, one God."3 Now this same pound bath gained <lb/>
            ten pounds, for this reason — that he has, by preaching <lb/>
            the word, drawn to him the people living under the <lb/>
            law. When he had been rewarded to his great satisfaction, <lb/>
            the second came, saying: " Lord, thy pound bath gained <lb/>
            five pounds." This servant represents the company of <lb/>
            those who were sent to announce the gospel to the uncir­ <lb/>
            cumcised, and are deservedly, by a divine decree, placed <lb/>
            at the head of those who, through their ministry, are con­ <lb/>
            verted to the worship of one God, having mortified the <lb/>
            deeds of the flesh. On the other hand, the servant who, <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xx. 18, 19, 30—34; Mark x. 32—34, 46—52; Luke xviii. 31—43. , </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Luke xix. 1—10.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Ephes. iv. 5, 6. </note> <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIV.]</note><lb/>
            when he was commanded to trade with the money entrusted <lb/>
            to him by his master, kept the pound laid up in a napkin, <lb/>
            is the figure of those who, although they may be fit <lb/>
            persons for preaching the gospel, in obedience to the <lb/>
            Lord's commands, through the church, either decline to <lb/>
            undertake that duty, or perform it unworthily. To tie up <lb/>
            the money in a napkin, is to conceal the gifts we have <lb/>
            received in sloth and uselessness. By this parable, then <lb/>
            we understand that the two faithful servants are th( <lb/>
            teachers of both peoples; that the ten pounds and the <lb/>
            five pounds mean believers in God; that by the wicked <lb/>
            servant are represented bad Catholics; by the enemies, <lb/>
            who would not allow the real heir to reign over them, <lb/>
            the impiety of those who prefer never to hear the word on <lb/>
            truth, or corrupt it by false interpretations. By reaping <lb/>
            where seed had not been sown,1 he means the separation of <lb/>
            those who never heard the word of God. The whole human <lb/>
            race that is to appear at the day of judgment, is certainly <lb/>
            represented by these five persons. And when he had thus <lb/>
            spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.2</p>
          <p>St. John alone mentions that, at the feast of the dedi­ <lb/>
            cation, in the winter, the Jews said to Jesus, who was <lb/>
            walking in Solomon's porch: " How long dost thou make <lb/>
            us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly." <lb/>
            Taking advantage of this opportunity of teaching them, he <lb/>
            answered: " I and my Father are one;" and uttered many <lb/>
            other sublime words. For this reason the Jews, blinded <lb/>
            by malice, took up stones to stone him [but he escaped <lb/>
            out of their hand]. After this, he went away again be­ <lb/>
            yond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized; <lb/>
            and there he abode. And many resorted unto him, and <lb/>
            believed on him there.3</p>

            <title type="sub">CH. XIV. Lazarus restored to life,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A CERTAIN man, named Lazarus, was sick at Bethany; <lb/>
            and his sisters, Mary and Martha, sent unto Jesus, saying: <lb/>
            “ Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.” When <lb/>
            Jesus heard that, he said: " This sickness is not unto <lb/>
            death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xix. 21.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Matt. xxv. 14—30. Luke xix. 11—20. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 John x. 22—42. </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            might be glorified thereby." Then he abode two days in <lb/>
            the same place, and after that went into Judea again, <lb/>
            and found that Lazarus had lain in the grave four days <lb/>
            already. Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was <lb/>
            coming, being strong in faith, went and met him, and said: <lb/>
            " Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died." <lb/>
            She who loudly lamented the loss of her brother, spoke to <lb/>
            our Lord with composure, and after a short conference with <lb/>
            Christ, during which she made a true confession of faith, <lb/>
            that is to say, acknowledged him to be the Son of God, the <lb/>
            life and the resurrection, she called Mary her sister, saying <lb/>
            to her in a low voice : " The Master is come, and calleth for <lb/>
            thee." Mary arose quickly, and went out of the town to <lb/>
            the place where Jesus had stopped; and when she saw him, <lb/>
            she fell down at his feet, saying: " Lord, if thou hadst been <lb/>
            here, my brother had not died." lIe-an inexhaustible <lb/>
            fountain of pity-wept, in the midst of her friends weeping, <lb/>
            the death of the friend they had lost; but his tears caused <lb/>
            them ineffable joy. Jesus, groaning in himself, came to the <lb/>
            grave, and commanded them to take away the stone from <lb/>
            the mouth, and then, with a loud voice, called him who, in <lb/>
            four days, had become putrid: "Lazarus, come forth." And <lb/>
            straightway he came forth, bound hand and foot with grave- <lb/>
            clothes ; and the Lord immediately ordered his disciples to <lb/>
            loose him and let him go. After the performance of this <lb/>
            glorious miracle, which ought to be celebrated to the <lb/>
            end of time, they did not all believe in Jesus, but many of <lb/>
            the Jews who came to Mary and Martha to comfort them, <lb/>
            and saw the unhoped-for resurrection of Lazarus, confessed <lb/>
            their belief in Christ.1</p>
          <p>There is no doubt but that the Lord raised several per­ <lb/>
            sons from the dead; however, in the holy Gospel, by reason <lb/>
            of a certain mystery, we read of three resurrections only. <lb/>
            By the daughter of the chief of the synagogue, who was re­ <lb/>
            stored to life in her fathers house before a small number of <lb/>
            witnesses, those sinners are signified, who shut up their sinful <lb/>
            propensities within their conscience, and do not suffer them to <lb/>
            break out. These are often raised to spiritual life by a divine <lb/>
            influence, which recalls them by secret checks from a de­ <lb/>
            raved will. The son of the widow, who was carried beyond <note type="footnote"> 1 John xi. 1—45. </note> <pb n="53"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIV.]</note><lb/>
            the gates of the city, and restored to life by Christ before <lb/>
            a multitude of witnesses, represents those guilty persons, <lb/>
            who, after consenting to perpetrate a crime, go forth, and, <lb/>
            as it were, draw death from the darkest recesses of their <lb/>
            soul; so that what was hidden in a secret corner, at last <lb/>
            appears before the whole world. Such men are often admo­ <lb/>
            nished to their salvation, and restored to life in a divine <lb/>
            manner by the remedy of a true conversion, as many <lb/>
            know to their great joy. In Lazarus, already buried, already <lb/>
            in a state of putrefaction, we have a figure of those sinners <lb/>
            who are fettered with the bonds of depraved habits, to such <lb/>
            a degree that wickedness has become so familiar to them, <lb/>
            that it does not allow them to become sensible of the <lb/>
            heinousness of the sin that they are committing; for which <lb/>
            reason they often excuse the evil they do; and are already <lb/>
            crushed, as it were, under the immense weight of their <lb/>
            guilt. They presume to be angry when they are reproved, <lb/>
            and are continually depraved by false praise, while their <lb/>
            neighbours, observing them, are also injured. Lastly, those <lb/>
            who, in the opinion of the world, are considered worthy of <lb/>
            condemnation, are nevertheless internally vivified by the <lb/>
            grace of God, and are afterwards absolved through the <lb/>
            agency of the priest.</p>
          <p>Or in other words, every man is born in a state of death <lb/>
            brought on us by original sin. The first day of death is that <lb/>
            which witnesses his birth; the second day, when, as he in­ <lb/>
            creases in stature, the boy becomes a man; arriving at years <lb/>
            of discretion, he begins to find innately in his own heart the <lb/>
            law which naturally teaches men not to do unto others what <lb/>
            they would not have others do unto them: but, unfortu­ <lb/>
            nately, they often venture to transgress this law. The third <lb/>
            day of death takes place when the written law is given to <lb/>
            man, but this also he despises. After all Christ came; <lb/>
            brought with him the Gospel, preached the kingdom of <lb/>
            heaven, threatened all sinners with the torments of Ge­ <lb/>
            henna, but promised eternal life to the righteous. The <lb/>
            Gospel itself is despised, and this is the fourth day of death, <lb/>
            as Lazarus lay in the tomb. Or again, we might say, <lb/>
            that the four steps that lead a sinner to destruction, and <lb/>
            bring him to the grave in which he decays, are: firstly, in­ <lb/>
            clination of the heart; secondly, consent; thirdly, action ; <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            fourthly, habit. But the grace of God recalls those who <lb/>
            have been removed far from him by sin, and restores to life <lb/>
            those who were sinking under the weight of their sins.</p>
          <p>When the wonderful miracle of the divine power was <lb/>
            published abroad by the reports of many witnesses, who, to <lb/>
            satisfy their curiosity, had examined on the spot by what <lb/>
            unknown law Lazarus issued from the grave, the chief <lb/>
            priests and the Pharisees gathered a council to conspire <lb/>
            against Christ; and when they heard what Caiaphas pro­ <lb/>
            phesied, they took counsel together to put him to death. <lb/>
            Jesus, therefore, went thence unto a country near to the <lb/>
            wilderness, into a city called Ephrem, and there conti­ <lb/>
            nued with his disciples. Now, both the chief priests <lb/>
            and their accomplices had given a commandment that if <lb/>
            any man knew where he was, he should make it known, <lb/>
            that they might take him: for they were afraid that all <lb/>
            men would follow him, and that the Romans would come <lb/>
            and take away the kingdom from them.1</p>
          <p>Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, <lb/>
            and there they made him a supper; and Martha served, <lb/>
            but Lazarus sat at the table. Then took Mary a pound of <lb/>
            ointment of spikenard [unguentum nardi pistici], very <lb/>
            costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them <lb/>
            with her hair. Spikenard is a kind of aromatic. Pistis <lb/>
            [<foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>] in Greek, fides in Latin, means faith; for that <lb/>
            reason the ointment is called pisticum, that is to say, faith­ <lb/>
            ful, because a corpse, when anointed with it, is preserved <lb/>
            from putrefaction. The house was filled with the <lb/>
            odour of the ointment, as the church is perfumed by the <lb/>
            good report of a religious life. When the traitor Judas, <lb/>
            who was a thief, and had the bag, smelt the sweet odour <lb/>
            with which the house was filled, he was offended, and re­ <lb/>
            buked this faithful and devoted woman for what she had <lb/>
            done. But the Lord mildly answered his harsh upbraid­ <lb/>
            ings: " Let her alone, for she bath wrought a good work <lb/>
            upon me. Verily I say unto you, in the whole world shall <lb/>
            this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of <lb/>
            her.”2</p>
          <p>Many Jews who went to Bethany, drawn thither by their <note type="footnote"> 1 John xi. 46—57. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt, xxvi. 6—13; Mark xiv. 3—9; John xii. 1—8. </note> <pb n="55"/>

            curiosity, saw Lazarus eating at the same table as Christ, <lb/>
            and joyfully bore witness to the miracle. The jealous <lb/>
            Pharisees consulted that they might, therefore, put the <lb/>
            resuscitated man to death; but in vain did they endeavour <lb/>
            to oppose the almighty power of Christ.1</p>

            <title type="sub">CH. XV. Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem- Teaches in the Temple,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ON the next day much people who were come to the <lb/>
            feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jeru­ <lb/>
            salem, took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet <lb/>
            him. As the hour of his immolation drew nigh, the Lamb of <lb/>
            God proceeded towards the spot that was to witness his <lb/>
            passion. When he was come to Bethphage, unto the <lb/>
            Mount of Olives, Jesus sent forth two of his disciples, say­ <lb/>
            ing : " Go into the village over against you, and straightway <lb/>
            ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and <lb/>
            bring them unto me." And the disciples went and brought <lb/>
            the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and <lb/>
            they set him thereon, that it might be fulfilled which was <lb/>
            spoken by the prophet long before: “ Behold, thy king <lb/>
            cometh unto thee,”—not sitting in a golden chariot arrayed <lb/>
            in splendid purple, nor does he mount a fiery steed, to take <lb/>
            the lead in discord and strife,—but is sitting upon an ass, <lb/>
            that loves tranquillity and peace. He is not surrounded <lb/>
            with glittering swords, but he cometh unto thee, meek; not <lb/>
            to be dreaded for his power, but to be loved for his gentle­ <lb/>
            ness. And a very great multitude spread their garments <lb/>
            in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees, and <lb/>
            strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went <lb/>
            before, and that followed, cried, saying: "Hosanna to the <lb/>
            Son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of <lb/>
            the Lord! Blessed be the kingdom of our father David! <lb/>
            Hosanna in the highest!" Some of the Pharisees said <lb/>
            unto him, " Master, rebuke thy disciples -" but be answered <lb/>
            and said unto them, " I tell you, that if these should hold <lb/>
            their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."2 And <lb/>
            when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over <lb/>
            it, and, as he foreknew every thing that was to happen, <note type="footnote"> 1 John xii. 9—11. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xxL 1—9; Mark xi. 1—10; Luke xix. 29—40; John xii. 12—15. </note> <pb n="56"/>

            foretold all the ills that threatened it, because it knew not <lb/>

            Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying : “ Who is <lb/>
            this ?" And the multitude said, " This is Jesus, the pro­ <lb/>
            phet of Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus went into the temple <lb/>
            of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought, <lb/>
            and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the <lb/>
            seats of them that sold doves, saying: " It is written, My <lb/>
            house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have <lb/>
            made it a den of thieyes.”1 And the blind and the lame <lb/>
            came to him in the temple, and he healed them. And <lb/>
            when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things <lb/>
            that he did, and the children crying, with signs of grateful <lb/>
            joy: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were sore <lb/>
            displeased, and, filled with bitter envy, they said unto him: <lb/>
            "Hearest thou what these say?" Jesus answered, "Yea, <lb/>
            have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and suck­ <lb/>
            lings thou hast perfected praise ?”2</p>
          <p>And when Jesus had looked round about upon all things, <lb/>
            he left these evil-disposed inhabitants of the city, and went <lb/>
            out unto Bethany with the twelve, and lodged there. Now <lb/>
            in the morning, as he returned into the city, he hungered, <lb/>
            and coming to a fig-tree that stood by the wayside, and <lb/>
            finding nothing thereon but leaves only, he cursed it, say­ <lb/>
            ing: "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever." <lb/>
            And presently the fig-tree withered away! This tree was <lb/>
            the true figure of the synagogue, which had the letter of <lb/>
            the law, but bore no fruit.3</p>
          <p>In the temple, they asked him by what authority he <lb/>
            did such wonderful things; but instead of answering their <lb/>
            question, he inquired of them whether the baptism of <lb/>
            John was from heaven or of men. Christ by this short <lb/>
            question baffled their crafty designs, and stopped their <lb/>
            mouths ; for malice prevented their confessing the truth, <lb/>
            that it came from heaven, and they were not bold enough <lb/>
            to deny it openly, because they feared the people.</p>
          <p>He then laid before them the parable of the two sons, <note type="footnote"> 1 Isa. Ivi. 7 ; Jer. vii. 11; Matt. xxi. 10—13; Mark xi. 15—17; Luke <lb/>

            whom their father sent to work in his vineyard; and who <lb/>
            began and ended their day so differently; for one obeyed <lb/>
            the will of his father, not in word, but in deed; while the <lb/>
            other disobeyed him, and showed his contempt of his father's <lb/>
            authority not by word of mouth, but by his actions.1</p>
          <p>The Lord also added the parable of the householder <lb/>
            which planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, <lb/>
            and went into a far country. Now these men took the <lb/>
            servants whom he had sent to receive the fruits of the <lb/>
            vineyard, and beat one, as Jeremiah; killed another, as <lb/>
            Isaiah; stoned another, as Naboth and Zacharias; and, <lb/>
            lastly, crucified the Son of God. The servants suc­ <lb/>
            cessively sent typify the law, the psalms, and the pro­ <lb/>
            phecies ; by whose teaching men might learn to do <lb/>
            right. But the messengers are beaten and driven away, <lb/>
            when the word is despised, or, what is worse, blasphemed. <lb/>
            He who tramples under foot the SOIl of God, and does <lb/>
            despite unto the Spirit of grace, kills, as far as he is <lb/>
            able, the heir to the vineyard. When the wicked hus­ <lb/>
            bandman is destroyed, the vineyard is given to another; <lb/>
            while the proud lose the gift of grace, the humble receive <lb/>
            it.2</p>
          <p>Jesus spake a third parable unto them, of a certain <lb/>
            king which made a marriage for his son; and when they <lb/>
            that were bidden to the wedding made light of it, he sent <lb/>
            forth his armies, and punished them.3</p>
          <p>. The Pharisees with the Herodians tempted him, by <lb/>
            asking if it were lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or <lb/>
            not. When they had brought unto him a penny, Jesus <lb/>
            answered: " Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cræsar's, <lb/>
            and unto God the things that are God's.” 4</p>
          <p>The Sadducees also attempted to make him fall into <lb/>
            a snare, by describing the case of the woman who had <lb/>
            seven husbands, and asking him: " In the resurrection, <lb/>
            whose wife shall she be of them ?”Jesus answered: <lb/>
            " Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of <lb/>
            God. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxi. 23—32; Mark xi. 27—33; Luke xx. 1—8. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xxi. 33—41; Mark xii. 1—9; Luke xx. 9—16. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xxii <unclear>—7</unclear>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4Matt, xxii. 15—21; Mark xii. 13—17; Luke xx. 20—25. </note> <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven." <lb/>
            In this manner the good Master inspires the children of <lb/>
            the church with confidence, that, at the resurrection, they <lb/>
            will enjoy the vision of God, unspotted by corruption.1</p>
          <p>When he was questioned by the doctor of the law as to <lb/>
            which was the great commandment in it, he said: " Thou <lb/>
            shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all <lb/>
            thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great <lb/>
            commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou <lb/>
            shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two com­ <lb/>
            mandments bang all the law and the prophets." He now <lb/>
            asked the Pharisees whose son Christ was; and confounded <lb/>
            them, showing them that he was the Lord of David, and thus <lb/>
            put them to silence so effectually, that no man " durst, <lb/>
            from that day forth, ask him any more questions;" but <lb/>
            now they began openly to take steps to deliver him into the <lb/>
            hands of the Romans.2 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, <lb/>
            and to his disciples: " The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in <lb/>
            Moses’ seat; all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, <lb/>
            that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they <lb/>
            say and do not. For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous <lb/>
            to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they them­ <lb/>
            selves will not move them with one of their fingers. But <lb/>
            all their works they do to be seen of men; they make broad <lb/>
            their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their gar­ <lb/>
            ments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the <lb/>
            chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, <lb/>
            and to be called of men, Rabbi. But be not ye called <lb/>
            Rabbi; for one is your Master, and all ye are brethren. <lb/>
            And call no man your father upon the earth; for one is <lb/>
            your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called <lb/>
            masters; for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that <lb/>
            is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever <lb/>
            shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble <lb/>
            himself shall be exalted. Woe unto you, Scribes and <lb/>
            Pharisees, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven <lb/>
            against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer <lb/>
            ye them that are entering to go in." In this manner Jesus <lb/>
            uttered many things for the benefit of mankind, teaching <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxii. 23—30; Mark xii. 18—27; Luke xx. 27—36. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xxii. 34—46; Mark xii. 28—37; Luke xx. 41—44. </note> <pb n="59"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XV.]</note><lb/>
            the simple, but confounding the hypocrites. He spoke <lb/>
            of those who swear by the temple, and by the gold that <lb/>
            is in the temple; of the altar, and the gifts that are <lb/>
            thereon; of the divine mercy, which had sent unto them <lb/>
            prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and of the cruelty <lb/>
            of the Jews, which was exhibited in the various kinds of <lb/>
            death which they inflicted upon those who were sent from <lb/>
            God. He mourned over Jerusalem, lamenting, not the <lb/>
            buildings, but the inhabitants. Twice he repeated, in a <lb/>
            sorrowful tone: " 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem! which slew the <lb/>
            prophets, and would not repent of her wickedness.” 1</p>
          <p>On Jesus departing from the temple, and his disciples <lb/>
            pointing to the magnificent buildings, he answered: <lb/>
            " There shall not be left one stone upon another, that <lb/>
            shall not be thrown down." And as he sat upon the <lb/>
            Mount of Olives, his disciples privately questioned him, as <lb/>
            Matthew and Mark affirm, about the time and the signs <lb/>
            of this predicted destruction. To their inquiry as to when <lb/>
            the end of the world should be, he answered that many <lb/>
            great calamities would come to pass before that day, wars <lb/>
            between nation and nation, earthquakes in divers places, <lb/>
            pestilences, and famines; fearful sights from heaven, and <lb/>
            great signs. He foretold many things relating to the per­ <lb/>
            secutions they would have to suffer, and to his own coming <lb/>
            on the earth; warning the faithful, when they were delivered <lb/>
            up, to take no thought beforehand what they should speak, <lb/>
            but in their patience to possess their souls. He predicted <lb/>
            that Jerusalem would be compassed with an army, and then <lb/>
            woe unto them that are with child; that they would fall <lb/>
            by the edge of the sword, or be led away captive into all <lb/>
            nations; that there would be signs in heaven; and that <lb/>
            they would see him coming in a cloud with power and great <lb/>
            glory. " Then look up," said he, " for your redemption <lb/>
            draweth nigh." Forbidding drunkenness and the cares of <lb/>
            this life, he exhorted them to watch and to pray always. <lb/>
            He rebuked the scribes for their pride, and declared that <lb/>
            the widow who threw two mites into the treasury had cast <lb/>
            in more than they all.2</p>
          <p>In the parable of the fig-tree, he teaches us how the end <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt, xxiii.; Mark xii. 33—40; Luke xx. 45—47. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt, xxiv.; Mark xii. 38—44; xiii.; Luke xx. 45—47; xxi. 1—36. </note> <pb n="60"/>

            of the world will come. He relates the parables of the ten <lb/>
            virgins, and of the householder who left his servants in <lb/>
            charge of his goods, and went into a far country; describes <lb/>
            the advent of the Son of man in his glory, and all the holy <lb/>
            angels with him; speaks of the sheep that are to be set on <lb/>
            his right hand, separated from the goats that are to be <lb/>
            placed on his left; of the retribution of the wicked, who <lb/>
            are to go away into everlasting punishment; and of the <lb/>
            reward of the righteous, who are to go away into life <lb/>
            eternal.1</p>

          <p>Now, the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, <lb/>
            the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him: "Where <lb/>
            wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Pass­ <lb/>
            over?" And he said unto Peter and John: " Go ye into <lb/>
            the city, to a certain man, whom one bearing a pitcher of <lb/>
            water shall point out to you; follow him into the house <lb/>
            where he entereth in, and say ye to the good man of the <lb/>
            house: Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the <lb/>
            Passover with my disciples ? And he will shew you a large <lb/>
            upper room furnished; there make ready." And they went <lb/>
            forth, and found as he had said unto them; and they made <lb/>
            ready the Passover. And in the evening, he came with the <lb/>
            twelve, and as they sat he said unto them : " With desire I <lb/>
            have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. <lb/>
            For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until-it be <lb/>
            fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ”2 According to St. John,3 <lb/>
            the supper being ended, the devil having now put into the <lb/>
            heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus, <lb/>
            knowing that the Father had given all things into his <lb/>
            hands, and that he was come from God and went to God, <lb/>
            rose from supper, and laid aside his garments, and took <lb/>
            a towel, and girded himself. After that, he poured water <lb/>
            into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to <lb/>
            wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. After <lb/>
            lie had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and <lb/>
            was set down again, he said unto them: " Know ye what I <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxiv. 32, 33; xxv.; Mark xiii. 28, 29 ; Luke xix. 11—27. I </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xxvi. 17—20; Mark xiv. 12—17; Luke xxii. 7—16. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 John xiii. 1—20. </note> <pb n="61"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVI.]</note><lb/>
            have done to you ? Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye <lb/>
            say well; for so I am. If I, then, your Lord and Master, <lb/>
            have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's <lb/>
            feet." And so on, until he says: "He that receiveth me, <lb/>
            receiveth him that sent me."</p>
          <p>Saint Matthew relates that, as his disciples did eat, Jesus <lb/>
            said: " Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall <lb/>
            betray me." And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began <lb/>
            every one of them to say: " Lord, is it I?" And be <lb/>
            answered and said: “ He that dippeth his hand with me in <lb/>
            the dish, the same shall betray me.” And, as they were <lb/>
            eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and <lb/>
            gave it to the disciples, and said: " Take, eat; this is my <lb/>
            body." And taking the cup, he gave thanks, and gave it to <lb/>
            them, saying: " Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of <lb/>
            the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remis­ <lb/>
            sion of sins. But I say unto you: I will not drink hence­ <lb/>
            forth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink <lb/>
            it new with you in my Father's kingdom."1</p>
          <p>The Lord, on the night when he was delivered up, prayed <lb/>
            three times; to show us that we should pray to be par­ <lb/>
            doned for our past sins, to be protected from present <lb/>
            evils, and to be warned against future perils; addressing <lb/>
            all our prayers to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost. It is also to be remarked that as the temptation <lb/>
            of desire is triple, so is also the temptation of fear: lust <lb/>
            of the flesh, lust of the eyes, worldly ambition; fear of <lb/>
            death, fear of shame, fear of pain. Against all which he <lb/>
            teaches us that we ought to fortify ourselves by prayer. <lb/>
            For which reason we understand why the Lord prayed three <lb/>
            times on account of the triple temptation of his passion.</p>
          <p>That great divine, St. John, relates that Jesus, after he <lb/>
            had washed the feet of Peter, who reluctantly submitted, <lb/>
            and the other apostles, obscurely pointed out his betrayer by <lb/>
            referring to the mysterious prophecies contained in Scrip­ <lb/>
            ture, saying: " He that eateth bread with me will lift up <lb/>
            his heel against me." Afterwards, when he had determined <lb/>
            to make him better known, he was troubled in spirit, and <lb/>
            testified, and said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, that <lb/>
            one of you shall betray me.” Then the disciples looked <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt, xxvi 21—29; Mark xiv. 18—25; Luke xxii. 17—23. </note> <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            one on another, doubting of whom he spake. And Simon <lb/>
            Peter beckoned to John, who was leaning on Jesus' <lb/>
            bosom, and John asked him: " Lord, who is it?” Jesus <lb/>
            answered: "He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I <lb/>
            have dipped it." And when he had dipped the sop, he <lb/>
            gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. And after the <lb/>
            sop, Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him. <lb/>
            " That thou doest, do quickly." Now no man at the table <lb/>
            knew for what intent he spake this unto him. He then <lb/>
            went immediately out; and it was night. Therefore, when <lb/>
            he was gone out, Jesus said: " Now is the Son of man <lb/>
            glorified, and God is glorified in him." And many other <lb/>
            words of deep meaning spake Jesus, concerning the true <lb/>
            love of God and of one's neighbour, the unity of the Tri­ <lb/>
            nity, Peter's denying him thrice, and the coming of the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost to comfort them; on the observance of God's com­ <lb/>
            mandments, and the rewards prepared for the righteous; of <lb/>
            the persecutions of the faithful, and the inevitable condem­ <lb/>
            nation of the wicked; the dispersion of his disciples; and his <lb/>
            own passion, now nigh at hand.</p>
          <p>When Jesus had finished this incomparable discourse, he <lb/>
            lifted up his eyes to heaven, and audibly addressed a com­ <lb/>
            passionate prayer to his Father on behalf of his disciples and <lb/>
            all those that should believe in God through their word. <lb/>
            In this prayer the merciful speaker implored his Father to <lb/>
            grant us much more than our human frailty would ever <lb/>
            presume to ask.1</p>
          <p>Then, according to St. Luke, there was a strife among his <lb/>
            disciples, which of them should be accounted the greatest; <lb/>
            but their heavenly Teacher recalled them to a sense of <lb/>
            humility by his example and sayings. He thus kindly put <lb/>
            a stop to the contention among his weak-minded disciples, <lb/>
            declaring that his love for them led him to be their servant. <lb/>
            lie also promised a kingdom to those who had continued <lb/>
            with him in his temptations; and, after further discourse <lb/>
            he said to Peter, when rashly boasting: " Simon, behold, <lb/>
            Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as <lb/>
            wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; <lb/>
            and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." <lb/>
            And he said unto him: " Lord, I am ready to go with thee, <note type="footnote"> 1 John xiii. 18—xvii. 26. </note> <pb n="63"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVII.]</note><lb/>
            both into prison and to death." Jesus answered: "I tell <lb/>
            thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before that <lb/>
            thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me." And he said <lb/>
            unto them: " When I sent you without purse, and scrip, <lb/>
            and shoes, lacked ye anything?" And they said: " No­ <lb/>
            thing." Then said he unto them: "But now, he that hath <lb/>
            a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that <lb/>
            hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one." <lb/>
            And they said: " Behold, here are two swords." And he <lb/>
            said: " It is enough.”1</p>

          <p>AND when they had sung an hymn, as Matthew and <lb/>
            Mark relate, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <lb/>
            Then saith Jesus unto them: " All ye shall be offended <lb/>
            because of me this night." And they came to a place <lb/>
            called Gethsemane, which signifies the valley of fat things, <lb/>
            or of fatness; and he saith unto the disciples: "Sit ye <lb/>
            here, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." And he <lb/>
            taketh with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and <lb/>
            began to be sore amazed and sorrowful, and very heavy. <lb/>
            And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and <lb/>
            kneeled down and prayed, saying: "Father, if thou be <lb/>
            willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will, <lb/>
            but thine, be done." And there appeared an angel unto <lb/>
            him from heaven, strengthening him; and being in an agony, <lb/>
            he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, <lb/>
            drops of blood, falling down to the ground. We under­ <lb/>
            stand that on the other side of the brook Cedron, there <lb/>
            was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. <lb/>
            Judas also knew the place; so, having received a band of <lb/>
            men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, he <lb/>
            came thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons. And <lb/>
            forthwith he came to Jesus, and said: “ Hail, master; and <lb/>
            , kissed him." Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, <lb/>
            and took him. Then Jesus, as St. John informs us, said <lb/>
            unto them: "Whom seek ye?" They answered him: <lb/>
            " Jesus of Nazareth." As soon as be had said: "I am <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xxii. 24—38. </note> <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            he," they went backward, and fell to the ground, and so <lb/>
            on.1</p>
          <p>St. Luke tells us that, when they which were about him <lb/>
            saw what would follow, they said unto him: " Lord, shall <lb/>
            we smite with the sword ?” Then Peter smote the high <lb/>
            priest's servant (Malchus), and cut off his right ear. <lb/>
            Jesus answered their question by saying: " Suffer ye thus <lb/>
            far." And he immediately added, addressing Peter, who <lb/>
            had made use of the sword, as St. Matthew records: " Put <lb/>
            up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the <lb/>
            sword shall perish by the sword. Thinkest thou that I <lb/>
            cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give <lb/>
            me more than twelve (thousand) legions of angels ? But <lb/>
            how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must <lb/>
            be?” We may add to these words what St. John tells <lb/>
            us he said also in this place: " The cup which my Father <lb/>
            hath given me, shall I not drink it ? " Then, as St. Luke <lb/>
            says, he touched the ear of Malchus, and healed him. In <lb/>
            that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes: "Are ye <lb/>
            come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves for to <lb/>
            take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and <lb/>
            ye laid no hold on me. But this is your hour and the <lb/>
            power of darkness." Then all the disciples forsook him and <lb/>
            fied. One young man followed him having a linen cloth cast <lb/>
            about his naked body; and when they laid hold on him, he <lb/>
            left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. The captain, <lb/>
            with his band, and the officers of the Jews, came among the <lb/>
            crowd, and they bound our Saviour, and led him away to <lb/>
            Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, and high <lb/>
            priest that same year.2</p>
          <p>But Peter followed him afar off, unto the high priest's <lb/>
            palace, and went into the hall, to see the end, and there he <lb/>
            sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire, for it <lb/>
            was cold. Now this fire was kindled in the midst of the <lb/>
            hall, and when the servants had seated themselves round <lb/>
            it, Peter placed himself among them. St. Peter is to be <lb/>
            regarded with great veneration for following the Lord in <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxvi. 30—50 ; Mark xiv. 26—46; Luke xxii. 39—48; John <lb/>

            spite of his fear. It was natural for him to fear; his follow­ <lb/>
            ing his Master was a token of devotion; his denial, of deceit; <lb/>
            his repentance, of faith.1</p>
          <p>Now the chief priests and all the council sought false <lb/>
            witness against Jesus, to put him to death; but found none, <lb/>
            though many false witnesses came. When Jesus held his <lb/>
            peace, the high priest said unto him: “I adjure thee, by <lb/>
            the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, <lb/>
            the Son of God." Jesus said unto him: " Thou hast said." <lb/>
            Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying: " He hath <lb/>
            spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses? <lb/>
            Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think <lb/>
            ye ? " They answered: " He is guilty of death." Then did <lb/>
            they spit in his face, and strike him with the palms of their <lb/>
            hands ; some began to cover his face, others buffeted him, <lb/>
            saying: " Prophesy unto us, thou Christ; who is he that <lb/>
            smote thee ? ” We understand that the Lord suffered all <lb/>
            these things during the night he passed in the house of <lb/>
            the chief priest, into which he was first led; there, also. <lb/>
            Peter was tempted, while all these insults were offered to <lb/>
            the Lord. According to St. Mark, the triple denial of St. <lb/>
            Peter was begun before the first crowing of the cock, and <lb/>
            finished before the cock crew again. The three other evan­ <lb/>
            gelists relate that, before the first crowing, St. Peter had <lb/>
            showed all these signs of grief and fear. Then Peter <lb/>
            called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him: " Before <lb/>
            the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice." And be went <lb/>
            out, and wept bitterly.2</p>
          <p>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and his <lb/>
            doctrine. Jesus answered him: " I spake openly to the <lb/>
            world, I plainly taught in the synagogue and in the temple, <lb/>
            whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said <lb/>
            nothing. Why askest thou me ? Ask them which heard <lb/>
            me, what I have said unto them; behold, they know what <lb/>
            I said." And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers <lb/>
            which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his band, <lb/>
            saying: “Answerest thou the high priest so?" Jesus <lb/>
            answered him : “ If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxvi. 53; Mark xiv. 54; Luke xxii. 54—62; John xviii. 15, 18. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Matt. xxvi. 5.9—75; Mark xiv. 55—72; Luke xxii. 56 —65; John <lb/>

            evil; but if well, why smitest thou me ? " Now Annas had <lb/>
            sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.1</p>
          <p>When the morning was come, as Matthew relates,2 <lb/>
            all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel <lb/>
            against Jesus to put him to death; and when they had bound <lb/>
            him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius <lb/>
            Pilate, the governor. St. Luke3 has given an account of <lb/>
            what happened to our Lord about dawn, when the men <lb/>
            that held him mocked him and smote him; and when <lb/>
            they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face; and <lb/>
            many things blasphemously spake they against him. And <lb/>
            as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief <lb/>
            priests, and the scribes came together, and led him into <lb/>
            their council, saying: " If thou art the Christ, tell us." And <lb/>
            be said unto them : " If I tell you, ye will not believe ; and <lb/>
            if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. <lb/>
            Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the <lb/>
            power of God." Then said they all: " Art thou, then, the <lb/>
            Son of God?" And he said unto them: “Ye say that I <lb/>
            am." And they said: "What need we any further witness ? <lb/>
            for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth." And <lb/>
            the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto <lb/>
            Pilate. Luke has recounted these circumstances; but <lb/>
            Matthew and Mark have related all that befell our Lord <lb/>
            until morning; afterwards they return to their account <lb/>
            of Peter's denial; and when this is finished, they go back to <lb/>
            what took place early in the morning, and continue their <lb/>
            narrative of all that happened to our Saviour from that <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>St. John4 says: then led they Jesus to Caiaphas,5 <lb/>
            unto the hall of judgment [praetorium] : and it was early; <lb/>
            and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest <lb/>
            they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover. <lb/>
            But the base crowds assembled there, bringing the Lord <lb/>
            with them, as if he were already convicted, and, with the con­ <lb/>
            sent of Caiaphas, to whom it had before appeared expedient <lb/>
            that Jesus should die, no delay was allowed to intervene <lb/>
            before he was delivered to Pilate to be condemned. <note type="footnote"> 1 John xviii. 19—24.</note> <note type="footnote">a Chap. xxvii. 1, 2; Mark xv. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Chap. xxii. 63—xxiii. 1.</note> <note type="footnote">4 John xviii. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 According to St. John, from Caiaphas. </note> <pb n="67"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">CHAP. XVII.]</note>St. Matthew1 is the only evangelist who mentions the <lb/>
            death of the traitor Judas, which he does in these words: <lb/>
            " Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he <lb/>
            was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the <lb/>
            thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying: <lb/>
            ‘I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.' <lb/>
            And they said, ‘What is that to us ? see thou to that.' And <lb/>
            he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, <lb/>
            and went and hanged himself. The chief priests took the <lb/>
            silver pieces, and said: ‘ It is not lawful for to put them <lb/>
            into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.' And <lb/>
            they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, <lb/>
            to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field is called, ' Acel­ <lb/>
            dama,’ that is, the field of blood, unto this day. Then <lb/>
            was fulfilled all that had been foretold long before."2</p>
          <p>And now the holy evangelists take pains to describe, in <lb/>
            regular order, all that happened to our Lord before Pilate;. <lb/>
            facts which the studious reader ought himself to investigate <lb/>
            with diligence, and put each in its proper place. During <lb/>
            the passion of Christ, many things were said, and many <lb/>
            questions answered, as Augustine, bishop of Hippo, judi­ <lb/>
            ciously remarks, in the third book of his work, called: “The <lb/>
            Harmony of the Evangelists," from which each of the holy <lb/>
            writers selected what seemed to him expedient, and inserted <lb/>
            in his history what, in his judgment, sufficed. Matthew <lb/>
            relates that Jesus stood before the governor, who, asking <lb/>
            him if he were the king of the Jews, he answered: ". Thou <lb/>
            sayest." Pilate then went out, as we read in the gospel <lb/>
            according to St. John, to those who would not enter <lb/>
            the judgment-hall, and said: " What accusation bring <lb/>
            you against this man?" They answered: " If he were <lb/>
            not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto <lb/>
            thee." Then said Pilate unto them: " Take ye him, and judge <lb/>
            him according to your law." The Jews said unto him: “It <lb/>
            is not lawful for us to put any man to death." Then Pilate <lb/>
            entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and <lb/>
            said unto him : "Art thou the king of the Jews ? " Jesus <lb/>
            answered: " Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others <note type="footnote"> 1 Chap. xxvii. 3—9; Acts i. 18, 19. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 St. Matthew quotes Jeremiah, in whose prophecy no such passage is <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            tell it thee of me ? ” Pilate answered: “Am I a Jew ? <lb/>
            Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee <lb/>
            unto me. What hast thou done ? " Jesus answered: " My <lb/>
            kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this <lb/>
            world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be <lb/>
            delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from <lb/>
            hence." Pilate therefore said unto him : " Art thou a king, <lb/>
            then ? " Jesus answered: " Thou sayest that I am a king. <lb/>
            To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the <lb/>
            world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every <lb/>
            one that is of the truth heareth my voiced Pilate saith <lb/>
            unto him : " What is truth ? " And when he had said this, <lb/>
            he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them: " I <lb/>
            find in him no fault at all." Then, as Luke relates, the Jews, <lb/>
            becoming furious, began to accuse him, saying: " We found <lb/>
            this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give <lb/>
            tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a king." <lb/>
            And when, as Matthew says, he was accused of the chief <lb/>
            priests and elders of the people, he answered nothing; <lb/>
            so great was his meekness! Then said Pilate unto him: <lb/>
            “Hearest thou not how many things they witness against <lb/>
            thee?” And he answered him never a word; insomuch <lb/>
            that the governor marvelled greatly. When Pilate was <lb/>
            sat down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, <lb/>
            saying: " Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for <lb/>
            I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of <lb/>
            him." St. Luke writes that, when Pilate said: “ I find no <lb/>
            fault in this man," the Jews were the more fierce, saying: <lb/>
            “ He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all <lb/>
            Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place." When Pilate <lb/>
            heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean; <lb/>
            and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's juris­ <lb/>
            diction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at <lb/>
            Jerusalem at that time. And when Herod saw Jesus, he <lb/>
            was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see him of a long <lb/>
            season, because he had heard many things of him, and he <lb/>
            hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. Then he <lb/>
            questioned with him in many words; but he answered him <lb/>
            nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood, and <lb/>
            vehemently accused him. And Herod, with his men of war, <lb/>
            set him at naught, and arrayed him in a white robe, and <pb n="69"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVII.]</note><lb/>
            sent him again to Pilate. And the same day Pilate and <lb/>
            Herod were made friends together, for before they were at <lb/>
            enmity between themselves.</p>
          <p>And Pilate, when he had called together the rulers and <lb/>
            the people, said unto them: “Ye have brought this man <lb/>
            unto me, as one that perverteth the people; and, behold, <lb/>
            I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in <lb/>
            him, touching those things whereof ye accuse him. No, nor <lb/>
            yet Herod; for I sent you to him, and, lo, nothing worthy <lb/>
            of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him <lb/>
            and release him." For he knew that for envy they had <lb/>
            delivered him. Now at that feast the governor was wont <lb/>
            to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. <lb/>
            Therefore, when they were gathered together, he said unto <lb/>
            them: " Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas, <lb/>
            or Jesus which is called Christ ? " But the chief priests <lb/>
            persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, <lb/>
            and destroy Jesus. Now Barabbas was a notable prisoner, <lb/>
            who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, <lb/>
            was cast into prison. The governor said unto them: <lb/>
            " Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? " <lb/>
            They said: "Barabbas." Pilate saith unto them: “What <lb/>
            shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ ? ” They <lb/>
            all said unto him : " Let him be crucified.” And the governor <lb/>
            said: “ Why ? what evil bath he done ? " But they cried out <lb/>
            the more, saying: " Let him be crucified." When Pilate saw <lb/>
            that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was <lb/>
            made, he took water, and washed his hands before the mul­ <lb/>
            titude, saying: " I am innocent of the blood of this just <lb/>
            person; see ye to it." Then answered all the people: " His <lb/>
            blood be on us, and on our children." Then released he <lb/>
            Barabbas unto them, and took Jesus, and scourged him." <lb/>
            St. John informs us, that the soldiers platted a crown of <lb/>
            thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a <lb/>
            purple robe, and coming up to him, said: " Hail, King <lb/>
            of the Jews!" And they smote him with their hands. <lb/>
            Pilate went forth again, and saith unto them: " Behold, I <lb/>
            bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no <lb/>
            fault in him.” Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown <lb/>
            of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto <lb/>
            them: " Behold the man !” When the chief priests, there­ <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            fore, and officers saw him, they cried out, saying: " Crucify <lb/>
            him, crucify him." Pilate saith unto them: " Take ye him, <lb/>
            and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.” The Jews <lb/>
            answered him: " We have a law, and by our law he ought <lb/>
            to die, because he made himself the Son of God." When, <lb/>
            therefore, Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid; <lb/>
            and went again into the judgment-hall, and saith unto <lb/>
            Jesus: "Whence art thou?" But Jesus gave him no <lb/>
            answer. Pilate therefore said unto him: “Speakest thou <lb/>
            not unto me ? Knowest thou not that I have power to <lb/>
            crucify thee, and have power to release thee ? " Jesus <lb/>
            answered: " Thou couldest have no power against me, except <lb/>
            it were given thee from above; therefore, he that bath <lb/>
            delivered me unto thee bath the greater sin." From thence­ <lb/>
            forth Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out, <lb/>
            saying: “If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's <lb/>
            friend: whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against <lb/>
            Cæsar.”</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN Pilate, therefore, heard that saying, he brought <lb/>
            Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a <lb/>
            place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, <lb/>
            •" Gabbatha." And it was the preparation of the Passover, <lb/>
            and about the sixth hour; and he saith unto the Jews: <lb/>
            " Behold your king! " But they cried out: " Away with <lb/>
            him, away with him, crucify him." Pilate saith unto them: <lb/>
            “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The chief priests answered: <lb/>
            “ We have no king but Cresar.” Then delivered he him <lb/>
            therefore unto them to be crucified.1</p>
          <p>Such is the account John gives us of what Pilate <lb/>
            said and did; things that Matthew and Mark, omitting <lb/>
            at first, afterwards recollected. Thus Matthew says: <lb/>
            “Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the <lb/>
            common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band; <lb/>
            and they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. <lb/>
            And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it <lb/>
            upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they <lb/>
            bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying: " Hail, <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxvii. 11—26; Mark xv. 1—15; Luke xxiii. 1—25; John <lb/>
            xviii. 28—40. </note> <pb n="71"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVIII.]</note><lb/>
            King of the Jews!" And they spit upon him, and took <lb/>
            the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that they <lb/>
            had mocked him, they took the robe (or the purple, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to St. Mark) off from him, and put his own raiment <lb/>
            on him, and led him away to crucify him. John relates <lb/>
            that Jesus, " bearing his cross, went forth into a place <lb/>
            called Golgotha," or Mount Calvary. " And they laid hold <lb/>
            upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, <lb/>
            the father of Alexander and Rufus," a fact mentioned by <lb/>
            three evangelists; " and on him they laid the cross, that he <lb/>
            might bear it" to the place just named.</p>
          <p>They crucified Jesus in Golgotha, between two malefac­ <lb/>
            tors, and gave him wine mingled with myrrh; and set up <lb/>
            over his head his accusation written: " This is Jesus, the <lb/>
            King of the Jews.” And this title was written in Greek, <lb/>
            and Latin, and Hebrew.2</p>
          <p>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took <lb/>
            his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; <lb/>
            and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven <lb/>
            from the top throughout. They said therefore among them­ <lb/>
            selves : " Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it <lb/>
            shall be;" that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith: <lb/>
            " They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture <lb/>
            they did cast lots." 3</p>
          <p>The rulers and the scribes railed on him as he hanged <lb/>
            on the cross, wagging their heads, and saying: “Ah! <lb/>
            thou that destroyest the temple of God, and buildest it <lb/>
            in three days, save thyself.4 If thou be the Son of God, <lb/>
            come down from the cross."</p>
          <p>We learn from Luke that one of the malefactors which <lb/>
            were hanged, railed on him, saying: " If thou be Christ, <lb/>
            save thyself and us." But the other rebuked him, saying : <lb/>
            "Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same <lb/>
            condemnation ? And we indeed justly, for we receive the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxvii. 27—33; Mark xv. 16—22; Luke xxiii. 26; John xix. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> a Matt. xxvii. 34—38; Mark xv. 23, 25—27; Luke xxiii. 32, 33, 36, 38; <lb/>

            due reward of our deeds; but this man bath done nothing <lb/>
            amiss." And he said unto Jesus: "Lord, remember me, <lb/>
            when thou comest into thy kingdom." And Jesus said <lb/>
            unto him: “Verily I say unto thee: To-day shalt thou be <lb/>
            with me in Paradise.”1</p>
          <p>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his <lb/>
            mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Mag­ <lb/>
            dalene. When Jesus, therefore, saw his mother, and the <lb/>
            disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his <lb/>
            mother: " Woman, behold thy son." Then saith he to the <lb/>
            disciple: "Behold thy mother.” And from that hour that <lb/>
            disciple took her unto his own horned</p>
          <p>From the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole <lb/>
            land until the ninth hour, and at the ninth hour Jesus <lb/>
            cried with a loud voice, saying: " Eli, Eli, lama-zababdani ?" <lb/>
            that is to say: " My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken <lb/>
            me ? ” After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now <lb/>
            accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith: <lb/>
            “I thirst." Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar; and <lb/>
            they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, <lb/>
            and put it to his mouth. And when Jesus had cried with a <lb/>
            loud voice, according to Luke, he said: " Father, into the <lb/>
            hands I commend my spirit." 3</p>
          <p>At last, according to John, when Jesus had received <lb/>
            the vinegar, he said: "It is finished;” and he bowed his <lb/>
            head, and gave up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the <lb/>
            temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and <lb/>
            the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves <lb/>
            were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept, <lb/>
            arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and <lb/>
            went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. Now <lb/>
            when the centurion and they that were with him, watching <lb/>
            Jesus, saw the earthquake and those things that were done, <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xxiii. 37, 39—43. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 John xix. 25—27. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Matt. xxvii. 45—49 ; Mark xv. 33—36; Luke xxiii. 44—46 ; John <lb/>

            in the twenty-second psalm, ver. 1 : Eli, Eli, lama azabtani ! It seems <lb/>
            to have been the author's intention to have given them in this latter <lb/>
            form. </note> <pb n="73"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIX.]</note><lb/>
            they feared greatly, saying: " Truly this was the Son of <lb/>
            God." And many women which followed Jesus from <lb/>
            Galilee, ministering unto him, stood afar off; among whom <lb/>
            were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and <lb/>
            Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children. And all the <lb/>
            people that came together to that sight, beholding the things <lb/>
            which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.1</p>
          <p>When the even was come, Joseph of Arimathea, an <lb/>
            honourable counsellor, a good man and a just, who also <lb/>
            himself waited for the kingdom of God (being a disciple of <lb/>
            Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews), went boldly unto <lb/>
            Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus ; and the governor, when <lb/>
            he knew of the centurion that he was already dead, gave <lb/>
            Joseph leave to take it. Joseph came, therefore, and <lb/>
            took the body of Jesus, and having bought fine linen, he <lb/>
            wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre. <lb/>
            And there came also Nicodemus, and brought a mixture of <lb/>
            myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then <lb/>
            took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes <lb/>
            with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now <lb/>
            in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and <lb/>
            in the garden a new sepulchre, hewn out of a rock, wherein <lb/>
            was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, <lb/>
            because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was <lb/>
            nigh at hand. The women, whose names we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, and whose affection for him was the most ardent, <lb/>
            sat over against the sepulchre, and beheld where he was <lb/>
            laid.2</p>
          <p>Now the next day, the priests and Pharisees falsely <lb/>
            reported to Pilate some of the words of the Lord, and <lb/>
            having obtained his consent, they sealed the stone, and <lb/>
            placed soldiers all round to keep watch over the sepulchre.3</p>

            several circumstances which took place at the resurrection <lb/>
            of our Lord, which would appear to be irreconcileable, <lb/>
            unless the order in which they happened is carefully con­ <lb/>
            sidered. It may, therefore, be well to consult what Augus­ <lb/>
            tine, an enlightened commentator on the holy Scriptures, <lb/>
            says upon this subject, in the third book of his " Harmony <lb/>
            of the Evangelists," which I shall quote in his own words. <lb/>
            Thus, after discussing several questions, be makes this de­ <lb/>
            claration : " I will endeavour, by God's help, to collect in <lb/>
            one continuous narration all the facts immediately con­ <lb/>
            nected with our Lord's resurrection, according to the <lb/>
            testimonies of the several evangelists, so far as they can be <lb/>
            arranged." 1</p>
          <p>They all agree in the coming [of the women] to the <lb/>
            sepulchre, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week; <lb/>
            before which, however, the facts which Matthew alone <lb/>
            relates bad occurred, viz., the great earthquake, the rolling <lb/>
            back of the stone, the consternation of the keepers, some of <lb/>
            whom lay near the spot like dead men. According to John, <lb/>
            Mary Magdalene came, no doubt with the other women <lb/>
            who ministered to our Lord, but her affection for him was <lb/>
            more ardent; and therefore, with good reason, John makes <lb/>
            particular mention of her, passing over in silence the names <lb/>
            of those who, according to the statements of the other <lb/>
            evangelists, were with her. She came, therefore, and when <lb/>
            she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, before <lb/>
            she had examined anything attentively, not doubting that <lb/>
            the body of Jesus was removed, as John tells us, she ran <lb/>
            to announce to himself, as well as to Simon Peter, what <lb/>
            she had seen. This John was the disciple whom Jesus <lb/>
            loved. And they both began to run towards the sepulchre, <lb/>
            and John, coming first to the place, stooped down, and <lb/>
            saw the linen clothes lying, yet went he not in. Then <lb/>
            cometh Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, <lb/>
            and seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin that was <lb/>
            about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrap­ <lb/>
            ped together in a place by itself. Then John went in also, <lb/>
            and saw and believed what Mary had said, that they had <note type="footnote"> 1 St. August., de Consens. Evangel., iii. 69. The quotation from St. <lb/>

            taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre ; for as yet they <lb/>
            knew not the scripture, that be must rise again from the <lb/>
            dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own <lb/>
            home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping, <lb/>
            that is to say, before the spot where the tomb had been <lb/>
            hewn out of the rock, although within the space where the <lb/>
            women bad already entered. Now in that place there was <lb/>
            a garden, as John informs us. They then saw on their <lb/>
            right hand the angel who had rolled back the stone from <lb/>
            the door of the sepulchre ; and was sitting upon it. Of this <lb/>
            angel Matthew and Mark speak in the following terms: <lb/>
            “ Then said be unto the women: ‘ Fear not ye: for I <lb/>
            know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not <lb/>
            here; for be is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where <lb/>
            the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he <lb/>
            is risen from the dead; and, behold he goeth before you <lb/>
            into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.’” <lb/>
            What Mark relates does not differ from Matthew's narra­ <lb/>
            tive.</p>
          <p>As Mary wept on hearing these words, she stooped <lb/>
            down and looked into the sepulchre, and, as John informs <lb/>
            us, “ saw two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, <lb/>
            and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had <lb/>
            lain. They say unto her: ‘ Woman, why weepest thou?' <lb/>
            She saith unto them: ‘ Because they have taken away my <lb/>
            Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.'" We <lb/>
            must understand that the angels had risen, and that they <lb/>
            were seen standing, as Luke mentions, when they said to <lb/>
            the women who were afraid, and bowed down their faces to <lb/>
            the earth: " Why seek ye the living among the dead ? he <lb/>
            is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake unto you <lb/>
            when he was yet in Galilee, saying that the Son of man <lb/>
            must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be cru­ <lb/>
            cified, and the third day rise again." And they remembered <lb/>

          <p>After this, Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus <lb/>
            standing, as John tells us, and knew not that it was Jesus. <lb/>
            Jesus saith unto her : " Woman, why weepest thou? Whom <lb/>
            seekest thou?" She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith <note type="footnote"> • 1 Matt. xxviii. 1—7 ; Mark xvi. 1—7; Luke xxiv. 1—8; John xx. 1— <lb/>
            13. </note> <pb n="76"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            unto him: " Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where <lb/>
            thou hast laid him, and I will take him away." Jesus saith <lb/>
            unto her: " Mary.” She turned herself, and saith unto him : <lb/>
            "Rabboni," which is to say, " Master.” Jesus saith unto her: <lb/>
            “ Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father; <lb/>
            but go to my brethren, and say unto them : ‘ I ascend unto my <lb/>
            Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.' ” <lb/>
            She then departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, the <lb/>
            place where the garden lay before the cave in the rock, ac­ <lb/>
            companied by the other women, who, as Mark informs us, <lb/>
            “ trembled, and were amazed, neither said they anything <lb/>
            to any man." And as they went, behold, Jesus met them, <lb/>
            saying : " All hail." And they came, and clung to his feet, <lb/>
            and worshipped him. From these statements we gather, <lb/>
            that, during their visit to the tomb, they were twice <lb/>
            addressed by the angels, as well as by the fjord himself; <lb/>
            that is to say, the first time when Mary supposed him to <lb/>
            be the gardener, and afterwards when Jesus came to meet <lb/>
            them in the way. By appearing twice before these women, <lb/>
            lie confirmed their faith, and allayed their fears. He then <lb/>
            said unto them: " Be not afraid; go, tell my brethren, <lb/>
            that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me." <lb/>
            Mary Magdalene, therefore, came and told the disciples <lb/>
            that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these <lb/>
            things unto her; and not only unto her, but also to the <lb/>
            other women who are mentioned in the gospel of Luke. <lb/>
            They told these things unto the eleven disciples, and to <lb/>
            all the rest; and their words seemed to them as idle tales, <lb/>
            and they believed them not. Mark attests these facts. Indeed, <lb/>
            after he has described the state of these women, who went <lb/>
            out of the sepulchre trembling and amazed to such a degree <lb/>
            that they did not say anything to any man; he adds that, <lb/>
            when the Lord was risen he appeared first-early the first <lb/>
            day of the week-to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had <lb/>
            cast seven devils; and that she went and told them that had <lb/>
            been with him, as they mourned and wept, who, when they <lb/>
            had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, <lb/>
            believed not. Matthew inserts this additional circumstance <lb/>
            in his narrative, that, after the departure of the women <lb/>
            who had seen and heard all these things, some of the watch, <lb/>
            who had fallen to the ground as dead men, came into the <pb n="77"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIX.]</note><lb/>
            city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that <lb/>
            were done, that is to say, all that they had seen and known. <lb/>
            When the priests were assembled with the elders, and had <lb/>
            taken counsel, they gave large bribes unto the soldiers to <lb/>
            induce them to say that his disciples had stolen him away <lb/>
            while they slept; promising at the same time to secure them <lb/>
            from the anger of the governor, who had placed them there <lb/>
            to guard the tomb. The soldiers took the money, and did <lb/>
            as they were taught; and this saying is commonly reported <lb/>
            among the Jews until this day. Luke is the only evangelist <lb/>
            who does not say that our Saviour appeared to the women, <lb/>
            but only the angels. Now Matthew asserts that Jesus met <lb/>
            them on their return from the sepulchre. Mark also assures <lb/>
            us, as well as John, that he appeared first to Mary Magda­ <lb/>
            lene, but does not tell us how he appeared to her, while <lb/>
            John explains this.1</p>
          <p>As the four evangelists agree, in their faithful narratives, <lb/>
            on all that the Almighty Emmanuel did before his passion; <lb/>
            so they relate, in harmony with each other, his resurrection <lb/>
            and ascension, and inform us that the Lord was seen by <lb/>
            mortal eyes on ten occasions after he had risen from the dead : <lb/>
            once by the women at the sepulchre ; again, by these same <lb/>
            women in the way as they returned from the tomb; the <lb/>
            third time he appeared to Simon Peter; and if the evan­ <lb/>
            gelist has not informed us when or where the meeting took <lb/>
            place, he plainly declares that it did occur. The fourth <lb/>
            time, he appeared to the two disciples who were going to <lb/>
            a village called Emmaus, but in another form, that they <lb/>
            might not know him ; he accompanied them in the way as <lb/>
            a traveller, and inquired of them the cause of their sadness <lb/>
            and of their complaints. When he heard the lamentation of <lb/>
            Cleopas concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet <lb/>
            mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and <lb/>
            how they delivered him to be condemned to death, he <lb/>
            gently reproved them for being slow of heart to believe all <lb/>
            that the prophets had spoken; and beginning at Moses <lb/>
            and all the prophets, he expounded unto them the Scrip­ <lb/>
            tures. And they constrained him to accept of their <lb/>
            hospitality; and, as he sat at meat with them, he took <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxviii. 8—15 ; Mark xvi. 8—11 ; Luke xxiv. 9—12; John xx. <lb/>
            14-18. </note> <pb n="78"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And <lb/>
            while he was breaking the bread, he opened their eyes, that <lb/>
            they might know him; and as soon as they had recognized <lb/>
            him, he vanished out of their sight. His fifth appearance <lb/>
            was at Jerusalem when several of the disciples were assem­ <lb/>
            bled in the evening, as Luke and John inform us, but <lb/>
            Thomas was not among them. Jesus entered the place, <lb/>
            although they had shut the doors ["for fear of the Jews"], <lb/>
            shewed unto them his hands and his side, took a piece of <lb/>
            a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb, and did eat before <lb/>
            them. He then breathed on them, and said unto them: <lb/>
            "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." The sixth time that he <lb/>
            appeared was after eight days, when Thomas saw him, and <lb/>
            said: “ My Lord and my God." The seventh time he <lb/>
            shewed himself at the Sea of Tiberias, when seven of his <lb/>
            disciples, who were fishing, saw him in the morning, after a <lb/>
            night's toil, and ate bread and fish with him on the shore, <lb/>
            after the miraculous draught of 153 fishes. The eighth <lb/>
            time he appeared on a mountain in Galilee, according to <lb/>
            Matthew ; and when they saw him they worshipped him, but <lb/>
            some doubted. He then said unto them: " All power is <lb/>
            given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore, <lb/>
            and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the <lb/>
            Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching <lb/>
            them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded <lb/>
            you; and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the <lb/>
            world." His ninth visit, Mark tells us, was when he <lb/>
            appeared for the last time unto the eleven as they sat at <lb/>
            meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness <lb/>
            of heart. It is called the last time, because they were not <lb/>
            to be with him any longer on the earth. His tenth appear­ <lb/>
            ance, as we read in the narrative of Mark and Luke, took <lb/>
            place on the same day: the disciples saw him not here below, <lb/>
            but as he was ascending into heaven, taken up in a cloud. <lb/>
            Such was the number of times, that our Saviour is said in <lb/>
            the writings of the evangelists, to have been seen of man <lb/>
            before he ascended into heaven; that is to say, nine times <lb/>
            on earth, and once as he rose through the air; but, <lb/>
            as John says, all his acts are not recorded. And, indeed, <lb/>
            they had many opportunities of being in company with <lb/>
            him during the forty days that preceded his ascension, <pb n="79"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XX.]</note><lb/>
            although he did not remain with them throughout the <lb/>
            whole time. John informs us that, between the first day of <lb/>
            his resurrection and his next appearance, there was an <lb/>
            interval of eight days. In this manner, appearing during <lb/>
            those forty days, as often as he would, to whom he would, and <lb/>
            as he would, he confirmed his disciples in the belief of his <lb/>
            resurrection.1</p>

          <p>MARK and Luke mention our Lord's two last appear­ <lb/>
            ances, and relate all that was said and done. We read in <lb/>
            Mark that he upbraided the doubtful, for their hardness of <lb/>
            heart, but said unto those who were strong in the faith: " Go <lb/>
            ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. <lb/>
            He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he <lb/>
            that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall <lb/>
            follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out <lb/>
            devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take <lb/>
            up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not <lb/>
            hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall <lb/>
            recover." So then after the Lord Jesus had spoken <lb/>
            unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the <lb/>
            right hand of God. Moreover Luke at the end of his <lb/>
            Gospel says : " And he led them out as far as to Bethany, <lb/>
            and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came <lb/>
            to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and <lb/>
            carried up into heaven." 2 Again in the opening chapter of <lb/>
            the Acts of the Apostles, he speaks of the ascension in <lb/>
            these words : " And being assembled together with them, he <lb/>
            commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, <lb/>
            'ye have heard of file; for John truly baptized with water,. <lb/>
            but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many <lb/>
            days hence.' When they, therefore, were come together, <lb/>
            they asked of him, saying: ' Lord, wilt thou at this time <lb/>
            restore again the kingdom to Israel And he said unto <lb/>
            them : ‘ It is not for you to know the times or the seasons <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxviii. 16—20; Mark xvi. 12—19 ; Luke xxiv. 13—49 ; John. <lb/>

            which the Father bath put in his own power, but ye shall <lb/>
            receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; <lb/>
            and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and <lb/>
            in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts <lb/>
            of the earth.' And when he had spoken these things, while <lb/>
            they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out <lb/>
            of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward <lb/>
            heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in <lb/>
            white apparel, which also said: 'Te men of Galilee, why <lb/>
            stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same Jesus which is <lb/>
            taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner <lb/>
            as ye have seen him go into heaven.’ Then returned they <lb/>
            unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from <lb/>
            Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey." There, as Luke testi­ <lb/>
            fies, these faithful disciples rejoiced greatly in the triumph <lb/>
            of their heavenly Master, continued with one accord in <lb/>
            prayer and supplication, both in the temple and in an <lb/>
            upper room, and waited with confidence for the promise of <lb/>
            the Father, as Jesus had commanded them.1 All that they <lb/>
            had heard him say was fully proved to them by the miracles <lb/>
            which they saw performed before their own eyes. And, <lb/>
            indeed, as they had often heard from his own lips that he <lb/>
            should have to endure the most cruel sufferings during his <lb/>
            passion, and that he should rise again in triumph on the <lb/>
            third day; now they rejoiced to see the immortal Giver of <lb/>
            life overcome the sharpness of death, and triumph because <lb/>
            he is exalted above the heavens, and sits at the right hand <lb/>
            of the Father. Angels also appeared in white apparel, and, <lb/>
            addressing the men of Galilee, while filled with admiration <lb/>
            they looked steadfastly toward heaven, pointed out to them <lb/>
            the great joy both of angels and of men, and announced <lb/>
            that Jesus would re-appear at the end of the world to judge <lb/>
            all nations.2</p>
          <p>Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, <lb/>
            Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, <lb/>
            Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James, who <lb/>
            remained with the Lord Jesus unto the end, were called by <lb/>
            him the salt of the earth and the light of the world ; and <lb/>
            justly so, for they despised this world, in order to follow his <lb/>
            steps, and were rewarded by being appointed by God rulers <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xxiv. 52, 53; Act. Apost. i. 1—14.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Acts i. 10, 11. </note> <pb n="81"/>

            and judges of the earth. When this venerable company <lb/>
            was returned to Jerusalem, Peter, who was the first called <lb/>
            and the greatest in dignity among the apostles, stood up in <lb/>
            the midst of the disciples, who were about an hundred and <lb/>
            twenty in number. He began his address to them by <lb/>
            speaking of the fate of the traitor Judas, who, having hung <lb/>
            himself between heaven and earth, burst asunder in the <lb/>
            midst, and his bowels gushed out because he was unworthy <lb/>
            of a place in either; this happened after he had purchased <lb/>
            with the reward for betraying Christ, a field called <lb/>
            “Aceldalna,” that is to say, The field of blood. He then <lb/>
            reminded them that they were, as David had foretold, <lb/>
            to ordain another apostle in his room, that he might take <lb/>
            part in this heavenly ministry and apostleship. All, there­ <lb/>
            fore, adopted the proposal of their president, and in order to <lb/>
            complete the sacred number of the apostles they appointed <lb/>
            two, Joseph, surnamed Justus, and Matthias; and they gave <lb/>
            forth their lots,, after Peter had offered up a prayer, which <lb/>
            the rest confirmed, and the lot falling upon Matthias, he was <lb/>
            numbered with the eleven apostles.1</p>
          <p>These twelve apostles represent the hours of the day, and <lb/>
            the twelve months of the entire year, and bad been often <lb/>
            signified long before in dark sayings of the prophets <lb/>
            and patriarchs. They are held in reverence by all the nations <lb/>
            of the faithful, and justly regarded as the senators of heaven, <lb/>
            and the glorious princes of the church; because they are <lb/>
            grafted as fruitful branches into Christ, the true vine. In <lb/>
            the Lord's field, they faithfully followed his steps among <lb/>
            men, more especially by voluntary poverty; and having, as <lb/>
            companions and partakers of the same mysteries, shone <lb/>
            with the effulgence of miraculous powers, they now sit <lb/>
            together on celestial thrones, the righteous judges of the <lb/>
            twelve tribes of Israel. And as, while they were on earth, <lb/>
            they had without ceasing contended for the prize set before <lb/>
            them, and indefatigably laboured in the church, as Christ's <lb/>
            faithful vicars and witnesses, so now they shine as his <lb/>
            blessed co-heirs in heaven. <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts i. 3, 15—26. </note> <note type="footnote">VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote">G </note></p><pb n="82"/>

          </ab>
          <p>XXI. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, <lb/>
            and the faithful disciples were all with one accord in one <lb/>
            place, at the third hour of the day, suddenly there came <lb/>
            a sound from heaven, and the Holy Ghost descended in <lb/>
            the form of tongues, like as of fire, and sat upon each of <lb/>
            them, filling them with all wisdom and heavenly gifts. <lb/>
            0 how quick and skilful is the heavenly Artificer, the sweet <lb/>
            and vivifying helper of those souls which desire his unction! <lb/>
            This celestial fire, which did not consume, but illumine, <lb/>
            came down to inflame fully the hearts of the disciples, <lb/>
            and free them from the attractions of carnal pleasures, and <lb/>
            from the dread of punishment. It suddenly taught them <lb/>
            to speak with other tongues, strengthened their minds <lb/>
            by authority, and raised them to the summit of virtue, <lb/>
            against all the wiles of the enemy. The apostles spake <lb/>
            of the wonderful works of God in divers tongues, so <lb/>
            that strangers out of every nation under heaven were <lb/>
            amazed that these Galileans, who had never quitted their <lb/>
            native land, should speak so fluently in every language. <lb/>
            The Jews, full of envy, and confounded by this miracle, <lb/>
            and accustomed as they were to put a wrong construction <lb/>
            upon the words and works of Christ, asserted that these <lb/>
            men, who were showing forth the mighty works of God, <lb/>
            were full of new wine, which made them talk like madmen. <lb/>
            But Peter, who was indeed intoxicated with spiritual drink, <lb/>
            rose up against these perfidious men, spoke to them the <lb/>
            words of saving wisdom, treated eloquently of the in­ <lb/>
            carnation, the passion, and the resurrection of Christ, <lb/>
            and, with the help of the Holy Spirit, confounded the <lb/>
            multitude of the malicious. As he had once smitten <lb/>
            with the sword Malchus, and had cut off the ear of this <lb/>
            servant of the high priest, so with the spiritual word of <lb/>
            God he pierced the hearts of those who were carnally <lb/>
            slaves to the letter of the Mosaic law, and commanded the <lb/>
            neophytes to banish from their minds the recollection <lb/>
            of the ancient ceremonies and observances. These same <lb/>
            Jews who, shortly before, had so cruelly persecuted <lb/>
            the Messiah to death, were exhorted by St. Peter, in <lb/>
            a fervent address, to repent and to be baptized in <pb n="83"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXII.]</note><lb/>
            the name of Jesus Christ; and as he had been hitherto <lb/>
            accustomed to take fish from the sea by means of his net, <lb/>
            so now, by performing the sacred duties of a preacher, he <lb/>
            drew the wandering sinner from the depths of ignorance, <lb/>
            to set his feet on the solid ground of faith. In one day <lb/>
            he baptized three thousand of those who were converted, <lb/>
            and, putting on the new man, had cast off the old things <lb/>
            of a carnal life.1</p>

          <p>AND now, by God's help, I have compiled a plain narrative <lb/>
            of all that passed from the birth of Christ to the coming of <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost the Comforter; and have collected and briefly <lb/>

            gained from the accounts given by the fluent Augustine <lb/>
            and other doctors of the church. I have endeavoured in <lb/>
            this work to be useful to my fellow creatures and to myself; <lb/>
            wishing especially to be of some service to those who dis­ <lb/>

            which purpose I have collected the accounts of our Lord's <lb/>
            miracles, which are spread over four books, and comprised <lb/>
            them within the limits of a small volume. Moreover, I have <lb/>
            generally been anxious to adopt the very words 1 found <lb/>
            in the authentic books; and although, for brevity's sake, I <lb/>
            have been frequently compelled to alter their language, <lb/>
            yet I have made every effort to arrive at the precise <lb/>
            truth, and have never voluntarily deviated from received <lb/>

          <p>TIBERIUS, the step-son of Octavianus Augustus, being <lb/>
            the SOIl of Livia his wife by a former husband, reigned <lb/>
            twenty-three years. In the twelfth year of his reign, he sent <lb/>
            Pilate into Judea, as procurator of that province. Herod <lb/>
            the tetrarch, when he had been in possession of this prin­ <lb/>
            cipality twenty-four years, founded the cities of Tiberias <lb/>
            and Libias, in honour of the emperor Tiberius and his <lb/>
            mother Livia.3</p>
          <p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cresar, our <lb/>
            Lord Jesus, after his baptism, as was foretold by St. John, <lb/>
            preached the kingdom of heaven to the world, four thousand <lb/>
            years after the creation, according to the Hebrews, as is <lb/>
            proved by Eusebius, in his Chronicles; we must here notice <lb/>
            that the fifteenth year of Tiberius corresponds with the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of the eighty-first Jubilee among the Jews, if <lb/>
            we consult these same Chronicles, which Eusebius himself <lb/>
            compiled, as he thought best, from the two editions extant,4 <lb/>
            we find five thousand, two hundred, and twenty-eight <lb/>
            years. <note type="footnote"> 1 It is not the work of Bcde, "Dc Temporibus," but the one bearing <lb/>
            the title, “ De Sex Ætatibus Mundi,” which our author has followed, for <lb/>

            Herod Antipas. The town called, in honour of Livia, sometimes Libias, <lb/>
            sometimes Julias (Livia herself having taken the name of Julia after she <lb/>

          <p>In the eighteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, <lb/>
            our Lord redeemed the world by his passion, and rising <lb/>
            again victoriously from the dead on the third day, showed <lb/>
            himself openly to his faithful disciples, and on the fortieth day <lb/>
            ascended into heaven before their eyes. Agrippa, surnamed <lb/>
            Herod, whose father was Aristobulus, son of King Herod, <lb/>
            went to Rome, to impeach Herod the tetrarch, but was <lb/>
            thrown into prison by order of Tiberius,1 where he made <lb/>
            himself many friends, especially Caius (Caligula), son of <lb/>
            Germanicus.</p>
          <p>Caius, surnamed Caligula, reigned three years, ten months, <lb/>
            and eight days. He gave the kingdom of Judea to his friend <lb/>
            Herod Agrippa, whom he had liberated from confinement. <lb/>
            This prince held the sceptre for the space of seven years, <lb/>
            that is to say, until the fourth year of the reign of Claudius, <lb/>
            when "the angel of the Lord smote him,” and his son <lb/>
            Agrippa [II.] succeeded in the government, and reigned <lb/>
            twenty-six years, until the extermination of the Jews. He, <lb/>
            as well as Herod the tetrarch, was persuaded by Herodias to <lb/>
            go to Rome, to conciliate the friendship of Caligula, but <lb/>
            being there accused by Agrippa, he lost even his tetrarchate, <lb/>
            and escaping by flight into Spain, with Herodias, died there <lb/>
            of grief. Pilate, who had pronounced sentence of death <lb/>
            on Christ, received so many affronts from Caligula, that he <lb/>
            killed himself with his own hand. This emperor, to honour <lb/>
            his gods, polluted the holy places of the Jews, by placing in <lb/>
            them these impure idols.2</p>
          <p>Claudius governed the empire thirteen years, eight <lb/>
            months, and nineteen days. He himself, in the fourth year <lb/>
            of his reign, during a dreadful famine, of which St. Luke <note type="footnote"> 1 In the month of September, A.D. 37, about six months before the <lb/>
            death of Tiberius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He did not give Judea to Herod Agrippa, as our author states, <lb/>
            according to Bede, but Batanea and the Trachonitis. Claudius, A.D. 41, <lb/>
            added to them Judea and Samaria. The death of this king happened in 44. <lb/>
            Agrippa II. never possessed Judea, but other territories, with the superin­ <lb/>
            tendence of the Temple, and the right of appointing the high-priest. It <lb/>
            was in the year 39 that Herod Antipas, accused of entertaining a treason­ <lb/>
            able correspondence with the Parthians, was banished with Herodias to. <lb/>
            Lyons ; from whence, it appears, they were subsequently removed to Spain. <lb/>
            Pilate, according to a tradition, was sent to Vienne in Dauphiny, where he <lb/>
            killed himself in a fit of despair, A.D. 40. </note> <pb n="86"/>

            Britain, where no army had dared to land either before or <lb/>
            after Julius Cæsar, and, without fighting any battles or <lb/>
            shedding blood, within the space of a few days, received the <lb/>
            proffered submission of the greater part of the island. He <lb/>
            also added the Orkney Islands to the Roman empire, and <lb/>
            returned to his capital, whence he had been absent alto­ <lb/>
            gether somewhat less than six months. In the ninth year <lb/>
            of his government, he drove the rebellious Jews out of Rome, <lb/>
            as we read in the Acts of St. Luke. In the following year <lb/>
            a dire famine afflicted the Romans.1</p>
          <p>Nero filled the imperial throne for the space of thirteen <lb/>
            years, seven months, and twenty-eight days. In his second <lb/>
            year, Festus succeeded Felix as procurator of Judea, and sent <lb/>
            Paul in chains to Rome. Albinus succeeded Festus in the <lb/>
            government of Judea, and was followed by Gessius Florus. <lb/>
            The Jews were not long able to bear the dissolute manners, <lb/>
            the avarice, and the other vices of Florus; for which reason <lb/>
            they rebelled against the Romans. Vespasian was sent <lb/>
            against them at the head of an army, and took several of <lb/>
            their towns. Nero's greatest crime, and he committed <lb/>
            many, was his having given the order for the first persecu­ <lb/>
            tion of the Christians, the most distinguished leaders of <lb/>
            whom he commanded to be put to death at Rome; St. Peter <lb/>
            was crucified, and St. Paul fell by the sword. This emperor <lb/>
            did not venture to undertake any wars, and was very near <lb/>
            losing Britain ; for during his government, two towns of <lb/>
            great importance were captured and destroyed.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 The conquests of the Romans in Britain commenced under A. <lb/>
            Plautius, A.C. 43. The expedition of Claudius into England, where he <lb/>
            remained only sixteen days, took place in the third year of his reign. <lb/>
            There was, indeed, at the same period a famine at Rome; but the one <lb/>
            our author speaks of, and of which St. Luke makes mention in the <lb/>
            Acts of the Apostles (xi. 28), belongs to the next year. The conquest of <lb/>
            the Orkneys did not happen under this prince, but under Vespasian. The <lb/>
            expulsion of the Jews from Italy (Acts xviii. 2) must be referred to the year <lb/>
            49, and the second famine to the year 51. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The expedition of Vespasian into Judea took place in the year <lb/>
            67. Festus had succeeded Felix in 60, and consequently not in the <lb/>
            second, but in the sixth year of the reign of Nero.—St. Peter and St. <lb/>
            Paul appear to have suffered martyrdom on the 29th of June, A.D. 66.— <lb/>
            The Roman power in Britain was almost stationary under Aulus Didius <lb/>
            and Varanius, the immediate successors of Ostorius; indeed, it is said that </note> <pb n="87"/>
             </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 69—79.]"/>
          <p>Vespasian held the reins of government for the space of <lb/>
            nine years, eleven months, and twenty-two days. He was <lb/>
            in Juden when lie was proclaimed emperor by the army, and, <lb/>
            leaving the direction of the war to his son Titus, he <lb/>
            returned to Rome by the way of Alexandria, and, after the <lb/>
            murder of Vitellius, took possession of the throne. Titus, <lb/>
            within the space of two years, overthrew the kingdom of <lb/>
            Judea, and razed the temple to the ground one thousand <lb/>
            and eighty-four years after its first erection. This war <lb/>
            was terminated in four years; it was carried on for two <lb/>
            years during the life of Nero, and was continued for two <lb/>
            years after his death. Vespasian, among other great actions <lb/>
            while he was yet a subject, signalized himself in Germany, <lb/>
            and afterwards in Great Britain, whither he had been sent <lb/>
            by Claudius, and where he fought thirty-two pitched battles <lb/>
            with the enemy ; he added to the Roman empire two powerful <lb/>
            nations, twenty towns and the Isle of Wight on the coast <lb/>
            of Britain. It was during his reign that the colossus [of <lb/>
            Rhodes] was erected; its height was a hundred and seven <lb/>
            feet.'</p>
          <p>The emperor Titus reigned two years and two months; a <lb/>
            man whose character was so admirable on account of his <lb/>
            being endowed with every virtue, that be was called the love <lb/>
            and delight of mankind. He completed the amphitheatre <lb/>
            at Rome, when five thousand animals were killed at the <lb/>
            dedication.2 <note type="footnote"> the Emperor Nero seriously entertained the thought of abandoning the <lb/>
            island, but the next governor, Paulinus Suetonius (A.D. 59—61) revived <lb/>
            the spirit of the Romans. He conquered the island of Mona, now <lb/>
            Anglesey. Boadicea, widow of King Prasutagus, and queen of the Iceni,' <lb/>
            who were joined by the Trinobantes, rebelled against the Romans, laid <lb/>
            waste with fire and sword the colony of Camalodunum (Colchester), and <lb/>
            took London and Verulam by assault, massacring the inhabitants. The <lb/>
            Britons, however, were afterwards defeated by Suetonius with tremendous <lb/>
            loss, and Boadicea put an end to her existence by taking poison. This <lb/>
            revolt took place A.D. 61. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The Temple at Jerusalem was destroyed by fire, Aug. 10, A.D. 70, <lb/>

          <p>Domitian, the younger brother of Titus, governed the <lb/>
            empire fifteen years and five months. He commenced <lb/>
            the second persecution of the Christians, Nero's being the <lb/>
            first, and shortly afterwards received his reward for thus <lb/>
            fighting against God, being slain in the senate-housed</p>
          <p>Nerva held the imperial sceptre one year, four months, <lb/>
            and eight days. His first edict recalled all those who were <lb/>
            banished. The apostle St. John regained his liberty by this <lb/>
            general amnesty, and took advantage of it to return to <lb/>
            Ephesus.2</p>
          <p>Trajan filled the throne nineteen years, six months, and <lb/>
            fifteen days. He began the third persecution of the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians, and ordered the most eminent servants of God to be <lb/>
            tortured to death. Pliny the younger, born at Como, lived <lb/>
            during this reign ; he is regarded as a great orator and his­ <lb/>
            torian : many of his works, proofs of his remarkable talent, <lb/>
            are still extant. The Pantheon at Rome, built by Domitian, <lb/>
            was destroyed by lightning; it was so named, because it was <lb/>
            consecrated as the temple of all the gods. The Jews, who <lb/>
            excited seditions in every part of the world, were slaughtered <lb/>
            in great numbers, a punishment they deserved. This <lb/>
            emperor extended far and wide the bounds of the Roman <lb/>
            empire, which, since the time of Augustus, had been rather <lb/>
            defended than added to by any remarkable conquest.3</p>
          <p>Hadrian, cousin of Trajan, reigned twenty-one years. <lb/>

            (Caius Cæcilius Plinius Secundus) was born at Como about A.D. 52, and <lb/>

            commanding that the Christians should not be condemned <lb/>

            them of the permission to enter Jerusalem, which he care­ <lb/>
            fully rebuilt, and surrounded with walls; commanding that <lb/>
            it should be called Ælia, after his own name. Being perfect <lb/>
            master both of Greek and Latin, he founded at Athens a <lb/>
            library of admirable architecture. Mark was the first <lb/>
            gentile bishop of Jerusalem; those who preceded him having <lb/>
            been all Jews. Their names were: James the brother <lb/>
            of our Lord, Simeon the son of Cleophas, Justus, Zaccheus, <lb/>
            Tobias, Sixtus (Benjamin), John, Matthias, Philip, Seneca, <lb/>
            another Justus, Levi, Effrem, Joseph, and Judas. These <lb/>
            bishops, fifteen in number, who were of the circumcision, <lb/>
            governed the Christian church at Jerusalem, from the time <lb/>
            of our Lord's passion until the reign of Ælius Hadrian, a <lb/>
            space of nearly one hundred and seven years; rendering <lb/>
            themselves illustrious by their sanctity, their faith, and their <lb/>
            learning. Their successors of gentile origin, were Mark, <lb/>

            Marcus Aurelius and Lucius (Verus), reigned twenty-two <lb/>
            years and three months. Justin the philosopher presented <lb/>
            to Antoninus a book he wrote in favour of the Christian <lb/>
            religion, which induced the emperor to treat the Christians <note type="footnote"> 1 The initiation of the Emperor Hadrian into the mysteries of Eleusis in <lb/>
            126 had excited the persecution which induced St. Quadratus, bishop of <lb/>
            Athens, St. Aristides, and Serenus. Granianus, proconsul of Asia, to present <lb/>
            to the emperor apologies for the Christian religion, which induced him to <lb/>
            put an end to the persecution. Jerusalem was retaken, and reduced to ashes <lb/>
            by Julius Severus in the month of August, 135. Its conversion into a <lb/>

            Polycarp, on his arrival at Rome, reclaimed from their <lb/>
            heresy many who had been recently corrupted by the <lb/>
            doctrines of Valentine and Cerdo.1</p>
          <p>Marcus Antoninus Verus, and his brother [by adoption] <lb/>
            Lucius Aurelius Commodus, reigned nineteen years and two <lb/>
            months. The government was now for the first time <lb/>
            administered by them jointly, hitherto there having been <lb/>
            ,sole emperors. They afterwards made war against the <lb/>
            Parthians with distinguished courage and success. During <lb/>
            the persecution of the Christians in Asia, Polycarp and <lb/>
            Pionius suffered martyrdom. In Gaul, also, Pothinus, bishop <lb/>
            of Lyons, and several other Christians gloriously shed their <lb/>
            blood for Christ. Not long after, the plague, that avenger <lb/>
            of crime, depopulated many provinces of the Roman empire, <lb/>
            above all Italy, and Rome itself. On the demise of his <lb/>
            brother Commodus, Antoninus took his own son Commodus <lb/>
            as his colleague in the government. Melito, bishop of <lb/>
            Sardis, in Asia, wrote an apology for the Christians, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to the emperor Antoninus. Lucius, king of Britain, <lb/>
            sent a letter to Eleutherius, bishop of Rome, soliciting <note type="footnote"> 1 Justin Martyr, born A.D. 103, at Neapolis (Sicham), drew up his <lb/>

            Pius I., who died ten years before (July 11, 157); consequently he does <lb/>
            not belong to this reign, but to that of Marcus Aurelius. St. Hernias, <lb/>
            and not Hermes, the father of Pius I., wrote the bock called "The Pastor," <lb/>

            Romans xvi. 14. The book does not contain anything relative to the time <lb/>
            of celebrating Easter. Polycarp, a disciple of St. John, who is supposed <lb/>
            to be the “ angel of the church of Smyrna" (Rev. ii. 8), undertook a <lb/>
            journey to Rome in 158, to confer with Pope Anicetus on this subject. <lb/>

            inherit his father's virtues, being addicted to every species <lb/>
            of debauchery. Irenæus, bishop of Lyons at this time, had <lb/>
            gained great celebrity. The emperor Commodus having <lb/>
            ordered the head of the Colossus to be taken off, replaced it <lb/>
            by one taken from his own statue.2</p>
          <p>Helvius Pertinax reigned only six months; he was assas­ <lb/>
            sinated by Didius Julian, who, after a reign of only seven <lb/>
            months, was vanquished and killed, during the civil war, <lb/>
            by Severus, near the Milvian bridge. Victor, bishop of <lb/>
            Rome, by a decree which was widely dispersed, ordered the <lb/>

            the 21st day of March, which was then reckoned the <lb/>
            first month of the year. Theophilus, bishop of Cæsarea, <lb/>
            in Palestine, adopted this decree, and in conjunction with <lb/>

          <p>Severus Pertinax held the reins of government for seven­ <lb/>

            a cruel persecution of the Christians. Clemens, a priest of <lb/>
            the church of Alexandria, and Pantænus, a stoic philo­ <lb/>

            cussions. Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, Theophilus of <lb/>
            Cæsarea, Polycarp and Bacchiolus, Asiatic bishops, were also <lb/>
            illustrious. In different parts of the empire, a great number <lb/>
            of Christians received the crown of martyrdom. Clodius <lb/>
            Albinus, who bad assumed the title of Cæsar in Gaul, <lb/>
            having been slain near Lyons, Severus transferred the war <lb/>
            into Britain. In order to secure the conquered provinces <lb/>
            from the incursions of the barbarians, he ordered a wide <lb/>
            ditch to be dug, and a very strong wall to be raised; which <lb/>
            was. additionally fortified, at unequal distances, by a number <lb/>
            of towers: these works very nearly extended from sea to <lb/>
            sea, being about one hundred and thirty-two thousand paces <lb/>
            long. This emperor died at York.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author seems, in imitation of Aurelius Victor, to have confounded <lb/>

            Christ, Pontius. The third year of his reign witnessed the <lb/>
            completion of the year one thousand from the foundation <lb/>
            of Rome. The doors of the pagan temples having been <lb/>
            closed, the holy church freely opened hers with joy for the <lb/>
            celebration of God's praise; and this year, more august than <lb/>
            any that had preceded it, was kept with magnificent games <lb/>
            by a Christian emperor. Origen, son of the martyr Leo­ <lb/>
            nidas, instructed in the divine philosophy of Christianity, <lb/>
            at Cæsarea of Palestine, two young brothers, Theodore <lb/>
            surnamed Gregory, and Athenodore, who afterwards became <lb/>
            illustrious bishops of Pontus. His reply to a certain Celsus, <lb/>
            an epicurean philosopher, who had written against us, filled <lb/>
            eight volumes. In short, such was his diligence in writing, <lb/>
            that St. Jerome says somewhere that he had read five <lb/>
            thousand books of which Origen was the author.2</p>
          <p>Decius reigned one year and three months. Having put <note type="footnote"> 1 Gordianus Pius, whose reign is here confounded with that of his pre­ <lb/>
            decessors, the Gordians of Africa, Maximus and Balbinus, reigned in reality <lb/>
            but five years and about eight months, having been assassinated in the east <lb/>
            at the instigation of Philip. It was before this reign, and about A.D. 231, <lb/>
            that Julius Africanus went to Alexandria to take lessons of Heraclea, who <lb/>
            at that time had succeeded Origen in the functions of catechist, and after­ <lb/>
            wards became patriarch of that church. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The acts, evidently apocryphal, of St. Pontius, may be seen in the <lb/>
            Miscellanea of Baluze. He appears to be quite an imaginary personage; <lb/>
            and indeed Bede has not mentioned his name. We do not read anywhere <lb/>
            that Philip ordered the temple to be closed, nor that the secular games by <lb/>
            which he celebrated, in 247, the year 1000 of Rome, had a Christian <lb/>
            character. It is true that a few temples and idols were destroyed at <lb/>
            Neocesarea, in Pontus, but this was an entirely local act, brought about by <lb/>
            the zeal of St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, one of the pupils of Origen men­ <lb/>
            tioned here. It does not appear why our author asserts that this orator <lb/>
            of the church gave lessons during this reign, which Bede more suitably <lb/>
            places under Gordian the Pious. Origen died, as already stated, in 253; <lb/>
            and his treatise against Celsus, being the last of his writings, might very <lb/>
            well have been composed in the time of Philip. </note> <pb n="96"/>

            to death the two Philips, father and son, he carried the <lb/>
            hatred he bore them so far as to order the Christians to be <lb/>
            persecuted; pope Fabian then received the crown of mar­ <lb/>
            tyrdom, and left the episcopal see to Cornelius. Alexander, <lb/>
            bishop of Jerusalem, also received the martyrs crown at <lb/>
            Cæsarea in Palestine, and Babylas at Antioch.1</p>
          <p>Gallus, with his son Volusian, reigned two years and four <lb/>
            months. Dionysius, a priest of Alexandria, relates that the <lb/>
            commencement of the reign of this prince was most prospe­ <lb/>
            rous, and that everything succeeded according to his mind, <lb/>
            but that, having persecuted the holy men who offered up <lb/>
            prayers to the supreme God for the tranquillity of the <lb/>
            empire, his own peace and prosperity vanished. Origen <lb/>
            died before he had quite completed his seventieth year, <lb/>
            and was buried in the city of Tyre. At the request of <lb/>
            Lucina, a Roman matron, the pope, Cornelius, raised from <lb/>
            the catacombs, during the night, the bodies of the two <lb/>
            apostles, which had been deposited there, and interred that <lb/>
            of St. Paul on the road to Ostia, where he had been beheaded, <lb/>
            and that of St. Peter near the spot which had witnessed his <lb/>
            crucifixion; among the bodies of the holy bishops, where <lb/>
            formerly stood the temple of Apollo, on the Vatican <lb/>
            Mount, and Nero built a palace. The bodies were translated <lb/>
            on the third of the calends of July,2 (the 29th of June). <note type="footnote"> 1 The seventh persecution, which took place under this prince, in which <lb/>
            a great number of martyrs perished, began A.D. 250. St. Fabian, the pope, <lb/>
            was one of the first victims, as well as St. Babylas and St. Alexander. St. <lb/>
            Cornelius, who was not elected until after a vacancy of six months (June <lb/>
            4, 251), suffered martyrdom under Callus, in 252. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We are not aware that St. Cornelius effected the two removals here <lb/>
            attributed to him. It was he himself who was buried by Lucina in a crypt <lb/>
            near the cemetery of St. Callistus. On the pretended removals mentioned <lb/>
            in this paragraph, Baronius may be consulted, under the year 221. <lb/>
            There are few questions more obscure and perplexed than those of the <lb/>
            interments and translations of the bodies of SS. Peter and Paul. If we <lb/>
            believe St. Gregory the Great, the corpses of these two princes of the <lb/>
            apostles were, immediately after their execution, taken away by those <lb/>
            among their disciples who were Greeks and who wished to carry them <lb/>
            away to their own country, but re-taken, when at a distance of two miles <lb/>
            from Rome by the Latin Christians, who placed them provisionally in the <lb/>
            catacombs situated near the spot; later they were deposited, one in the <lb/>
            Vatican, the other in the church of St. Paul extra muros; then Pope St. <lb/>
            Xystus, transferred them once more to the catacombs on the 29th of <lb/>

          <p>Valerian and his son Gallienus reigned fifteen years. <lb/>
            Having raised a persecution against the Christians, Valerian <lb/>
            was soon afterwards taken prisoner by Sapor, king of the <lb/>
            Persians, and being deprived of his sight, wore out his <lb/>
            days to old age a wretched captive. Gallienus, terrified at <lb/>
            such a manifest judgment of God, gave orders that the <lb/>
            Christians should not be molested. Nevertheless, either <lb/>
            as a punishment for his own licentiousness, or for his <lb/>
            father's hostility to God, the incursions of the barbarians <lb/>
            caused the greatest calamities throughout the Roman empire. <lb/>
            During this persecution, Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, <lb/>
            whose very learned works are still extant, suffered martyr­ <lb/>
            dom. Pontius, one of his deacons, has left us an admirable <lb/>
            volume, describing his life and death, having suffered exile <lb/>
            with him up to his last moments. Theodore Gregory, bishop <lb/>
            of Neocæsarea, in Pontus, was eminently distinguished <lb/>
            by the performance of miracles; he gave a -proof of this <lb/>
            power, when, by his prayers, he removed a mountain in <lb/>
            order to have sufficient room for the foundations of a church <lb/>
            which he intended to raise. Stephen and Sixtus, bishops of <lb/>
            Rome, suffered martyrdom.1</p>
          <p>Claudius (II.) reigned one year and nine months. He <lb/>
            vanquished the Goths, who, for fifteen years, had been <lb/>
            ravaging Illyricum and Macedonia; for this service rendered <lb/>
            to the state, the senate heaped honours on his memory; <lb/>
            a golden shield was hung up in the senate-house, and a <lb/>
            statue of the same metal erected in the Capitol. Marcion, <lb/>
            a very eloquent priest of the church of Antioch, who taught <lb/>
            rhetoric in that city, disputed with Paul of Samosata, bishop <lb/>
            of Antioch, who held that Christ was of the nature common <lb/>
            to man; his discourse, which was taken down in writing <lb/>
            by the notaries, is still extant.2 <note type="footnote"> had been already taken back to his church, but those of St. Peter still <lb/>

          <p>. Aurelian governed the Roman empire for five years and <lb/>
            six months. Having excited a persecution against us, a <lb/>
            thunderbolt fell before him to the great consternation of all <lb/>
            present; and not long after this he was massacred by the <lb/>
            soldiers half way on the road leading from Constantinople <lb/>
            to Heraclea. Eutychian, the pope, was martyred at Rome, <lb/>
            and interred in the cemetery of Callistus, where he had <lb/>
            buried three hundred and thirteen martyrs with his own <lb/>
            hands.1</p>
          <p>Tacitus reigned six months. Having lost his life in <lb/>
            Pontus, Florian seized the empire which he held eighty- <lb/>
            eight days, and was killed at Tarsus. Anatolius, a native of <lb/>
            Alexandria, and bishop of Laodicea, in Syria, well versed in <lb/>
            all the learning of the philosophers, is highly spoken of; we <lb/>
            may judge of his genius by his work on Easter, and his ten <lb/>
            books on arithmetic. About this time the insane heresy <lb/>
            of the Manicheans and Sabellians commenced.2</p>
          <p>Probus, during his reign of six years and four months, com­ <lb/>
            pletely delivered Gaul from the barbarians, who for a long <lb/>
            time had occupied that country, but whom he routed in <lb/>
            many bloody battles. Archelaus, bishop of Mesopotamia, <lb/>
            composed, in the Syrian language, a book on his con- <note type="footnote"> He defeated the Goths, who had crossed over into Greece with an army of <lb/>
            32,000 men, in the years 269 and 270, nearly destroying their vast force; <lb/>
            a pestilence carried him off at Sirmium. The statue erected in honour <lb/>
            of Claudius in the Capitol, by the senate, was ten feet high.-The refuta­ <lb/>
            tion of the errors of Paul of Samosata by Marcion took place in the third <lb/>
            council of Antioch, over which Hymeneus, patriarch of Jerusalem, presided <lb/>
            at the commencement of the year 270. The acts of this public disputation <lb/>
            no longer exist. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This persecution was the ninth, and happened not before but after the <lb/>
            fall of the thunderbolt mentioned by our author. St. Eutychian did not <lb/>
            suffer martyrdom, and he died as late as December, 283. He is said to have <lb/>
            interred as many as three hundred and forty-two martyrs with his own hands. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Marcus Claudius Tacitus, a Roman, was elected emperor by the senate <lb/>
            after the death of Aurelian, when in his seventieth year. During a short <lb/>

            invaded the territories of Rome in Asia, but he prepared to make war <lb/>
            against the Persians and Scythians. He died in Cilicia, during the <lb/>
            expedition, of a violent distemper, or, according to some, was assassinated, <lb/>
            on the 13th of April, A.D. 276. Bishop Anatolius flourished about the <lb/>
            year 270. The heresy of the Manichees began in 277; that of the Sabel­ <lb/>

            merianus, two years. Gaius, bishop of Rome, shone illus­ <lb/>
            triously as the head of that church, but suffered martyrdom <lb/>
            under Diocletian. Pierius, a priest of Alexandria, during <lb/>
            the patriarchate of Theonas, instructed the people with. <lb/>
            the greatest success; his sermons and divers treatises, <lb/>
            still extant, are written in so elegant a style, that he was <lb/>
            called Origen the younger; a man surprisingly frugal, and <lb/>
            affecting voluntary poverty; he spent the remainder of his <lb/>
            days after the persecution at Rome.2</p>
          <p>Diocletian reigned jointly with Heracleus Maximian <lb/>
            twenty years. Carausius having assumed the purple, took <lb/>
            possession of Britain.3 Narses, king of the Persians, <lb/>
            invaded the east. The Quinquegentians infested Africa. <lb/>
            Achilleus made himself master of Egypt. To face so <lb/>
            many enemies, Diocletian admitted into the government <lb/>
            the Cæsars Constantius and Galerius Maximian. The <lb/>
            first married Theodora, the step-daughter of Heracleus, by <lb/>
            whom he had six children, who were the brothers [and <lb/>
            sisters] of Constantine. Galerius obtained the hand of <lb/>
            Valeria, daughter of Diocletian. Ten years afterwards, <lb/>
            Asclepiodotus, the prætorian prefect, recovered Britain.</p>
          <p>In the nineteenth year of this reign, Diocletian in the <lb/>
            east, and Heracleus, Maximian in the west, ordered the <lb/>
            churches to be plundered, and the Christians to be tor­ <lb/>
            mented and put to death. In the second year of this <lb/>
            persecution, Diocletian laid down the purple in Nicomedia, <note type="footnote"> 1 The dispute between Archelaus and Manes took place in 277. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Caius, or Gaius, elected pope September 17, 283, suffered martyrdom <lb/>

            until the 23rd of August, 300. What our author says of Pierius is quite <lb/>
            true. He must have undertaken his voyage to Rome when the persecution <lb/>
            had ended in 311. We are not informed of the date of his death. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Carausius, by birth either a Belgian or a Briton, it is not very certain <lb/>

            retained until the year 297, when he was murdered at York by Allectus, a <lb/>
            Briton. The names he assumed were, Marcus, Aurelius, Valerius, Carau­ <lb/>
            sins. Narses invaded the east in 297. The Quinquegentians or Quinque­ <lb/>

            to abdicate the government at Milan. However, this per­ <lb/>

            the seventh year of the reign of Constantine.</p>
          <p>Constantius (Chlorus), a prince of a mild disposition, and <lb/>
            of great affability, died at York, in Britain, in the sixteenth <lb/>
            year of his reign. The persecution of the Christians was <lb/>
            urged forward with such cruelty and fury, that in the course <lb/>
            of a month they reckon eighteen thousand martyrs, who <lb/>
            had suffered death for Christ. Having passed the limits <lb/>
            of the ocean, it shed the precious blood of Alban, Aaron, <lb/>
            Julius, and many other persons of both sexes, in Britain. <lb/>
            Then also Pamphilus suffered martydom; he was the <lb/>
            particular friend of Eusebius, bishop of Cesarea, who him­ <lb/>
            self has given, in three books, the history of the life of this <lb/>
            holy priest.</p>
          <p>In the third year of the persecution, Constantius quitted <lb/>
            this world, and Maximinus and Severus received the title of <lb/>
            Cæsar from Galerius Maximian;1 this Maximian added to <lb/>
            his many misdeeds and adulteries, the crime of persecuting <lb/>
            the Christians.2 At that time, Peter, bishop of Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, and several other bishops in Egypt, were put to <lb/>
            death, as well as Lucian, a priest of Antioch, remarkable for <lb/>
            his good morals, continence, and erudition; with many other <lb/>
            servants of Christ.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Constantius Chlorus [to whom Britain fell in succession on the resig­ <lb/>

            marriages mentioned above were also celebrated in the same year. Con­ <lb/>
            stantius had three sons and three daughters by his wife Theodora. <lb/>
            Asclepiodotus, an officer of Constantius Chlorus, recovered Britain in 300, <lb/>

            The edict that put an end to the persecution appeared in the spring of 311 <lb/>

            was proclaimed Augustus at Rome, and Licinius, who bad <lb/>

            The catholic faith was defined at the council of Nice. The <lb/>
            emperor ordered a number of churches to be built for divine <lb/>
            worship: he had one constructed at Rome, in honour of St. <lb/>
            John the Baptist, in which he was baptized, which was <lb/>
            called the church of Constantine, after the founders name; <lb/>
            another on the site of the temple of Apollo, dedicated to St. <lb/>
            Peter; and a third on the road to Ostia, to St. Paul; he <lb/>
            raised a chapel in the Sessorian palace, to which he gave the <lb/>
            name of Jerusalem, and placed in it a fragment of our <lb/>
            Saviours cross. At the request of his daughter, he dedicated <lb/>
            a church to St. Agnes the Martyr, and another to St. <lb/>
            Lawrence the Martyr, on the road to Tibur, on the land of <lb/>
            Veranus. He also built a church on the Lavican way, <lb/>
            between two laurels, in honour of the holy martyrs Marcel­ <lb/>
            linus and Peter, and a mausoleum, where he laid the remains <lb/>
            of his mother in a- sarcophagus of porphyry. He, besides, <lb/>
            ordered the construction of a church, to be dedicated to <lb/>
            the memory of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul, and St. <lb/>
            John the Baptist, near Ostia, the port of Rome. Churches <note type="footnote"> immediately with fresh fury in those countries which were under the <lb/>

            buried there, and called it Helenopolis, after the name of <lb/>

            bear his own name, and wished it to become the seat of the <lb/>

            Constans, reigned twenty-four years, five months, and <lb/>

            a town which was often delivered by his prayers from the <lb/>
            perils that threatened it. The Arian heresy, upheld and <lb/>
            protected by the emperor, at first caused the persecution <lb/>
            of Athanasius, and afterwards of all the bishops who were <lb/>
            not of that sect; who had to suffer banishment, imprison­ <lb/>
            ment, and all kinds of punishment. Maximin, bishop of <lb/>
            Treves, was one of the most illustrious prelates of that <lb/>
            period; he sheltered with honour Athanasius, bishop of <lb/>
            Alexandria, when Constantine sought to punish him. <lb/>

            a hundred and five. Constantius, having returned to Rome, <lb/>
            the Christians at Constantinople received the bones of <lb/>
            Andrew the apostle, and of Luke the evangelist, with great <lb/>
            exultation. Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, who had been sent <lb/>
            an exile into Phrygia by the Arians, after having repaired <lb/>
            to Constantinople to present his petition to Constantius, <lb/>
            was allowed to return to Gaul.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 St. James, bishop of Nisibis, in Mesopotamia, is said by his prayers to <lb/>

            350. The banishment of St. Athanasius to Treves, took place in the year, <lb/>
            335, and consequently in the reign of Constantine; the motive for it <lb/>
            was a political denunciation by the partisans of Eusebius before this <lb/>
            prince, and not a point of doctrine. St. Maximin, a native of Silé, in <lb/>

          <p>Julian reigned two years and eight months. He had <lb/>
            been baptized, had taken holy orders, as far as the <lb/>
            rank of deacon; 1 but having left the church, he adopted <lb/>
            the profession of arms, made himself master of the empire, <lb/>
            and returning to the worship of idols, became a persecutor <lb/>
            of the Christians. Then the pagans took possession of the <lb/>
            tomb of John the Baptist, at Sebaste, a town of Palestine, <lb/>
            and scattered his bones about the country; they then col­ <lb/>
            lected them together again, and burned and dispersed them <lb/>
            over a wider tract. But, by the providence of God, a few <lb/>
            monks came from Jerusalem, and mixing with the crowd, <lb/>
            who were collecting these remains, gathered up what they <lb/>
            could, and carried them to their superior, Philip. Convinced <lb/>
            that it would be beyond his power, with the means at <lb/>
            his disposal, to preserve a treasure of such importance, he <lb/>
            immediately sent them to Athanasius, the most illustrious <lb/>
            bishop of that age, confiding them to the care of his deacon, <lb/>
            Julian. The bishop, as soon as he had received them, <lb/>
            enclosed these relics in a cavity which he caused to be made <lb/>
            in the wall of the sanctuary, in the presence of only a few <lb/>
            witnesses, and with a prophetical spirit dedicated them to <lb/>
            future generations. What he foresaw was fulfilled under <lb/>
            the emperor Theodosius by Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, <lb/>
            who, having destroyed the tomb of Serapis, consecrated on <lb/>
            that same spot a church to St. John.2</p>
          <p>Jovian reigned eight months. Meletius and his adherents <lb/>
            called together a council at Antioch, which condemned the <lb/>
            doctrine of Macedonius, who blasphemed the Holy Ghost.3 <lb/>
            The emperor, having concluded with the Persians a truce for <lb/>
            twenty-nine years, re-entered the territory of the Roman <lb/>
            empire. Warned by the fall of his predecessor Constantius, <lb/>

            allow his pious and happy principles to bear fruit.</p>
          <p>Valentinian reigned jointly with his brother Valens eleven <lb/>
            years. Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea, wrote several works <lb/>
            favourable to our doctrines, but having afterwards swerved <lb/>
            from the faith, he founded the heresy which bears his name. <lb/>
            Damasus, bishop of Rome, built a church near the theatre, <lb/>
            in honour of St. Lawrence, and another over the catacombs, <lb/>
            where lay the bodies of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul; <lb/>
            and decorated the pavement which covered them with in­ <lb/>
            scriptions in verse. Valens, after being baptized by Eu­ <lb/>
            doxius, an Arian bishop, persecuted the orthodox. Gratian, <lb/>
            son of Valentinian, was raised to the imperial dignity at <lb/>
            Amiens, in the third year of his father's reign. At Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople a church was dedicated to the apostles who had <lb/>
            suffered martyrdom. A.uxentius at length dying, Ambrose <lb/>
            was raised to the bishopric of Milan, and by his preaching, <lb/>
            converted to the faith of Christ the whole of Cisalpine <lb/>
            Gaul.'</p>
          <p>Valens reigned four years with Gratian and Valentinian, <lb/>
            the sons of his brother Valentinian. Valens, having made <lb/>
            a decree that monks should be subject to military service, <lb/>
            ordered all those who refused to be beaten to death. The <lb/>
            Huns, who up to that time [A.D. 375] had been confined <lb/>
            to their inaccessible mountains, driven by a sudden fit of <lb/>
            rage, fell with fury upon the Goths, who, being attacked <lb/>
            in different quarters, were expelled from their ancient seats <lb/>
            [A.D. 376]. Having passed the Danube, the Goths were <lb/>
            received in their flight by Valens, who did not require them <lb/>
            to lay down their arms ; but soon afterwards, experiencing <note type="footnote"> 1 The errors of Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea, already censured several <lb/>
            times since the year 362, were definitively condemned in the oecumenical <lb/>

            the holy see from the autumn of 366 until the 2nd of December, 384. The <lb/>
            emperor Valens was baptized bv Eudoxius at the commencement of 367, <lb/>
            and Gratian received from his father Valentinian the title of Augustus at <lb/>
            Amiens, on the 24th of August in the same year. The church of the <lb/>
            Apostles at Constantinople was consecrated in 370. Auxentius, an Arian, <lb/>
            usurped the see for almost twenty years. St. Ambrose was raised to the <lb/>
            episcopal dignity in 374. </note> <pb n="105"/>

            troops, they overran Thrace, plundering and destroying <lb/>
            everything with fire and sword.</p>
          <p>After the death of Valens, Gratian and his brother <lb/>
            Valentinian [II.] reigned six years.1 Theodosius, created by <lb/>
            Gratian emperor [of the east], vanquished in many great <lb/>
            battles those powerful nations which had emigrated from <lb/>
            Scythia, that is to say, the Alans, Huns, and Goths. The <lb/>
            Arians, displeased at seeing the harmony that existed <lb/>
            between these two princes, at last gave up the churches <lb/>
            which they had retained possession of by violence during forty <lb/>
            years. A council of one hundred and fifty fathers assembled <lb/>
            at Constantinople under Damasus, bishop of Rome, against <lb/>
            Macedonius.2 Theodosius took his son Arcadius as his <lb/>
            colleague in the empire. In the second year of the reign <lb/>
            of Gratian, when he, as well as Theodosius, was consul for <lb/>
            the sixth time,3 Theophilus compiled his Easter tables. <lb/>

            of Augustus, if, contrary to his oath, he had not aspired <lb/>
            to the empire, was, almost against his will, proclaimed em­ <lb/>
            peror by the army in'Britain [A.D. 383] ; he passed over into <lb/>
            Gaul, where, near Lyons, he treasonably killed the emperor <lb/>
            Gratian, whom he had drawn into a snare, and drove his <lb/>
            brother Valentinian out of Italy. He nevertheless justly <lb/>
            suffered the punishment of being banished with his mother <lb/>
            Justina, for both were infected with the impure heresy of <lb/>
            Arius, and he had shamefully persecuted Ambrose, the <lb/>

            the barbarians, drove the rest beyond the frontiers of Britain, <lb/>
            and, on the eye of returning home, advised their allies to <lb/>

            incursions of their enemies.</p>
          <p>This rampart, constructed without regard to the rules of <lb/>
            art, and in which more turf than stone was used, was of no <lb/>

            Picts, knowing that they would not return, re-appeared, <lb/>
            and wrested from the natives the whole island from the <lb/>

            quickly killed, taken prisoners, or put to flight, the wall it­ <lb/>
            self was broken through, and the country on the other side <lb/>
            of it savagely plundered. A letter full of grief and trouble <lb/>
            was sent to Aëtius, who had the command of the Roman <lb/>
            troops in the twenty-third year of the reign of Theodosius, <lb/>
            and was now consul for the third time, imploring succour <lb/>
            in vain. Meanwhile a dreadful and memorable famine <lb/>
            afflicted the fugitives, and caused some of them to go <lb/>
            over to the enemy, while the remainder, retiring to the <lb/>
            mountains, caverns, and forests, made a desperate resist­ <lb/>

            returned to their homes, intending shortly to renew their <lb/>

            treme part of the island, which they now for the first time <lb/>
            determined to inhabit. The famine, just spoken of, was <lb/>

            to the west with fire and sword, under pretence that the <lb/>

          <p>Aben the heresy of Pelagius disturbed the faith of <lb/>

            of our Lord strengthened the faith by the word of truth, as <lb/>
            well as by signs and miracles; and the attack made on <lb/>
            the Britons at this time by the combined forces of the <lb/>

            of the Franks. He reigned five years; and on his demise, <lb/>
            was succeeded by Clodion, whose reign lasted seven years.2</p>

            king of the Franks, died after a reign of thirteen years, and <lb/>

            ordered dwellings to be erected for the poor near the <lb/>

            sent every year money and clothes to Sardinia and Africa, <lb/>

            visiting Constantinople, was met at the Golden Gate, by a <lb/>
            great concourse of people, in whose presence he restored to <lb/>
            sight a blind man, who implored relief. On his return, <lb/>
            Theodoric ordered him to be arrested at Ravenna, and <lb/>
            thrown into prison with his attendants, where he died. <lb/>
            Theodoric was led to commit this crime from jealousy, <lb/>
            because Justin, the defender of the Catholic faith, had re­ <lb/>
            ceived this prelate honourably. In the same year, be put <lb/>
            to death Symmachus, patrician of Ravenna; but the next <lb/>
            year lie himself died suddenly in the same city, and was <lb/>
            succeeded by his nephew Athalaric. Hilderic, king of the <lb/>
            Vandals, ordered the bishops to be recalled from exile, and <lb/>
            the churches to be repaired, after seventy-four years of <lb/>
            heretical profanations. Benedict, the abbot, was illustrious <lb/>
            for his virtues, which Pope St. Gregory has recorded in his <lb/>
            book of Dialogues.2</p>
          <p>Justinian, nephew of Justin by a sister of that prince, <lb/>
            reigned twenty-eight years. The patrician Belisarius, sent <lb/>
            into Africa by Justinian, subdued the Vandals. He re­ <lb/>
            took Carthage after it had been ninety-six years in their <lb/>
            hands, whom he defeated and expelled, taking their king <lb/>
            Gelimer, whom he sent prisoner to Constantinople. The <note type="footnote"> counting the years of the reign of Clovis after his baptism, the MSS. <lb/>

            original reading, as, though evidently faulty, it agrees with the total <lb/>
            number of years assigned to the reign of Clovis in a preceding paragraph. <lb/>
            On the death of Clovis, the kingdom of the Franks was divided between <lb/>
            his four sons, and was not re-united by Clotaire until the successive deaths <lb/>
            of his brothers and their heirs. Clotaire, therefore, dispossessed, not his <lb/>
            brother Theodoric, but his grand-nephew Theodebald, of the kingdom of <lb/>
            Metz. St. Godard and Flavius, or Filleul, were indeed contemporaries of <lb/>
            this prince, but not St. Mamertus, as he died May 11, 475. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 July 10, 518—August 1, 527. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pope John 1. died May 18, A.D. 526, at Ravenna, in the prison where <lb/>

            to the Lombards, to induce them to invade and take posses­ <lb/>

            church of SS. Philip and James, which his predecessor <lb/>
            Pelagias had begun. Then the warlike Alboin, son of <lb/>

            Italy, at the head of the Guinili, and, with the consent of <lb/>

            apostolic nuncio at Constantinople, and afterwards bishop of <lb/>
            Rome, composed his commentary on the book of Job, and, <lb/>
            in the presence of Tiberius, convicted Eutychius, the bishop, <lb/>
            of error in his belief in the resurrection. He proved this <lb/>
            so clearly that the emperor was of opinion that the book <lb/>
            Eutychius had written on the resurrection ought to be <lb/>
            committed to the flames, having also refuted it himself by <lb/>
            allegations derived from Catholic authorities. Eutychius <lb/>
            taught that in the glory of the resurrection, our bodies <lb/>
            will be impalpable, and more subtile than the winds and <lb/>
            the air ; an assertion which was contrary to these words of <lb/>
            our Saviour: "Handle me and see; for a spirit bath not <lb/>
            flesh and bones as ye see me have." 2</p>
          <p>The nation of the Longobards, or Lombards, having in <lb/>
            their train famine and mortality, overran the whole of Italy, <lb/>
            and laid siege to the city of Rome. Alboin was then their <lb/>
            king.</p>
          <p>Maurice reigned twenty-one years. Hermenegild, son <lb/>
            of Leuvigild, king of the Goths, having resolutely confessed <lb/>
            the Catholic faith, was deprived by his father, who was <lb/>
            an Arian, of all his honours, thrown into prison and chains, <lb/>
            and at last beheaded, on the second night after Easter; and <lb/>
            thus the king and martyr exchanged an earthly throne for <lb/>
            the celestial kingdom. His brother Recared, who soon after <lb/>
            succeeded his father, converted to the Catholic faith the <lb/>
            whole nation of the Goths under his dominion, at the <lb/>
            instance of Leander, bishop of Seville, who had also in­ <lb/>

          <p>Maurice married the daughter of Tiberius Constantine, <lb/>
            and was the first of the Greek emperors who ordered the <lb/>
            Roman fasces to be carried before him. In the thirteenth <lb/>
            year of the reign of Maurice, the thirteenth indiction, <lb/>
            Gregory, bishop of the Roman church, and a very learned <lb/>
            doctor, assembled a council of twenty-three bishops at the <lb/>
            tomb of St. Peter the apostle, to make such decrees as the <lb/>
            state of the church required. The same pope, having sent <lb/>
            into Britain, Augustine, Mellitus, John, and several other <lb/>
            monks who feared God, converted the English to Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity. Ethelbert soon received the faith of Christ with <lb/>
            the whole Kentish nation, his subjects, and the neighbouring <lb/>
            provinces under his rule, conferring bishoprics, not only on <lb/>
            Augustine, his own teacher, but also on other holy priests. <lb/>
            The English nations to the north of the river Number, <lb/>
            under their kings Ella and Ethelfrid, had not yet heard the <lb/>
            word of life. Gregory, writing to Augustine and the bishops <lb/>
            of London and York, in the eighteenth year of the reign of <lb/>
            Maurice, in the fourth indiction, sent them the pall, and <lb/>
            gave them the title of metropolitans, and died four years <lb/>
            afterwards.1</p>
          <p>Phocas reigned eight years.2 This prince, at the request <lb/>

            order to put a stop to the pretensions of the church of Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople, which styled itself the first of all the Christian <lb/>
            churches. The same emperor, at the instance of another <lb/>
            pope Boniface, gave orders that the ancient temple called <lb/>
            the Pantheon, after being cleansed from the pollutions of <lb/>
            idolatry, should be converted into a church, dedicated to the <lb/>

            turned to him with all his heart; and having quitted Persia, <lb/>
            he went to Chalcedon and Hierapolis, seeking Christ every­ <lb/>
            where, and lastly to Jerusalem. Here lie received the grace <lb/>
            of baptism, and entered the monastery of abbot Anastasius, <lb/>
            situated at the distance of four miles from the city. Having <lb/>
            there spent seven years, under the monastic rule, while on <lb/>
            a pilgrimage to Cæsarea, in Palestine, he fell into the hands <lb/>
            of the Persians, and after much suffering from Marzabanes, <lb/>
            the judge, who caused him to be scourged, imprisoned, and <lb/>
            bound in chains, be was at length sent into Persia to King <lb/>
            Chosroes. This prince ordered him to be scourged three <lb/>
            times at intervals, then suspended by one hand for three <lb/>
            hours, and at last to be beheaded, with seventy other <lb/>
            martyrs. Soon afterwards a certain demoniac, being clothed <lb/>

            received, as well as his subjects, the word of salvation <lb/>
            preached to them by bishop Paulinus, whom the venerable <lb/>
            Justus, archbishop of Canterbury, had sent into those parts. <lb/>
            In the eleventh year of his reign, and about 180 years after <lb/>
            the arrival of the English in Britain, Paulinus was raised to <lb/>
            the episcopal see of York. As an auspicious omen of the <lb/>
            faith that was to come, and of the celestial kingdom, the <lb/>
            king Edwin's temporal power had so increased, that (what no <lb/>

            dominion through every quarter of the island, whether <lb/>
            possessed by the Saxons or the Britons. At that time Pope <lb/>
            Honorius refuted an error which had arisen among the Scots, <lb/>
            with regard to the observance of Easter, in a letter ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to that nation ; and John, the successor of Severinus, <lb/>

            bequeathed his dominions to his three sons, Clotaire, <lb/>

            sented the pope, in the presence of the clergy and people, <lb/>
            a writing under his hand, condemning all that he or his <lb/>
            predecessors had written or done against the Catholic faith. <lb/>
            Deceived by this step, the pope kindly received him as <lb/>
            bishop of the imperial city. But, on his return to Constan­ <lb/>

          <p>Constantine, the brother of Heraclius, reigned six <lb/>

            the Catholics by his strange doctrine, as his predecessors had <lb/>
            done, but by open persecution. The apostolic nuncios, sent <lb/>
            by the holy Roman church to correct him, were imprisoned, <lb/>
            banished, or scourged; and he went so far as to strip and <lb/>
            pull down the altar they had dedicated in the oratory of <lb/>
            Placidia's palace, forbidding them to celebrate mass there. <note type="footnote"> 628; if we except the time when Dagobert, his son, was taken as his <lb/>

          <p>Consigns [II.], the son of Constantine, reigned twenty- <lb/>
            eight years. Deceived by Paul, as Heraclius his grand­ <lb/>
            father had been by Sergius, also bishop of the imperial <lb/>
            city, he published an edict against the Catholic faith, defining <lb/>
            that there were neither one nor two wills, or operations, in <lb/>
            Christ, as if we were to believe that he had neither willed <lb/>
            nor acted. Wherefore Pope Martin, having assembled at <lb/>
            Rome a synod of one hundred and five bishops, excommu­ <lb/>
            nicated Cyrus, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul, the heretics just <lb/>
            mentioned. The exarch Theodore, who was soon afterwards <lb/>
            sent by the emperor, carried off Pope Martin from theLateran, <lb/>
            and conducted him to Constantinople. He was then banished <lb/>
            to the Chersonesus, where he ended his days, and the lustre <lb/>
            of his miracles still continues. The synod above-mentioned <lb/>
            was held in the ninth year of the reign of Constans, in the <lb/>
            month of October, in the eighth indiction. This emperor <lb/>
            sent to Vitalian, recently elected pope, a book of the <lb/>
            gospels, written in letters of gold, and ornamented all <lb/>
            round the cover with diamonds of an extraordinary size, to <lb/>
            be deposited in the church of St. Peter the apostle. A few <lb/>
            yearsafterwards, that is, during the sixth indiction, the same <lb/>
            emperor, on his visit to Rome, offered on the altar of St. <lb/>
            Peter a pall of cloth of gold, and made his whole army <lb/>
            enter the church, each soldier carrying a wax-candle. The <lb/>
            following year, the sun was eclipsed on the 5th of the nones <lb/>

            Theodore and Adrian, the abbot, a man equally learned, <lb/>
            were sent by Vitalian into Britain, where they caused most <lb/>
            of the English churches to bear the fruits of sound doctrine. <lb/>
            Constans, after frequently subjecting the provinces to <lb/>

            These legates were received with the greatest tokens of <lb/>

            church which they required. One hundred and fifty bishops <lb/>
            assembled under the presidency of George, patriarch of the <lb/>
            imperial city, and Macharius, patriarch of Antioch. Those <lb/>
            who pretended that there was but one will and one operation <lb/>
            in Christ, were convicted of running counter to numerous <lb/>
            passages of the Catholic fathers. This debate ended, George <lb/>

            So much favour was shown to these messengers of catholic <lb/>

            held at Constantinople, and its acts written in the Greek <lb/>

            and in the popedom of Celestine, to oppose Nestorius, bishop <lb/>
            of the imperial city.</p>
          <p>The fourth council, that of Chalcedon, consisted of six <lb/>
            hundred and thirty bishops under Pope Leo, in the days of <lb/>
            the Emperor Marcian. Its censures were levelled against <lb/>
            Eutyches, who was at the head of some most unprincipled <lb/>
            monks.2</p>

          <p>Justinian the younger, soil of Constantine, reigned, ten <lb/>
            years. He concluded a truce with the Saracens forten <lb/>
            years, by sea and land. The province of Africa was re- <lb/>
            united to the Roman empire, from which it had been <lb/>
            wrested by the Saracens after they had captured and <lb/>
            destroyed Carthage. The emperor, finding that Sergius, of <lb/>
            happy memory, bishop of the Roman church, would not <lb/>
            ratify and subscribe the acts of the heretical council, which <lb/>
            he had convoked at Constantinople, sent Zacharias, the <lb/>
            captain of his guards, with orders to convey him there; but <lb/>
            the troops of Ravenna and the neighbourhood, opposed the <lb/>
            cruel orders of the prince, and Zacharias was driven out of <lb/>
            Rome, insulted and ill-used.</p>
          <p>In the fourth year of the reign of Justinian, Pepin <lb/>
            became mayor of the palace in France. Pope Sergius <lb/>
            ordained that venerable man Wilbrord, surnamed Clement, <lb/>
            bishop of the Frisians. An Englishman by birth, he quitted <lb/>
            Britain to live amongst the barbarians, every day increasing <lb/>
            the influence of the Christian faith and destroying the <lb/>
            power of Satan. Justinian, deprived for his perfidy of the <lb/>
            imperial dignity, retired, an exile, into Pontus, where he was <lb/>
            hospitably entertained by the abbot Cyrus.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 "For the history of the pious princess Etheldrida, who died in 679, and <lb/>

          <p>Tiberius reigned seven years. The synod of Aquileia, <lb/>
            from its lack of knowledge in the faith, was reluctant to <lb/>
            admit the fifth general council, until it had listened to the <lb/>
            sound instructions of the holy pope, when it consented to <lb/>
            receive it, as the other Christian churches had done. <lb/>
            Grisulf, duke of the Lombards of Beneventum, ravaged <lb/>
            Campania with fire and sword, and reduced a number of the <lb/>
            inhabitants to captivity. As no human power could resist <lb/>
            these violent attacks, Pope John [VI.], who had succeeded <lb/>
            Sergius, sent priests, loaded with presents, who redeemed <lb/>
            the captives and induced the enemy to retire. Another <lb/>
            pope of the same name filled the apostolical chair imme­ <lb/>
            diately after him, and, among other remarkable works, <lb/>
            erected a chapel dedicated to the holy mother of Grod—a <lb/>
            building of great beauty, within the church of the blessed <lb/>
            Peter, prince of the apostles.2</p>
          <p>Aribert [II.], king of the Lombards, restored to the holy <lb/>

            belonged to the apostolic see, but had been long before <lb/>

          <p>Justinian [IT.] reigned six years with his son Tiberius. <lb/>
            Having re-ascended the throne by the assistance of Terbellis, <lb/>
            king of the Bulgarians, he condemned to death the patricians <lb/>
            who had driven him out of his kingdom, as well as Leontius, <lb/>
            who had usurped his sceptre, and Tiberius, his successor, <lb/>
            who bad detained the banished emperor in custody within <lb/>
            the walls of the city, during the whole period of his reign. <lb/>
            He ordered the patriarch Callinichus to be sent to Rome, <lb/>
            after having his eyes put out, and bestowed his bishopric <lb/>
            upon Cyrus, who was abbot in the Chersonesus, and who <lb/>
            had entertained him during his exile. Having sent for <lb/>
            Pope Constantine, he received and dismissed him with great <lb/>
            honour, so much so that, on the Sunday before his <lb/>
            departure, the emperor requested him to say mass in his <lb/>
            presence, and received the sacrament at his hands. Pros­ <lb/>
            trate on the ground, he besought the pope to intercede for <lb/>
            the pardon of his sins; and he also renewed the privileges of <lb/>
            the whole church. The troops which, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            remonstrances of the pope, Justinian had sent into the <lb/>
            Chersonesus to seize the person of Philippicus, banished <lb/>
            there by his orders, suddenly took the part of Philippicus, <lb/>
            and the whole army proclaimed him emperor. On his <lb/>
            return to Constantinople, when near the twelfth milestone <lb/>
            from the city, he joined battle with Justinian, who was <lb/>
            defeated and killed, and Philippicus mounted the throne.2</p>
          <p>Philippicus reigned eighteen months. This emperor <lb/>
            ejected Cyrus from his bishopric, and ordered him to <lb/>
            return to Pontus to resume, as abbot, the government of <lb/>
            his monastery. He addressed to Pope Constantine a mis­ <lb/>
            sive so full of unsound doctrine, that, by the advice of the <lb/>
            apostolic council, Constantine rejected it. In consequence, <lb/>
            he ordered tables, inscribed with the acts of the six œcume­ <lb/>
            nical councils, to be set up in the portico of the church of <lb/>
            St. Peter, as Philippicus had commanded those which were <lb/>
            in the imperial city to be removed. The Roman people, <note type="footnote"> 1 Baronius places this occurrence somewhere about the year 704. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pope Constantine went to Constantinople October 5th, 710, and <lb/>

            also decreed that the name of the heretical emperor should <lb/>
            no longer be used in public documents or on coins; and his <lb/>
            effigy was not placed in the church, nor his name pro­ <lb/>
            nounced in the office of the mass.1</p>
          <p>Anastasius reigned three years. He ordered his prisoner <lb/>
            Philippicus to be deprived of sight, but his life to be spared. <lb/>
            This emperor wrote letters to Pope Constantine, and <lb/>
            commissioned Scolasticus, patrician and exarch of Italy, to <lb/>
            carry them to Rome. In these letters he showed himself <lb/>
            a defender of the Catholic faith, and recognized the validity <lb/>
            of the acts of the sixth holy council. Liutprand, king of <lb/>
            the LOIn bards, admonished by the venerable pope, Gregory <lb/>
            [II.], confirmed the donation of the land situate in the <lb/>
            Cottian Alps, which Aribert had made and Liutprand had <lb/>
            annulled. Wulfran, archbishop of Sens and a monk of <lb/>
            Fontenelle, signalized himself by the many miracles he per­ <lb/>
            formed while preaching the word of God to the Frisians. <lb/>
            Egbert, a holy man of the English nation, and an honour <lb/>
            to the priesthood by his monastic life, while a pilgrim to his <lb/>
            heavenly country, converted several provinces inhabited by <lb/>
            the Scots to the canonical observance of the time for cele­ <lb/>
            brating Easter, from which they had departed for many <lb/>
            years. He preached among them in the year 717 of the <lb/>
            incarnation of our Lord.2</p>
          <p>Theodosius reigned one year.3 Elected emperor,he defeated <lb/>
            Anastasius in a severe engagement near the town of Nice, and <lb/>
            having received his oath of allegiance compelled him to <lb/>
            become a clerk, and be ordained priest. As soon as he was <lb/>
            seated upon the throne, being a Catholic, he replaced in its <lb/>

            removed. The river Tiber overflowed its banks, and caused <lb/>
            much damage in the city of Rome; its waters rose to a <lb/>
            height of about eight feet in the Broad street (viâ latâ), <lb/>
            and formed a wide torrent, extending from St. Peter's gate <lb/>
            to the Milvian bridge. This inundation lasted seven days, <lb/>
            until, the citizens having frequently made processions with <lb/>
            litanies, the river returned at last to its channel on the <lb/>
            eighth day. In those times, it was the custom of great <lb/>
            numbers of the English, high and low, men and women, <lb/>
            persons of rank and private individuals, inspired by the love <lb/>
            of God, to leave Britain and repair to Rome.1</p>
          <p>Leo reigned nine years.2 In the third year of his reign <lb/>
            Charles Martel, son of Pépin, became mayor of the palace, <lb/>
            and, the year following, defeated the tyrant Ragenfred at <lb/>
            Vinci, and after this victory besieged him in Angers. The <lb/>
            Saracens, investing Constantinople with an innumerable <lb/>
            army, besieged the city for the space of three years, until <lb/>
            the inhabitants, having raised their voices to heaven, their <lb/>
            fervent prayers were heard, and the greatest part of the <lb/>
            barbarians perished from hunger, cold, and pestilence ; and <lb/>
            the survivors, disheartened at the length of the siege, retired. <lb/>
            On their return to their own country, the Saracens attacked <lb/>

            the repose of a monastic life in the capital of the Christian world. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has servilely followed Bede in the computation of the years <lb/>
            of the reign of Leo, without reflecting that the English historian, who died <lb/>
            in 735, could not have seen the end of this emperor's reign. This number <lb/>
            of nine years proves that Bede finished his treatise, “On the Six Ages of <lb/>
            the World,”about 726or 727, and consequently four or five years before <lb/>
            his “ Ecclesiastical History" (731). The third year of Leo comprehends <lb/>
            the time between the 25th of March, 719, and the 24th of March, 720; <lb/>
            Charles Martel was named duke of Austrasia in 715, defeated Ragenfred <lb/>
            before Vinci in Cambrai, and besieged Angers in 724. The siege of Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople only lasted one year (Aug. 15, 717—Aug. 15, 718). In the <lb/>
            winter the earth was covered with ice and snow for one hundred and ten <lb/>
            days. The Bulgarians attacked the Saracens at the time they were raising <lb/>
            the siege. The tempest was so dreadful that it is said only five vessels out <lb/>
            of the whole re-entered the ports of Syria. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

          <p>UP to this point I have followed the chronography of the <lb/>
            Englishman Bede, who has brought down his work to the <lb/>
            year 734 of the incarnation of our Lord.2 This Bede, a <lb/>
            priest, and Paul, of Mount Cassino, both monks, and men <lb/>
            of deep learning, among other useful works, have published <lb/>
            in five books the history of their respective nations; they <lb/>
            have clearly made known to us whence the Lombards and <lb/>
            English came, and how the former subdued Italy, while the <lb/>
            latter occupied Britain.3 Henceforth I shall be forced to <lb/>
            make laborious researches through the writings of other <lb/>
            fathers of the church, while I endeavour to bring my history <lb/>
            of past events down to the present day, embittered by so <lb/>
            many and such varied calamities, while two prelates have <lb/>

            venting their fury, to the common loss, by having recourse <lb/>
            to arms, as well as by threats.1</p>
          <p>Constantine, the son of Leo, reigned fifty-eight years.2 <lb/>
            Then Hugh, archbishop of Rouen, gloriously filled the sees <lb/>
            of Paris and Bayeux, and governed the abbeys of Jumièges <lb/>
            and Fontenelle. Carloman and Pepin become mayors of <lb/>
            the palace, and Remi, their brother, having ejected Ragen­ <lb/>
            froi, obtains the archbishopric of Rouen. Constantine and <lb/>
            Abdallah, the emir of the Saracens, are rivals in cruelty <lb/>
            towards the orthodox followers of Christ. Constantine <lb/>
            assembled at Constantinople a council of three hundred and <lb/>
            thirty bishops.3</p>
          <p>In the year 754 of our Lord's incarnation, Stephen, the <lb/>
            pope, no longer able to bear the persecutions of Astolph, king <lb/>
            of the Lombards, escaped to France and was honourably <lb/>
            received by the inhabitants, but fell sick at Paris. As soon <lb/>
            as he was convalescent, he consecrated an altar in the <lb/>
            church of St. Denys, crowned Pepin and his two sons, <lb/>
            Charles and Carloman; and committed the holy church to <lb/>
            their protection against her enemies.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 As our author has mentioned that six years had already elapsed since <lb/>

            written in 1136, the period when the succession to Henri I. was disputed <lb/>
            with fury by Stephen of Blois, his nephew, and Geoffry of Anjou, his son- <lb/>

            He left his crown to his son Charlemagne, who reigned forty- <lb/>

            28, 814). During his first expedition into Italy, he entered Rome on the <lb/>
            2nd of April, 774, and took Desiderius prisoner at Pavia in the month of May <lb/>
            following. It was in 778 that he made himself master of Pampeluna, <lb/>
            besieged Saragossa without taking it, and dismantled Pampeluna on his <lb/>
            return. A different account of Charlemagne's expedition to Spain is given <lb/>
            by the Arabian and some of the Latin historians. The Frank writers gloss <lb/>
            over his severe losses in his retreat at Roncesvalles, rendered memorable <lb/>
            by the death of Roland, the Orlando of Ariosto; and his previous successes <lb/>
            appear to have been partial and transitory. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Leo IV., September 14, 775—September 8 780. Constantius VI., <lb/>

            year ravaged Hungary.1</p>
          <p>In these times, Adrian [I.] and Leo [III.] governed the <lb/>
            holy see forty-eight years, signalizing their pontificates by <lb/>
            their great virtues and services to the church. Constantine <lb/>
            and Leo, and another Constantine, were then emperors, as <lb/>
            we have already stated.2 From the time of Constantine the <lb/>
            Great, the son of Helena, who founded Constantinople, <lb/>
            until the reign of Constantine, the son of Irene, the <lb/>
            emperor of Constantinople governed the Roman empire, <lb/>
            and gave laws to Italy and many other nations speaking <lb/>
            different languages. Several of these emperors were <lb/>
            heretics, and were not raised to the throne by the <lb/>
            lawful exercise of the rights of the people, nor legiti­ <lb/>
            mately elected by the people, but unjustly usurped it by <lb/>
            cruel murders of their masters or their relations ; nor were <lb/>
            they able to defend one half of so vast an empire against <lb/>
            the attacks of the barbarians, who were everywhere in arms <lb/>
            against it. In consequence, Pope Leo, and an assembly of <lb/>
            the senators and people of Rome, concerted measures for the <lb/>
            safety of the state, and by unanimous resolve threw off the <lb/>
            yoke of the emperors of Constantinople, and elected Char­ <lb/>
            lemagne, the powerful king of the Franks, who had long <lb/>
            protected them with great valour, to be emperor of Rome. <lb/>
            Thus, in the fifth year of Pope Leo, which corresponds with <lb/>
            the year 808 of the incarnation of our Lord, king Charle­ <lb/>
            magne became the eighty-third emperor from Augustus, <lb/>
            and the Romans proclaimed him by that august name. He <lb/>
            condemned to death the assailants of Pope Leo, by whom <lb/>
            he had been consecrated; but at the pope's request he <lb/>
            spared their lives, and only banished them to France. <note type="footnote"> 1 This pretended discovery happened in 781. The conquest of Bavaria <lb/>

          <p>Nicephorus I., brother of Irene, reigned six years. He <lb/>

            to the empire which he governed for twenty-seven years <lb/>

          <p>Theophilus reigned eleven years. Lothaire rebelled <lb/>

            crowned at Rheims, and ably governed the kingdom for the <lb/>
            space of seven years. At this time Hugh the Great, of <lb/>
            Orleans, duke of France, raised himself above all the nobles <lb/>
            of France by his riches and power. He married the <lb/>
            daughter of the emperor Otho, by whom he had three sons, <lb/>
            Hugh, Otho, and Henry, and a daughter of the name of <lb/>
            Emma, who married Richard the elder, duke of Normandy, <lb/>
            but died without children.2</p>
          <p>In the second year of the reign of Lothaire, in the month <lb/>
            of August, Hugh the Great besieged the town of Poictiers ; <lb/>
            but through the merits of St. Hilary, bishop and patron of <lb/>
            the town, the Lord caused an awful thunder, while a violent <lb/>
            whirlwind rent the duke's tent, who, struck with a panic, <lb/>
            as well as his army, immediately raised the siege and re­ <lb/>
            treated.3 The same year, Gislebert, duke of Burgundy de­ <lb/>
            parted this life, and Otho, his son-in-law, the son of Hugh <lb/>
            the Great, obtained possession of the duchy, but dying <lb/>
            without children not long afterwards, he was succeeded by <lb/>
            his brother Henry. Then Ansegise, bishop of Troyes, was <lb/>
            driven from his see by Earl Robert, and repaired to the <lb/>
            court of the emperor Otho in Saxony. Returning thence <lb/>
            at the head of an army of Saxons, he laid siege to Troyes <lb/>
            which held out for a considerable time, although he was <lb/>
            ably assisted by the forces of the chiefs, Helpo and Bruno. <lb/>

            battle in which duke Helpo and a number of the Saxons, <lb/>
            were slain. His colleague, Bruno, who was an eye-witness <lb/>
            of their defeat, raised the siege, and returned to his own <lb/>
            country in great sorrow.1</p>
          <p>King Lothaire recovered the kingdom of Lorraine; <lb/>
            he repaired, attended by a numerous army, to the palace <lb/>
            at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the emperor Otho resided with <lb/>
            his queen: he entered at the hour of dinner, no one <lb/>
            trying to prevent him; for Otho, his wife and attend­ <lb/>
            ants, saved themselves by flight, and quietly left him in <lb/>
            possession of the palace. Lothaire after this success re­ <lb/>
            turned to France, and the emperor, assembling an army, <lb/>
            appeared before Paris, and set fire to one of the suburbs, <lb/>
            but his nephew with many of his followers fell by the swords <lb/>
            of the French.2 Lothaire, therefore, calling to his assist­ <lb/>

            attacked their enemies, whom he defeated and pursued as <lb/>
            far as Soissons. The terrified fugitives in their haste threw <lb/>
            themselves headlong into the river Airne, and as they <lb/>
            were not acquainted with the fords, numbers perished; <lb/>

            of Châlons and of Be,-tune in right of his wife Adelaide, drove Bishop <lb/>
            Ansegise out of Troyes about 958. He also took Dijon the following year, <lb/>

            were swollen, and such multitudes perished in the current <lb/>
            that its course was almost choked by their corpses.1 King <lb/>
            Lothaire continued the pursuit of the enemy three days and <lb/>
            three nights. In the end of the same year, contrary to the <lb/>
            wishes of his officers and his army, Lothaire concluded a <lb/>
            peace with the emperor at Rheims, and ceded to him Lor­ <lb/>
            raine, to the great grief of the French.2</p>
          <p>King Lothaire died in the year of our Lord 976, and <lb/>
            was interred at Rheims in the church of St. Remi. His <lb/>
            son Lewis filled the throne eleven years, and at his death <lb/>
            was buried in the church of St. Cornelius, the martyr, at <lb/>
            Compiegne.3 Charles, his brother, claimed the throne ; but <lb/>
            Hugh the Great [Hugh Capet], son of Hugh the Great, <lb/>
            opposed him, and, having raised a numerous army, sat down <lb/>
            before Laon, where Charles resided with his queen. The <lb/>
            king, full of indignation, made a sally at the head of the <lb/>
            garrison, attacked and put to flight the army of Hugh, and <lb/>
            burnt their huts. The duke, perceiving that Charles was <lb/>
            not to be subdued by open warfare, concerted measures <lb/>
            with Ascelin, bishop of Laon, who was the king's adviser. <lb/>
            The bishop, forgetting his age and profession, and not <lb/>
            considering that death was approaching, followed the ex­ <lb/>
            ample of Achitophel and Judas, and did not blush to become <lb/>
            a traitor. During the night, when all the inhabitants were <lb/>
            asleep, he admitted Hugh into the town, who made Charles <lb/>
            and his wife, the daughter of Herbert, earl of Troyes, <lb/>
            prisoners, and condemned them to perpetual captivity in <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 983, Hugh, the duke, was <lb/>
            anointed king at Rheims. In the same year, Robert his <lb/>
            son was crowned king, and reigned thirty-eight years.2 <lb/>
            Hugh was induced by a vision to commit this great crime. <lb/>
            St. Valery appeared to him when he was duke at Lutetia, <lb/>
            the city of the Parisii. He revealed to him in a dream who <lb/>
            he was, and what he wanted, commanding him to undertake <lb/>
            an expedition against Arnold, earl of Flanders, and take his <lb/>
            body out of the monastery of Sithieu, where that of St. <lb/>
            Berlin also lies, and restore it to the convent of Leuconaüs <lb/>
            in the Vimeux. He then promised him that, if he faithfully <lb/>
            obeyed his orders, he and his posterity to the seventh <lb/>
            generation should wear the crown of France. Hugh readily <lb/>
            obeyed the orders of the saint, and, by the will of God, <lb/>
            terrified Arnold with his impetuous courage, recovered and <lb/>
            reverently restored to their tombs the bodies of the vene­ <lb/>
            rable saints Valery and Riquier, which had been carried <lb/>
            away by 'a certain clerk named Erchambald, bribed by the <lb/>
            offer of a large sum of money. The duke himself repaired <lb/>
            to Leuconaüs with the great men of his court, and deposited <lb/>
            the remains of St. Valery in a monastery situate on the <lb/>
            banks of the Somme, and having driven out the secular <lb/>
            canons, filled their places with regular monks. Not long <note type="footnote"> 1 Charles of France, duke of Lorraine, was not brother of Lewis V., as <lb/>
            our author, following Hugh de Fleuri, calls him, but King Lothaire's. <lb/>
            Hugh Capet never bore the title of Great, which was exclusively given to <lb/>
            his father. It was on Good Friday, April 3, 991, that Ascalin or Adal­ <lb/>
            béron, bishop of Laon, opened the gates of that town to him. Agnes de <lb/>
            Vermandois, the second wife of Charles, was the daughter of Herbert III., <lb/>
            count of Vermandois, who was also often called count of Troyes and <lb/>
            Meaux. Their children, Lewis and Charles, who shared their captivity at <lb/>
            Orleans, were still alive in 1009, a period when mentioned with King Robert, <lb/>
            at the commencement of a charter. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The coronation of Hugh Capet took place on the 3rd of July, 987, and <lb/>

            afterwards, as already stated, he usurped the throne, which <lb/>
            his descendants have filled to the present day; for four <lb/>
            kings of his race have reigned up to this moment, namely, <lb/>
            Robert, Henry, Philip, and Lewis.1 Hugh, at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of his reign, convoked a synod at Rheims, to <lb/>
            which he invited Sewin, archbishop of Sens, with his suffra­ <lb/>
            gans, and ordered Arnold, archbishop of Rheims, to be <lb/>
            degraded; declaring that according to the canons of the <lb/>
            church the son of a concubine could not be a bishop. But <lb/>
            in truth he was jealous of Arnold, because he had the royal <lb/>
            blood of Charlemagne in his veins, being the brother of <lb/>
            king Lothaire, although the son of a concubine. He was <lb/>
            not however for this reason the less worthy and unassuming, <lb/>
            but was renowned for his great virtues. But the venerable <lb/>
            Sewin feared God more than the king; he therefore refused <lb/>
            to be a party to the unjust degradation of Arnold; what <lb/>
            was more, as far as lay in his power, he opposed the king's <lb/>
            design. His opposition only incensed the king against <lb/>
            himself and induced him to persist in his unjust project. <lb/>
            However, some other bishops were worked on by their fears, <lb/>
            though with great reluctance, to pronounce the sentence of <lb/>
            degradation on Arnold, and consecrated in his place Ger­ <lb/>
            bert, a monk and philosopher, who had been tutor to king <lb/>
            Robert. In this manner, by the imperious command of the <lb/>
            king, Arnold was deposed, expelled ignominiously from the <lb/>
            church of the blessed Mary, mother of God, and imprisoned <lb/>
            at Orleans for three years. These outrages were soon <lb/>
            brought to the knowledge of the pope, who, being highly <lb/>
            indignant, suspended the bishops who had deposed Arnold <lb/>
            and put Gerbert in his place. He also sent Leo, an abbot, <lb/>
            into France, as the legate of the apostolical see, to remedy <lb/>
            these irregular proceedings. The legate began his labours <lb/>
            by first paying a visit to Sewin at Sens, and communicated <lb/>
            to him the orders of the holy see, knowing him to be a <lb/>
            more strict observer of what was right than the rest. In <note type="footnote"> 1 For information respecting this vision of Hugh Capet, and the events <lb/>

            are considered of great importance, and are carefully filed <lb/>

            was very well read in sacred and profane literature, and <lb/>
            had many illustrious and noble pupils in his school, amongst <lb/>
            whom were, King Robert, Leotheric, archbishop of Sens; <lb/>
            Remi, bishop [monk] of Auxerre; Haimond, and Hubold, <lb/>
            and several others who rank high on the list of learned <lb/>
            men. Bishop Bern! composed a good commentary on the <lb/>
            mass, and published a useful edition of the work of the <lb/>
            grammarian Donatus. Haimond wrote a valuable expo­ <lb/>
            sition on St. Paul's epistles, and commented on the gospels <lb/>
            and other parts of the holy scriptures. Hubold, who was <lb/>
            skilled in music, made the churches echo with the praises <lb/>
            of the Creator, composing a sweet office in praise of the <lb/>
            Holy Trinity, besides a number of hymns in honour of God <lb/>

            he had entered with this prince, and given up the town to his uncle <lb/>
            Charles, competitor with Hugh for the crown, he was arrested at Laon on <lb/>
            the 2nd of April, 991, carried prisoner to Orleans, and deposed in the <lb/>

            liberated, and recovered his bishoprick, which he kept until his death in <lb/>
            1023. It appears that there was no council at Rheims in 995, but only a <lb/>
            preparatory council held at Mouson on the 2nd of June, in which another <lb/>
            was announced to be held at Rheims on the Ist of July, which Hugh Capet, <lb/>
            the protector of Gerbert, probably prevented from taking place. We still <lb/>

            the tenth century, but had no relation with Gerbert. The works that are <lb/>

            Otho, by whom, and the people of Ravenna, he was pro­ <lb/>
            moted to the archiepiscopal see of that town. A few years <lb/>
            afterwards, he was translated to the apostolic see, being <lb/>
            raised to the papal dignity under the name of Silvester [II.] <lb/>
            in the year 909. It is related that when Gerbert was master <lb/>
            of a school, he had a conference with the devil, and inquired <lb/>
            of him what his future career was to be. He immediately <lb/>
            received the following ambiguous answrer:— <lb/>

            clearly see that after a while it was fulfilled, for Gerbert <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">[B. I. CH. XXIV.</note>During the reign of Ethelred the son of Edgar, many <lb/>
            disastrous events happened in England. Sweyn, king of <lb/>
            the Danes, having assembled a numerous fleet, invaded the <lb/>
            country, upon which king Ethelred, being deserted by his <lb/>
            own subjects, who went over to the Danes, escaped into <lb/>
            Normandy with his wife and sons. Emma, his queen, was <lb/>
            the sister of Richard I. [II.], SOIl of Gunnor and duke of <lb/>
            Normandy, and of Robert, archbishop of Rouen. Not long <lb/>
            afterwards, the heathen king, Sweyn, was killed by St. <lb/>
            Edmund, king and martyr, and his body was embalmed, <lb/>
            and carried to Denmark. The Danes were still pagans, <lb/>
            and were terrified at the death of their fierce chief, <lb/>
            whose corpse could not be buried in English ground. <lb/>
            However, king Ethelred, having heard the report of Sweyn's <lb/>
            death, immediately returned to his own country, and, by <lb/>
            fair words and promises, drew to him those who had de­ <lb/>
            serted his standard, and encouraged them to defend them­ <lb/>
            selves better than they had hitherto done. But Canute, the <lb/>
            son of Sweyn, was highly incensed at the flight of his <lb/>
            troops, who had abandoned in such a cowardly manner the <lb/>
            noble kingdom of England, which they had already subdued; <lb/>
            he therefore equipped a powerful fleet, and Olave, king of <lb/>
            Norway, with Lacman, king of Sweden, crossing over to <lb/>
            England, laid siege to London. At that time king Ethelred <lb/>
            was lying sick, and soon afterwards died there ; and Edmund, <lb/>
            his son, surnamed Ironside, was raised to the throne. Many <lb/>
            battles were fought between the English and the Danes <lb/>
            with uncertain results, and much blood was shed on both <lb/>
            sides. At last, through the well-directed efforts of some <lb/>
            prudent men, the two princes agreed on the terms of peace <lb/>
            so necessary to the welfare of their subjects. Canute em­ <lb/>
            braced Christianity, and received for his wife Emma, the <lb/>
            widow of King Ethelred, with one-half of the kingdom. <lb/>
            By her he had Hardicanutc, who became king of England, <lb/>
            and Gunnilda, who married Henry III., emperor of the <lb/>

            the cruel Edric Streon; and Canute obtained the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty of the whole of England, which he enjoyed until <lb/>

            them off as his nephews. There Child Edmund prematurely <lb/>

            contrary. After a severe struggle, Canute, son and successor of Sweyn, <lb/>
            shared the kingdom with Edmund Ironside, the son and successor of <lb/>
            Ethelred, in 1016, marrying at the same time the widow of the latter. <lb/>
            Edmund did not long hold the kingdom of Wessex, his share under the <lb/>
            treaty, as we shall presently see. As for Lacman and Olave (see William <lb/>
            of Jumièges, lib. v. ch. 11), the first, who appears to be quite an imaginary <lb/>
            personage, could not be king of Sweden at that period, as the throne was <lb/>
            filled by Olave, surnamed the Infant, who died in 1026. Olave II., king <lb/>
            of Norway, far from taking part in the expedition of Canute, had recovered <lb/>
            his dominions from him in 1015, and never ceased to be his most inveterate <lb/>
            enemy. Chunelind, daughter of Canite, here named Gunnilda, married, <lb/>

            The two words have the same meaning, a noble youth. Child, as Child- <lb/>

            his father's throne, invited them over to England, and <lb/>
            brought them up with as much care as if they had been <lb/>
            his own children.1</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1031, Robert, king of the French, <lb/>
            died, and Henry his son, supported by Robert, duke of <lb/>

            sition of Queen Constance and his younger brother Robert, <lb/>
            and others of the French. His reign lasted twenty-nine <lb/>
            years.2</p>
          <p>Robert, duke of Normandy, died on the calends [1st] <lb/>
            of July, in the fifth year of his reign, at Nice, a town of <lb/>
            Bithynia, on his return from Jerusalem, and William the <lb/>
            bastard, his son, a boy only eight years old, succeeded <lb/>
            to his dukedom, which he ably governed for fifty years.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Edmund Ironsido succeeded his father Ethelred II., who died on the <lb/>

            the grossest improbabilities, or even impossibilities. Thus our author <lb/>
            makes Canute send them to his brother Sweyn, king of Denmark, but he <lb/>
            never had a brother of that name, and the prince who shared with him <lb/>
            the throne of Denmark from 1014 to 1017, was called Harold. Other <lb/>
            historians call this Sweyn king of Sweden, but the king of Sweden con­ <lb/>
            temporary with Canute, bore the name of Olave; lastly, they say one <lb/>
            of the exiled princes married the sister of Solomon, king of Hungary, and <lb/>
            our author even makes him reign over that country; and they marry the <lb/>
            other to the daughter of the Emperor Henry II., sister-in-law to the king <lb/>
            of Sweden. But Solomon did not ascend the throne before 1063, nearly <lb/>
            fifty years after the princes were banished from England, and had only one <lb/>
            sister, Adelaide, wife of Wratislas, king of Poland. What we know with <lb/>
            certainty is, that the sons of Edmund took refuge in Hungary, whence the <lb/>
            youngest returned to England, with his three children, in the reign of <lb/>
            Edward the Confessor, his uncle, about the year 1055. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 King Robert died on the 20th of July, 1031. It is certain that the <lb/>

            1035, and consequently in the fourth year of the reign of Henry I. Our <lb/>

            from Lorraine. While on the road, one night as he was <lb/>
            praying, he heard angels singing:—“ I think toward you, <lb/>
            saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil.”2 Bruno <lb/>
            having attained the end of his journey, was honourably <lb/>
            received by Pope Damasus, and ordained cardinal-bishop <lb/>
            in a conclave. He was noble in person as well as descent, <lb/>
            wise and eloquent, and adorned with many virtues. The <lb/>
            same year Pope Damasus died, and Bruno, who took the <lb/>
            name of Leo, was elected pope. He made great efforts to <lb/>
            revise the decisions of the holy canons which had fallen into <lb/>
            disuse in times past, through the negligence of the kings <lb/>
            and pontiffs already mentioned, and were almost forgotten. <lb/>
            He therefore held a very important council at Rheims in <lb/>
            the year 1050, in which chastity and righteousness were <lb/>
            enforced in the ministers of God, and several decrees <lb/>
            necessary to the welfare of the church renewed, though the <lb/>
            bishops and priests were ignorant of their existence. He <lb/>
            also, at the request of Hérimart, the abbot, consecrated the <lb/>
            church of St. Remigius, archbishop of Rheims, on the <lb/>

            and the duke of the Normans. William D'Arques, uncle <lb/>
            of the duke, had rebelled against him, and by the advice of <lb/>
            Mauger, his brother, archbishop of Rouen, had requested <lb/>
            the aid of King Henry. The brave duke immediately in­ <lb/>
            vested the town of Arques, and, marching against Engelran, <lb/>
            count of Ponthieu, who attempted to throw relief into the <lb/>
            place, killed the earl, and, after taking Arques, disinherited <lb/>
            his uncle, and ordered Mauger, the author of these dissen­ <lb/>
            sions, to be degraded. The king of France chafed with <lb/>
            indignation upon hearing this news, and, in 1054, entered <lb/>
            the territory of Evreux, at the head of a numerous army, <lb/>
            while he made his brother Eudes cross the Seine with a <lb/>

            d'Eu, and Roger de Mortemer. They came up with the <lb/>

          <p>WHEN the fulness of time was come, the divine grace, <lb/>
            mercifully announced to mankind the saving visitation <lb/>
            which was provided before the creation of the world, and <lb/>
            towards its last age illuminated the dark recesses of the <lb/>
            hearts of men with the rays of a new light. Our Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, as the sublime voice of the holy gospel truly <lb/>
            informs us, in the fifteenth year of the emperor Tiberius <lb/>
            Cæsar, was baptized by John in the river Jordan; and the <lb/>
            true sun shone forth by visible signs and wonders for three <lb/>
            years and a half, and manifested to the world his divine <lb/>
            nature, by which be is co-equal, consubstantial, and co- <lb/>
            eternal, with the Father and the Holy Ghost. Afterwards, <lb/>
            in his mercy, he suffered on the cross in the thirty-third <lb/>
            year of his age,1 for the salvation of man; and, having <lb/>
            destroyed death, which for five thousand years had kept <lb/>
            mankind fast bound in the chains of a just damnation, be <lb/>
            despoiled hell, and, having vanquished Satan, the old serpent, <lb/>
            on the third day rose triumphantly from the dead. Lastly, <lb/>
            on the fortieth day, after he had confirmed the belief of the <lb/>
            faithful witnesses in his resurrection, by often showing him­ <lb/>
            self to them openly, and commanded them to preach the <lb/>
            gospel to all nations, giving them power to perform miracles, <lb/>
            he led the disciples forth as far as Bethany, and, standing <lb/>
            on mount Olivet, blessed them, and while they beheld with <lb/>
            joy, ascended into heaven. Ten days afterwards, while <lb/>
            his friends were fasting and continuing in prayer with one <lb/>
            accord, he sent to them the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and <lb/>
            according to his promise instantly, by an internal unction, <lb/>
            he taught them all things, gloriously filled them with all <lb/>
            spiritual powers, strengthened them against all the assaults <note type="footnote"> 1 “ The baptism of Christ took place at the commencement of the <lb/>

            the faithful in Greece, added the noble volume of the Acts <lb/>
            of the Apostles, which he addressed to Theophilus. The <lb/>
            word means a lover of God, and may be applied to all who <lb/>
            are studious and intelligent, and unceasingly devoted to <lb/>
            meditation on the divine law. To such the word of God <lb/>
            is justly addressed, and they eagerly receive it and hold it <lb/>

            flamed with zeal for the faith, stood up with the eleven, and, <lb/>
            lifting up his voice, explained that the coming of the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost the Comforter had been foretold long before by the <lb/>
            prophet Joel. He supported the truth of his declaration, that <lb/>
            Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God by miracles, and <lb/>
            wonders and signs, was raised from the dead three days after <lb/>
            his passion on the cross, by reference to predictions in the <lb/>
            Psalms. The Jews were pricked in their heart, and, receiv­ <lb/>
            ing the word to the salvation of their souls, were baptized; <lb/>
            and the same day there were added about three thousand <lb/>
            souls to the number of the believers.1 Such was the origin <lb/>
            of the primitive church, on which the heavenly grace was <lb/>
            abundantly bestowed.</p>
          <p>Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles at <lb/>
            Jerusalem, and all those who saw these extraordinary things <lb/>
            trembled with fear. And they that believed lived together, <lb/>
            and had all things common. They sold their possessions <lb/>
            and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had <lb/>
            need. Every day the faithful increased in virtue, while the <lb/>
            Lord added continually to the number of those who were to <lb/>
            be saved.</p>
          <p>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple <lb/>
            at the ninth hour, and there saw a beggar who bad been <lb/>
            lame from his mother's womb. Peter told the indigent man <lb/>
            that he possessed no earthly riches, but offered him some­ <lb/>
            thing more valuable; and, taking him by the hand, presently <lb/>
            healed him in the name of Jesus Christ. Immediately his <lb/>
            feet and ankle-bones received strength, so that he leaped up <lb/>
            and ran, and entered with them into the temple, rejoicing <lb/>
            and praising God before all the people, who were filled with <lb/>
            wonder and amazement when they saw this special miracle <lb/>
            performed in the name of Jesus Christ on the lame man, <lb/>
            who was laid daily at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. <lb/>
            While the apostles were thus employed, the people ran <lb/>
            together to Solomon's porch, to see him who had just been <lb/>
            healed by the virtue of the name of Christ. Seeing the <lb/>
            multitude assembled, Peter opened his mouth and humbly <lb/>
            disclaimed the merit of the cure, which he wholly ascribed to <lb/>
            the divine nature of Jesus Christ. Mildly rebuking the <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts ii. 1—41. (Year 33 of the Christian era.) <lb/>

            haustible mercy of his Master, he mildly excused them, <lb/>
            because they did it through ignorance. At the end of his <lb/>
            discourse, he exhorted them to repent of their sins, and <lb/>
            proved to them in the clearest manner that the Saviour and <lb/>
            true Prophet had already come, as Moses, and Samuel, and <lb/>
            all the prophets had predicted long before</p>
          <p>As they spake unto the people, the priests, and the cap­ <lb/>
            tain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, and, <lb/>
            laying hands upon them, put them in hold; for, being filled <lb/>
            with the bitterness of iniquity, they were grieved that the <lb/>
            apostles taught the people, and preached, through Jesus, <lb/>
            the resurrection from the dead. Many of them which <lb/>
            beard the word believed; and the number of the men was <lb/>
            about five thousand. On the morrow, Annas, the high <lb/>

            rulers, and elders, and scribes, were gathered together at <lb/>
            Jerusalem. And when they bad set them in the midst, they <lb/>
            asked: " By what power, or in what name, have ye done <lb/>
            this?" Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, testified <lb/>
            clearly that the impotent man was made whole by the <lb/>
            name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and that there was <lb/>
            none other name given under heaven whereby we must be <lb/>
            saved. Now when their adversaries saw the boldness of <lb/>
            Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned <lb/>
            and ignorant men, they marvelled, and were grieved; and <lb/>
            they took knowledge of them, that they had been with <lb/>
            Jesus. And beholding the man which was healed standing <lb/>
            with them, they could say nothing against the miracle, <lb/>
            as it was manifest to all who were in Jerusalem, they were <lb/>
            consumed with rage. Afterwards, having taken counsel, <lb/>
            they called the apostles, and commanded them not to speak <lb/>
            at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John <lb/>
            refused to obey their injunction, saying with great boldness : <lb/>
            “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto <lb/>
            you more than unto God; judge ye. For we cannot but <lb/>
            speak the things which we have seen and heard." The <lb/>
            assembly then sent them away with threats, but not daring <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts ii. 42—iii. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. CH. I.</note><lb/>
            to punish them, as they perceived that the great miracle <lb/>
            which they had just performed had gained them the favour <lb/>
            of the people. On regaining their liberty, the apostles went <lb/>
            to their own company, and reported all that had befallen <lb/>
            them. And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice <lb/>
            to God with one accord, and, inspired with holy zeal, offered a <lb/>
            signal prayer of thanks to God. And when they had prayed, <lb/>
            the place was shaken where they were assembled together, <lb/>
            and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost; and the nets <lb/>
            spread by their holy preaching drew many from the abyss of <lb/>
            error to the light of faith and righteousness.1</p>
          <p>And the multitude of them that believed were of one <lb/>
            heart and of one soul: neither said any that aught of the <lb/>
            things which he possessed was his own, neither was there <lb/>
            any among them that lacked; but they had all things in <lb/>
            common. The possessors of houses and lands sold them, and <lb/>
            laid the price of them down at the apostles' feet; and distri­ <lb/>
            bution was made unto every man according as he had need. <lb/>
            The primitive church at Jerusalem shone thus brightly, <lb/>
            all its aspirations being fervently directed heaven-ward. <lb/>
            The blessing of God sanctified this happy society, whence <lb/>
            originated the excellent institutions which have come down <lb/>
            to us. Joseph [Joses], who by the apostles was surnamed <lb/>
            Barnabas, that is to say, the son of consolation, a Levite, of <lb/>
            the country of Cyprus, ever ready in good works, having <lb/>
            land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the <lb/>
            apostles' feet. Ananias also sold a field, but kept back part <lb/>
            of the price, his wife Sapphira being privy to it, and brought <lb/>
            a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. When <lb/>
            this fraud was revealed to Peter by the Holy Ghost, the <lb/>
            apostle rebuked the man who endeavoured to deceive him <lb/>
            by a lie. Ananias had scarcely heard the apostle's repri­ <lb/>
            mand, when he fell down and gave up the ghost. And <lb/>
            about the space of three hours after, his wife, not knowing <lb/>
            what was done, came in, and, when Peter questioned her <lb/>
            as to the price of the land, she also told a lie, and being <lb/>
            rebuked by the apostle, fell down straightway at his feet, <lb/>
            and yielded up the ghost. And great fear came upon all the <lb/>
            church, and upon as many as heard these things.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts iv. 1—34. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2Acts v. 1—11. </note> <pb n="165"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">A.D. 33.]</note>By the hands of the apostles were many signs and <lb/>
            wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with <lb/>
            one accord in Solomon's porch. However, of the rest durst <lb/>
            no man join himself to them, but the people magnified <lb/>
            them. The number of men and women who believed in the <lb/>
            Lord increased more and more. In the streets the sick were <lb/>
            laid on couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing <lb/>
            by might overshadow some of them, and free them from <lb/>
            their infirmities. Great numbers of the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            neighbouring towns hastened together to Jerusalem, bring­ <lb/>
            ing to the apostles the sick and those who were possessed <lb/>
            with the devil, and they all recovered the health they <lb/>
            desired.1</p>
          <p>The high priest and all they that were with him were <lb/>
            filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles, <lb/>
            and put them in the common prison. But the angel of the <lb/>
            Lord opened the prison doors by night, and bringing them <lb/>
            forth, said, “ Go, stand and speak to the people in the <lb/>
            temple all the words of this life." They accordingly <lb/>
            entered into the temple early in the morning, and there <lb/>
            preached the word of God with boldness. But the high <lb/>
            priest and they that were with him called the council <lb/>
            together, and sent to the prison to have them brought. <lb/>
            The officers truly found the prison shut with all safety, but <lb/>
            no man within. At length, they beard that the men of whom <lb/>
            they were in search were teaching in the temple. Then the <lb/>
            captain and the officers brought them without violence, <lb/>
            for they feared the people, lest they should have been <lb/>
            stoned. When they had set them before the council, the <lb/>
            high priest accused them of having filled Jerusalem with <lb/>
            a doctrine which was contrary to their tenets, and opposed <lb/>
            to the universal decisions of the elders. The apostles <lb/>
            therefore answered, "We ought to obey God rather than <lb/>
            man. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye <lb/>
            slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with <lb/>
            his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, and to give <lb/>
            repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. We are <lb/>
            witnesses of those things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, <lb/>
            whom God hath given to them that obey him." When they <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts v. 12—16. </note> <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. I.</note><lb/>
            heard'that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel <lb/>
            to slay them.1</p>
          <p>Then there stood up one of the council, a Pharisee <lb/>
            named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, who was held in repu­ <lb/>
            tation among all the people, who, causing the apostles to be <lb/>
            removed from the assembly, as he wished to be of service to <lb/>
            them, then plainly recounted how, only a few days before, <lb/>
            Theudas with four hundred followers was brought to nought, <lb/>
            and how Judas the Galilean, who drew away much people after <lb/>
            him, perished in the days of the taxing, with all his faction. <lb/>
            After having adduced examples of this kind, he con­ <lb/>
            tinued : " And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, <lb/>
            and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be <lb/>
            of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God ye <lb/>
            cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight <lb/>
            against God." Having heard this, they concurred in <lb/>
            Gamaliel's opinion, and having recalled the apostles and <lb/>
            beaten them, commanded that they should not speak in the <lb/>
            name of Jesus, and let them go. And they departed from <lb/>
            the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were <lb/>
            counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ. <lb/>
            And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased <lb/>
            not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>In those days, as the number of the disciples was <lb/>
            continually on the increase, there arose a murmuring of <lb/>
            the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows <lb/>
            were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve <lb/>
            called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said: <lb/>
            " It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and <lb/>
            serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you <lb/>
            seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and <lb/>
            wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we <lb/>
            will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the <lb/>
            ministry of the word." This advice was unanimously <lb/>
            adopted, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost, Philip and Prochorus, Nicanor and <lb/>
            Timotheus, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch; <lb/>
            and set them before the apostles, who, when they had prayed, <lb/>
            laid their hands on them. The number of the disciples <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts v. 17—33. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Acts v. 34—42. </note> <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 34.]</note><lb/>
            multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the <lb/>
            priests were obedient to the faith.1</p>
          <p>Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and <lb/>
            miracles among the people. The Jews, therefore, moved <lb/>
            with envy, rose up against him, and disputed with him, but <lb/>
            were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which <lb/>
            he spoke. Then they suborned false witnesses, who asserted <lb/>
            that they had heard him speak blasphemous words against <lb/>
            Moses and against God. And they stirred up the people, <lb/>
            and the elders, and the scribes, and arresting him, brought <lb/>
            him before the council, and began to accuse him. And all <lb/>
            that sat in the council saw his face, as it had been the face <lb/>
            of an angel. Being examined by the high priest, Stephen <lb/>
            made an eloquent reply, and boldly unfolded the history of <lb/>
            the fathers with great wisdom, expatiating fitly on the <lb/>
            merits of Abraham, Moses, and the other patriarchs, and <lb/>
            concluding with an account of many great events in a few <lb/>
            words. He then rebuked the unbelievers, and those who <lb/>
            despised the law, calling them plainly stiff-necked and <lb/>
            uncircumcised in heart and ears, who always resisted <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost, and persecuted the prophets. When <lb/>
            they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and <lb/>
            gnashed on him with their teeth. But he, being full <lb/>
            of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven <lb/>
            and saw the glory of God, and said: " Behold, I see <lb/>
            the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the <lb/>
            right hand of God." Then they cried out with a loud <lb/>
            voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one <lb/>
            accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and <lb/>
            the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet <lb/>
            whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, calling <lb/>
            upon God, and saying: " Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." <lb/>
            And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice: " Lord, <lb/>
            lay not this sin to their charge." And when he had said <lb/>
            this, he fell asleep in the Lord.2 This happened in the <lb/>
            second year of our Lord's ascension, on the seventh of the <lb/>
            calends of January [December 26]. Devout men then <lb/>
            carried the corpse of the first martyr to Gamaliel's country <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts vi. 1—7. Our author, in his list of the seven deacons, inserts <lb/>
            Timotheus instead of Timon. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts vi. 8—vii. 60. </note> <pb n="168"/>

            house, which is called Caphargamala, where they buried him <lb/>
            with respect, and made great lamentation over him. Nico­ <lb/>
            demus, Gamaliel, and Abibas, were afterwards interred in the <lb/>
            same spot. This great treasure remained concealed there for <lb/>
            three centuries, until the priest Lucian discovered it by a <lb/>
            revelation from God; and John, bishop of Jerusalem, <lb/>
            ordered it to be carried to that city, in the seventh year of <lb/>
            the reign of the emperor Honorius [A.D. 415].1</p>
          <p>After Stephen was stoned, a great persecution arose <lb/>
            against the church at Jerusalem, and they were all scat­ <lb/>
            tered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, <lb/>
            except the apostles. But during this dispersion, the dis­ <lb/>
            ciples, strengthened by the Holy Ghost, passed into several <lb/>
            countries, and there preached the word of God. Then <lb/>
            Philip preached Christ in Samaria, and wrought before his <lb/>
            hearers many wonderful works in the name of Christ, healing <lb/>
            the paralytic, the lame, and those possessed with a devil. <lb/>
            The Samaritans gave heed with one accord unto the things <lb/>
            which Philip spake, and received the true faith with great <lb/>
            alacrity. Then Simon Magus (who had long bewitched the <lb/>
            people of Samaria, and blinded them with his sorceries to <lb/>
            such a degree that these deluded men looked upon him as <lb/>
            some great one, and called him the great power of God) <lb/>
            believed also when he heard Philip preaching the things <lb/>
            concerning the kingdom of God. Being baptized in com­ <lb/>
            pany with other men and women in the name of Jesus <lb/>
            Christ, Simon continued with Philip, and beholding the <lb/>
            signs and great miracles which were wrought, marvelled <lb/>
            much at things so extraordinary.2</p>
          <p>Now when the apostles, which were at Jerusalem, heard <lb/>
            that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto <lb/>
            them Peter and John, who, when they were come down, <lb/>
            prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.. <lb/>
            Then laid they their hands on those who were baptized, <lb/>
            and they received the Holy Ghost.3 Hence proceeds the <lb/>
            institution of the church, that, after the catechumens have <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author is mistaken as to the time of St. Stephen's martyrdom, <lb/>
            which happened only about nine months after our Lord's death. As to <lb/>

            received the sacrament of baptism from the priest, the <lb/>
            bishop shall lay hands on them, offering up prayers in their <lb/>
            behalf, and anointing them with the chrism; and thus the <lb/>
            confirmation of those who are baptized is completed by the <lb/>
            gift of the sevenfold graces of the Holy Spirit. When <lb/>
            Simon saw that, through the laying on of the apostles' hands <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, say­ <lb/>
            ing, " Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay <lb/>
            hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost." But Peter said <lb/>
            unto him : " Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast <lb/>
            thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. <lb/>
            Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart <lb/>
            is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this <lb/>
            thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of <lb/>
            thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that <lb/>
            thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of ini­ <lb/>
            quity." But Simon, making light of the apostle's words, <lb/>
            left him, and became an apostate, and for a long time pro­ <lb/>
            voked the anger of God by his innumerable crimes. The <lb/>
            apostles, when they had spoken the word of the Lord, <lb/>
            returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many <lb/>
            parts of Samaria.1</p>
          <p>At the command of an angel of the Lord, Philip went to <lb/>
            meet Candace, the eunuch who had the charge of all the <lb/>
            treasure of the queen of the Ethiopians, as he was returning <lb/>
            from Jerusalem; and having mounted the chariot, sat by <lb/>
            him, and expounded to him the book of the prophet Isaiah <lb/>
            which he was reading; and commencing with the prediction <lb/>
            of the slaughter of the unresisting Lamb, preached unto him <lb/>
            Jesus. The eunuch, listening to him with pleasure, readily <lb/>
            comprehended and believed him, and, as soon as they found <lb/>
            water, was baptized; and then returned to his own country, <lb/>
            rejoicing in his renewal by holy regeneration. But the <lb/>
            Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, who preached the <lb/>
            gospel in all the cities from Azotus to Cæsarea.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts viii. 18—25. The account given in the Acts of the Apostles <lb/>
            ends very differently: " Then answered Simon and said, Pray ye to the <lb/>

            me." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts viii. 26—40. Our author has confused the name of the eunuch <lb/>

            hands upon him, comforted him, restored his sight, and <lb/>
            baptized him. Thus Saul, who before had ravened as a <lb/>
            wolf, and was a cruel persecutor of the church, became <lb/>
            not only a lamb, but fearless as a ram, a chosen vessel, and <lb/>
            the teacher of the Gentiles. He immediately entered the <lb/>
            synagogues, and preached Jesus, that he is the Son of God, <lb/>
            to the great amazement of all present, who remembered the <lb/>
            bigotry with which in times past he had zealously followed <lb/>
            the traditions of the fathers.1</p>
          <p>Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded <lb/>
            the Jews which dwelt at Damascus. But his faithful testi­ <lb/>
            mony roused their implacable hatred against him; so much <lb/>
            so, that a short time after they narrowly searched for him, <lb/>
            intending to kill him, and placed sentries day and night <lb/>
            at the gates of the city, to prevent his escape. But the <lb/>
            disciples, discovering the schemes of his enemies, defeated <lb/>
            their projects by letting him down by the wall, in a basket, <lb/>
            during the night. When Saul was come to Jerusalem, <lb/>
            lie endeavoured to join himself to the disciples; but they <lb/>
            were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a <lb/>
            disciple. But Barnabas took him, brought him to the <lb/>
            disciples, and related to them how he had seen the Lord <lb/>
            in the way, and told them all the other things that bad <lb/>
            happened, and Saul faithfully attached himself to the disci­ <lb/>
            ples. He, therefore, returned thanks to God, and continued <lb/>
            with them coming in and going out, doing every thing boldly. <lb/>
            in the name of the Lord Jesus. He disputed against the <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts ix. 1—21. </note> <pb n="171"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 35.]</note><lb/>
            Grecians, confounded the Jews, and by God's help refuted <lb/>
            them all. The leaders among them, thus baffled in argu­ <lb/>
            ment, were so enraged at Saul, that they tried to kill him. <lb/>
            Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to <lb/>
            Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. Then had the <lb/>
            churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, <lb/>
            and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, were <lb/>
            filled with the comfort of the Holy Ghost; and the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of believers increased.1</p>
          <p>The apostle Peter healed at Lydda a man sick of the <lb/>
            palsy, named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years. <lb/>
            And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sal'on, when they wit­ <lb/>
            nessed this miracle, turned to the Lord. At Joppa, <lb/>
            Tabitha, full of good works and alms-deeds, died, and was <lb/>
            laid by the brethren in an upper chamber. The disci­ <lb/>
            ples, hearing that Peter was at Joppa, which was not far <lb/>
            from Lydda, sent unto him two men, desiring him to come <lb/>
            to them. As soon as he received the message of the breth­ <lb/>
            ren, he humbly obeyed the summons. When Peter was <lb/>
            come, all the widows stood round him weeping, and showing . <lb/>
            the coats and garments which Dorcas made for them. But <lb/>
            Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and <lb/>
            turning to the body said, " Tabitha, arise." And she opened <lb/>
            her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up, and be, giving <lb/>
            her his hand, lifted her up, and presented her alive to the <lb/>
            saints and widows. This miracle was known throughout <lb/>
            all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord !2</p>
          <p>Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort, called the Italian <lb/>
            band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his <lb/>
            house, was constantly employed in acts of charity and <lb/>
            prayers for his eternal welfare. This man saw plainly in a <lb/>
            vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God, <lb/>
            and as he regarded him with deep awe, heard him say, " Cor­ <lb/>
            nelius, thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memo­ <lb/>
            rial before God." The angel then commanded him to send <lb/>
            for Simon Peter, who would give him saving advice. He <lb/>
            therefore immediately obeyed the order, and sent three men <lb/>
            to Peter. On the morrow, as they drew nigh unto the city, <lb/>
            Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth <lb/>
            hour. While he was fasting, and his thoughts were dwelling <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts ix. 22—31,</note> <note type="footnote">2 Acts ix. 32—42. </note> <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. I."/><lb/>
            on heavenly things, he saw in a trance heaven opened, and <lb/>
            a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great <lb/>
            sheet, knit at the four corners, and let down from heaven to <lb/>
            the earth, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and <lb/>
            creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air. And <lb/>
            there came a voice to him, saying, " Rise, Peter, kill and <lb/>
            eat." But Peter said, " Not so, Lord; for I have never <lb/>
            eaten any thing that is common or unclean." And the <lb/>
            voice spake unto him again the second time, “What the <lb/>
            Lord bath cleansed, that call not thou common.”This was <lb/>
            done thrice, and the vessel was immediately received up <lb/>
            again into heaven. By this revelation the conversion of the <lb/>
            Gentiles through the four climates of the world, in every <lb/>
            language and nation, was divinely intimated to Peter; and <lb/>
            he was plainly taught by God himself not to reject any one <lb/>
            who wished to be converted. Re-assured and joyful, he <lb/>
            hospitably received in the house of Simon the tanner the <lb/>
            messengers of Cornelius, and on the following day accom­ <lb/>
            panied them to Cæsarea of Palestine. On his arrival there, <lb/>
            , he found Cornelius, with his kinsmen and intimate friends <lb/>
            expecting him, and as they were ready to hear him preach <lb/>
            and obey his words, he kindly complied with their wishes.1</p>
          <p>Peter, therefore, opening his mouth, said: “Of a truth I <lb/>
            perceive that God is no respecter of persons ;but in every <lb/>
            nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is <lb/>
            accepted with him. He sent his word unto the children <lb/>
            of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord <lb/>
            of all." When Peter had proclaimed these and many other <lb/>
            things, respecting the advent of our Saviour and eternal life, <lb/>
            and had supplied the thirsty souls with copious draughts of <lb/>
            the water of life from the fountain of heavenly doctrine, <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost fell on all who heard the word, and <lb/>
            suddenly conferred upon them the gift of languages. Then <lb/>
            Peter, to the great surprise of those of the circumcison who <lb/>
            had accompanied him, baptized Cornelius and all those who <lb/>
            believed with him.2</p>
          <p>In compliance with the invitation of his distinguished <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts x. 1—33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts x. 34—48. There is a slight difference in the two accounts. <lb/>

            converts, Peter remained some days at Cæsarea, and having <lb/>
            confirmed them in the faith, went up to Jerusalem, where <lb/>
            he related to his fellow apostles the conversion of the <lb/>
            Gentiles. Then certain men that were of the circumcision, <lb/>
            contended with him, saying, " Why wentest thou in to men <lb/>
            uncircumcised, and didst eat with them ?" But Peter began <lb/>
            to explain to them, in regular order, how, while fasting and <lb/>
            praying in the city of Joppa, he had seen a vision in a <lb/>
            trance, wherein God showed him the calling and conversion <lb/>
            of the Gentiles, and promised his aid; giving them, further, <lb/>
            a simple account of all that had happened. When they <lb/>
            heard these things, they held their peace; and being full <lb/>
            of brotherly love, praised and glorified God, who saves <lb/>
            even Gentiles through repentance. The faithful of Cyprus <lb/>
            and Cyrene, and others, who were scattered abroad by the <lb/>
            persecution that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as <lb/>
            Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to <lb/>
            none but Jews. But when they were come to Antioch, <lb/>
            they made known the Lord Jesus to the Greeks, and a <lb/>
            great number believed and turned to the Lord. The church <lb/>
            which was in Jerusalem hearing this, rejoiced in the Lord, <lb/>
            and sent forth Barnabas, a good man, and full of the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost and of faith, who, when he came to Antioch, and had <lb/>
            seen the grace of God, was glad, and having comforted the <lb/>
            disciples, departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul. From thence <lb/>
            they both went together to Antioch, where they frequented <lb/>
            the church a whole year, and taught much people. And <lb/>
            the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</p>
          <p>Then one of the prophets who came from Jerusalem, of the <lb/>
            name of Agabus, predicted by inspiration that there would <lb/>
            be a great dearth, upon which Saul and Barnabas, having <lb/>
            received from their brethren the contributions intended for <lb/>
            the relief of the saints, were despatched to Jerusalem.2</p>
          <p>Tiberius Cæsar reigned about twenty-two years. In the <lb/>
            eighteenth year of his reign, as history correctly states, our <lb/>
            Lord Jesus Christ suffered on the cross, rose again from the <lb/>
            dead, performed, in an ineffable manner, many miracles, <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xi. 1—26. This famine, which is mentioned before, book i. pp. <lb/>
            85, 86, was predicted A.D. 43, began in 44, and continued to desolate the <lb/>
            East for several years. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts xi. 27—30. </note> <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. I."/><lb/>
            which becoming known far and wide throughout the world, <lb/>
            were the subject of a report from Pilate to Tiberius; <lb/>
            adding, that on account of the innumerable wonders effected <lb/>
            in his name, Christ was already looked upon as a God. <lb/>
            Tiberius informed the senate of all that had come to his <lb/>
            knowledge. But this body, we are told, as Tertullian writes <lb/>
            in his Apology, showed nothing but contempt for Christ, <lb/>
            because the judgment of this affair had not been referred at <lb/>
            first to it, but the decision of the mob had anticipated its <lb/>
            authority. For, according to an ancient law, no one could <lb/>
            be considered a god amongst the Romans, if the title was <lb/>
            not confirmed by a decree of the senate. Moreover, as <lb/>
            Eusebius of Cæsarea assures us, in the second book of his <lb/>
            "Ecclesiastical History,”what had taken place was neces­ <lb/>
            sary to prevent our thinking that the divine power has <lb/>
            any need of the support of human laws. As we have just <lb/>
            stated, the senate refusing to acknowledge Christ, Tiberius <lb/>
            maintained his own opinion, and forbade any one from <lb/>
            offering molestation to the Christians.1 Divine Providence, <lb/>
            no doubt, inspired the emperor with this determination, in <lb/>
            order that, at first, the preaching of the gospel might be <lb/>
            universally extended without opposition. The consequence <lb/>
            was that suddenly, like light flashing from heaven, or the rays <lb/>
            of the rising sun, the word of God illuminated the whole <lb/>
            world with the brightness of its divine light, that the pro­ <lb/>
            phecy might be accomplished, which said, " Their sound <lb/>
            went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends o. <lb/>
            the world.” 2 From that time, in every town, and village, <lb/>
            an immense number of people congregated in the churches, <lb/>
            as the sheaves in harvest-time are crowded into the barns. <lb/>
            All those who were held by the bonds of a deadly supersti­ <lb/>
            tion, handed down to them by their fathers, now freed from <lb/>
            their tyrannical masters by receiving the knowledge of the <lb/>
            word of God, through the teaching of Christ, and by wit- <note type="footnote"> 1 Tiberius, as before remarked, reigned little more than twenty-two <lb/>
            ,years and a half after the death of Augustus. His prohibition of per­ <lb/>
            secuting the Christians, if it really did take place, must have been issued <lb/>
            A.D. 35 ; but there is some difficulty in crediting it, notwithstanding all <lb/>
            the documents respecting it alleged by Turtullian and St. Justin as <lb/>
            authentic. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Psalm xviii. 5. Rom. x. 18. </note> <pb n="175"/>

            nessing the miracles performed in his name, turned to the <lb/>
            one true God and Lord, their Creator, repenting of their <lb/>
            old errors which they faithfully confessed.</p>
          <p>On the death of Tiberius, Caius Caligula ascended the <lb/>
            throne, but did not fill it quite four years. He gave the <lb/>
            government of Judea to Herod Agrippa, son of Aristobulus, . <lb/>
            and, at the same time, conferred upon him the tetrarchatcs <lb/>
            of Philip and Lysanias, to which he also shortly afterwards <lb/>
            added that of Herod. This same Herod was the author of <lb/>
            the death of John the Baptist, and had treated the Lord <lb/>
            with derision a short time before his passion. The emperor, <lb/>
            after having tormented him in many ways, banished him for <lb/>
            life to Spain, as Josephus, the famous historian of the <lb/>
            Hebrews, relates in his writings.1</p>
          <p>At this time Philo the Jew, a most celebrated writer, who <lb/>
            stands in the first ranks among those who have studied the <lb/>
            philosophy of the Greeks, bequeathed to posterity glorious <lb/>
            monuments of his learning. Among other things, he de­ <lb/>
            scribes the cruelty and folly of Caligula, who carried his <lb/>
            pride to such a pitch that he aspired to be worshipped as a <lb/>
            god, and profaned the sanctuary at Jerusalem by setting up <lb/>
            idols in the temples. In addition to this, the Jews, in <lb/>
            punishment for their daring and heinous cruelties to Christ, <lb/>
            suffered fearful massacres and tribulations, as the learned <lb/>
            men above named, Philo and Josephus, relate in their works. <lb/>
            Indeed, from the time they committed the impious crime, <lb/>
            they were constantly exposed to the fury of seditions, and <lb/>
            continually the victims of war and murder, until at last <lb/>
            their ruin was complete at the siege of Jerusalem by Ves­ <lb/>
            pasian. Pilate, who, in the twelfth year of the reign of <lb/>
            Tiberius Cæsar, had been named procurator of Judea, and <lb/>
            had pronounced sentence of death on Christ, suffered such <lb/>
            persecution by the orders of Caius, that be killed himself <lb/>
            with his own hand. During this reign, Matthew, who <lb/>
            preached in Judea, wrote his gospel in the Hebrew tongue.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 See before, book i., page 85. [16 or 26 March, 37—January 24,4].] </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The account given by Philo of the follies, the cruelties, and the <lb/>
            impieties of Caligula, in connexion with the Jews, may be seen in his <lb/>
            work, De Virtutibus, sive de legatione ad Gaium. This mission took <lb/>
            place in the year 40. The attempt of Caligula to have his statue raised in <lb/>
            the temple at Jerusalem was made in September of that year, although </note> <pb n="176"/>

          <p>Cams Cæsar having been put to death, Claudius reigned <lb/>
            thirteen years and eight months. During his reign a fright­ <lb/>
            ful famine desolated the whole world, as Luke tells us the <lb/>
            prophet Agabus predicted. About that time, during the <lb/>
            famine which happened under Claudius, Herod the king <lb/>
            stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. <lb/>
            Then James, the son of Zebedee, an apostle of our Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, visited all Judea and Samaria, and performed <lb/>
            many miracles by the power of Christ. He disputed in the <lb/>
            synagogues with the unbelievers, and expounded the Holy <lb/>
            Scriptures, proving that every thing which had been pre­ <lb/>
            dicted by the prophets, was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus <lb/>
            Christ.</p>
          <p>Hermogenes, the magician, when he heard how highly <lb/>
            James was spoken of on account of his virtues, was filled <lb/>
            with envy, and sent his disciple Philetus to watch the <lb/>
            motions of the apostle. Attended by a few pharisees, <lb/>
            Philetus tried to oppose James, and to shake the truth of <lb/>
            his preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. But the apostle <lb/>
            persisted with confidence in the Holy Spirit, and proving the <lb/>
            falsehood of his adversary's assertions shewed from the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Son <lb/>
            of God. Returning to Hermogenes, Philetus bestowed the <lb/>
            highest praises on James, honestly admitted the truth of <lb/>
            his statement respecting the true faith, extolled him as <lb/>
            invincible in argument, and published abroad the numerous <lb/>
            miracles he had seen or heard of. He ended his narrative <lb/>
            by advising his master to go with him immediately to the <lb/>
            apostle to entreat his favour and number themselves among <lb/>
            his disciples. But Hermogenes was so much incensed, that <lb/>
            he put Philetus in bonds, and he was unable to move. As <lb/>
            soon as the apostle was apprized by the son of Philetus of <lb/>
            this treatment, he sent his handkerchief to him, and com­ <lb/>
            manded him to touch it in the name of the Lord. This <lb/>
            done, Philetus was delivered from the bonds of the magician, <lb/>
            and hastening to James in great joy, laughed at these dia- <note type="footnote"> Philo places it in the spring. The same year Pilate appears to have killed <lb/>
            himself in despair at his disgrace, while, as it is supposed, he was in exile at <lb/>
            Vienne, in Dauphiny ; and it is reckoned that about this time St. Matthew <lb/>
            composed his gospel in Hebrew, or rather Syro-Chaldaic; and it was <lb/>
            immediately translated into Greek. </note> <pb n="177"/>

            bolical sorceries. However, the magician, seriously grieved, <lb/>
            called up the demons by his nefarious art, and commanded <lb/>
            them to bring to him James and Philetus in chains. But <lb/>
            the devils, as soon as they made their appearance in the air, <lb/>
            began to howl, complaining, with horrible groans, that the <lb/>
            angel of God had bound them with chains of fire which <lb/>
            caused them excruciating pain. At last, being set free by <lb/>
            order of the apostle, they went back to Hermogenes, and, <lb/>
            in turn binding his hands behind with cords, led him thus <lb/>
            bound before James.</p>
          <p>The blessed apostle rebuked the magician, telling him <lb/>
            that the society of demons was a detestable thing, and <lb/>
            ruinous to man: he then ordered Philetus to untie the <lb/>
            cords with which the magician, who stood before him humi­ <lb/>
            liated and confounded, was bound. Thus liberated, he seized <lb/>
            the apostle's staff to defend himself against the fury of the <lb/>
            demons, and ordered his disciples to bring from his house, <lb/>
            on their shoulders, several coffers full of books. He then <lb/>
            began to throw the books into the fire, but in compliance <lb/>
            with the commands of the apostle, he filled the coffers with <lb/>
            stones and lead, and cast them into the sea, lest the smell <lb/>
            arising from the combustion of polluted things should do <lb/>
            injury to those who were unaware of their witchcraft. <lb/>
            Hermogenes, thus delivered from the burthen of magic, <lb/>
            returned to the apostle, and humbly embracing his feet, <lb/>
            manifested sincere repentance to God; and, attaching him­ <lb/>
            self to the blessed James, obeyed him in all things. He <lb/>
            thus began to attain such a state of perfection in the fear <lb/>
            of God, that the Lord through him wrought several mira­ <lb/>
            cles, by witnessing which many persons turned to the Lord, <lb/>
            renouncing their errors and forsaking their evil deeds.</p>
          <p>The Jews, persevering in their malice, when they saw <lb/>
            that the magician, whom they considered invincible, and his <lb/>
            friends, had become believers in Christ, offered money to <lb/>
            Lysias and Theocritus, the centurions of Jerusalem, who <lb/>
            arrested James, and committed him to prison. The apostle <lb/>
            was brought with great tumult into the judgment-hall, <lb/>
            where all admired his confidence in the Lord. Being <lb/>
            questioned by the Pharisees, he returned excellent answers, <lb/>
            and commented on the holy scriptures with wisdom and <lb/>
            eloquence. He proved from them irrefragably Christ's <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. I.</note><lb/>
            birth from a pure virgin, his passion and resurrection, and <lb/>
            all the rest as confessed by the Catholic church. The apostle <lb/>
            concluded his discourse with such power, that all who were <lb/>
            present believed, confessed their sins, and became faithful <lb/>
            adherents to the church of God.</p>
          <p>A few days afterwards, Abiathar, the chief priest, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that so great a multitude believed in the Lord, was <lb/>
            grieved to the heart, and by giving money to the people, <lb/>
            stirred up a violent tumult; the result of which was, that <lb/>
            the scribe Josias put a cord round the neck of the apostle, <lb/>
            and dragged him to the palace of king Herod, son of <lb/>
            Aristobulus. The king, wishing to please the Jews, ordered <lb/>
            that he should be beheaded. While James was on the way <lb/>
            to the place of execution, he saw a man, afflicted with the palsy, <lb/>
            lying on the ground, who begged him with faith to heal his <lb/>
            infirmity ; the apostle said to him, " In the name of my <lb/>
            crucified Lord Jesus Christ, for whose sake I am led away <lb/>
            to be beheaded, rise up sound in every limb, and bless your <lb/>
            Saviour." The palsied man immediately got up, and re­ <lb/>
            joicing at being able to run, began to bless the Lord. <lb/>
            At this sight, Josias threw himself at the apostle's feet, and <lb/>
            humbly implored his pardon.</p>
          <p>James, perceiving that the heart of the scribe was visited <lb/>
            by the grace of God, rejoiced, and Josias confessed the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, the true SOIl of the living God. Then Abia­ <lb/>
            thar ordered him to be detained while the bystanders beat <lb/>
            him in the face with their hands, and having sent to Herod <lb/>
            a report of what had happened, requested permission to <lb/>
            behead the new convert also. When James had embraced <lb/>
            the neophyte, he laid his hand on his head, and blessed him, <lb/>
            making the sign of the cross upon his forehead. Josias, <lb/>
            thus perfected in the faith, was beheaded with the apostle, <lb/>
            and the Almighty Emmanuel granted them both an eternal <lb/>
            reward.</p>
          <p>The martyrdom of the blessed apostle James, the brother <lb/>
            of John the great Evangelist, having been consummated <lb/>
            on the 8th of the calends of August [the 25th of July], <lb/>
            the day on which the devotion of the church celebrates his <lb/>
            festival, seven disciples who had been instructed in the true <lb/>
            faith by him, and were present at his passion, by divine <lb/>
            inspiration, placed his body on board an old ship, and com­ <pb n="179"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 44.]</note><lb/>
            mitted themselves to the sea, without a pilot, without <lb/>
            rigging, but full of confidence in God's providence. They <lb/>
            arrived in a miraculous manner on the coast of Spain, and <lb/>
            being well received by the king of Gallicia, were the first to <lb/>
            preach the faith and religion to the Spanish nation, and <lb/>
            gave their master an honourable burial. Many miracles <lb/>
            were there effected through the merits of St. James the <lb/>
            apostle, and the inhabitants of the whole province soon <lb/>
            embraced the faith of Christ. The canons of the cathedral <lb/>
            church watch with veneration the precious body of the <lb/>
            apostle; and devout Christians, from every quarter of the <lb/>
            globe, flock thither, where they meet to implore the mercy <lb/>
            of God through the intercession of the apostle.1</p>
          <p>King Herod, called Agrippa by Josephus, finding that <lb/>
            the execution of James was acceptable to the Jews, put <lb/>
            Peter also in prison, and delivered him to the custody of <lb/>
            four quaternions of soldiers. Peter, therefore, was kept in <lb/>
            prison, as they intended after Easter to bring him forth to <lb/>
            the people, to put him to death. The prayers of the church <lb/>
            ascended incessantly to the Divine Majesty, beseeching him <lb/>
            that the young flock might not be deprived of the guardian­ <lb/>
            ship of its pious shepherd. The Lord, in his clemency, <lb/>
            listened to the prayer of his spouse and loving handmaid <lb/>
            on behalf of her protector. Heavenly aid was not wanting <lb/>
            to the church, and Herod's cruel designs were provided <lb/>
            against and frustrated. Peter was sleeping at night between <lb/>
            two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers before <lb/>
            the door kept the prison; when the angel of the Lord came <lb/>
            upon him, surrounded with light, and smote him on the side, <lb/>
            and raised him up, saying, " Rise up quickly." Immediately <note type="footnote"> 1 All that is known with any certainty of St. James the Great is, that he <lb/>
            was the first of the apostles who shed his blood for the faith, having been <lb/>
            beheaded by Herod Agrippa some time before the passover. The circum­ <lb/>
            stances of his martyrdom, related by our author, are completely apocry­ <lb/>

            Abiathar, who never existed but in the days of David. The whole of this <lb/>

            the chains fell from off his hands, and, taking his girdle, <lb/>
            binding on his sandals, and casting his garment about him, <lb/>
            he followed the angel, passing through the guards, unto the <lb/>
            iron gate which opened to them of its own accord. At first <lb/>
            he thought that all this had happened in a dream; but <lb/>
            when the angel had departed from him, Peter came to <lb/>
            himself, and, perceiving the truth, returned thanks to his <lb/>
            deliverer for his escaped He then went to the brethren <lb/>
            who were assembled in the house of Mary the mother of <lb/>
            John, whose surname was Mark, and as he knocked at the <lb/>
            door, a damsel, named Rhoda, went to see who was there. <lb/>
            When she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for <lb/>
            gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the <lb/>
            gate. At length, having obtained admission, be cheered the <lb/>
            drooping spirits of the astonished disciples, and declared <lb/>
            unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, <lb/>
            and, immediately departing, retired to another place. His <lb/>
            escape caused great commotion among the soldiers, and, as <lb/>
            they could not discover where he was, King Herod was <lb/>
            greatly incensed with the guards. However, his cruel treat­ <lb/>
            ment of the apostle was not suffered to remain long un­ <lb/>
            punished ; but the avenging hand of God was quickly upon <lb/>
            him, as Luke tells us in the " Acts of the Apostles," and <lb/>
            Josephus in the nineteenth book of his "Antiquities." <lb/>
            For on his going to Cæsarea, anciently called the Tower of <lb/>
            Strabo, on a set day, he entertained the citizens with public <lb/>
            shows, in honour of the emperor. Splendidly arrayed in <lb/>
            apparel admirably embroidered with gold and silver, he <lb/>
            proceeded to the theatre, and sitting upon his throne, made <lb/>
            an oration to the people, who shouted that it was not the <lb/>
            voice of a man but of a god. And immediately the angel <lb/>
            of the Lord smote him, because, he gave not God the glory ; <lb/>
            and five days afterwards he expired, eaten of worms.2</p>
          <p>Agrippa, the son of Herod, reigned twenty-six years,3 that <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xii. 3—12. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts xii. 13—23. The death of Herod Agrippa certainly happened <lb/>

            years afterwards he received in exchange the tetrarchate of Philip, together </note> <pb n="181"/>

            is to say, until the extermination of the Jews. He lived in <lb/>
            peace with the Romans and Christians, and the word of God <lb/>
            grew and multiplied.</p>
          <p>There were in the church at Antioch, certain prophets <lb/>
            and teachers, viz. Barnabas, and Simeon Niger, Lucius of <lb/>
            Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, <lb/>
            and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost said: " Separate me Barnabas and Saul for <lb/>
            the work whereunto I have called them." And when they <lb/>
            had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they <lb/>
            sent them away. So they, being sent forth by the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost, departed unto Seleucia, and from thence they sailed <lb/>
            to Cyprus. At Salamine they preached the word of God in <lb/>
            the synagogues of the Jews, and travelled over the island <lb/>
            as far as Paphos.1</p>
          <p>There the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, <lb/>
            called for Barnabas and Saul, and having thankfully heard <lb/>
            the word of God, believed. The apostle then struck Ely­ <lb/>
            mas the sorcerer blind for a season, because he withstood <lb/>
            the doctrine of the faith. Saul now justly gained the name <lb/>
            of Paul, from the first among the gentiles whom he brought <lb/>
            into subjection to the faith, as Scipio was surnamed Africanus <lb/>
            after he conquered Africa. They then repaired to Perga in <lb/>
            Pamphilia, and afterwards to Antioch in Pisidia, where they <lb/>
            went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down. <lb/>
            After reading the law and the prophets, the rulers of the <lb/>
            synagogue having granted permission, Paul stood up, and, <lb/>
            beckoning with his hand for silence, admirably reviewed the <lb/>
            history of the patriarchs, and proved clearly that the pro­ <lb/>
            mises of God, made long before by the prophets, were now <lb/>
            fulfilled in Christ.2</p>
          <p>The next sabbath-day almost the whole city came to bear <lb/>
            the word of God, but the most bigoted of the Jews used their <lb/>
            earnest endeavours to oppose the preaching of the apostles <lb/>
            by their blasphemous outcries. Then Paul and Barnabas <lb/>
            boldly exclaimed : " It was necessary that the word of God <lb/>
            should first be spoken to you; but seeing that ye put it from <note type="footnote"> with that of Lysanias. After the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70) he <lb/>
            came to reside at Rome, where he died in the year 90. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xiii. 1—6. (A.D. 42 or 44.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts xiii. 7—43. (A.D. 44 or 45.) </note> <pb n="182"/>

            you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, <lb/>
            we turn to the gentiles. For so bath the Lord commanded <lb/>
            us, saying: <foreign xml:lang="grc">̓̒</foreign> I have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, <lb/>
            that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the <lb/>
            earth.’ " When the gentiles heard this, they were glad, <lb/>
            and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. <lb/>
            But the Jews raised persecution against Paul and Barna­ <lb/>
            bas, and expelled them out of their coast. Then, filled with <lb/>
            joy, they came to Iconium, and preached in the synagogue <lb/>
            both to the Jews and Greeks. Remaining in that city for <lb/>
            some time, they laboured boldly for the glory of God, who <lb/>
            worked signs and wonders by their hands. But the unbe­ <lb/>
            lievers, both gentiles and Jews, insulted them in their rage, <lb/>
            and attempted to stone them. But they fled to Lystra and <lb/>
            Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the whole region that <lb/>
            lieth round about, and there they preached the gospel; and <lb/>
            their doctrine caused a great commotion among the whole <lb/>
            population.1</p>
          <p>At Lystra, a lame man, who had never been able to walk, <lb/>
            having heard Paul speak, called upon the name of the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus, was immediately healed, and, leaping up full of faith, <lb/>
            glorified the Lord. When the people saw what Paul had <lb/>
            done, they were struck with wonder, and exclaimed, in the <lb/>
            speech of Lycaonia: " The gods are come down to us, in <lb/>
            the likeness of men.” And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; <lb/>
            and Paul, Mercurius. Then the priest of Jupiter and the <lb/>
            people would have offered sacrifice to them, but the apostles <lb/>
            immediately ran in among the people, rending their clothes, <lb/>
            and humbly gave the glory of the miracle to the Lord. But <lb/>
            although they thus humbled themselves, they could scarcely <lb/>
            restrain the people from doing sacrifice unto them. And <lb/>
            there came suddenly thither Jews from Antioch and <lb/>
            Iconium, who persuaded the people to stone Paul; so that <lb/>
            they drew him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. <lb/>
            But while the disciples stood round him, he rose up and <lb/>
            came into the city, and the next day he departed to Derbe. <lb/>
            Some time after, the two apostles returned again to <lb/>
            Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, and passed through Pisidia, <lb/>
            preaching every where the word of life, and strengthening <lb/>
            the souls of the disciples by their exhortations; and when <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xiii. 44—XIV. 6. (A.D. 45.) </note> <pb n="183"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 45—50.]"/><lb/>
            they had ordained them elders in every church, and had <lb/>
            prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord. <lb/>
            From Pamphilia they went down into Attalia, and thence <lb/>
            sailed to Antioch.1</p>
          <p>There they abode a long time with the disciples. Then <lb/>
            certain men, which came down from Judea, persuaded the <lb/>
            believing gentiles to be circumcised and observe the law of <lb/>
            Moses. Paid and Barnabas opposed this teaching, and were <lb/>
            sent, by unanimous consent, to the apostles and elders at <lb/>
            Jerusalem, to have the question determined. Passing <lb/>
            through Phenice and Samaria, they published the conversion <lb/>
            of the gentiles, and caused great joy unto all the brethren. <lb/>
            At Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and de­ <lb/>
            clared all things that God had done with them. However, <lb/>
            as certain of the sect of the Pharisees, which believed, were <lb/>
            strongly inclined to Judaize, Simon Peter, James, and the <lb/>
            other elders handled with great zeal the question proposed <lb/>
            to them, and at last decided, by the inspiration of the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost, that chosen and experienced brethren should be sent <lb/>
            to the gentiles, entrusted with a letter requiring them to <lb/>
            cast off all other burdens, except abstaining from meats <lb/>
            offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, <lb/>
            and from fornication.2</p>
          <p>Paul, therefore, and Barnabas, with Judas, surnamed Bar­ <lb/>
            sabas, and Silas, were sent to Antioch, and delivered the <lb/>
            epistle of the apostles and elders to the multitude of believers <lb/>
            among the gentiles, who, when they had read it, rejoiced <lb/>
            for the consolation. Judas and Silas, being also prophets, <lb/>
            comforted the brethren with many words, and confirmed <lb/>
            them, and after a while returned in peace to Jerusalem. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding, Paul and Barnabas preached the word of <lb/>
            the Lord for some time at Antioch. On their departure <lb/>
            from thence, they separated; Barnabas, with Mark and <lb/>
            John, embarked for Cyprus, while Paul, having chosen <lb/>
            Silas for his companion, went through Syria and Cilicia, <lb/>
            confirming the churches, and commanding them to observe <lb/>
            the commands which the apostles and elders had given. <lb/>
            He then came to Derbe and Lystra, and there, to obviate <lb/>
            the subtle scruples of the Jews, circumcised Timothy, who <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xiv. 7—25. (A.D. 45, 4G.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts xiv. 20—XV. 29. (A.D. 50.) </note> <pb n="184"/>

            was the son of a gentile. Passing through Phrygia, Galatia, <lb/>
            and Mysia, he came down to Troas, and, warned by a vision in <lb/>
            the night, crossed over into Macedonia. He preached at <lb/>
            Philippic which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, <lb/>
            where Lydia, a seller of purple, who worshipped God, <lb/>
            listened to the things which were spoken of Paul, and <lb/>
            believing, and being baptized with her household, she con­ <lb/>
            strained the apostles, by her repeated entreaties, to lodge <lb/>
            with her.1</p>
          <p>As Paul, with his companions, was going forth to prayer, <lb/>
            be was met by a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of <lb/>
            divination, who brought her masters much gain by sooth­ <lb/>
            saying. This girl followed them exclaiming, " These men are <lb/>
            tho servants of the most high God, which show unto us the <lb/>
            way of salvation." Having done this for many days, Paul <lb/>
            being grieved, said to the spirit: " I command thee, in the <lb/>
            name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her." And he came <lb/>
            out the same hour. But when her masters saw that the <lb/>
            hope of their gains was gone, they were in a great rage, and <lb/>
            caught Paul, and Silas, and drew them into the market- <lb/>
            place unto the rulers, and accused them of causing dis­ <lb/>
            turbances in the city by introducing customs foreign to the <lb/>
            manners of the Romans. The excited populace also joining <lb/>
            in the attack upon these innocent men, they were scourged, <lb/>
            and, by order of the magistrates, thrust into the inner prison, <lb/>
            with their feet made fast in the stocks. At midnight, Paul <lb/>
            and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God; and soon <lb/>
            received his special assistance. For suddenly there was a <lb/>
            great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were <lb/>
            shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and <lb/>
            every one's bonds were loosed. At this sight, the gaoler <lb/>
            was terrified beyond measure, and having heard from the <lb/>
            lips of Paul the grounds of his faith, believed and was <lb/>
            baptized with all his household. The magistrates of the <lb/>
            city feared, when they beard that the apostles were Romans, <lb/>
            and, releasing them from prison, desired them to depart out <lb/>
            of the city. Being set free, they went to the house of <lb/>
            Lydia, and then departed for Thessalonica by way of <lb/>
            Amphipolis and Apollonia. At Thessalonica, on three sab­ <lb/>
            bath-days, Paul entered the Jews' synagogue, and publicly <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xv. 32—XVI. 15. (A.D. 51, 52.) </note> <pb n="185"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 52.]</note><lb/>
            reasoned with them out of the scriptures, alleging that <lb/>
            " Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the <lb/>
            dead; and this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ." <lb/>
            Many, both Jews and gentiles, believed and joined the com­ <lb/>
            pany of Paul and Silas. But the bigoted Jews, moved with <lb/>
            envy, stirred up the multitude against them, and accused <lb/>
            Jason and the other brethren, whom they drew before the <lb/>
            rulers of the city. But the rulers, when they had taken, <lb/>
            security of Jason, and of the other, let them go. And the <lb/>
            brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night <lb/>
            unto Berea; and thence, as the Jews had raised tumults <lb/>
            there also, the brethren conducted Paul to Athens. Here <lb/>
            he waited for Silas and Timothy, whom he had left at Berea. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews <lb/>
            and devout persons, and preached in the market-place every <lb/>
            day to those who came to hear him. Then certain philoso­ <lb/>
            phers of the Epicureans and Stoics disputed with him. <lb/>
            For the Athenians, and strangers which were there, spent, <lb/>
            their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some <lb/>
            new thing. Then Paul, standing in the middle of the <lb/>
            Areopagus, rebuked the Athenians for their idolatry and <lb/>
            superstition, and began to speak of the altar on which he <lb/>
            had found an inscription: " To the unknown God." These. <lb/>
            words he took for the text of his expected discourse, and <lb/>
            announced to them the true God, who, in former times, <lb/>
            was unknown to the world; then, saying much in a few <lb/>
            words, he preached earnestly the faith, and the hope of the <lb/>
            resurrection.1</p>
          <p>Then Dionysius the Areopagite, with his wife Damaris, <lb/>
            and a few others, clave unto the apostle and believed his <lb/>
            words. Paul afterwards departed from Athens and came to <lb/>
            Corinth, where he testified to the Jews and the Greeks that <lb/>
            Jesus was the Christ, and earnestly devoted himself to the <lb/>
            ministry of preaching; and he reasoned in the synagogue <lb/>
            every sabbath. Meanwhile Silas and Timotheus arrived <lb/>
            from Macedonia. Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, <lb/>
            convinced by the arguments of Paul, believed and was bap­ <lb/>
            tized, with all his house, and many of the Corinthians. <lb/>
            And Paul entered into a certain man's house named Titus <lb/>
            the Just, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xvi. 16—XVII. 31. (A.D. 52.) </note> <pb n="186"/>

            Obedient to the commands of God made known to him by <lb/>
            a vision in the night, Paul continued there a year and six <lb/>
            months, teaching constantly the word of God. There lived <lb/>
            at Athens a Jew, of the name of Aquila, born in Pontus, <lb/>
            and his wife Priscilla; Paul, being a tent-maker as well as <lb/>
            Aquila, assisted them in their labours, and thus gained a <lb/>
            living by the work of his own hands. Paul then took leave <lb/>
            of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and came to <lb/>
            Ephesus. He then went to Cesarea, and thence came to <lb/>
            Antioch ; and after he had spent some time there, he de­ <lb/>
            parted, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia <lb/>
            strengthening the disciples.1</p>

          <p>THUS far I have made brief extracts from the history <lb/>
            of the primitive church as related by Luke in the Acts of <lb/>
            the Apostles, as far as the account of Paul's baptizing at <lb/>
            Ephesus, in the name of the Lord Jesus, those disciples <lb/>
            who had before received the baptism of John. He after­ <lb/>
            wards remained there for three months with those who, filled <lb/>
            with the Holy Ghost, spake with tongues and prophesied; he <lb/>
            himself continually setting forth the kingdom of God, to <lb/>
            the profit of many: and then departing thence, for the next <lb/>
            two years he preached the gospel boldly in every part of <lb/>
            Asia, and performed in the name of Jesus Christ a number <lb/>
            of miracles on the sick and demoniacs.2 I must now have <lb/>
            recourse to other works, and collect some short notices of <lb/>
            the apostles generally, from authorities which are considered <lb/>
            authentic, and are used by the church.</p>
          <p>The Creator of all things only knows the degrees of rank <lb/>
            and the respective merits of the apostles; and He, who <lb/>
            searches the secrets of the human heart, has apportioned to <lb/>
            each the rewards of his labour. The word apostle signifies <lb/>
            sent; for Christ sent them to preach the gospel throughout <lb/>
            the world, in order that, as fishermen's nets haul shoals of <lb/>
            fishes from the depths of the sea, the apostle's preaching <lb/>
            might draw from the pit of perdition to the light of life, <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xvii. 34—XVIII. 23. (A.D. 52—55.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Acts xix. 1—10. (A.D. 54-57.) </note> <pb n="187"/>

            those who were lost in the depths of sin. Their names are <lb/>
            these: Simon Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, the <lb/>
            son of Zebedee, and John his brother; James, the son of <lb/>
            Alpheus, and Philip; Thomas and Bartholomew; Levi, <lb/>
            Matthew, and Simon the Canaanite; Judas Thaddeus and <lb/>
            Matthias.1</p>
          <p>Peter, called the first, the greatest in dignity, the key­ <lb/>
            bearer, he who zealously obeyed Christ, and followed him <lb/>
            with his whole heart-he it was who filled the highest seat <lb/>
            in the company of the apostles. He was the son of Jonas <lb/>
            or John, and born at Bethsaida, a village near the lake <lb/>
            of Gennesaret, in the province of Galilee. To announce <lb/>
            his future dignity and illustrious power, he received three <lb/>
            names. The significations of the three words indicated the <lb/>
            many virtues vouchsafed to him by Heaven; for Simon <lb/>
            means obedient, Peter acknowledging, and Cephas a head? <lb/>
            Thus Simon, by the obedience with which, as soon as he <lb/>
            heard the Lord's commandment, he attached himself to him, <lb/>
            leaving all things, and ready to follow him to death, rose to <lb/>
            the knowledge of the ineffable divinity. Inspired by <lb/>
            Heaven, he ardently desired to be acquainted with divine <lb/>
            things, above the powers of human intellect, and in the <lb/>
            sincerity of his faith loudly proclaimed a glorious confession, <lb/>
            "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." He <lb/>
            therefore, was honoured above measure by Christ himself, <lb/>
            made the head and foundation of the church. The generous <lb/>
            Benefactor, who had inspired him divinely with the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of himself, rewarded with the highest rank and <lb/>
            authority the faith of a pure heart to which his mouth had <lb/>
            given utterance by that confession. " Blessed art thon,” <lb/>
            said he, " Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood bath not re­ <lb/>
            vealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” 3</p>
          <p>Truly blessed, indeed, is Simon, that is to say, the obe­ <lb/>
            dient, who is also called Barjona, that is to say, the son of a <lb/>
            dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. " An obedient man," <lb/>
            saith Solomon, " boasts his victories." <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts i. 13, 26. (A.D. 33.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We are not aware that Peter is synonymous with agnoscens in any <lb/>
            language. As for the Syro-Chaldaic word Cephas, it is by a mere abuse of its <lb/>

          <p>He who unremittingly observes the divine commandments <lb/>
            is attacked by divers temptations in his daily conflicts with <lb/>
            Satan, whom he overcomes by perseverance in the law of <lb/>
            God. What, indeed, does the divine law command or teach, <lb/>
            but that every man must engage in spiritual warfare, combat <lb/>
            the old serpent, who is always lying in ambush for us, and <lb/>
            labour diligently to obtain the reward of his heavenly call­ <lb/>
            ing ? Thus, the brave soldier of the Lord doubtless speaks <lb/>
            of his victories, when be returns thanks to God his pro­ <lb/>
            tector, after triumphing over the enemy, saying with the <lb/>
            prophet :-" Thou hast girded me with strength unto the <lb/>
            battle; thou shalt throw down my enemies under me and <lb/>
            others in the same strain. No one can please God the <lb/>
            Father by his holy works, if he have not obtained the virtue <lb/>
            of obedience through the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
          <p>Then the Saviour, nobly consummating the reward of <lb/>
            Simon's pious confession, said to him:—“ Thou art Peter, <lb/>
            and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates <lb/>
            of hell shall not prevail against it." Petrus, in Latin, <lb/>
            Cephas, in Syriac, are names derived in both languages <lb/>
            from the word petra, a stone, that is, from Christ, who is the <lb/>
            chief corner-stone upon which the church is founded. Thus <lb/>
            Simon, by his obedience, was prepared to acknowledge the <lb/>
            Son of God, a knowledge which not flesh and blood, but the <lb/>
            heavenly Father, revealed to him; and therefore Peter was <lb/>
            considered, by our Saviour himself, to be worthy of the sur­ <lb/>
            name of acknowledging. Having afterwards given to him <lb/>
            the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the King of Sabaoth <lb/>
            appointed him to be Cephas, that is to say, head of the <lb/>
            church, the prince and sovereign pontiff of the apostles, <lb/>
            gifted with the power of binding and loosing, pre-eminent <lb/>
            in doctrine and sanctity, exalted by signs and miracles, the <lb/>
            first pastor of the flock of Christ in his church, and his <lb/>
            special vicar.</p>
          <p>Peter preached the word to those of the circumcision for <lb/>
            the space of seven years, and performed, during that time, <lb/>
            the wonderful works which Luke records in the Acts of the <lb/>
            Apostles, as I have mentioned above. He healed, at the <lb/>
            Beautiful gate of the Temple, the lame man, aged forty <lb/>
            years, and baptized the five thousand Jews who were con- <note type="footnote"> 1 Psalm xviii. 39. </note> <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 37—41.]"/><lb/>
            verted; he punished, with his censorial power, Ananias and <lb/>
            his wife Sapphira, who were guilty of deceit and falsehood, <lb/>
            and thus gave a terrible warning, to the men of that day <lb/>
            and to posterity, of the chastisement to be given for their <lb/>
            souls' health. As he passed along the streets, his shadow <lb/>
            alone, falling upon the multitude of sick people as they lay <lb/>
            in their beds, was sufficient to heal them, so great were the <lb/>
            merits and power which Heaven bestowed upon him.</p>
          <p>At Lydda he restored to health, in the name of the Lord, <lb/>
            the paralytic Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years; and <lb/>
            brought to the faith those who saw and wondered at so <lb/>
            unheard-of a miracle. At Joppa he raised to life the vener­ <lb/>
            able widow Tabitha, and presented her alive to the saints <lb/>
            and widows. The rest of his acts, from Judea to An­ <lb/>
            tioch, and how he repeatedly overcame Simon Magus in <lb/>
            his frequent disputes with him, Clemens Romanus, the son <lb/>
            of Faustinian, has related in his book of the Recognitions, a <lb/>
            work which he has also entitled the Itinerary of Peter. <lb/>
            This author, having abandoned all he possessed at Rome, <lb/>
            embarked for Palestine, and met the apostle Peter at <lb/>
            Cæsarea Stratonis, his residence being pointed out to him <lb/>
            by Barnabas, whom he bad hospitably entertained at Rome, <lb/>
            and who treated him as a friend and guest worthy of the <lb/>
            greatest respect. Clemens was kindly received by Peter, <lb/>
            as a son by his father, on account of his regard for both him <lb/>
            and Barnabas, and being fully instructed in the faith of the <lb/>
            true Prophet, and renewed at the sacred font, he inseparably <lb/>
            attached himself to Peter.1</p>
          <p>Peter disputed with Simon Magus at Cæsarea, and after <lb/>
            Simon had retired in the evening with a thousand of his <lb/>
            followers, he strengthened in the faith those who remained, <lb/>
            and, invoking the name of God, healed the demoniacs and <lb/>
            the sick.</p>
          <p>The next day, the discussion was renewed, and with <lb/>
            God's help, Simon was put to silence on many points. At <lb/>
            last, as night was approaching, Simon, confounded, left the <lb/>
            place with a few adherents, and the people rejoicing, threw <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Clemens, the disciple and the third successor of St. Peter, died in <lb/>
            the year 100, after filling the pontifical chair nine years. The book of The <lb/>
            Recognitions, attributed to him by our author, was justly rejected as apo­ <lb/>
            cryphal even in the time of St. Jerome. </note> <pb n="190"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. II."/><lb/>
            themselves at Peter's feet. The demoniacs and the sick <lb/>
            were cured by his prayers, and having heard the doctrine <lb/>
            and experienced the mercy of the true God, they retired full <lb/>
            of joy. On the third day, Peter established the immortality <lb/>
            of the soul, by the truth of his arguments, against Simon, <lb/>
            who denied it, and laid bare his wicked principles, by giving <lb/>
            proofs of them. The people, indignant, drove the blas­ <lb/>
            phemer from the hall, and even thrust him out of the door <lb/>
            of the house; and of the numbers who had been his follow­ <lb/>
            ers for a long time, scarcely one now ventured to keep com­ <lb/>
            pany with him. However, Simon loaded the shoulders of <lb/>
            his companion with the polluted and execrable instruments <lb/>
            of his art, and fearing that, if he were taken, he should come <lb/>
            within the grasp of justice, he threw them at night into the <lb/>
            sea, and ran away, his attendant refusing to accompany him, <lb/>
            because he had by this time found him to be a detestable <lb/>
            impostor..</p>
          <p>Peter dwelt three months at Cæsarea, ordaining Zaccheus <lb/>
            bishop of that city ; and baptized on a day of festival an <lb/>
            immense number of believers, amounting to ten thousand. <lb/>
            From thence he sent twelve brethren after Simon, to follow <lb/>
            his track. Sophonias and Joseph, Micheas and Eleazar, <lb/>
            Phineas and Lazarus, Elisæus and Benjamin, son of Saba; <lb/>
            Ananias, son of Saphra; Rubelus, the brother of Zacchæus; <lb/>
            Nicodemus and Zacharias the architect, were selected by the <lb/>
            apostle, that he might be assisted in the worship of God by <lb/>
            twelve faithful brethren, though relying principally on divine <lb/>
            grace, and that by their aid he might follow up Simon Magus <lb/>
            and the other enemies of righteousness.</p>
          <p>Having completed the three months he spent at Cæsarea, <lb/>
            Peter went, by way of Dora, to Ptolemais, and there remained <lb/>
            ten days teaching the people the law of God. After this he <lb/>
            was also employed in sowing the seed of the divine word at <lb/>
            Tyre, Sydon, and Berytus; and then entered Tripoli with a <lb/>
            considerable number of the elect, who followed him from <lb/>
            each of these cities. At Tripoli he was entertained in the <lb/>
            house of Maro with every token of regard from the citizens, <lb/>
            who also granted to all the companions of Peter a gratui­ <lb/>
            tous hospitality, marked with the greatest kindness. The <lb/>
            following morning an immense multitude crowded into <lb/>
            Maro's garden to hear the apostle, who, in the first place, <pb n="191"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 41—?]"/><lb/>
            put to flight the foul spirits which cried out from the bodies <lb/>
            they possessed, and after his sermon healed the sick in that <lb/>
            place. There, for the space of three months, he sowed <lb/>
            abundantly the words of salvation, and baptized Clemens, <lb/>
            and several others, at fountains which were in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the sea; appointing Maro, his host, who was <lb/>
            already perfectly prepared in all things, bishop.</p>
          <p>Thence he repaired to Antarados, and divided the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of believers who followed him into two bodies, ordering <lb/>
            Nicetas and Aquilas to conduct them, and go before him, <lb/>
            to Laodicea, from fear that such a concourse of persons <lb/>
            accompanying him might excite the jealousy of the enemies <lb/>
            to the faith. During the journey, Clemens informed Peter, <lb/>
            in a familiar conversation, whence he came, described his <lb/>
            family, and related the history of his parents. The next <lb/>
            day, he visited a neighbouring island, in order to see some <lb/>
            pillars of glass1 of an immense size; and here, thanks to <lb/>
            Peter, he recognized his mother Matidia, after a separation <lb/>
            of twenty years. Peter healed by his prayers a paralytic <lb/>
            woman, who was the hostess of Matidia, and Clemens gave <lb/>
            her a thousand drachms as a remuneration for her services.</p>
          <p>After this, Peter went to Balancas, and then to Palthos <lb/>
            and Gabala, and thus reached Laodicea, where he stayed ten <lb/>
            days ; during which time the recognition of the mother and <lb/>
            her three sons, Clemens, Faustinus, and Faustus, took place. <lb/>
            Two of the brothers, who were twins, related, that after <lb/>
            being shipwrecked, as they were tossed to and fro by the <lb/>
            waves, holding on to a piece of plank, some pirates found <lb/>
            them, and taking them on board their boat, sailed with them <lb/>
            to Cæsarea, and there sold them under feigned names to a <lb/>
            certain woman, who had acted most justly towards them, <lb/>
            having educated them as her own children, instructed them <lb/>
            in liberal and Greek literature, and, when they had arrived <lb/>
            at the proper age, put them to the study of philosophy.</p>
          <p>While Peter remained at Laodicea, incessantly occupied <lb/>
            as was his custom, in pious works, an old man, named <lb/>
            Faustinian, who appeared to be in a state of poverty, went <note type="footnote"> 1 Vitreas. M. Le Prevost proposes to read viteas, observing that pillars <lb/>

            to turn, and began to deny the existence of God, of a pro­ <lb/>
            vidence in this world, and the necessity of divine worship; <lb/>
            asserting that every thing was done by mere chance and by <lb/>
            generation.1 His three sons, whom he had not yet recog­ <lb/>
            nized, opposed him in the hearing of all the people for three <lb/>
            days, and, by their answers, instructed their hearers in many <lb/>
            abstruse doctrines.</p>
          <p>The first day, Nicetas ably argued that there exists a <lb/>
            God who is master of all things, who made the world, and <lb/>
            governs it by his providence, a just God, who will reward <lb/>
            every man according to his works. On the second day, <lb/>
            Aquilas discoursed with eloquence on the just disposal of <lb/>
            all things by a God of justice. On the third day, Clemens <lb/>
            disputed on the origin of things, inquiring whether all <lb/>
            depended upon generation, or whether there was aught in <lb/>
            us effected not by the hazard of birth, but by the will of <lb/>
            God. It was then that, by a divine motion, without which <lb/>
            nothing happens, the obstinate old man and his wife recog­ <lb/>
            nized their children, although twenty years bad elapsed.</p>
          <p>The chief magistrate of the town used his utmost en­ <lb/>
            deavours to detain at his house Peter and the brethren who <lb/>
            were with him; and his daughter, who for twenty years <lb/>
            had been the prey of a cruel demon, was set free and healed.</p>
          <p>At this time, as Faustinian, while on a visit to his friends, <lb/>
            Anubis and Appio, who lodged at the house of Simon, was <lb/>
            taking his supper with them, his face was transformed by <lb/>
            magic art into that of Simon: a circumstance which caused <lb/>
            the greatest fear to all his friends, as they dreaded that, by <lb/>
            an order of the emperor, he would be taken for the magician, <lb/>
            and punished in his room.</p>
          <p>After this Peter went to Antioch, where he was received <lb/>
            with great demonstrations of joy by the inhabitants: he <lb/>
            there preached the word of God, restored to health the sick <lb/>
            who were brought to him, and healed the people afflicted <lb/>
            with the palsy, possessed with a devil, as well as all those <lb/>
            who suffered from any kind of accident. The number of <lb/>
            the sick was immense. Peter was offering up a prayer to <lb/>
            the Lord for them all, in the presence of the people, when <lb/>
            suddenly, by the grace of God, an extraordinary light ap­ <lb/>
            peared in the midst of the audience, and all who were <note type="footnote"> 1 "Genesis:" genitura, fatum, horoscopus.—Ducange, Gloss. </note> <pb n="193"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 42 ?]</note><lb/>
            afflicted in any way immediately recovered their health. <lb/>
            In consequence, all the inhabitants of Antioch, with one <lb/>
            voice, confessed the Lord, and within seven days more than <lb/>
            ten thousand souls believing in God were baptized.</p>
          <p>Theophilus, who held the highest rank among the great <lb/>
            men of the city, was inflamed with so ardent a love for God, <lb/>
            that he freely offered the great hall of his own house to be <lb/>
            converted into a spacious church.1 It was consecrated under <lb/>
            the name of a church, and an episcopal throne was erected <lb/>
            in it for the apostle Peter by the entire population. Mean­ <lb/>
            while Faustinian, laying open his mind to the heavenly <lb/>
            mysteries, at the sight of so many miracles threw himself <lb/>
            publicly at the feet of the apostle, and, abjuring his ancient <lb/>
            errors, requested to be baptized. Peter enjoined him a <lb/>
            preparatory fast, baptized him on the following Sunday, <lb/>
            and, standing in the midst of the people, made the con­ <lb/>
            version of Faustinian the subject of a discourse, in which <lb/>
            he recounted the events of the convert's life. This account <lb/>
            was generally pleasing and useful, and gained for the old <lb/>
            man and his family the favour and esteem of the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Antioch. The entire city made a happy progress in <lb/>
            divine things, and the number of the faithful increasing <lb/>
            daily, holy mother church rejoiced in Christ Jesus.3</p>
          <p>The blessed apostle Peter filled the see of Antioch for <lb/>
            the first seven years, and preached the word in Pontus, <lb/>
            Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Afterwards, Simon <lb/>
            Magus having gone to Rome, Peter set in order the church <lb/>
            of Antioch, and consecrated Evodius bishop in his place. <lb/>
            He then proceeded to Rome,1 attended by several chosen <lb/>
            disciples, and, entering the city in the time of the emperor <lb/>
            Claudius, found the juggler, so often mentioned, deceiving <note type="footnote"> 1 Basilica; from a Greek word signifying a royal palace, hall, or court <lb/>

            the people with a variety of phantoms raised by virtue of <lb/>
            the diabolical power called a familiar spirit. This impostor <lb/>
            was so puffed up with pride, that he set himself up for a <lb/>
            god, and even obtained from the Roman citizens the honour <lb/>
            of having a statue erected to him, as a god, on the banks of <lb/>
            the Tiber, between the two bridges. In fact, Satan had <lb/>
            taken entire possession of this insane contriver of all wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, who was the first he armed with the weapons of <lb/>
            impious heresy to war against the true faith of the church. <lb/>
            The Almighty Emmanuel prepared the illustrious leader of <lb/>
            his army to contend with him in close combat; I mean <lb/>
            Simon Peter, to whom Christ entrusted the keys of the <lb/>
            kingdom of heaven, and appointed him to be the prince of <lb/>
            the apostles and the firm ruler of his church. He, there­ <lb/>
            fore, on his arrival in Rome, dispelled the darkness of <lb/>
            falsehood by the brilliant light of truth and justice; and <lb/>
            there, as a worthy censor, judging with equity, he filled the <lb/>
            see twenty-five years, two months, and three days.1</p>
          <p>When the bright light of the word of God had shone forth <lb/>
            in the Roman capital, and the word of truth, which Peter <lb/>
            preached, had enlightened the minds of all his hearers, and <lb/>
            had caused them so much satisfaction that hearing only <lb/>
            did not satisfy those who daily attended, Mark, a disciple <lb/>
            of the apostle, was induced by repeated solicitations to <lb/>
            compose his gospel, that what the one taught by word of <lb/>
            mouth might be committed to writing by the other, and <lb/>
            thus transmitted to posterity for the perpetual instruction <lb/>
            of the readers. Peter was delighted to find that through <lb/>
            the influence of the Holy Spirit, his teaching was ap­ <lb/>
            propriated by a kind of pious fraud ;2 and perceiving in <lb/>
            this their faith and piety, he confirmed himself the work <lb/>
            of the evangelist, and delivered this Scripture3 to the <note type="footnote"> 1 It is the common opinion of the church, still current at Rome. that <lb/>

            assertion of this long residence of St. Peter at Rome. What appears most <lb/>
            probable, after a careful inquiry, is that he made his first journey to Rome <lb/>

            churches to be read for ever; besides which, he composed <lb/>
            two epistles which are called canonical.1 Peter worked <lb/>
            manfully in Christ's vineyard, during the reigns of Tiberius <lb/>
            Cæsar, Caius Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, nurturing many <lb/>
            excellent disciples, and, when they were well imbued with <lb/>
            virtue and learning, sending them into different countries. <lb/>
            He placed his disciple Mark, whom he loved as a son, first <lb/>
            at Aquileia, and then at Alexandria; Martial at Limoges; <lb/>
            Apollinaris at Ravenna; Valerius at Treves; and many <lb/>
            more in different places, where, in Christ's name, they <lb/>
            brought vast crowds of the Gentiles to the light of faith, <lb/>
            and having regenerated them placed them in the bosom of <lb/>
            our holy mother the church, by the water of holy baptism.</p>
          <p>One day when Peter was at Rome, while several of the <lb/>
            brethren were at table, Titus said to the apostle, “ As thou <lb/>
            hast cured all the sick, why dost thou let Petronilla lie <lb/>
            suffering from palsy?" The apostle answered, "It is ex­ <lb/>
            pedient for her that it should be so; but in order that <lb/>
            no one may think that I wish, by words, to cloak my <lb/>
            inability to heal her, I say to this woman, 'Rise up, Petro­ <lb/>
            nilla, and come and serve us.’” She rose up able to <lb/>
            minister to them; but, as soon as her attendance was no <lb/>
            longer required, he ordered her to return to her pallet. <lb/>
            However, when she began to be proficient in the fear of <lb/>
            God, not only was she perfectly healed of her own infirmity, <lb/>
            but her prayers were the means of restoring health to <lb/>
            others.2 <note type="footnote"> shorter than those of St. Matthew and St. Luke, contains only two facts, <lb/>

            extolled and continually honoured by the sons of the church <lb/>
            as their learned schoolmaster. He was first called Saul, <lb/>
            which means in Hebrew temptation; because he began his <lb/>
            career by tempting the holy mother church. Having after­ <lb/>
            wards changed his name, instead of Saul he was called Paul, <lb/>
            that is to say, wonderful, having been converted in a <lb/>
            marvellous manner, from a ravenous wolf into a mild lamb. <lb/>
            In Latin Paul may be taken for little ; wherefore he said <lb/>
            publicly, when speaking of himself, " I am the least of the <lb/>
            apostles."</p>
          <p>Paul was of the tribe of Benjamin, a pharisee of the phari­ <lb/>
            sees, born at Tarsus, a city -of Cilicia, but brought up at <lb/>
            Jerusalem from his childhood, and instructed in the law of <lb/>
            God by Gamaliel. In the second year after our Lord's <lb/>
            ascension, while he displayed excessive zeal for the tradi­ <lb/>
            tions of the elders, and became, therefore, a violent <lb/>
            persecutor of the Christians, he went to Damascus, bear­ <lb/>
            ing letters from the high priest, commissioning him to <lb/>
            persecute even to death all the worshippers of Christ who <lb/>
            dwelt there. When, however, he came nigh the city, he was <lb/>
            suddenly surrounded by an extraordinary light, and, hearing <lb/>
            with amazement the heavenly voice of the Lord Jesus, <lb/>
            he fell to the ground; but his salvation was secured, for <lb/>
            he arose divested of his former ferocity, and was led by <note type="footnote"> episode of St. Petronilla, copied from the Acts of SS. Nereus and Achil­ <lb/>

            embraced the faith which he had combated, and, having <lb/>
            been baptized, boldly preached it to Jews and Gentiles. <lb/>
            Beginning at Jerusalem, he proceeded as far as Illyria, Italy, <lb/>
            and Spain; 1 and made known the name of Christ to the <lb/>
            inhabitants of many countries who had not yet heard it.</p>
          <p>Luke, the evangelist, Paul's companion and fellow la­ <lb/>
            bourer, speaks of him to the end of his work with exactness <lb/>
            and dignity, pursuing the thread of his history to the omis­ <lb/>
            sion of others. Arator, also, a sub-deacon of the holy Roman <lb/>
            church, has written a second book on this subject, in which <lb/>
            he piously made a metrical version of the Acts of the <lb/>
            Apostles, in which he related the labours of Paul, his <lb/>
            patience in adversity, and the shipwreck be suffered. I <lb/>
            have already collected from these works some brief notices <lb/>
            respecting him in the preceding pages, but it is by no means <lb/>
            an irksome task to recapitulate them to the glory of God.</p>
          <p>Saul, who is likewise called Paul, having parted from his <lb/>
            companions, in obedience to. an admonition of the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost, preached at Paphos, where he struck blind Elymas <lb/>
            the sorcerer, who resisted the words of the faith, and con­ <lb/>
            verted to Christianity the proconsul Paulus. Having <lb/>
            entered the synagogue at Antioch, he commanded silence <lb/>
            by waving his hand, and related how the people of Israel <lb/>
            went out of Egypt by passing through the sea, and spoke <lb/>
            of the different miracles which were wrought in the desert. <lb/>
            On another sabbath day he rehearsed Christ's passion and <lb/>
            resurrection, which he illustrated by passages from the <lb/>
            prophets, and increased the flock of the church by a great <lb/>
            number of believers.</p>
          <p>At Lystra, Paul healed a man impotent in his feet from his <lb/>
            mother's womb, who listened with attention to the word of <lb/>
            God; but when he saw the ancient superstition of the Lycao- <note type="footnote"> Antioch, in the year 44, but this mission had nothing in common with <lb/>

            clothes, and used eloquence and reason to restrain their <lb/>
            zeal.</p>
          <p>After much opposition to his preaching, he handled the <lb/>
            question raised by the baptized Jews, whether believing <lb/>
            Gentiles ought to be baptized before they were circumcised. <lb/>
            Paul, therefore, went to Jerusalem with others chosen from <lb/>
            among the faithful, and consulted Peter and James, and <lb/>
            the other elders, and transmitted an epistle containing their <lb/>
            decision that Christians need only abstain from meats <lb/>
            offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, <lb/>
            and from fornication.</p>
          <p>At Philippi he cast an unclean spirit out of a young <lb/>
            woman who was a Pythoness, and who gave responses to <lb/>
            those who consulted her; the demon being expelled, her <lb/>
            covetous masters were deprived of the gains obtained by <lb/>
            her divination. They therefore accused Paul before the <lb/>
            magistrates, by whose orders he was imprisoned. In the <lb/>
            night, the apostle prayed to the Lord of light, and the <lb/>
            merciful guardian of his faithful people quickly heard him. <lb/>
            For there was a sudden earthquake, and the chains of the <lb/>
            prisoners fell from them; and the keeper of the prison <lb/>
            having been baptized, with his whole family, Paul and Silas, <lb/>
            the servants of the God of Sabaoth, were allowed to go free.</p>
          <p>Paul, preaching at Athens, was surnamed by the people <lb/>
            there, the sower of the word,1 and thus received a suitable <lb/>
            name from the unbelievers ; for his words were a fountain <lb/>
            of eternal life to thirsty souls, and be scattered freely the <lb/>
            seed of salvation for all who desired to gather it. He <lb/>
            disputed with the philosophers, both Epicurean and Stoic, <lb/>
            and eloquently proclaimed the true God who was called by <lb/>
            the Athenians " The Unknown God." Dionysius the Are­ <lb/>
            opagite, and his wife Damaris,2 believed and were baptized; <lb/>
            and Paul admitted him among his most intimate friends, <lb/>
            on account of his wisdom and love of righteousness. Soon <note type="footnote"> I Seminiverbius; in the Greek text of Acts xvii. 18, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπερμολόγος</foreign>; in <lb/>

            by the testimony of his namesake of Corinth, is that he was bishop of <lb/>
            Athens. It appears also that he suffered martyrdom. </note> <pb n="199"/>

            afterwards, as Aristides the Athenian tells us, Dionysius was <lb/>
            ordained bishop of Athens by the apostle, and after an <lb/>
            illustrious life received the glorious crown of martyrdom. <lb/>
            Paul went from thence to Corinth, where he found Aquila <lb/>
            preaching, with his wife Priscilla; he went to reside at their <lb/>
            house, and there practised the art of tent-making, in which <lb/>
            they were expert. There also, being admonished by Christ <lb/>
            not to cease from preaching, he faithfully obeyed, and many <lb/>
            were converted.</p>
          <p>At Ephesus, twelve men lately baptized by Paul in the <lb/>
            name of the Lord, were filled with the Holy Ghost, and <lb/>
            had the gift of divers kinds of tongues. Also, while Paul <lb/>
            was healing, in the name of the Lord Jesus, those who were <lb/>
            afflicted with various sorts of diseases, seven Jews, the sons <lb/>
            of one Sceva, chief of the priests, took upon them to lay <lb/>
            their hands on a man who had an evil spirit, calling over <lb/>
            him the name of the Lord Jesus, whom Paul preached. <lb/>
            But the demon, acting through the man who was possessed, <lb/>
            made a public acknowledgment of Jesus and his disciple <lb/>
            Paul. He also suddenly rushed upon the unbelieving exor­ <lb/>
            cists, whom he wounded and put to flight. A great number <lb/>
            of the Ephesians, having heard the truth preached to them, <lb/>
            believed and were baptized. Some of those who used <lb/>
            curious arts, burnt their books of magic, the value of which <lb/>
            they estimated at fifty thousand pence. So mightily grew <lb/>
            the word of God and prevailed; and his grace thus strength­ <lb/>
            ening the faithful, the party of the ungodly dwindled and <lb/>
            was confounded. But Paul sent Timotheus and Erastus <lb/>
            into Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia for a season.1</p>
          <p>Demetrius, a silversmith, perceiving that the teaching of <lb/>
            Paul induced the inhabitants of Ephesus to forsake the <lb/>
            temple of Diana, and grieved that the profits of his trade <lb/>
            were reduced to almost nothing, by the idols being con­ <lb/>
            demned to destruction, called together his fellow workmen, <lb/>
            and, setting forth their common grievances, stirred up a <lb/>
            clamorous tumult of the people. The riotous mob rushed <lb/>
            furiously into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions; but their <lb/>

            well, after exhorting them to persevere in their new career ; <lb/>
            and then departed to go into Macedonia. He remained <lb/>
            three months in Greece. His companions were Sosipater, <lb/>
            son of Birrus of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus and Secundns ; Gains of Derbe, and Timotheus; <lb/>
            and of Asia, Titicus and Trophimus. After the days of <lb/>
            unleavened bread, Paul and Luke sailed from Philippic and <lb/>
            came to Troas in five days; where they abode seven days. <lb/>
            And upon the first day of the week, when several of the <lb/>
            disciples came together to break bread, as they were listen­ <lb/>
            ing to a long discourse which Paul, who was ready to depart <lb/>
            on the morrow, continued until midnight, a young man, <lb/>
            named Eutychus, who sat in a window, fell down from the <lb/>
            third loft, overcome by sleep, but was restored to life by the <lb/>
            prayers of Paul, to the joy of all beholders.1</p>
          <p>From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and calling the <lb/>
            elders of the church, addressed them at length on matters <lb/>
            pertaining to the salvation of souls. And when he had <lb/>
            finished his discourse he kneeled down and prayed with <lb/>
            them all. And they all wept sore, and when they had <lb/>
            embraced each other, the brethren accompanied Paul unto <lb/>
            the ship. Then embarking, he came with a straight course <lb/>
            unto Coos, and to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara, and, <lb/>
            passing through Syria, arrived at Tyre, where he stayed <lb/>
            seven days with his faithful friends in Christ. From Ptole­ <lb/>
            mais he went to Cæsarea, and entered into the house of <lb/>
            Philip the evangelist, who had four daughters, virgins, which <lb/>
            did propbesy.2</p>
          <p>Then came down from Judea a prophet, named Agabus, <lb/>
            who bound his own hands and feet with Paul's girdle, and <lb/>
            by the grace of the Holy Ghost clearly predicted that the- <lb/>
            Jews at Jerusalem would bind Paul in the same manner, <lb/>
            and would deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. All <lb/>
            who heard him began to weep, but Paul said to those who <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xx. 1—12. Our author, following Origen, gives the name of <lb/>

            besought him not to go up to Jerusalem, " I am ready, not <lb/>
            to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name <lb/>
            of the Lord Jesus.”1</p>
          <p>Thus supported by the firmness of his faith, Paul went up <lb/>
            to Jerusalem, and related to James and the other elders <lb/>
            what things God had wrought among the gentiles by his <lb/>
            ministry; and when they heard of the conversion of the <lb/>
            gentiles, they magnified God the Creator of all things. <lb/>
            The next day Paul entered into the temple to purify <lb/>
            himself, and began to perform the ceremonies of the Mosaic <lb/>
            law, in order to remove every occasion of scandal to those <lb/>
            who were zealous for the laws of their fathers; that thus <lb/>
            making himself a Jew among the Jews, he might gain <lb/>
            all men. But the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw <lb/>
            him in the temple, stirred up the people by their malevolent <lb/>
            clamours, and laid hands on him. And all the city was <lb/>
            moved, and the people ran together; and they took Paul, <lb/>
            and drew him out of the temple, and forthwith the doors <lb/>
            were shut. They then began to beat him, and sought to kill <lb/>
            him. Claudius Lysias, the tribune of a cohort, when he <lb/>
            heard that all Jerusalem was suddenly in an uproar, imme­ <lb/>
            diately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them, <lb/>
            and, to prevent the populace from taking the apostle's life, <lb/>
            he forcibly rescued him out of their hands, and having bound <lb/>
            him with two chains, drew him out of the crowd, and com­ <lb/>
            manded him to be carried into the castle, that he might <lb/>
            inquire of him who he was, and what he had done. With <lb/>
            the tribune's consent, Paul ascended the stairs, and, speaking <lb/>
            to the people in the Hebrew tongue, gave a full account <lb/>
            of his conversion, and of his former conversation as a Jew, <lb/>
            and offered afterwards the best arguments for his change <lb/>
            to the faith of Christ. While he was thus judiciously speak­ <lb/>
            ing, the Jews, impatient at the force of his words, began to <lb/>
            raise violent clamours, and furiously exclaimed: " Away with <lb/>
            such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should <lb/>
            live." The chief captain, therefore, commanded him to be <lb/>
            brought into the castle, and scourged and tortured. Then <lb/>
            Paul said unto the centurion that stood by: " Is it lawful <lb/>
            to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned ?” <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xxi. 10—13. (A.D. 58.) </note> <pb n="202"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. III.</note><lb/>
            The chief captain, after he knew that he was a Roman <lb/>
            citizen, was afraid because he had bound him.1</p>
          <p>On the morrow Paul was brought before the council, <lb/>
            and standing in the midst defended himself with great <lb/>
            ability. But the high priest Ananias commanded them <lb/>
            that stood by to smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul <lb/>
            unto him: " God shall smite thee, thou whited wall; for <lb/>
            sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest <lb/>
            me to be smitten contrary to the law ?” And they that <lb/>
            stood by said, “ Revilest thou God's high priest?" Then <lb/>
            said Paul: “ I wist not, brethren, that he was the high <lb/>
            priest. For it is written : Thou shalt not speak evil of the <lb/>
            ruler of thy people."3 But when Paul perceived that the <lb/>
            one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, he cried <lb/>
            out in the council, " Men and brethren, I am a pharisee, <lb/>
            the son of a pharisee; of the hope and resurrection of the <lb/>
            dead I am called in question." At these words, there <lb/>
            arose a dissension between the two parties, and the <lb/>
            multitude was divided. For the sadducees say that there <lb/>
            is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the phari­ <lb/>
            sees confess both. Some of the pharisees took his part, <lb/>
            saying, " We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an <lb/>
            angel bath spoken to hiln.”3 ... And when there arose a <lb/>
            great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be <lb/>
            pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to take <lb/>
            him by force from among them, and to bring him into the <lb/>
            castled</p>
          <p>And the night following, the Lord stood by him, and <lb/>
            said: " Be of good cheer ; for as thou hast testified of me in <lb/>
            Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome." And <lb/>
            when it was day, more than forty Jews came to the chief <lb/>
            priests and elders, and bound themselves by an oath that <lb/>
            they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul <lb/>
            when on his way to the council. The tribune, hearing of <lb/>
            this conspiracy from Paul's sisters son, dextrously defeated <lb/>
            the plot of these wicked men. For at the third hour of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xxi. 14—XXII. 29. (A.D. 58.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Exodus xxii. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ordericus omits the concluding words of the sentence: “ Let us not <lb/>

            night, he sent the apostle in chains to Cæsarea under an <lb/>
            escort of two hundred soldiers, and threescore and ten <lb/>
            horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, and remitted the case <lb/>
            to the governor Felix in a letter which he wrote to him. <lb/>
            Thus conducted to Cæsarea, Paul was confined in the guard- <lb/>
            house of Herod's palace, and after five days was called <lb/>
            before the assembly. Ananias, the high priest, was present <lb/>
            with the elders of the Jews, and the orator Tertullus framed <lb/>
            an insidious accusation against Paul. The accused, with <lb/>
            the governor's permission, briefly replied, and by his <lb/>
            prudent answer completely refuted all that was laid to his <lb/>
            charge. Felix the governor then adjourned the assembly <lb/>
            until the arrival of the tribune, and ordered the centu­ <lb/>
            rion to treat Paul kindly. And after certain days, Felix <lb/>
            came with his wife Drusilla who was a Jewess, and sending <lb/>
            for Paul, heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <lb/>
            And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and <lb/>
            judgment to come, Felix trembled; but he often sent for him, <lb/>
            hoping to obtain money from him. At the end of two <lb/>
            years, Portius Festus succeeded Felix, who, willing to show <lb/>
            the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards Festus went down to Cæsarea, and <lb/>
            there commanded the Jews to bring forward their accusation <lb/>
            against Paul. In consequence they laid many and grievous <lb/>
            complaints against him. which they could not prove, while <lb/>
            Paul justified himself in these words : " Neither against the <lb/>
            law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against <lb/>
            Cæsar, have I offended anything at all." At last, through <lb/>
            the under-hand arts of the Jews, and the double dealing of <lb/>
            the judge, whose policy it was to conciliate them, Paul found <lb/>
            it necessary to appeal to Cæsar. He was also brought <lb/>
            before an assembly over which King Agrippa and the <lb/>
            governor Festus presided, when, raising his hand, he gave <lb/>
            an account of his calling and his faith in Christ, in a very <lb/>
            eloquent speech. When it was ended, all present admired his <lb/>
            wisdom; and the great men going aside, talked between <lb/>
            themselves, saying: "This man bath done nothing worthy of <lb/>
            death or of bonds. He might have been set at liberty, if <lb/>
            he had not appealed unto Cæsar.” He was, therefore, <lb/>
            delivered to Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort, one <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xxiii. 10—XXIV. 27. </note> <pb n="204"/>

            Aristarchus, a Macedonian, and Luke, being his fellow tra­ <lb/>
            vellers. There were in the ship two hundred and seventy-six <lb/>
            souls; the voyage, which violent tempests rendered very <lb/>
            dangerous, lasted fourteen days, during which they saw <lb/>
            neither sun nor stars; and took no food as they despaired of <lb/>
            being saved. Paul had tried to persuade them to winter in <lb/>
            Crete, but the earnest advice of the pilot and the master of <lb/>
            the ship prevailed with the centurion and soldiers to prose­ <lb/>
            cute the voyage. Their heedless haste induced them to <lb/>
            brave the storms of the winter season, and almost the whole <lb/>
            of them would have been lost, but for the aid afforded them <lb/>
            by the merits of Paul. But they suffered much from terror <lb/>
            and fatigue when they were wrecked on the quicksands ; and <lb/>
            all the tackle of the shipwas carried away, and theywere forced <lb/>
            to throw overboard the wheat and all that burdened the vessel. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, the angel of God stood before Paul, and said to <lb/>
            him, “ Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar; <lb/>
            and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.1</p>
          <p>After the ship had gone to pieces, it was with the greatest <lb/>
            difficulty that they reached the island of Mitylene.3 And <lb/>
            the barbarous people showed them great kindness, and <lb/>
            kindled a fire for their comfort, because of the rain and cold. <lb/>
            And when Paul was heaping faggots on the fire, a viper <lb/>
            came out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. The bar­ <lb/>
            barians, seeing this, cried out that the man was a murderer, <lb/>
            and would doubtless soon die. But Paul shook the viper <lb/>
            into the fire, and, to the surprise of all, felt no harm.3</p>
          <p>Publius, the governor of the island, hospitably entertained <lb/>
            the shipwrecked people three days. While there, Paul went <lb/>
            to see the father of Publius who lay sick of fever and dysen­ <lb/>
            tery, and having prayed over him, laid his hands on him, and <lb/>
            healed him. Others also of the islanders who bad diseases <lb/>
            came to him, and were healed. They therefore treated the <lb/>
            shipwrecked crew and passengers with great respect, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of Paul's merits, and when they departed, supplied them <lb/>
            with all that was necessary for their voyage. At the end of <lb/>
            three months, they embarked in a ship of Alexandria, which <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xxv. 1—XXVII. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> 2St. Luke calls this island Melita, generally supposed to be the <lb/>

            had wintered in the island, and, by God's guidance, arrived <lb/>
            not long afterwards at Rome; when some of the brethren, <lb/>
            hearing of Paul's arrival, went out to meet and congratulate <lb/>
            him. At Rome Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, in <lb/>
            the custody of a soldier; and after three days, he called the <lb/>
            chief of the Jews together, and complained to them of his <lb/>
            arrest and the ill-treatment he had suffered from their <lb/>
            brethren at Jerusalem. He then gave them a faithful <lb/>
            account of the true faith which is in Jesus Christ. He <lb/>
            dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, preaching to <lb/>
            all men the kingdom of God, and teaching the things which <lb/>
            concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man <lb/>
            forbidding him.1</p>
          <p>I have hitherto followed the narrative of St. Luke the <lb/>
            evangelist, in the Acts of the Apostles, who, omitting fur­ <lb/>
            ther notice of the other apostles, relates that Paul went to <lb/>
            Rome, where, for the space of two years, he' preached the <lb/>
            word of God without hindrance. He came to Rome in the <lb/>
            second year of the reign of Nero, and defended himself <lb/>
            before the emperor, who at the commencement of his reign <lb/>
            was as yet disposed to be merciful. By God's help, he was <lb/>
            set at liberty at the command of Nero, whom, by a figure, <lb/>
            he calls The Lion;" and quitting Rome, he journeyed <lb/>
            through the nations of the west, as far as Narbonué, a <lb/>
            city of Gaul. It is reported that he there built a church, <lb/>
            which he dedicated in honour of the Maccabean martyrs, <lb/>
            where is still seen the sign of the cross, marked in oil, <lb/>
            which the apostle traced with his thumb on the wall; he then <lb/>
            ordained his disciple Paul bishop of that city, who there, <lb/>
            after performing many good works, terminated his career by <lb/>
            a happy end.2</p>
          <p>In the same manner, several others, who had been <lb/>
            instructed in the doctrine of the Catholic faith by the holy <lb/>
            doctor of the gentiles, shed a wonderful lustre on the church <lb/>
            of God, being placed in the chair of authority to govern <lb/>
            the people of God in various countries. Luke in Bithynia, <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xxviii. 7—31. (A.D. 61—63.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2The metropolitan church of Narbonne was neither founded by St. <lb/>

            the thread of my narrative from the materials furnished by <lb/>
            the writings of the fathers. I shall have to tell how these <lb/>
            glorious princes of the earth, nobly bearing the standard of <lb/>
            the true Joshua, re-conquered the land of promise; how they <lb/>
            loved each other during their lives, and were not sepa­ <lb/>
            rated in death ; how, animated with the same spirit, they <lb/>
            fought at Rome against the emperor Nero and Simon the <lb/>
            magician; and how, having vanquished the enemy, they <lb/>
            received on the same day their heavenly crowns.2</p>
          <p>Marcellus, a Roman, son of the prefect Marcus, baptized <lb/>
            by the apostle Peter, has described the frowardness of Simon <lb/>
            Magus and the simplicity of Peter, in a letter addressed to <lb/>
            the holy martyrs Nereus and Achilleus, while they were <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Trophimus, the disciple of St. Paul, is a different person from his <lb/>
            namesake, the bishop of Arles, one of the seven bishops mentioned in the <lb/>
            preceding note. Ordericus Vitalis has made other mistakes of the same <lb/>
            kind in this passage. Thus St. Luke, though he preached in many parts <lb/>
            of Bithynia, never settled there, and SS. Carpus and Sosthenes were <lb/>
            simply disciples of St. Paul, without any particular mission or ecclesiastical <lb/>
            rank. The attributing to Onesimus the bishopric of Ephesus arose from <lb/>
            confusing the disciple of the apostle with a bishop who was contemporary <lb/>
            with St. Ignatius in 107. Tychicus was not sent to Paphos, but succes­ <lb/>
            sively to Colosse and Ephesus. As for Erastus, all that is known about <lb/>
            him is, that he held the post of treasurer of some city (probably Corinth) <lb/>
            before he attached himself to St. Paul. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ordericus is speaking particularly of the apostles SS. Peter and Paul, <lb/>

            banished to the island of Palmaria for the faith of Christ, <lb/>
            and daily combated the magicians Furius and Priscus, dis­ <lb/>
            ciples of Simon Magus with irrefragable arguments for the <lb/>
            truth. Marcellus relates that on a certain day, while Simon <lb/>
            was disputing with Peter, calling him a magician, and en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to excite the hatred of the Roman people against <lb/>
            him, a widow happened to pass with a great crowd, following <lb/>
            to the grave her only son over whom she mourned with <lb/>
            loud cries. Then Peter said to the followers of Simon, " Ap­ <lb/>
            proach the bier, and remove the corpse. Whoever restores <lb/>
            it to life may be well believed to possess the true faith." <lb/>
            When the people had done as he desired, Simon said: "If <lb/>
            I should bring him to life again, will you put Peter to <lb/>
            death The multitude answered: “We will burn him <lb/>
            alive ! Then Simon having conjured up his demons, <lb/>
            began with their aid to operate on the body, which made <lb/>
            a slight motion, and the people, observing it, raised <lb/>
            shouts in praise of Simon, and threatened Peter with death. <lb/>
            However Peter, having with some difficulty obtained silence, <lb/>
            addressed the crowd in these words: “ If this body lives, <lb/>
            let it speak, walk, take food, and return home. If not, be <lb/>
            assured that you are deceived by Simon." Then the people <lb/>
            exclaimed with one voice: " If Simon be not able to do <lb/>
            this, he shall suffer the punishment which he destined for <lb/>
            Peter." Simon now, feigning to be angry, tried to run <lb/>
            away; but the crowd caught hold of him, and loaded him <lb/>
            with reproaches. Peter, then extending his hands towards <lb/>
            heaven, said: " Lord Jesus Christ, who saidst unto us thy dis­ <lb/>
            ciples : ’ Go, in my name, cast out devils, heal the sick, raise <lb/>
            the dead;' restore now this child to life, that all the people <lb/>
            here may acknowledge that thou art God, and that there is <lb/>
            none other than thou, who livest and reignest with the Father <lb/>
            and the Holy Ghost, through all ages, Amen." The child im­ <lb/>
            mediately arose, and worshipped Peter, saying: " I saw the <lb/>
            Lord Jesus Christ commanding his angels thus: ' At the <lb/>
            request of Peter, my faithful friend, let that orphan, and <lb/>
            only child, be restored to his widowed mother.'" The people <note type="footnote"> of St. Jerome. Ordericus has borrowed several passages from it in the <lb/>
            sequel, as will be observed in passing; but this paragraph, and part of that <lb/>
            which follows, is taken from another source, the legend of SS. Nereus and <lb/>

            now began to exclaim unanimously: " There is but one <lb/>
            God, the one that Peter preaches." Simon meanwhile trans­ <lb/>
            formed himself into the shape of a dog, and tried to escape; <lb/>
            but the populace held him fast, and, as they strove to throw <lb/>
            him into the fire, Peter rushed into the midst of the crowd <lb/>
            and set him free. “ Our Mastery he said, "taught us to <lb/>
            render good for evil." Simon, therefore, escaped, and went <lb/>
            to see Marcellus, whom he had already seduced, and tied <lb/>
            up at the entrance of the house an enormous dog, which <lb/>
            could scarcely be held fast by the iron chain with which it <lb/>
            was bound. " We shall now see," said he, "if Paul, who is <lb/>
            accustomed to come to see you, will be able to enter." An <lb/>
            hour had scarcely elapsed when Paul appeared at the door, <lb/>
            and, making the sign of the cross, unchained the dog, saying: <lb/>
            “ Go and say to Simon : Cease from employing the services <lb/>
            of demons to deceive the people for whom Christ shed his <lb/>
            blood." Marcellus, witnessing such wonders, ran to meet <lb/>
            Peter, and throwing himself at his feet, received him into <lb/>
            his house, from which he expelled Simon with utter con­ <lb/>
            tempt. The dog now became gentle towards every one <lb/>
            except Simon, whom he continually worried; but, one day, <lb/>
            when he had got him under him, Peter ran up to him, <lb/>
            exclaiming: " I command thee, in the name of our Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, not to inflict a bite on any part of that man's <lb/>
            body." The animal from that moment could not touch one <lb/>
            of Simon's limbs, but it so tore his clothes that no part <lb/>
            of his body remained covered. Then all the people, and <lb/>
            especially the children, ran after him with the dog, and <lb/>
            drove him beyond the walls of the town, howling as if they <lb/>
            bad been in pursuit of a wolf. Unable to bear the scandal <lb/>
            of this ignominious treatment, Simon did not venture to make <lb/>
            his appearance for a whole twelvemonth; but after that, he <lb/>
            made himself known to the emperor Nero, and the rogue <lb/>
            thus attaching himself to one of the worst of men, became <lb/>
            all the worse for the connexion.</p>
          <p>As the end of the apostle's warfare drew nigh, the Lord <lb/>
            appeared to his servant Peter in a vision, saying: " Simon <lb/>
            and Nero, fully possessed by demons, are plotting against <lb/>
            thee. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will grant thee the <lb/>
            consolation of seeing Paul my apostle, who to-morrow will <lb/>
            enter Rome. In concert with him, thou shalt make war <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            upon Simon for the space of seven months, and when thou <lb/>
            bast conquered, driven away, and cast him into hell, ye <lb/>
            shall both come to me crowned as victors. All this took <lb/>
            place. Indeed Paul arrived the very next day. Pope St. <lb/>
            Linus has related when and how the apostles met, and how <lb/>
            they had a conflict with Simon seven months afterwards; <lb/>
            with full particulars of their martyrdom in a work <lb/>
            written in the Greek language for the use of the <lb/>
            eastern churches.1 From this narrative I propose to make <lb/>
            some extracts in the way I have already done, and to <lb/>
            compile, in as few words as I can, an abridged account of all <lb/>
            the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Having learnt that Paul was arrived at Rome, Peter was <lb/>
            overjoyed, and immediately rose and went out to meet <lb/>
            him. When they saw each other, they wept with delight, <lb/>
            remained for a long time locked in a close embrace, and <lb/>
            bathed themselves mutually with tears. These two great <lb/>
            apostles beginning to preach the word of God, the greater <lb/>
            part of the mixed population believed, nor could the in­ <lb/>
            furiated assemblies of Jews or Gentiles make any open <lb/>
            resistance to those whom the Holy Spirit had largely endowed <lb/>
            with the fulness of all wisdom.</p>
          <p>While an innumerable multitude of persons were con­ <lb/>
            verted to the Lord by Peter's preaching, it happened that <lb/>
            Livia, the consort of Nero, and Agrippina, the wife of the <lb/>
            prefect Agrippa, also embraced Christianity; and, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence, they separated from their husbands, and vowed to <lb/>
            lead a life of chastity for love of the eternal King.</p>
          <p>Paul also displayed the lustre of manifold graces, and <lb/>
            roused the wonder of the Roman world by signs and won­ <lb/>
            ders, by his great learning, and admirable sanctity.2 Having <lb/>
            purchased a public garden outside the walls, there, assisted <lb/>
            by Luke, Titus, and other faithful members of the church, <lb/>
            he discoursed on the word of life. Meanwhile he began to <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">1 Ordericus here refers to a pseudononymous work entitled, D. Lini, <lb/>

            collect a very great multitude of hearers, and, by God's help, <lb/>
            many souls were added to the faith through him ; so that <lb/>
            the fame of his preaching and holiness was noised through­ <lb/>
            out the city, and his reputation spread over the whole <lb/>
            neighbouring country. Many officers of the emperor's <lb/>
            household hastened to hear him preach, and became be­ <lb/>
            lievers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Some also of the guards <lb/>
            of the imperial bed-chamber resorted to him, and, becoming <lb/>
            Christians, left the service. Inflamed with inward fervour, <lb/>
            they attached themselves to Christ, and refused to return to <lb/>
            their ranks in the palace, preferring the glory conferred by <lb/>
            the true faith and its virtues, to the profession of arms, <lb/>
            riches, and honours. Thus every day the cause of Satan suf­ <lb/>
            fered loss, while the triumphs of the faithful increased. Even <lb/>
            Seneca, the emperor's tutor, formed so close an intimacy with <lb/>
            Paul, finding in him divine knowledge, that he could scarcely <lb/>
            live for a moment without conversing with the apostle; and <lb/>
            when he was prevented from listening to his words, he sought <lb/>
            by an interchange of letters to enjoy the charms of friendly <lb/>
            communication, and to profit by his good advice. It was thus <lb/>
            that, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, his doctrine <lb/>
            spread itself and made itself beloved; so that he taught <lb/>
            freely, and was listened to with enthusiasm by his numerous <lb/>
            bearers. He disputed with the pagan philosophers and <lb/>
            confounded the Jews; and almost all the world submitted to <lb/>
            his teaching. Even some of his writings were read to the <lb/>
            emperor by his own tutor ; a circumstance which made him <lb/>
            generally esteemed: the senate also were not indifferent to <lb/>
            his merits.</p>
          <p>But while these two illustrious apostles thus shed a <lb/>
            divine lustre, not only amongst the Romans, but also <lb/>
            amongst all who from different countries thronged to <lb/>
            Rome, the capital of the world, the elders of the synagogues <lb/>
            and some chief men of the gentiles, inflamed with bitter <lb/>
            zeal, stirred up the hatred of the turbulent mob against <lb/>
            the apostles by their impious accusations. They, therefore, <lb/>
            sent Simon Magus to Nero as he was leaving the palace, and <lb/>
            commissioned him to prefer false charges against the blessed <lb/>
            apostles. Simon began to speak much evil of Peter, declar­ <lb/>
            ing him to be a magician and a corrupter of the people. <lb/>
            The wicked believed this man, who deluded them with <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            magical tricks, at which they gaped with ignorant wonder; <lb/>
            for at his command a brazen serpent moved, dogs cut in <lb/>
            stone barked, bronze statues laughed and walked; while he <lb/>
            himself would run and suddenly rise into the air.</p>
          <p>As a contrast to these impositions, Peter cured the sick <lb/>
            with a word; restored sight to the blind by his prayers; <lb/>
            drove away demons by a simple command. Meanwhile he <lb/>
            even raised the dead, and drew away all those he could from <lb/>
            the pernicious company of the magician. The result was <lb/>
            that every religious man detested Simon, while all the <lb/>
            wicked men, on the contrary, became his accomplices, and <lb/>
            by false testimony accused Peter of crimes which he had not <lb/>
            committed. At last these accusations came to the ear of <lb/>
            Nero, who ordered the magician to appear before him. <lb/>
            When conducted into the emperors presence, he began to <lb/>
            deceive the spectators by illusive tricks, transforming him­ <lb/>
            self into different shapes, so as at one time to appear a boy, <lb/>
            the next moment an old Burn, and at another time a youth. <lb/>
            Thus, by the help of Satan, he played his antics in <lb/>
            different forms; a sight which so astonished the emperor, <lb/>
            that he took him for the son of God. Then the magician, <lb/>
            with his accomplices, accused the apostles, and Nero gave <lb/>
            orders that Peter and Paul should be brought in great <lb/>
            haste before him. As early as the day after, the apostles <lb/>
            and the magician disputed before Cæsar; and, as our faith­ <lb/>
            ful narrative informs us, they performed many wonders. For <lb/>
            the disciples of the truth declared the truth, asserting that <lb/>
            the magician was throughout a thief and a rogue; and to <lb/>
            prevent the weak-minded from listening to him, protested <lb/>
            solemnly that he was an infamous apostate. When Simon <lb/>
            threatened to send his angels to punish Paul, the latter <lb/>
            secretly requested Nero to order that a barley-loaf should <lb/>
            be brought and given to him privately. This having been <lb/>
            done, Peter took the loaf, which he blessed, broke, and hid <lb/>
            in his sleeve: he then inquired of the magician, who boasted <lb/>
            of being the son of God, what he had just done. Provoked <lb/>
            at not being able to discover the apostle's secret, Simon <lb/>
            called loudly to several enormous dogs, and ordered them to <lb/>
            come and devour Peter before the eyes of Cæsar. Behold, <lb/>
            suddenly there appeared dogs of a wonderful size, which <lb/>
            leaped upon Peter. The apostle, however, kneeling on the <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. III.</note><lb/>
            ground, extended his two hands, and exhibited the loaf <lb/>
            he had blessed. As soon as the dogs perceived it, they <lb/>
            suddenly disappeared. Thus the magician was publicly <lb/>
            exposed, and became the laughing-stock of all the world, <lb/>
            as he could only exhibit the ferocity of his dogs, instead of <lb/>
            the power of the angels he had promised to send against <lb/>
            the apostle ; and in this manner showed that the angels <lb/>
            who obeyed his orders came from the kennel, and not from <lb/>
            heaven.</p>
          <p>At last, Simon Magus having been frequently confounded <lb/>
            by the power of the apostles' words, Nero commanded that <lb/>
            a lofty wooden tower should be built in the Field of Mars. <lb/>
            The next day, the emperor, the senate, the Roman knights, <lb/>
            and all the people assembled there to witness the show; <lb/>
            and, by the command of Nero, the apostles were also brought <lb/>
            to the place. Then Simon, having ascended to the top of <lb/>
            the tower, before all the people, crowned with laurel, he <lb/>
            extended his hands towards heaven, and began to take his <lb/>
            flight in the air. Meanwhile, Paul, on his knees in the <lb/>
            presence of the whole crowd, was praying to the Lord ; <lb/>
            while Peter was attentively watching Simon's tricks, and <lb/>
            waited patiently for the moment favourable for the infliction <lb/>
            of divine vengeance. At last he said to his faithful com­ <lb/>
            panion, "Paul, raise your head a little, and look." Paul <lb/>
            lifted up his eyes, full of tears, and saw Simon already flying <lb/>
            through the air ; then he said: " Peter, why do you delay ? <lb/>
            Finish what you have begun, for the Lord Jesus Christ <lb/>
            already calls us to him." Then Peter, looking towards <lb/>
            Simon, exclaimed: " Angels of Satan, who bear this impostor <lb/>
            through the air to lead into error the hearts of the unbe­ <lb/>
            lievers, I adjure you, by God, the Creator of all things, and <lb/>
            by our Lord Jesus, his Son, who on the third day was <lb/>
            raised from the dead, that from this moment you cease to <lb/>
            carry him, and let him fall."</p>
          <p>Immediately, obeying the voice of Peter, the demons al­ <lb/>
            lowed their burden to drop from the clouds, and the magician <lb/>
            fell on the spot which is called the Sacred Street [Via Sacra], <lb/>
            where his body, broken into four quarters, spread over <lb/>
            four stones, which bear testimony to the triumph of the <lb/>
            apostles to the present day. Hearing the crash, Paul raised <lb/>
            his head, and returned thanks to God, the just judge. <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
             <lb/>
            Nero, inflamed with rage, ordered Peter and Paul to be <lb/>
            thrown into prison; while, by his orders, Simon's corpse <lb/>
            was carefully guarded for three days and as many nights, <lb/>
            because he was convinced that the magician would rise again <lb/>
            on the third day. Paul, on the contrary, asserted that he <lb/>
            was damned to all eternity. While the apostles were re­ <lb/>
            joicing in the Holy Ghost, and openly confessed that the <lb/>
            Lord Jesus was their master, Nero, transported with anger, <lb/>
            said to his prefect Agrippa : " It is absolutely necessary <lb/>
            that those impious men should perish by a condign punish­ <lb/>
            ment ; procure, therefore, some iron chains, and let them <lb/>
            be burnt in the Naumachia." Agrippa replied: "It is not <lb/>
            right that you should order them to be executed in that <lb/>
            way, as Paul appears to be innocent of the murder of <lb/>
            Simon; it is, however but just that he should lose his <lb/>
            head, on account of his impiety. As for Peter, who com­ <lb/>
            mitted the homicide, order him to be crucified.”1 The <lb/>
            emperor assenting, the teachers of eternal salvation were <lb/>
            immediately removed from his presence and delivered over to <lb/>
            Paulinus.</p>
          <p>Paulinus, one of the most illustrious of the Roman magis­ <lb/>
            tracy, received the charge of the apostles of Christ, and cola­ <lb/>
            fined them in the Mamertine prison, where they were guarded <lb/>
            by Processus, Martinian, and other soldiers. They remained <lb/>
            in this prison for nine months, and cured by their prayers <lb/>
            many sick people and demoniacs who came to them. More­ <lb/>
            over, as their fellow prisoners cried without ceasing, and <lb/>
            united in begging for water to quench the thirst that tor­ <lb/>
            mented them, the blessed apostles prayed to God, and their <lb/>
            prayer was quickly answered by him whom they trusted. <lb/>
            For the blessed apostle Peter, having made the sign of the <lb/>
            cross on the Tarpeian rock, at the same moment a spring <lb/>
            burst from the side of the hill. Then Processus, Martinian, <lb/>
            and all the prisoners, threw themselves at the feet of the <lb/>
            apostle Peter, and forty-seven persons, believing in the Lord, <lb/>
            were baptized. The apostle offered up for them the eucha­ <lb/>
            ristic sacrifice and made them partake of the holy com­ <lb/>
            mUllIon. <note type="footnote"> 1 This paragraph, thus far, and the two preceding ones, are extracted <lb/>

             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. II. CH. III.</note>At the sight of so many wonders, the officers,1 Processus <lb/>
            and Martinian, said to the apostles: “ Depart wherever <lb/>
            you like, for Nero has forgotten you, and will not miss you." <lb/>
            Peter and Paul, being entreated by the brethren to leave <lb/>
            the prison, quitted it at the end of nine months, and, passing <lb/>
            along the Via Appia, arrived safe at the city gate. Then <lb/>
            Paul went to visit his acquaintance and friends in the city, <lb/>
            and strengthened in the faith the Romans and the rest of <lb/>
            the believers, who rejoiced greatly at his escape; and, as <lb/>
            his custom was, sowed the seed abundantly of the word of <lb/>
            God, and, with his help, added for some days to the number <lb/>
            of the faithful. The blessed Peter, who had the flesh of his <lb/>
            leg eaten into by the fetters (the bandage falling off by the side <lb/>
            of the fence in the Via Nova), had almost reached the Appian <lb/>
            Gate, when the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him. As <lb/>
            soon as Peter had perceived him, he worshipped him, saying: <lb/>
            " Lord whither goest thou?" The Lord said to him: <lb/>
            " Follow me, Peter; for I am going to Rome to be crucified <lb/>
            a second time.” The apostle, immediately following him, <lb/>
            turned back towards Rome, and our Saviour then said to <lb/>
            him: " Fear not, for I am with you until I introduce you <lb/>
            into my Father's house.”2</p>
          <p>When Paul returned to the city in the morning, the <lb/>
            officers arrested him, and dragged him before the emperor's <lb/>
            tribunal. Then Nero, remembering what had before occurred, <lb/>
            gave orders that Peter should be nailed to a cross, and <lb/>
            Paul be beheaded. But when Peter was led to the foot of <lb/>
            the cross, his thoughts wholly occupied with heavenly things. <lb/>
            he acutely felt that the Lord Jesus Christ, who descended <lb/>
            from heaven upon the earth, had been raised upon a cross <lb/>
            planted upright, and he entreated the executioners to reverse <lb/>
            his, and crucify him with his head downwards. This they <lb/>
            did. fixing his feet above and his hands underneath. Then <lb/>
            an innumerable multitude of people assembled so full of in­ <lb/>
            dignation that they would have committed the emperor Nero <note type="footnote"> 1 Magistriani, called also magisteriani, were ministerial officers of the <lb/>
            lower empire. Ducange describes them as agentes in rebus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These two paragraphs, and the sentence which precedes them, are <lb/>

            . tradition reports to be the scene of this apparition, took its name from St. <lb/>
            Peter's words : Domine quo vadis ? </note> <pb n="215"/>

            himself to the flames. But Peter forbade them, saying: <lb/>
            " Nay, nay, my children, put no obstacle in my way; my <lb/>
            feet already walk on the road to heaven. Grieve not, but <lb/>
            rather rejoice with me, for to-day I receive the fruit of my <lb/>
            labours."</p>
          <p>Then after a long exhortation, in which he clearly explained <lb/>
            the type of the cross of Christ, whose steps he followed, he <lb/>
            prayed, and returned thanks to God, saying: "I give <lb/>
            thanks to thee, 0 good Shepherd, because the flock that thou <lb/>
            hast entrusted to my care share with me this trial; and I <lb/>
            beseech thee, Lord, to let them partake with me of thy <lb/>
            mercy in thy kingdom." He added: " Good Shepherd, Jesus <lb/>
            Christ, I commend to thee the sheep that thou didst coin­ <lb/>
            mit to my care, that they may not perceive that they have <lb/>
            lost me, having thee for their protector, by whose aid I have <lb/>
            been able to govern this flock.” With these words he <lb/>
            yielded up his spirit.</p>
          <p>Immediately, there appeared men, who had never been <lb/>
            seen in that place, and whom no one had been able to see <lb/>
            there, either before or afterwards, and they said that they <lb/>
            were come from Jerusalem for Peter's sake. These men, in <lb/>
            concert with the illustrious Marcellus, secretly carried off <lb/>
            the body of the apostle, and deposited it under a turpentine <lb/>
            tree, near the Naumachia, in the place which is called <lb/>
            the Vatican; testifying that the friends of our Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ were ordained to be the mighty patrons of the <lb/>
            Romans.1</p>
          <p>I shall now make some brief extracts from the history of <lb/>
            the martyrdom of St. Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, <lb/>
            showing how he fought a good fight, and finished his course, <lb/>
            and obtained the reward of his heavenly calling, inserting <lb/>
            the account in this place to the praise of the ineffable <lb/>
            Saviour.2</p>
          <p>After Paul had left the prison, as before related, he <lb/>
            returned to the garden, where lie lodged before; and <lb/>
            there great numbers of his friends resorted to him <lb/>
            with much joy. At last one day, towards evening, <note type="footnote"> 1 The preceding three paragraphs are borrowed from the account pub­ <lb/>

            as be was inculcating his saving doctrine, and teaching <lb/>
            the crowds in an upper chamber, Patroclus, the em­ <lb/>
            peror's cup-bearer, having been invited by some of his <lb/>
            own intimate friends, withdrew from his master's presence, <lb/>
            and repaired at nightfall to Paul that he might hear <lb/>
            the lessons of everlasting life. But on account of the <lb/>
            crowd he could not get near the master, to hear con­ <lb/>
            veniently the word of God which he fervently loved: he <lb/>
            therefore got up into a very high window, and there sat. <lb/>
            Now as Paul prolonged his discourse until a late hour, the <lb/>
            young man became drowsy, and through the snares and <lb/>
            malice of Satan, fell asleep, and falling from the window of <lb/>
            the room, which was on a very high floor, expired. The news <lb/>
            of this accident was speedily carried to Nero as he was <lb/>
            returning from the bath, and being extremely attached to <lb/>
            the young man, he was much concerned, and appointed <lb/>
            another to be cup-bearer in his place.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Paul, who still continued his instructions within, <lb/>
            immediately knew, through the Holy Spirit, what bad hap­ <lb/>
            pened, and informed those present of the accident, ordering <lb/>
            them to bring forthwith the lifeless body to him. As soon <lb/>
            as the corpse was brought into the room, Paul addressed <lb/>
            the people, and exhorted them to pray with a full faith to <lb/>
            the Lord Jesus for the resurrection of the dead man. All <lb/>
            present fell on their knees to join in prayer, which being <lb/>
            concluded, Paul said: " Young Patroclus, rise up and relate <lb/>
            what the Lord has done for you." Whereupon Patroclus <lb/>
            suddenly arose as if from sleep, and began to glorify Al­ <lb/>
            mighty God. Then Paul sent him away rejoicing with the <lb/>
            other officers of Cæsar's household.1</p>
          <p>While Nero was lamenting the death of Patroclus, and <lb/>
            abandoning himself to extreme grief, he heard those about <lb/>
            him say that Patroclus was alive and standing at the gate <lb/>
            of the palace. On hearing this, the emperor was seized <lb/>
            with fear, and forbade him to enter the palace and appear in <lb/>
            his presence. At last, listening to the persuasions of his <lb/>
            friends, he gave Patroclus permission to come in, and when <lb/>
            he saw him safe and sound, and showing no signs of death, <note type="footnote"> 1 This tale is one of the repetitions, so frequent in the apocryphal <lb/>
            legends, of the miracle in which St. Paul restored to life the young <lb/>

             <pb n="217"/>
            he was overwhelmed with amazement; and having conversed <lb/>
            with him for awhile, perceived that he was become a Chris­ <lb/>
            tian ; and, unable to restrain his rage, gave him a blow on <lb/>
            the cheek, which caused Patroclus to rejoice the more in <lb/>
            the Lord Jesus.</p>
          <p>Then Barnabas and Justus, Paul, the soldier Arion of <lb/>
            Cappadocia, and Festus the Galatian, all attendants and <lb/>
            friends of Cæsar, said to their master: " Why did you buffet <lb/>
            this young man who is well taught, and gave true answers? <lb/>
            We also are soldiers of the invincible king, Jesus Christ <lb/>
            our Lord." When Cæsar heard them all, with one mind <lb/>
            and one voice, call Jesus the invincible king, he ordered them <lb/>
            to be thrown into prison, resolving to torture cruelly those <lb/>
            he had fondly loved. He also commanded a strict search <lb/>
            to be made for all the setters forth of this great King, and <lb/>
            published a cruel edict that as many as were discovered <lb/>
            should be tortured and punished without trial. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, a strict search was made for the faithful by the <lb/>
            officers, and a great number of them were found and brought <lb/>
            into the presence of Cæsar.</p>
          <p>Amongst these, Paul, always in bonds for Christ's sake, <lb/>
            was led before the emperor in chains. All the other Chris­ <lb/>
            tians looked upon him as their master, and justly honoured <lb/>
            him whom the Lord had pronounced to be a chosen vessel, <lb/>
            each of them preferring him to himself in all things. Nero, <lb/>
            therefore, without any witness could easily understand that <lb/>
            Paul commanded the soldiers of the great King. Having <lb/>
            asked him why he had furtively intruded himself into the <lb/>
            jurisdiction of the Roman state and enticed his soldiers to <lb/>
            desert the imperial service, and enlist under the banner of <lb/>
            his own King,1 Paul, full of the Holy Spirit, boldly pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 However apocryphal, and even absurd, are many of the details of this <lb/>
            legend, the writer seems to have penetrated the true motive of these per­ <lb/>
            secutions. Under the large toleration allowed by the religious system of <lb/>
            the Romans in the time of the emperors, the introduction of a new god <lb/>
            might have been received with indifference, or even with favour; but, in <lb/>
            addition to the exclusive character of the new faith, the ruling powers <lb/>
            became evidently alarmed lest the kingly character attributed to Christ <lb/>
            should interfere with their temporal power. This view of the case was <lb/>
            adroitly put forward by the Jewish Sanhedrim when Christ was arraigned <lb/>
            before the Roman procurator; but Pilate either believed our Lord's <lb/>
            disclaimer of " a kingdom of this world," or thought him too insignificant <lb/>
            a person to cause any serious disturbance, and therefore handed him over </note> <pb n="218"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. III.</note><lb/>
            claimed before all present, the power of Almighty God, and <lb/>
            invited them all to partake of the bounties of his hand which <lb/>
            can dispense the richest gifts to every one according to his <lb/>
            deserts. He also admonished the emperor himself to pay <lb/>
            dutiful allegiance to the supreme King. Lastly, he asserted <lb/>
            that his King would come to judge the quick and the dead, <lb/>
            and destroy the world by fire. At these words, Nero Cæsar <lb/>
            was inflamed with anger, and commanded that all the sol­ <lb/>
            diers of Christ should be burnt at the stake. But Paul <lb/>
            was treated as one guilty of high treason, and a decree of <lb/>
            the Senate was passed, condemning him according to the <lb/>
            Roman laws to lose his head. Having been delivered to <lb/>
            the prefects Longinus and Megistus, and the centurion <lb/>
            Acestus, to be executed without the walls. Paul preached to <lb/>
            them by the way, without intermission, the word of salva­ <lb/>
            tion. The apparitors and officers also who were hastily <lb/>
            despatched by Nero to seek for them, used their utmost . <lb/>
            endeavours to hunt out the Christians who concealed them­ <lb/>
            selves, in order to put them to death. In consequence, such <lb/>
            immense numbers of the faithful were massacred, that the Ro­ <lb/>
            man people, becoming exasperated, made a forcible entrance <lb/>
            into the palace, with the intention of laying violent hands on <lb/>
            Cæsar himself. Then Nero, frightened at the clamours of <lb/>
            the people, issued another edict commanding that the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians should be allowed to live in peace. This rendered it <lb/>
            necessary that Paul should be brought before him a second <lb/>
            time; but as soon as Nero saw him, he vehemently ex­ <lb/>
            claimed : " Take away the magician, take away the sorcerer; <lb/>
            cut off the impostor's head, and sweep from the face of the <lb/>
            earth this perverter of the people's minds.” But Paul <lb/>
            firmly declared that after death he should live eternally, <lb/>
            and be with his invincible King, and that, to prove the truth <lb/>
            of his words, he would show himself visibly alive to the <lb/>
            emperor himself after they had beheaded him. Paul was <lb/>
            now led rejoicing to the place of execution, unceasingly <lb/>
            publishing the words of life to his executioners, and to all <lb/>
            who accompanied him. With the aid of the Holy Spirit, <lb/>
            he showed the emptiness of idolatry, proved its nothingness, <note type="footnote"> to his accusers to be dealt with according to their law, and he was finally <lb/>
            sentenced, on his own confession, for what they called blasphemy, that is <lb/>
            the assertion of his divine nature. </note> <pb n="219"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 67 ?]</note><lb/>
            and admirably set before them the true faith and the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the true God; concluding his discourse with a <lb/>
            magnificent description of the damnation of the repro­ <lb/>
            bate, and the glorious rewards of the righteous. He <lb/>
            did not speak in vain, for his divine teaching suddenly pro­ <lb/>
            duced its fruits; touching and inflaming the hearts of the <lb/>
            crowds who listened to him, and converting the shouts of the <lb/>
            new converts into wailings for their sins.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, as these holy occupations caused some <lb/>
            delay, while the dense crowd rent the air with their cries, <lb/>
            Nero sent Parthenius and Phereta to see if his orders had <lb/>
            been carried into effect, and hasten the apostle's execution, <lb/>
            if he were still alive. In these men also Paul endeavoured <lb/>
            to plant the seeds of salvation, but, evil prevailing, and their <lb/>
            hearts being hardened, his labour was in vain.</p>
          <p>As he went towards his place of martyrdom, followed by <lb/>
            innumerable multitudes, he met at the gate of the city of <lb/>
            Rome, Plautilla, a noble matron, to whom he said: " Adieu, <lb/>
            Plautilla, daughter of eternal salvation." He then requested <lb/>
            her to give him the kerchief she wore on her head, to bind <lb/>
            his eyes at the time of his suffering. The lady, in tears, <lb/>
            immediately presented him the kerchief, and commending <lb/>
            herself to his prayers, retired a little out of the crowd, as the <lb/>
            apostle had commanded her. Paul, observing that she was <lb/>
            subjected to insults by the pagans, who reproached her with <lb/>
            believing in a magician and an impostor, spake words of <lb/>
            comfort to her, ordered her to wait for his return in some <lb/>
            unfrequented place, and told her that she would receive, by <lb/>
            means of her kerchief, an unmistakeable token of his death. <lb/>
            He then in few words instructed Long-inns and those of his <lb/>
            companions who believed, how and by whom they could be <lb/>
            baptized after his death. Arriving at the place of execution, <lb/>
            he turned towards the east, lifted up his hands to heaven, <lb/>
            and prayed in Hebrew for a long time with the tears trick­ <lb/>
            ling down his cheeks, and concluded with returning thanks <lb/>
            to God. After this, taking leave of the brethren, he <lb/>
            blessed them, and having bound his eyes with Plautilla's <lb/>
            hood, he knelt down on both knees, and stretched out his <lb/>
            neck. The executioner struck him with all his might, and <lb/>
            cut off his head, which, after it was separated from the body, <lb/>
            pronounced with a clear voice the name of Jesus Christ in <pb n="220"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. III.</note><lb/>
            Hebrew. A stream of milk immediately gushed from the <lb/>
            body upon the soldier's clothes, and blood flowed after­ <lb/>
            wards. The hood, which he had bound over his eyes, <lb/>
            disappeared. Such an intense light burst from heaven at <lb/>
            the moment of his decollation, attended by delicious per­ <lb/>
            fume, that the mortal eyes could not bear the brightness, <lb/>
            and no human tongue could give a description of the fra­ <lb/>
            grance. All who witnessed these wonders were filled with <lb/>
            admiration, and, for a long time, gave praises to the invin­ <lb/>
            cible King of Sabaoth. But Parthenius and Phereta <lb/>
            returned to the city, and when they reached the gate, found <lb/>
            there Plautilla giving glory to the Lord; but they presently <lb/>
            asked her in derision, why she did not cover her head with <lb/>
            the hood she had given to Paul. She, inspired with the <lb/>
            ardour of faith, answered nobly : " 0 vain and wretched <lb/>
            men, who know not how to believe even the things that <lb/>
            you see with your own eyes and touch with your own hands ! <lb/>
            I have indeed the kerchief I gave, now gloriously tinged <lb/>
            with that precious blood." She then told them with tri­ <lb/>
            umph that Paul had come from heaven, attended by an in­ <lb/>
            numerable company of angels clothed in white, and restored <lb/>
            her hood, thanking her for her kindness towards him, and <lb/>
            adding the promise of an eternal reward. Then Plautilla <lb/>
            drew the hood1 from her bosom, and showed it to them <lb/>
            dyed red with blood. On seeing this the men were struck <lb/>
            with terror, and quickened their pace to reach the palace, <lb/>
            and inform Cæsar of what they had seen and heard. Upon <lb/>
            receiving the intelligence, the emperor was greatly aston­ <lb/>
            ished, and, horribly alarmed, began to consult the philoso­ <lb/>
            ophers, his own friends, and the officers of state as to the <lb/>
            meaning of all that had been reported to him.</p>
          <p>About the ninth hour, while they were all wondering at <lb/>
            these events, and inquiring and conversing about them, Paul <note type="footnote"> 1 This article of female attire, which became the object of so much <lb/>
            superstition, is variously called in the legend, as quoted by our author, <lb/>
            pannum, a cloth, napkin, or kerchief, panniculum, and mafora, otherwise <lb/>
            mavora, a covering for the head (<unclear>Ducance</unclear> Glossar.), but never velum or <lb/>
            velamen, a veil, the character assigned to it by modern writers. It appears <lb/>
            to have been either a hood, or a kerchief, which, wrapped round the head, <lb/>
            still forms the graceful head-dress of Italian females of the lower order, <lb/>
            and must also be familiar to many readers as that of the Madonnas of <lb/>

             <note type="margin">A.D. 67.]</note><lb/>
            entered the palace although the doors were closed, and standing <lb/>
            before the emperor, said to him : “ 0 Cresar Nero, behold Paul, <lb/>
            the soldier of the eternal and invincible King, stands before <lb/>
            you ! You will now, perhaps, believe that I am not dead, <lb/>
            but live by the power of my God. As for you, wretched man, <lb/>
            unutterable woes await you shortly, the bitterest punish­ <lb/>
            ment and eternal death ; because, among your other crimes, <lb/>
            you have shed like water the blood of the faithful.” Having <lb/>
            said these words, he suddenly disappeared; while Nero, on <lb/>
            hearing them, was struck with unspeakable horror; and <lb/>
            having almost lost his senses, was at a loss how to act. At <lb/>
            last, by the advice of his friends, he ordered Patroclus and <lb/>
            Barnabas to be set at liberty, with all those who bad been <lb/>
            thrown into chains with them. Longinus, also, and his <lb/>
            companions came to Paul's sepulchre early in the morning, <lb/>
            as he had appointed, and there saw two men praying, <lb/>
            and Paul standing between them. Terrified at this wonder­ <lb/>
            ful sight, they dared not approach nearer; but then Titus <lb/>
            and Luke, awaking from the trance into which they had <lb/>
            fallen in the fervour of their prayer, saw the prefects <lb/>
            and the centurion, who had been the instruments of Faults <lb/>
            death, hastening towards them, with natural alarm they im­ <lb/>
            mediately took to flight. But the officers, calling to them in <lb/>
            gentle accents, they immediately stopped, and having heard <lb/>
            their profession of faith, baptized them with religious joy.</p>
          <p>At this time, the first thunder-cloud of a terrible perse­ <lb/>
            cution burst over the Christians, who furnished admirable <lb/>
            examples of resolution and constancy for those that fol­ <lb/>
            lowed. In Tuscany, Torpes, one of the great officers of <lb/>
            Nero, was beheaded, after suffering various tortures ; at <lb/>
            Rome, Processus, Martinian, and forty-six of their com­ <lb/>
            panions were baptized by the blessed apostle Peter. Lon­ <lb/>
            ginus and two others were converted by Paul, and received <lb/>
            the washing of salvation at the hands of Titus and Luke. <lb/>
            All these, followed their spiritual teachers step by step, for <lb/>
            their faith and martyrdom. At Milan, Nazarius, Gervasius, <lb/>
            Protasius, and Celsus, a boy, suffered for Christ.1 Thus <lb/>
            Nero added war against God to his innumerable crimes, and <note type="footnote"> 1 It hardly need be remarked that we possess no authentic accounts of <lb/>
            any of these persons, whose acts in the martyrologies are completely <lb/>

            incurred the hatred of the army and Roman people, who <lb/>
            decreed that he should be publicly scourged to death. On <lb/>
            hearing this sentence, he trembled with fear, and, struck with <lb/>
            intolerable alarm, the wretched prince absconded, and was <lb/>
            never seen again. Some relate that, while wandering about <lb/>
            after his flight, his limbs became stiff from hunger and cold, <lb/>
            and he was devoured by wolves.1</p>
          <p>Such are the notices respecting the two most eminent <lb/>
            senators of the church, which I have collected faithfully, <lb/>
            extracting from the accounts of their remarkable acts, <lb/>
            contained in a great number of volumes, a short abridgment <lb/>
            for the information of posterity.</p>
          <p>Peter preached for seven years to the circumcision, and <lb/>
            held the see of Antioch for another seven years. He went <lb/>
            to Rome in the time of Claudius Cæsar, to oppose Simon <lb/>
            Magus, and there preached the gospel for twenty-five years, <lb/>
            being the first bishop of Rome. He was crucified in the <lb/>
            thirty-sixth year after Christ's passion, on the third of the <lb/>
            calends of July [June 29], and his body was interred by the <lb/>
            Aurelian Way, near the palace of Nero on the Vatican.2 <lb/>
            On the same day, Paul, after nobly suffering innumerable <lb/>
            pains and labours, was beheaded at the second milestone <lb/>
            on the road to Ostia, in the gardens situated ad aquas Sal­ <lb/>
            vias, [at the Salvian waters.3] Both the apostles suffered at <lb/>
            Rome during the reign of the emperor Nero, when Bassus <lb/>

          <p>ANDREW, the brother of Simon Peter, according to <lb/>
            the Hebrew etymology, signifies handsome or responding; <lb/>
            but in Greek is derived <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ του̃ ἀνδὸς</foreign>, that is, a viro, <lb/>
            and means virile. To this apostle Scythia and Achaia were <lb/>
            allotted, for the field of his ministerial labours; in which <lb/>
            last, in the town of Patras, he died suspended on a cross, <lb/>
            upon the second of the calends of December [November <lb/>
            30]. We possess a short but excellent work, containing <lb/>
            particulars of many wonderful acts of St. Andrew. Al­ <lb/>
            though the name of the author is unknown to me, yet some <lb/>
            account of these will, I think, be very acceptable to the <lb/>
            reader. I propose, therefore, to make brief extracts from <lb/>
            the narrative, to the glory of the Almighty Messiah, and <lb/>
            insert them in my own work.</p>
          <p>When Matthew, apostle and evangelist, published the <lb/>
            word of salvation to the Myrmidons, lie was seized by some <lb/>
            cruel men who put out his eyes, and threw him into prison <lb/>
            and chains. Meanwhile, the apostle Andrew, by command <lb/>
            of the angel of God, went down to the sea-shore; and <lb/>
            having found a ship, immediately embarked, and the winds <lb/>
            being favourable, made a quick passage to the town where <lb/>
            St. Matthew was confined in a loathsome prison. Here, <lb/>
            seeing his fellow apostle and the other prisoners, in great <note type="footnote"> founding a church at Rome, Peter undertook a journey there as early as <lb/>
            the year 42, from which he had to return to Jerusalem in 44. It is <lb/>
            equally difficult to admit that St. Peter and St. Paul suffered martyrdom <lb/>
            at Rome the same day, the one on the Vatican, the other on the road to <lb/>
            Ostia, two miles from the city. We learn from Prudentius that in the <lb/>
            fourth century it was supposed, and this is a more probable story, that the <lb/>

            affliction, he wept bitterly; but when they had prayed <lb/>
            together, the whole place suddenly shook under them, and a <lb/>
            light shone in the prison. The eyes of the blessed evan­ <lb/>
            gelist were also restored to him, and their fetters being <lb/>
            unloosed, Matthew and the rest of the prisoners were set <lb/>
            free, and quitted the dungeon. While, however, Andrew <lb/>
            was preaching the word of God to the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            country, they seized him, tied his legs together, and dragged <lb/>
            him through the street of the town, so that his hair was <lb/>
            torn out by the roots, and blood flowed from his head. <lb/>
            At last, the prayers of the apostle being heard, great fear <lb/>
            fell on the inhabitants of Myrmidonia,1 who presently set him <lb/>
            at liberty. Then prostrating themselves at his feet, they <lb/>
            eagerly listened to his preaching, and, divinely influenced, <lb/>
            believed in the Lord and were baptized. After this, Andrew <lb/>
            departed, and, returning to his own country, there touched <lb/>
            the eyes of a blind man who immediately recovered his <lb/>
            sight.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, the governor of the city of Amasia, having <lb/>
            heard of the miracles which Andrew performed in the name <lb/>
            of Christ, came in tears to throw himself at the feet of the <lb/>
            apostle, beseeching him to restore to life a young Egyptian <lb/>
            who had died of fever. The kind apostle consoled him in <lb/>
            his affliction, repaired with him to the house of mourning, <lb/>
            and after he had prayed, the child arose in perfect health. <lb/>
            All who saw this miracle rejoiced, believed, and were bap­ <lb/>
            tized.</p>
          <p>Sostratus, a Christian youth, having been tempted by his <lb/>
            mother to commit incest, ran off to the apostle; but the <lb/>
            woman, full of spite, accused her son of the crime before the <lb/>
            proconsul. The young man remained silent through modesty, <lb/>
            but St. Andrew defended him, and publicly rebuked the lewd <lb/>
            woman for her iniquity. The proconsul, in anger, ordered <lb/>
            the young man to be tied up in the leathern sack used for <lb/>
            parricides, and to be thrown into the river, and Andrew to <note type="footnote"> 1 The preaching of St. Matthew among the Myrmidons is a fact com­ <lb/>

            be taken to prison. But while he was praying, a violent <lb/>
            earthquake, attended with frightful claps of thunder, threw <lb/>
            the proconsul from his seat, and the rest all fell on the <lb/>
            ground. The mother of the lad was struck by lightning, <lb/>
            and burnt to death. Then the proconsul threw himself <lb/>
            at the feet of the apostle, saying: " Have compassion on <lb/>
            us, thou servant of God, for we are perishing, and the earth <lb/>
            will swallow us up." By the prayers of Andrew, the earth­ <lb/>
            quake ceased; the air became serene, and, going round, he <lb/>
            restored all those who were agitated with fear. The pro­ <lb/>
            consul received the word of God, and, believing in the Lord <lb/>
            with his whole family, was baptized by the apostle.</p>
          <p>Gratinus of Sinope,1 having an attack of fever, fell <lb/>
            seriously ill, and at the same time his wife became swollen <lb/>
            with the dropsy. His son also, while washing in the <lb/>
            women's bath, was grievously tormented by a demon, which <lb/>
            deprived him of his reason. At the request of the proconsul, <lb/>
            Andrew ascended a chariot and came into the town, and as <lb/>
            soon as he entered the house of Gratinus, drove out the <lb/>
            demon, and cleansed and healed the young man. He <lb/>
            rebuked a man and his wife who were foul with adultery, <lb/>
            and cured them, after having received a promise that they <lb/>
            would amend their lives; afterwards, when both were re­ <lb/>
            covered, they received the faith of Jesus Christ, and were <lb/>
            baptized with great joy, and their whole house.</p>
          <p>At Nice, seven demons lurked among the tombs by the <lb/>
            wayside, and stoned those who passed by at mid-day, having <lb/>
            already killed a great number. At last, hearing that the <lb/>
            apostle was approaching the gates, the whole city was in a <lb/>
            tumult of joy, and the inhabitants, going out to meet him <lb/>
            with branches of palm-trees, exclaimed: " Thou man of God, <lb/>
            our salvation depends on you." They then explained to <lb/>
            him the state of affairs, and heard in return from the <lb/>
            apostle's lips all the rules of faith and religion. They were <lb/>
            immediately filled with joy, believed in the Lord, and con­ <lb/>
            fessed that Jesus Christ was the Son of God. Andrew then <lb/>
            returned thanks to God for their instant conversion; and, <lb/>
            commanding the demons to appear before the people in the <lb/>
            shape of dogs, banished them to arid and barren wastes, <note type="footnote"> 1 There is no more a town of this name in Achaia than one of that of <lb/>

            where they could hurt no one. Thus armed with the power <lb/>
            of God. he delivered the city of Nice, baptized the citizens <lb/>
            who believed, and appointed Celestine,1 a good and wise <lb/>
            man, to be their bishop.</p>
          <p>At the gate of Nicomedia Andrew met a young man lying <lb/>
            dead on a pallet, whose aged parents were following to the <lb/>
            grave the corpse of their son, weeping bitterly. Grieved at <lb/>
            seeing their -tears, he inquired what was the cause of the <lb/>
            youth's death. But they were afraid and returned no <lb/>
            answer; their servants answered his question, saying: <lb/>
            “ While he was alone in his room, seven dogs suddenly <lb/>
            appeared and leaping upon him, miserably tore him, so that <lb/>
            he fell down dead." Then Andrew knew that this was the <lb/>
            work of the seven demons he had driven out of Nice, and <lb/>
            sighing towards heaven he begged of God the life of the <lb/>
            deceased. Having concluded his prayer, he turned himself <lb/>
            towards the bier, and said: " In the name of Jesus Christ, <lb/>
            rise up." To the great astonishment of the people, the <lb/>
            young man arose, and attached himself to him to whom <lb/>
            he owed his restoration to life. The apostle took the young <lb/>
            convert with him as far as Macedonia, and instructed him <lb/>
            in the words of salvation.</p>
          <p>Having quitted the town, he went on board a ship, and <lb/>
            entered the strait called Hellespont, intending to sail to <lb/>
            Byzantium, when suddenly the sea became rough, and a <lb/>
            violent gale sprung up which nearly sank the ship, so that <lb/>
            the sailors expected to perish every moment. At length <lb/>
            the blessed Andrew prayed to the Lord, at whose command <lb/>
            the wind was still and the sea tranquil, so that a favourable <lb/>
            voyage soon brought them, delivered from their peril, to <lb/>
            Byzantium.</p>
          <p>As they approached the shores of Thrace, a great <lb/>
            multitude of men appeared with drawn swords, and brandish­ <lb/>
            ing lances in their hands, ready to fall upon those who <lb/>
            came within their reach. But the blessed Andrew made the <lb/>
            sign of the cross towards them, and prayed to God for the <lb/>
            preservation of his followers. Then the angel of the Lord, <lb/>
            passing through the band with great radiance, touched their <note type="footnote"> 1 In the Pseudo Abdias this person is called Calixtus. We are now <lb/>
            fairly landed in Asia, as those words are inserted after Nice in the original <lb/>

            swords and, falling on the ground, they allowed the man of <lb/>
            God and those who accompanied him to go through unhurt. <lb/>
            The apostle Andrew arrived at Perinthus, a maritime city of <lb/>
            Thrace, where he found a vessel which was to sail with all <lb/>
            speed for Macedonia. The angel of God commanding him <lb/>
            to embark in it, when on board he preached the word of <lb/>
            God, and the pilot and all the sailors believed in the <lb/>
            Lord.</p>
          <p>There was at Thessalonica a young nobleman extremely <lb/>
            rich named Exous. He went to the apostle without his <lb/>
            family knowing it, and having heard him preach the word of <lb/>
            God believed in the Lord, and, leaving his parents and <lb/>
            property, attached himself to him. His relations searching <lb/>
            for him, found him at Philippi, and used their utmost <lb/>
            endeavours to detach him from the apostle by employing <lb/>
            presents and threats, but were not able to do so. Andrew <lb/>
            whom they treated with contempt, preached to them the <lb/>
            word of salvation, and, having got together a numerous <lb/>
            band, they threw fire upon the house, and being furnished <lb/>
            with bundles of rushes and sedges and with torches, <lb/>
            they began to succeed in their efforts to reduce it to ashes. <lb/>
            Then the young man, having called upon the name of Christ, <lb/>
            poured upon the flames a bottle of water, and the divine <lb/>
            power extinguished the fire in an instant, as if it had not <lb/>
            been lighted. Enraged at the failure of their attempts, <lb/>
            they brought ladders to scale the walls, and put to the sword <lb/>
            all who were in the house; but they were struck blind by <lb/>
            the power of God, so that they were unable to see how to <lb/>
            ascend the ladders. Then Lysimachus, one of the citizens, <lb/>
            acknowledged the hand of God, and strongly rebuked his <lb/>
            neighbours for their folly, saying: " Why, 0 simple mortals, <lb/>
            do you consume your strength in fruitless attempts ? God <lb/>
            himself fights for these men, and you do not perceive it! <lb/>
            Cease this folly, lest the anger of Heaven should destroy <lb/>
            you." At these words they were pricked to the heart, and <lb/>
            while the darkness of night was thickening around them, <lb/>
            they were illuminated by light from heaven. Going up <lb/>
            they found the apostle praying; and, prostrating themselves <lb/>
            on the floor, entreated his forgiveness, which they received. <lb/>
            He then kindly raised them up, and, being strengthened in <lb/>
            the faith, they praised the Lord. However the parents <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. IV.</note><lb/>
            of the young man were not among the number of those <lb/>
            who believed; and cursing their child, they returned to their <lb/>
            own country, where, at the end of fifty days, they both <lb/>
            expired in the same hour. Then the young man received <lb/>
            his whole patrimony from his fellow-citizens, by whom he <lb/>
            was much beloved, and attaching himself to the apostle, he <lb/>
            distributed amongst the poor the revenue of his estates.</p>
          <p>Some time after they both departed together for <lb/>
            Tbessalonica, where the citizens thronged about them in the <lb/>
            theatre with great rejoicings. While Exous was preaching <lb/>
            to them the word of God, the blessed Andrew, admiring his <lb/>
            wisdom, listened in silence. After this, at the request of the <lb/>
            multitude, he ordered them to bring to him Adimathus, the <lb/>
            sick son of Carpianus. This young man, having received <lb/>
            from his father an assurance that he would be healed, be­ <lb/>
            lieved his words, and putting on his clothes, rose from the <lb/>
            bed on which he had lain twenty-three years, and, run­ <lb/>
            ning swiftly, so that he left his parents behind him, <lb/>
            repaired to the theatre, fell down at the apostle's feet, and, <lb/>
            to the amazement of the people, returned thanks for the <lb/>
            recovery of his health. A certain Thessalonian, having <lb/>
            implored the apostle to heal his son who was possessed with <lb/>
            a devil, Satan, the master of a thousand artifices,1 suffocated <lb/>
            him in a secret chamber. The father, having found his <lb/>
            son dead, and being in great affliction at his bereavement, <lb/>
            yet strong in faith, did not give up all hope, but had the <lb/>
            corpse carried to the theatre by his friends, and told his <lb/>
            case to the apostle. The latter, turning to the people, ex­ <lb/>
            claimed : " 0 men of Thessalonica, what can it profit you <lb/>
            to witness the performance of miracles, if you do not <lb/>
            believe However, as they promised to believe if they <lb/>
            saw the miracle, the apostle Andrew said to the dead man: <lb/>
            “ In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up, young man !”And <lb/>
            he immediately arose, and the people astonished, faithfully <lb/>
            kept the promise they bad made to receive the faith.</p>
          <p>Medias of Philippi, begged St. Andrew with tears, to have <lb/>
            compassion upon his son, who was very ill; and the bene­ <lb/>
            volent apostle kindly listened to his request, and, taking him <note type="footnote"> 1 Mille Artifex; one of the names which it was pretended the devil <lb/>
            sometimes gave himself as will be seen hereafter in the legend of St. <lb/>
            Marcellus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            by the hand, went with him to Philippi. As they were <lb/>
            entering the gate of the city, an old roan came up to them, <lb/>
            and implored his interference in favour of his sons, who <lb/>
            were thrown into prison by Medias for some offence they <lb/>
            had committed. The apostle exhorting him to be merciful, <lb/>
            Medias threw himself at his feet, and, in the hope of obtain­ <lb/>
            ing the recovery of his son, pardoned not only the two sons <lb/>
            of the old man, but also seven other prisoners for whom no <lb/>
            one had said a word. When they were set at liberty, the <lb/>
            apostle healed Philomede, who had been twenty-two years <lb/>
            infirm.</p>
          <p>The people then calling upon the apostle to cure their <lb/>
            sick also, Andrew, trusting in the Lord, said to the young <lb/>
            man whom he had just healed: " Visit all the sick at their <lb/>
            own homes, and command them to rise up in the name of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, who has restored you to health." He imme­ <lb/>
            diately obeyed the apostle's word, and the people believed <lb/>
            when they saw the miracles, and offered many presents to <lb/>
            the man of God; but as he preached the word of life to all <lb/>
            without reward, he refused to accept of anything, but in­ <lb/>
            vited all men to come and receive the faith. He also healed <lb/>
            gratuitously the daughter of Nicholas, who was in a <lb/>
            languishing state; although her father offered him a very <lb/>
            valuable present, that is to say, a gilded chariot with four <lb/>
            white mules, and the same number of horses.</p>
          <p>The fame of the apostle's miracles on the sick spreading <lb/>
            throughout Macedonia, Quirinus, the proconsul, was in­ <lb/>
            censed against him, and he sent soldiers to Thessalonica to <lb/>
            lay hands upon Andrew; but when they saw the brightness <lb/>
            of his countenance, they dared not touch him. The people <lb/>
            of the place who believed in God receiving information that <lb/>
            a band of soldiers was coming there to do harm to the <lb/>
            apostle, they became so exasperated that they were ready to <lb/>
            fall on them with swords and staves; and although the <lb/>
            apostle forbade, they could scarcely refrain from murdering <lb/>
            them. Again the proconsul sent a band of soldiers, who, <lb/>
            when they saw the apostle, became so agitated that they <lb/>
            were not able to utter a single word. The third time, the <lb/>
            proconsul despatched a large body of troops, one of whom <lb/>
            was possessed with a devil, and made use of the most violent <lb/>
            language against the proconsul in his absence. The demon <pb n="230"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. IV.</note><lb/>
            afterwards came out of the soldier, who fell down on the <lb/>
            ground and expired. At last, the proconsul came himself <lb/>
            transported with fury, but, although he stood near the <lb/>
            apostle Andrew, was not able to see him until he heard him <lb/>
            speak. This wretched man, seeing the holy servant of God, <lb/>
            loaded him with abuse and threats. But the benign saint <lb/>
            endeavoured to calm the fury of the judge with gentle <lb/>
            words; and, pouring forth prayers to the Lord, restored <lb/>
            the dead soldier to life. The proconsul, however, still per­ <lb/>
            sisted in his insane fury, and the next morning ordered that <lb/>
            wild beasts should be let into the arena, and the blessed <lb/>
            apostle led to the spot, and thrown to the wild beasts. <lb/>
            The savage guards then dragged Andrew by the hair towards <lb/>
            the arena, threw him in, and let loose upon him a ferocious <lb/>
            and horrible boar. The animal walked three times round <lb/>
            the holy man of God, but did him no harm. By order of <lb/>
            the proconsul, another boar1 was brought by thirty soldiers, <lb/>
            and driven into the place by two hunters; but it would not <lb/>
            touch Andrew, while it tore the huntsmen in pieces. At <lb/>
            last, giving a horrible grunt, it fell down and expired. <lb/>
            While the people, for this deliverance, were celebrating the <lb/>
            praises of the Lord, an angel was seen to descend from <lb/>
            heaven to comfort the holy man of God, who was still in the <lb/>
            stadium. At last the cruel proconsul, boiling with rage, <lb/>
            commanded that a most ferocious leopard should be let <lb/>
            loose; but as soon as it was at liberty, disregarding the <lb/>
            apostle, the animal ascended the steps to the proconsul's <lb/>
            seat, and, leaping on his son, instantly strangled him. <lb/>
            Utter madness must have possessed the proconsul, for <lb/>
            he was not at all grieved at what had happened, nor did he <lb/>
            speak a word. Then the blessed man comforted the people <lb/>
            with the love of God, and, to strengthen their faith, <lb/>
            promised to restore to life the proconsul's dead son. <lb/>
            Prostrating himself upon the ground, he prayed for a con­ <lb/>
            siderable time, and then, taking the hand of the deceased in <lb/>
            his own, raised him up in the name of the Lord. The people <lb/>
            witnessing this miracle magnified God, and would have killed <lb/>
            the proconsul Quirinus, who in his unbelief had dared resist <lb/>
            God's saint; but the apostle would not permit them. The <lb/>
            proconsul retired to the pretorium in confusion. <note type="footnote"> 1 According to the supposititious Abdias it was a bull. </note> <pb n="231"/>
             </p>
          <p>Moved by the entreaties of a certain woman, the blessed <lb/>
            Andrew followed her to a farm where there was a serpent <lb/>
            fifty cubits long which devastated the whole country. At <lb/>
            the approach of the apostle, the serpent made a loud hissing, <lb/>
            and, erecting its crest, glided towards the persons present to <lb/>
            their great consternation. Then the holy man of God said <lb/>
            to it: "Hide thy head, cruel monster! thou hast raised it <lb/>
            since the creation of the world for the destruction of the <lb/>
            human race. Submit thyself to the servants of God, and <lb/>
            die." The serpent immediately uttered a tremendous groan, <lb/>
            and, coiling round the trunk of a large oak-tree that was <lb/>
            near, vomited a stream of poison and blood, and expired. <lb/>
            The apostle afterwards went to the farm-house belonging to <lb/>
            the woman, where he found her little child lying dead, having <lb/>
            been struck by the serpent. He then sent the parents to <lb/>
            see that the reptile which had killed the . infant was itself <lb/>
            dead. After they had left the place, the apostle said to the <lb/>
            proconsul's wife: " Go, and restore the child to life." She, <lb/>
            nothing doubting, approached the corpse, and said: " In the <lb/>
            name of my God, Jesus Christ, rise up whole;" and the <lb/>
            child instantly arose, to the great joy of all present, who <lb/>
            returned thanks to God.</p>
          <p>On the following night, the blessed Andrew saw Peter and <lb/>
            John in a vision, when it was revealed to him that in a short <lb/>
            time he would be hung on a cross, and thus be a partaker <lb/>
            of the same suffering as the Lord Jesus at his crucifixion. <lb/>
            Whereupon he called together the brethren, and related <lb/>
            the vision to them, explaining its meaning, and endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to console them in the affliction which the announcement <lb/>
            of his sudden departure from this world had caused them. <lb/>
            During five days he instructed them in saving truths, and <lb/>
            having, by devout prayers, commended the flock of his <lb/>
            church to God, he departed for Thessalonica.</p>
          <p>The proconsul, Lisbius, endeavouring to resist the designs <lb/>
            of God, sent soldiers on several occasions to take Andrew, <lb/>
            but his abominable attempts were foiled; and, on the arrival <lb/>
            of the apostle, Lisbius was cruelly scourged by two demons. <lb/>
            Upon this he sent for the man of God, and confessed his <lb/>
            iniquity to him in the presence of all the people. He then <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author has forgotten to add that from Thessalonica St. Andrew <lb/>
            repaired to Patras, where the events that follow took place. </note> <pb n="232"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. IV.</note><lb/>
            willingly heard the word of God from the apostle's lips, and <lb/>
            being healed of his wounds, believed in God, in whose laws <lb/>
            he thenceforth diligently walked.</p>
          <p>Calista, the proconsul's wife was extremely jealous of <lb/>
            Trophima, who formerly bad been his concubine, but who, <lb/>
            being now united to another man, adhered to the apostolic <lb/>
            doctrine. She therefore, unknown to Lisbius, sent for her <lb/>
            steward, and ordered him to condemn the woman as a <lb/>
            prostitute, and to send her to the stews. Trophima being <lb/>
            therefore conducted there, and given up to the bawd, made <lb/>
            incessant prayers to God. When the lewd presented them­ <lb/>
            selves, she held out the gospel which she carried in her <lb/>
            bosom, and suddenly their libidinous desires were ex­ <lb/>
            tinguished. One day a gay young man of very licentious <lb/>
            habits drew near her, and would have violated her, but she <lb/>
            resisted him, and, during the struggle, the gospel fell to the <lb/>
            ground. Then Tropbima, in the extremity of her distress, <lb/>
            lifted up her hands to heaven, and, bursting into tears, said: <lb/>
            " Do thou, Lord, save me from pollution, for whose name I am <lb/>
            devoted to chastity." The angel of the Lord immediately <lb/>
            appeared to her, and the debauched youth fell down at her <lb/>
            feet, and expired; she, however, comforted by divine grace, <lb/>
            blessed God, and raised the young man to life in the name <lb/>
            of Christ, and the whole city ran to witness the spectacle.</p>
          <p>Calista repaired to the bath with her steward, and while <lb/>
            they were in the water together, a horrible demon appeared <lb/>
            before them, and struck them both dead. This sudden <lb/>
            catastrophe was followed by great lamentations, and was <lb/>
            announced to the apostle and the proconsul. Calista's <lb/>
            nurse, who, on account of her great age, was obliged to <lb/>
            be carried, implored the apostle to restore her mistress to <lb/>
            life. Although the husband was justly irritated when he <lb/>
            heard of the foul offence she bad committed, the gentle <lb/>
            apostle ordered the corpse to be laid where it could be <lb/>
            generally seen, and, approaching the body, and having <lb/>
            prayed, touched the head of the woman, saying: " Arise, in <lb/>
            the name of Jesus Christ, my God." The woman im­ <lb/>
            mediately rose up, and begged to be reconciled to Trophima. <lb/>
            At the sight of these divine miracles the proconsul Lisbius, <lb/>
            under the guidance of the apostle, made progress in the <lb/>
            faith, and faithfully obeyed his counsels in all things.</p><pb n="233"/>
            
          <p>One day when they were both sitting on the sea-shore, <lb/>
            and many persons were there listening with the greatest <lb/>
            attention to the word of God from the apostle's lips, a dead <lb/>
            body was thrown by the waves at the feet of Andrew, <lb/>
            who soon brought it to life again after he had offered up <lb/>
            a prayer to God. The body was that of a young man <lb/>
            named Philopater, son of Sostratus, a Macedonian citizen. <lb/>
            He bewailed the loss of his companions who were drowned, <lb/>
            and supplicated Andrew to restore them to him; upon <lb/>
            which the apostle addressed his prayers to heaven, and the <lb/>
            waves, obeying his commands, brought to the shores thirty- <lb/>
            nine corpses, which he restored to life, commanding each <lb/>
            of the brethren who were there to lay his band upon a <lb/>
            corpse, and to say to it: “May Jesus Christ, the Son of <lb/>
            the living God, raise you from the dead." In this manner <lb/>
            thirty-nine men came to life again, and glorified the Lord <lb/>
            Almighty.</p>
          <p>After performing many miracles and good works, of which <lb/>
            it would be impossible for me to give a particular account, <lb/>
            the blessed apostle Andrew went to Patras,1 where <lb/>
            Maximilla the wife of the proconsul Egeas,2 who had suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded Lisbius lay seriously ill. Then Effidima,2 who had <lb/>
            been converted by the preaching of Sosias, besought the <lb/>
            apostle to visit Maximilla, lying sick under an attack of <lb/>
            fever. He repaired to the bed-chamber of the sick woman, <lb/>
            preceded by Effidima; and, having prayed, the fever dis­ <lb/>
            appeared, and the woman was cured. The proconsul now <lb/>
            offered to the holy man of God a hundred silver pieces, <lb/>
            which he would not even look at. While the blessed <lb/>
            apostle was at Patras performing a great number of miracles, <lb/>
            and many were led to embrace the faith of Christ by these <lb/>
            displays of corporal succour, Stratocles, the brother of the <lb/>
            proconsul Egeas, arrived from Italy. He bad with him a <lb/>
            slave named Algmana,3 of whom he was extremely fond, and <lb/>
            who, having been attacked by a demon, lay in the court, <lb/>
            foaming at the mouth. This caused much disturbance, and <lb/>
            Stratocles, whose grief was unbounded, at the instance of <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original legend, St. Andrew returns to Patras, after a journey <lb/>

            Maximilla and Effidima, sent for the blessed Andrew, who, <lb/>
            by his prayers, healed the demoniac boy. In consequence <lb/>
            Stratocles believed in the Lord; and, strengthened in the <lb/>
            faith, attached himself to the apostle, in order to hear him <lb/>
            preach the word of God. Egeas had left for Macedonia; <lb/>
            and Maximilla, in the fervour of her spiritual love, sought <lb/>
            continual opportunities of receiving from the apostle the <lb/>
            heavenly doctrine, and piously devoted herself to him. The <lb/>
            proconsul therefore became highly incensed against the <lb/>
            apostle, and indignant, because his wife, after she had re­ <lb/>
            ceived the doctrine of salvation, would no longer share his <lb/>
            bed.</p>
          <p>I shall now endeavour to relate briefly the martyrdom1 of <lb/>
            the most blessed Andrew, inserting carefully in my work <lb/>
            the account which the pious devotion of our holy mother the <lb/>
            church has preserved in her libraries, and faithfully recites. <lb/>
            The priests and deacons of the churches of Achaia were, <lb/>
            doubtless, eye-witnesses of it clearly, and they described it <lb/>
            well for the instruction of all the churches founded in the <lb/>
            four climates of the globe.2</p>
          <p>The proconsul Egeas, on his return from Macedonia, <lb/>
            went to Patras, a city of Achaia, and began to compel the <lb/>
            believers in Christ to offer sacrifices to idols. St. Andrew <lb/>
            went to see him, and reasoned with him to bring him over <lb/>
            to the true faith; but wisdom could not penetrate his per­ <lb/>
            verse mind. Then the liberal steward of divine knowledge, <lb/>
            although his attempts to profit the impious Egeas were not <lb/>
            crowned with success, abundantly supplied the food of his <lb/>
            heavenly doctrine to others who were predestinated to life. <lb/>
            He discoursed with wisdom on the mystery of the cross, <lb/>
            showing plainly why God was made man and suffered for us, <lb/>
            and fully explained the history of our Lord's passion, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ordericus Vitalis always uses the word passion to describe the final <lb/>
            scenes of suffering and death which closed the career of the primitive <lb/>
            martyrs. The theological sense of the word is, perhaps, generally under­ <lb/>
            stood from its application in the formularies of the church to our Lord's <lb/>
            last sufferings, but it has been thought most advisable in these cases to <lb/>
            substitute the word martyrdom. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author often speaks of the four climates," as we do of the four <lb/>
            quarters of the globe, and as the theory of the zones is now antiquated, <lb/>
            the modern phraseology might have been adopted but for its involving an <lb/>
            anachronism in the state of geographical knowledge. </note> <lb/>

            the common advantages which mankind had derived from it. <lb/>
            Irritated at this discourse, Egeas ordered the apostle to be <lb/>
            seized and thrown into prison, where multitudes visited <lb/>
            him from almost every part of the province, intending to kill <lb/>
            the proconsul and liberate the apostle by forcing the prison <lb/>
            doors. But Andrew restrained them by his salutary counsels, <lb/>
            spending the whole night in teaching them, and, recalling to <lb/>
            their memory the patience of the Lord Jesus, earnestly <lb/>
            entreated the people not to offer any obstacle to his <lb/>
            passion.</p>
          <p>The next day the proconsul Egeas sent to have the apostle <lb/>
            brought before him, and, sitting on the tribunal, employed <lb/>
            every means to gain him over; but the saint, whose faith <lb/>
            was built on God, firmly resisted both his threats and his <lb/>
            fair words. Egeas at last ordered him to be stretched out and <lb/>
            lashed with seven scourges of three thongs;1 but, after re­ <lb/>
            ceiving these stripes, the brave champion of Christ set forth <lb/>
            the merits of the cross, and, notwithstanding the fury of the <lb/>
            tyrant, firmly maintained the truth of his averments.</p>
          <p>Then the enraged proconsul, exasperated to the last <lb/>
            degree, ordered the apostle to be attached to the cross, com­ <lb/>
            manding the ministers of torture to bind his feet and hands, <lb/>
            and stretch his limbs as if be was placed on the wooden <lb/>
            horse, that his sufferings might be protracted, because, if he <lb/>
            were fastened with nails, he would die too soon. As the <lb/>
            holy man was led along by the executioners, he was followed <lb/>
            by a great concourse of people who clamoured loudly, say­ <lb/>
            ing: "What has this just man, the friend of God, done, <lb/>
            that you are leading him to be crucified?" But Andrew <lb/>
            walked with composure and cheerfulness, begging the crowd <lb/>
            not to hinder his passion, and continuing to teach his saving <lb/>
            doctrine. When he had arrived at the spot which was to <lb/>
            witness his last struggle, and saw the cross at a distance, he <lb/>
            exclaimed in a loud voice: " Hail, 0 cross, consecrated by <lb/>
            having borne the body of Christ, and adorned by having his <lb/>
            limbs attached to thee as if they were precious jewels! 0, <lb/>
            good cross, that hast received from these thy lustre and <lb/>
            beauty; long desired, dearly loved, sought for unceasingly, <lb/>
            and now, at last, prepared for my longing soul!" Having <note type="footnote"> 1 Septem ternionibus flagellis; the French translator renders the phrase <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. IV.</note><lb/>
            given utterance to this and much more full of love and devo­ <lb/>
            tion, the apostle stripped himself, and gave his clothes to <lb/>
            the executioners, who drew near the cross, on which they <lb/>
            stretched his limbs, and suspended him with cords. In this <lb/>
            cruel manner they executed the orders of the impious pro­ <lb/>
            consul. A crowd of more than twenty thousand men stood <lb/>
            round, exclaiming that the holy man was suffering unjustly; <lb/>
            among whom was Stratocles, the brother of Egeas. St. <lb/>
            Andrew comforted the minds of the faithful, exhorting them <lb/>
            to patience under worldly afflictions, because martyrdom <lb/>
            was the best road to an eternal reward.</p>
          <p>Meantime, the multitude thronged to the palace of Egeas, <lb/>
            shouting with one accord, “ What sentence is this you have <lb/>
            pronounced, proconsul ? You have given an unrighteous <lb/>
            judgment. Grant us the life of this just man; restore to <lb/>
            us this holy man; do not put to death a man who is dear to <lb/>
            God.” Egeas, hearing these and other such cries of the <lb/>
            people, was seized with fear, and promising to take the <lb/>
            apostle down, immediately went with them towards the place <lb/>
            of execution. As soon as St. Andrew saw him, he exhorted <lb/>
            him to believe in Christ, and to have recourse to the faith <lb/>
            for his salvation while it was still in his power. All this <lb/>
            time, suspended from the cross, he serenely triumphed; and, <lb/>
            enjoying the vision of Christ, whom he had loved with all his <lb/>
            soul and long desired to see, in his excessive joy he ex­ <lb/>
            claimed : "I now see my King; I now adore him; I am come <lb/>
            into his presence." Then the executioners, handling the <lb/>
            cross,were unable to touch him; and, though they all made suc­ <lb/>
            cessively repeated efforts to loose him, the arms of those who <lb/>
            attempted to take him down became benumbed. Then St. <lb/>
            Andrew cried with a loud voice, and poured forth a devout <lb/>
            prayer to God. After having prayed for a long time to <lb/>
            Jesus, his good Master, he was suddenly surrounded in the <lb/>
            sight of all the people, by an extraordinary light flashing <lb/>
            like lightning from heaven, too bright for human eyes to <lb/>
            bear. This luminous appearance continued about half an <lb/>
            hour, and, at the moment when it vanished, Andrew, the <lb/>
            illustrious champion of Christ, gave up the ghost, and <lb/>
            went with it to meet the Lord. Maximilla, a woman of <lb/>
            senatorial rank, respectfully removed his body ; and, having <lb/>
            caused it to be embalmed, interred it in a well-chosen spot. <pb n="237"/>

          <p><note type="margin">ABOUT A.D. 70.]</note>But Egeas was seized by a demon as be was returning <lb/>
            to his palace, and died tormented by the evil spirit, on the <lb/>
            public road, in the presence of all the people. As for Strato­ <lb/>
            cles, the brother of Egeas, he would not touch the smallest <lb/>
            portion of his fortune, but withdrew, carrying with him the <lb/>
            body of the holy apostle Andrew. All the inhabitants of the <lb/>

            person remained who did not believe in the Saviour, our <lb/>
            God. It is reported that, from the sepulchre of St. <lb/>

            which indicate to the inhabitants of that country what will <lb/>
            be the fertility of the year. If the produce be small, the <lb/>
            earth gives her fruit sparingly; if, on the contrary, the yield <lb/>

            when hanging on the cross, exhort the cruel Egeas, thy <lb/>

          <p>JAMES and John, the sons of Zebedee, were named by Christ <lb/>
            Boanerges, or, what would read much better, Boane­ <lb/>
            reem,1 that is to say, the sons of thunder ; on account of the <lb/>
            strength and greatness of the faith with which they kept <lb/>
            inviolably, and taught in all its purity, the law of the Lord. <lb/>
            James [Jacobus] signifies he that supplants, but John the <lb/>
            grace of God, or in whom is grace. These elect brethren <lb/>
            well merited such distinguished names, as, by supplanting <lb/>
            of vice, they obtained a brilliant victory over the crooked <lb/>
            serpent on the stage of this frail life, and became the <lb/>
            especial friends of God, and, full of his manifold grace, <lb/>
            enlightened our holy mother the church with the doctrine of <lb/>
            truth. I have inserted in the preceding Book of this work,2 <lb/>
            a plain and short account of the blessed James, carefully <lb/>
            abridged from the writings of ancient authors; relating <lb/>
            how he carried the gospel into Judea and Samaria, and how <lb/>
            he suffered martyrdom by the command of Herod, the son <lb/>
            of Aristobulus, on the accusation of the chief priests and <lb/>
            pharisees. I now enter on the inquiry what has been <lb/>
            written respecting John the diviner the beloved disciple of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ; desiring to make a brief summary of all that <lb/>

            other faithful brethren scattered over the face of the earth, <lb/>
            and what other celebrated antiquarians have published <lb/>
            relating to St. John, especially Jerome, the commentator <lb/>
            on the holy scriptures, in his preface to the Apocalypse.</p>
          <p>John, the apostle and evangelist, was chosen to perpetual <lb/>
            celibacy by the Lord Jesus Christ, who loved him more <lb/>
            than all the other disciples, insomuch that he allowed him <lb/>
            to recline on his bosom at the paschal supper, and after­ <lb/>
            wards committed to him the care of his own mother, when <lb/>
            he was the only disciple standing by the cross; thus <lb/>
            appointing to the guardianship of a virgin, one whom he <lb/>
            had called to perpetual chastity at the time when he thought <lb/>
            of marrying. While John was publicly preaching the word <lb/>
            of God in Asia, and incessantly bearing testimony to Jesus <lb/>
            Christ both to Jews and Gentiles, an accusation against him <lb/>
            was forwarded to Rome by the malicious enemies of the <lb/>
            truth. By order of Domitian, who, after the example of <lb/>
            Nero, raised the second persecution of the Christians, he <lb/>
            was carried off from Ephesus, and brought before Cæsar and <lb/>
            the senate, near the Latin gate. Standing firm in the true <lb/>
            faith, as immovable as a strong and lofty mountain, he was <lb/>
            thrown into a caldron of boiling oil, by Domitian's command, <lb/>
            on the second of the nones [6th] of May; but, protected <lb/>
            by the divine grace, he came out of it unhurt. On that day, <lb/>
            in every year the faithful devoutly celebrate a festival to <lb/>
            his memory. He was then banished to the isle of Patmos, <lb/>
            where he wrote the Apocalypse, in which the condition and <lb/>
            order of the church are described, as foreshown to him, <lb/>
            in seven stages, together with the depths of tribulation <lb/>
            and the rewards of good deeds.</p>
          <p>At length, by the providence of God, who disposes all <lb/>
            things aright, the same year that John was banished, the <lb/>
            Roman senate condemned Domitian to death for his cruel­ <lb/>
            ties 2 and declared also, by a general decree, that all the <lb/>
            orders issued by the emperor should be considered null and <note type="footnote"> 1 These words probably refer to some tradition of an intended marriage <lb/>
            of St. John, which has not reached us. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 St. John's immersion in a cask of boiling oil, and his banishment to <lb/>
            the Isle of Patmos, one of the Sporades, in the Egean Sea, took place <lb/>
            May 6, A.D. 95. Domitian was not assassinated during the course of the <lb/>
            same year, nor for a year afterwards, but in September, 96. </note> <pb n="240"/>

            <lb/>
            void. In consequence of this decree, St. John the apostle, <lb/>
            who, by command of Domitian, had been banished, with <lb/>
            ignominy, returned to Ephesus with honour, amid general <lb/>
            rejoicings. For the whole population of Ephesus went out <lb/>
            to meet him on his return, and both men and women, in the <lb/>
            faithful expression of their joy, exclaimed as if with one voice, <lb/>
            “ Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."</p>
          <p>As John was entering the city, behold they were carrying <lb/>
            to the grave the corpse of Drusiana, who, loving him fer­ <lb/>
            vently,. had desired to see him before her death. The <lb/>
            widows, and the poor, parents and orphans, all wept together, <lb/>
            and exclaimed: “St. John, the apostle of God, you see us <lb/>
            bearing to the grave Drusiana, who, following your holy <lb/>
            counsels, fed us all, served God in chastity and humility, <lb/>
            and, sighing for your return, said daily: ‘ 0 that I could see <lb/>
            with my own eyes the apostle of God before I die !’ ” Then <lb/>
            the blessed John having commanded them to put down the <lb/>
            bier, and to uncover the corpse, said with a loud voice: <lb/>
            " Drusiana, may my Lord Jesus Christ restore thee to life! <lb/>
            Rise up on thy feet, and return to thy house, and there pre­ <lb/>
            pare refreshment for me.” Immediately she arose, and <lb/>
            obeyed the apostle's command with great joy, as well she <lb/>
            might, for it seemed to her that she had been awakened not <lb/>
            from death, but from sleep. And then the people ceased <lb/>
            not shouting, for the space of three hours: " There is but <lb/>
            one God, he whom St. John preaches; there is but one Lord, <lb/>
            Jesus Christ."</p>
          <p>At that time, two brothers, who were extremely rich, sold <lb/>
            their inheritance by the advice of Crato the philosopher, and <lb/>
            bought diamonds of singular value, which they crushed in <lb/>
            the forum before all the people; thus making an osten­ <lb/>
            tatious exhibition of their contempt for the world. St. John <lb/>
            happening to be passing through the forum, witnessed this <lb/>
            display, and pitying the folly of these misguided men, kindly <lb/>
            gave them sounder advice. Sending for Crato their master, <lb/>
            who had led them into error, he blamed the wasteful de­ <lb/>
            struction of valuable property, and instructed him in the <lb/>
            true meaning of contempt for the world according to <lb/>
            Christ's doctrine ; quoting the precept of that teacher, his <lb/>
            own master, when, in reply to the young man who inquired <lb/>
            of him how he might obtain eternal life, he said: “ If thou <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the <lb/>
            poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come <lb/>
            and follow me.” 1 Crato the philosopher, acknowledging the <lb/>
            soundness of the apostle's teaching, entreated him to restore <lb/>
            the jewels which had been foolishly crushed to their former <lb/>
            condition. St. John then gathered up the precious frag­ <lb/>
            ments, and while he held them in his hand, prayed for some <lb/>
            time, with his eyes raised to heaven. His prayer being <lb/>
            concluded, and all the faithful present having said Amen, <lb/>
            the broken pieces of the jewels became so closely united <lb/>
            that there remained not the slightest appearance of any <lb/>
            fracture. Then Crato the philosopher, with all his disciples, <lb/>
            threw himself at the apostle's feet, believed, and were bap­ <lb/>
            tized; and Crato, preaching openly the faith of the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus, became a true philosopher.2 Moreover, the two <lb/>
            brothers, who before destroyed their property to no purpose, <lb/>
            now, in obedience to the evangelical precept, sold their <lb/>
            jewels and distributed the price in alms to the poor of <lb/>
            Christ. And a multitude of believers began to attach <lb/>
            themselves to St. John and to follow his steps.</p>
          <p>Atticus and Eugenius, two brothers,3 and noble Ephesians, <lb/>
            imitated the conduct of the youths already mentioned; <lb/>
            selling all that they had and distributing to the poor, and <lb/>
            becoming followers of the apostle as he went about the <lb/>
            cities preaching the word of God. It happened that as <lb/>
            they were entering Pergamus they beheld their own slaves <lb/>
            parading in garments of silk, and making a display of worldly <lb/>
            vanities. The devil's malice shot the arrow, when the pride <lb/>
            of the two brothers was wounded at seeing their slaves <lb/>
            swaggering and gay, while they were poor and reduced to a <lb/>
            single cloak. The blessed apostle, comprehending the wiles <lb/>
            of Satan, directed that bundles of straight twigs and small <lb/>
            pebbles from the sea-shore should be brought to him. <lb/>
            When this was done, he called on the name of the Lord, <lb/>
            and the twigs were turned into gold. and the pebbles into <lb/>
            precious stones. Then the holy apostle said to the brothers: <note type="footnote"> I Matt. xix. 21. </note><note type="footnote">a Either this Crato, or another of the same name, is subsequently men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Ordericus in book ii. c. 11 of the present history. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 In the original legend the brothers, whose names are here given, are <lb/>

            “ Go, for seven days, among the goldsmiths and jewellers, <lb/>
            and let me know when you have tested your gold and dia­ <lb/>
            monds.’’"The brothers accordingly went round the work­ <lb/>
            men's shops, and returning at the end of the seven days <lb/>
            informed the apostle that the goldsmiths declared the gold <lb/>
            to be pure, and the jewellers pronounced the stones precious. <lb/>
            Then St. John said: " Go, now, and re-purchase the lands <lb/>
            which you sold, for you have lost the heavenly inheritance. <lb/>
            Clothe yourselves in robes of silk, that you may be as gay <lb/>
            as the rose for a season. The flower is delightful both for <lb/>
            its scent and colour, but soon fades. You envied the ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of your slaves, and regretted that you had reduced <lb/>
            yourselves to poverty; flourish then for a while that you <lb/>
            may decay and perish; be rich in this world, that you may <lb/>
            be stripped of all in the next. Is not the band of the Lord <lb/>
            powerful to make his servants abound in wealth and above <lb/>
            measure glorious ? But he has appointed a trial of the <lb/>
            soul, that men may believe that these will obtain eternal <lb/>
            riches, who for his sake have relinquished their worldly ad­ <lb/>
            vantages.”</p>
          <p>While the blessed John was delivering these edifying <lb/>
            precepts and others like them, and descanting nobly on the <lb/>
            misery and contempt of the world, on apostacy, and perse­ <lb/>
            verance in well-doing, it happened that a young man named <lb/>
            Stacteus was followed to his grave by his mother who was a <lb/>
            widow. In her deep affliction the mother, with the crowd <lb/>
            of people attending the funeral, threw themselves at the <lb/>
            apostle's feet, and besought him with many tears, that in <lb/>
            the name of God he would restore this young man to life, <lb/>
            as he had done in the case of Drusiana, and kindly relieve <lb/>
            the distress of his mother and his newly married wife. <lb/>
            Then the apostle knelt down and prayed for some time <lb/>
            weeping, thrice rising from his supplications, lifting his <lb/>
            hands to heaven and praying in secret. Then he directed <lb/>
            the body to be loosed from the grave-clothes, and calling on <lb/>
            the youth by name, commanded him to arise and give a true <lb/>
            account of what he had seen while he was dead. Then <lb/>
            Stacteus arose, and worshipping the apostle began to rebuke <lb/>
            his disciples: "I saw," he said, "your angels weeping, <lb/>
            while Satan's angels were rejoicing at your humiliation. I <lb/>
            saw the kingdom prepared for you, and chambers garnished <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            with bright jewels, full of delights, feasts, riches; endless <lb/>
            life, eternal light, and all the joys which you have lost. I <lb/>
            saw also the chambers of darkness, for which, alas ! you have <lb/>
            made the exchange,-full of dragons and pit-falls, full of <lb/>
            hissing flames and torments, full of corruption and sorrow." <lb/>
            While Stacteus was describing these and similar scenes, the <lb/>
            crowd of people who listened to him were struck with <lb/>
            amazement. But Atticus and Eugenius, with the young <lb/>
            man raised from the dead, threw themselves at the apostle's <lb/>
            feet together, and entreated him to intercede with the Lord <lb/>
            on their behalf. At length, St. John gave this answer to <lb/>
            their entreaties, that they should do penance for thirty days, <lb/>
            during which time their chief prayer to God should be that <lb/>
            the golden twigs should be restored to their primitive state, <lb/>
            and the stones become as worthless as they were at first. <lb/>
            It turned out, however, that the thirty days elapsed without <lb/>
            the gold being changed into twigs, or the jewels into peb­ <lb/>
            bles. The brothers then came to the apostle in great <lb/>
            distress, and besought his clemency with many tears and <lb/>
            prayers. Compassionating their grief and penitence, and <lb/>
            moved by the intercessions of the multitude on their behalf, <lb/>
            the apostle then ordered the twigs to be carried back to <lb/>
            the wood, and the pebbles to the beach, restored to their <lb/>
            own nature. Upon which, the two brothers recovered the <lb/>
            grace they had forfeited, so that, as they had done before, <lb/>
            they cast out devils, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, <lb/>
            and performed many miracles in the name of the Lord.</p>
          <p>While the name of John was in every one's mouth, and <lb/>
            his character reverenced, not only at Ephesus, but through <lb/>
            the whole province of Asia Minor, that city became the <lb/>
            scene of tumults raised by the idol-worshippers. The <lb/>
            heathen, roused to frenzy, dragged John to the temple of <lb/>
            Diana, and used all their efforts to induce him to join in <lb/>
            their impure sacrifices. But he, inspired by the Holy <lb/>
            Spirit, proposed to them that they should accompany him <lb/>
            to the church dedicated to Christ, and, invoking the aid of <lb/>
            Diana, lay it in ruins by her power ; while, if they failed of <lb/>
            success, he would, in the name of the God he served, over­ <lb/>
            throw the temple of Diana and destroy her image. Reason <lb/>
            would convince them that, if he did this, they ought to <lb/>
            abandon their vain superstition, and follow the path of the <note type="footnote">R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. V.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            true and right faith. A proposal of this sort was suited to <lb/>
            the popular impulse, although some few objected to affairs <lb/>
            being put on such an issue. And now John gently ex­ <lb/>
            horted the crowd to stand aloof while he with a devout <lb/>
            mind prayed audibly to Almighty God. Immediately the <lb/>
            temple and all its shrines fell to pieces and were ground to <lb/>
            powder, like dust scattered by the wind from the face of <lb/>
            the earth. The same day twelve thousand heathens, not <lb/>
            counting women and children, were converted and received <lb/>
            baptism in the name of the holy Trinity. Then Aristo­ <lb/>
            demus, who was chief pontiff of all the idol temples, at the <lb/>
            instigation of the evil spirit, stirred up the commonalty to <lb/>
            a new insurrection, in which citizen was ready to fight <lb/>
            against citizen. Upon which John, whose loving mind was <lb/>
            bent on preserving peace, addressed himself to Aristodemus, <lb/>
            saying: " Tell me, 0 Aristodemus, what I can do to abate <lb/>
            your indignation." The pontiff replied: " If you desire <lb/>
            that I should believe in your God, drink the poison which I <lb/>
            will give you, and should you escape death it will be manifest <lb/>
            that yours is, indeed, the true God." The apostle assent­ <lb/>
            ing to this proposal, Aristodemus, to strike terror into him, <lb/>
            went to the proconsul and begged of him two culprits who <lb/>
            lay under sentence of decapitation for their crimes. Having <lb/>
            obtained his consent, they were brought into the forum, <lb/>
            and there, having drunk poison in the presence of the <lb/>
            apostle and all the people, forthwith expired. Then <lb/>
            the blessed John, standing over their dead bodies, fear­ <lb/>
            lessly took into his hands the poisoned cup, and making <lb/>
            the sign of the cross over it, with devout prayers, be re­ <lb/>
            counted to all who were within hearing the marvellous <lb/>
            works of God. Having ended his discourse, he armed him­ <lb/>
            self with the sign of the cross, and, draining the cup to the <lb/>
            dregs, remained uninjured, offering thanksgiving to God. <lb/>
            Upon which the spectators shouted: " There is one only <lb/>
            true God, and John is his prophet."</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Aristodemus, after narrowly watching the <lb/>
            apostle for the space of three hours, and perceiving that he <lb/>
            neither looked pale nor exhibited any signs of fear, was so <lb/>
            far from yielding to the truth that he hardened his heart <lb/>
            against it, though the by-standers complained loudly of his <lb/>
            withholding his belief. At last, he required that the <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            prisoners who had died by the poison should be restored to <lb/>
            life, upon which all doubt would be removed from his <lb/>
            mind. The crowd, however, were incensed with rage, and <lb/>
            threatened that they would set fire to his house and throw <lb/>
            him into the flames if he ventured further to persecute <lb/>
            the Lord's apostle. Whereupon, John, perceiving that a <lb/>
            desperate conflict was impending between the faithful and <lb/>
            the unbelievers, interposed and thus addressed the sur­ <lb/>
            rounding throng: " Patience is an exemplary virtue, one of <lb/>
            the divine graces which it is our duty to imitate. If then <lb/>
            Aristodemus. is still held in the bonds of unbelief, let it be <lb/>
            ours to set him free; and I will never desist from my <lb/>
            undertaking until I have found a remedy for his disordered <lb/>
            mind, like a skilful physician who perseveringly adapts his <lb/>
            cure to the various forms of his patient's disease. In the <lb/>
            case of this distempered man, if what has been done already <lb/>
            fails of restoring him to a sound mind, we must do some­ <lb/>
            thing which hitherto has not been tried." He then called <lb/>
            Aristodemus to him and invested him with his own tunic, <lb/>
            while he himself stood covered with his mantle, and gave <lb/>
            these directions to the pontiff: " Go, and, stretching yourself <lb/>
            upon the corpses of the deceased malefactors, say: “John, <lb/>
            the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, bath sent me unto <lb/>
            you, that in his name you may be restored to life, and that <lb/>
            all may know that life and death obey Jesus Christ, my <lb/>
            Lord and master.” Aristodemus obeyed the apostle's com­ <lb/>
            mand, and, struck with astonishment at the restoration of <lb/>
            the dead men, worshipped John, and, hastening to the <lb/>
            proconsul, eagerly related to him all that had occurred, and <lb/>
            then with a wise determination, he said to the proconsul: "Let <lb/>
            us go to the apostle, and implore his pardon on bended <lb/>
            knees." This they accordingly did, and John, lovingly <lb/>
            receiving them, offered up on their behalf prayer and thanks­ <lb/>
            giving to God, and enjoined on them a week's fasting. At <lb/>
            the expiration of this, the apostle baptized them, with their <lb/>
            parents, their kindred and their whole households; and they <lb/>
            destroyed their idol images, and dedicated a church to the <lb/>
            honour of St. John, in which he was afterwards buried.</p>
          <p>When, at last, the blessed John was ninety-nine1 years of <lb/>
            age, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him with his disciples <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original legend we read seven. </note> <pb n="246"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. V.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            saying: " Come unto me, for it is time that thou shouldest <lb/>
            sit down to feast, with thy brethren, in my kingdom," <lb/>
            Then John, arising, prepared to depart; but the Lord said <lb/>
            to him: " On the Sunday, which is the anniversary of my <lb/>
            resurrection, three days hence, thou shalt come unto me :" <lb/>
            and having thus spoken ascended to heaven. On the Lord's <lb/>
            day following, therefore, the whole multitude of the faithful <lb/>
            assembled with John in the church erected in his name, <lb/>
            where he celebrated the divine mysteries from cock-crowing <lb/>
            to the third hour, when he addressed the congregation, <lb/>
            saying: "Brethren and fellow servants, co-heirs and par­ <lb/>
            takers of the kingdom of God, ye know what gifts and <lb/>
            graces, and signs and miracles, together with doctrine, our <lb/>
            Lord Jesus Christ hath vouchsafed to you through my <lb/>
            ministry. Henceforth continue without csasing to walk in <lb/>
            his commandments, for the Lord is pleased now to call me <lb/>
            out of this world."</p>
          <p>Thereupon he caused a grave to be dug near the stately1 <lb/>
            altar, and the earth thrown up to be carried out of the <lb/>
            church. He then descended into the grave, and, lifting up <lb/>
            his hands to the Lord, said: " 0 Lord Jesu Christ, at thy <lb/>
            summons I come, with thanksgiving, to the heavenly ban­ <lb/>
            quet to which thou hast graciously vouchsafed to invite me, <lb/>
            knowing that I have desired thee with my whole heart. <lb/>
            Beholding thy face, I am restored to life even from the <lb/>
            tomb. The odour of thy presence sheds in my heart desires <lb/>
            of everlasting life. Thy voice is sweeter than honey, and <lb/>
            thy words far beyond angelic eloquence. I have committed <lb/>
            to writing thy works which my own eyes have seen, and thy <lb/>
            words which I heard with my own ears. And now, Lord, I <lb/>
            commend to thee thy children which their virgin mother the <lb/>
            church bath regenerated in thy name by water and the <lb/>
            Holy Ghost. Receive me now, that I may join the com­ <lb/>
            pany of my brethren, with whom thou appearedst to call me <lb/>
            o thy presence. Open unto me the gate of life and lead <lb/>
            me to the heavenly banquet, in which all thy faithful dis­ <lb/>
            ciples feast with thee. For thou art the Christ, the Son of <lb/>
            the living God, who, according to the will of the Father, <lb/>
            didst become the Saviour of the world. To thee, therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 Quadratum, four-square.-Duchesne. The reading of the French <lb/>

            we give thanks for ever and ever." And when all the <lb/>
            people had answered " Amen !" the apostle was surrounded, <lb/>
            for the space of an hour, with a light so effulgent that no <lb/>
            eye could bear to look on it. It was then discovered that <lb/>
            the grave had been filled up, and contained manna only, <lb/>
            which the place produces to the present day; being distin­ <lb/>
            guished by the multitude of miracles in honour of him who <lb/>
            was in an especial manner our Lord's beloved disciple. <lb/>
            Crowds resort to the spot, pouring out prayers and supple <lb/>
            cations to God, receiving through the merits of St. John, <lb/>
            the apostle and evangelist, answers to their petitions, and <lb/>
            obtaining by his intercession the relief they implore from <lb/>
            their diseases and sufferings. Among whom let me, sinner <lb/>

            pouring forth my heart in prayer, with faith and hope, to <lb/>

            being loved more than others, and, specially taught in the <lb/>
            heavenly mysteries, became his most distinguished apostle <lb/>
            and evangelist, I humbly implore thy aid; beseeching thee, <lb/>

            and, regarding my manifold infirmities of body and troubles <lb/>

            St. Ephrem and others, that St. John did not actually die, or that he was <lb/>
            immediately restated to life. The opinion was founded on a well known <lb/>

            Alpheus, who is named by John the Baptist Mary the wife <lb/>
            of Cleophas, was the aunt of our Lord's mother. Im­ <lb/>
            mediately after the ascension, James was ordained by the <lb/>
            apostles bishop of Jerusalem, which see he filled during <lb/>
            thirty years. He was held in deep reverence by all the <lb/>
            other apostles, both on account of his great sanctity and his <lb/>
            kindred to our Lord; so that, however they were dispersed <lb/>
            in their mission of preaching the gospel through distant <lb/>
            regions, they, from time to time, resorted to him as their <lb/>
            common father, and humbly implored his counsels, as their <lb/>
            master, when occasion required. At length, in the seventh <lb/>
            year of Nero's reign, while James was preaching Christ the <lb/>
            Son of God, at Jerusalem, he was thrown headlong from <lb/>
            that temple by the Jews and stoned to death, and buried <lb/>
            there near the temple on the first of May.1</p>
          <p>Jlegesippus,2 a holy and learned man, who lived near the <lb/>
            apostles' times, mentions James the Just in the fifth book of <lb/>
            his Commentaries; relating that after the death of Festus, <lb/>
            who succeeded Felix as proconsul of Judæa, while the pro­ <lb/>
            vince was without a governor and chief before the appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of Albinus, James, the brother of the Lord, was <lb/>
            cruelly martyred by the Jews. He was sanctified from his <lb/>
            mothers womb; wine or strong drink he never tasted, nor <lb/>
            ate flesh; steel never approached his head, nor were his <lb/>
            limbs anointed with oil, and he never used the bath. He <lb/>
            wore no garments made of wool, but contented himself with <lb/>
            a wrapping of coarse cloth. He spent his time in solitary <lb/>
            prayer for the pardon of his people, until, by continual <lb/>
            kneeling, his knees became callous, like those of a camel. <lb/>
            His marvellous self-denial and rigid virtue obtained for him <lb/>
            the surname of the Just, and of Oblias, which signifies the <lb/>
            defence of the people. <note type="footnote"> 1 St. James the Less had the government of the church at Jerusalem <lb/>
            committed to him by the other apostles, a few months after our Lord's <lb/>

          <p>A person belonging to one of the seven Jewish sects <lb/>
            having asked him what was meant by Jesus being the <lb/>
            door,1 he replied: " It means the Saviour." The Jews, <lb/>
            indeed, are divided among themselves into seven sects, all <lb/>
            of which have departed from the way of truth. Thus the <lb/>
            Pharisees and Sadducees, the Essenes and Galileans, the <lb/>
            Hemero-baptists, the Masbuthæans, and the Samaritans,2 <lb/>
            glory in distinct names, and hold and defend with obstinacy <lb/>
            the various doctrines which they severally adopt. Some of <lb/>
            these, through the ministry of James, were converted to the <lb/>
            faith of Christ. But when many of the principal Jews <lb/>
            believed in Jesus, the scribes and pharisees were in great <lb/>
            consternation, and said: "What remains, but that all the <lb/>
            people should speedily believe that Jesus is the Christ ?" <lb/>
            They then, acting in concert, presented themselves to James, <lb/>
            and courteously besought him to ascend a pinnacle of the <lb/>
            temple at the feast of the passover, and bear a true testi­ <lb/>
            mony concerning Christ to the multitudes of Jews and <lb/>
            Gentiles assembled at the feast, both from the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood and from distant countries. The apostle was <lb/>
            filled with joy at the opportunity thus afforded him ot <lb/>
            declaring the truth, and gave his consent to what they <lb/>
            entreated, though not according to what those wicked men <lb/>
            designed; for the just man knew that this was directed by <lb/>
            divine inspiration, and therefore it was that he acceded to <lb/>
            their request. Standing, accordingly, on a pinnacle of the <lb/>
            temple, he addressed the people with a loud voice, showing <lb/>
            clearly and without doubt that Jesus, the Son of God, had <lb/>
            fulfilled all that the prophets had foretold concerning him.</p>
          <p>The apostle James, having now concluded his faithful dis­ <lb/>
            course, the multitudes shouted with joy, " Hosanna to the Son <lb/>
            of David! " But the pharisees and other enemies of the truth <lb/>
            were greatly troubled, and, taking counsel together, ex­ <lb/>
            claimed, " Oh ! Oh ! The Just one also is deceived." Then <lb/>
            was fulfilled what is written in the book of Wisdom, " We <lb/>
            will take away the just, for he is unprofitable to US."3 The <lb/>
            pharisees now ascending to the place where he stood, said <note type="footnote"> 1 St. John x. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has borrowed this enumeration of the Jewish sects from a <lb/>

            to him: "We entreated thee to disabuse the people of their <lb/>
            error concerning Jesus, but thou hast given it strength ;" to <lb/>
            which James replied, "I have opened their eyes to their <lb/>
            error, and given them to see the truth." The pharisees <lb/>
            therefore finding that the multitude received with joy the <lb/>
            preaching of the apostle, and believed in Christ, threw him <lb/>
            from the summit of the temple and began to stone him. <lb/>
            But he fell on his knees praying, " 0 Lord, my God and <lb/>
            Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." <lb/>
            While he was thus praying, and stones were being showered <lb/>
            upon him, one of the priests, a son of Rechab, cried out, <lb/>
            " Spare him, I beseech ye, spare him, what do ye ? The <lb/>
            Just one whom you are stoning prays for you." Then one <lb/>
            of the pharisees, in a frenzy of rage, seized a fuller's beam <lb/>
            and struck the apostle violently on the head and beat out his <lb/>
            brains. Thus was the martyrdom of the confessor of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ accomplished, and he was interred near the <lb/>
            temple on the calends [1st] of May.1</p>
          <p>Shortly afterwards, Vespasian waged war against the <lb/>
            Jews, which the wisest of them believed was ordained by <lb/>
            divine Providence as a retribution for their cruelty to James <lb/>
            the Just, as is clearly seen in the works of Josephus, the <lb/>
            celebrated Hebrew historian. While the unbelieving Jews <lb/>
            were exposed to double peril, the church of God, triumphing <lb/>
            in a true faith and saving grace, invokes the help of her <lb/>
            intrepid warrior in her daily conflicts with pure devotion <lb/>
            and in these exalted words: " Have compassion, 0 Jacob <lb/>
            the Just, brother of our Lord, on us who are puffed up with <lb/>
            pride and vainglory and polluted with the lusts of the world; <lb/>
            mercifully hear our prayers, and procure for us the joys of <lb/>
            the divine light. Thou who didst pray for thy enemies, <lb/>
            vouchsafe thy aid to us who are devoted to thee, that we <lb/>

            with sacred graces; so that, like a shining lamp, he enlightened <lb/>
            barbarous races by his bright example and true doctrine. <lb/>
            Born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, lie was among the first <lb/>
            who followed the steps of Christ. After our Lord's ascension <lb/>
            he preached the gospel during twenty years to the Gauls or <lb/>
            Galatians, and Scythians, thus bringing different nations to <lb/>
            the knowledge of the true light. It happened while he was <lb/>
            in Scythia that, being seized by the heathen and dragged <lb/>
            before an image of Mars to compel him to sacrifice to the <lb/>
            idol, an enormous serpent issued from the base of the statue <lb/>
            and struck dead the son of the pontiff, who was serving the <lb/>
            fire for the sacrifice, as well as the two tribunes who govern­ <lb/>
            ed the province, and wrhose officers held the apostle Philip in <lb/>
            bonds. The venom exhaled by the serpent also infected <lb/>
            all who were present, so that they began to faint and to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit symptoms of severe disorder.</p>
          <p>Then Philip exhorted them all to believe in God, and to <lb/>
            throw down and break in pieces the statue of Mars, fixing <lb/>
            in its place the cross of our Lord, as the object of their <lb/>
            adoration ; adding that, if they did this, the languishing <lb/>
            would recover, the dead be restored to life, and the deadly <lb/>
            serpent be put to flight in the name of Christ. Those <lb/>
            who were suffering immediately exclaimed in the bitterness <lb/>
            of their pains: " Restore our strength and we will cast down <lb/>
            the statue." The apostle thereupon called for silence and <lb/>
            exorcised the serpent in the name of the Lord, commanding <lb/>
            it to depart forthwith, and without injuring any one, betake <lb/>
            itself to the wilderness and dwell in solitary places far from <lb/>
            the paths of men. Upon this, the fierce serpent went forth and, <lb/>
            gliding quickly away, was no more seen. The apostle also in <lb/>
            the name of the Lord raised to life the son of the pontiff and <lb/>
            the tribunes who had been struck dead, and also restored <lb/>
            to health the crowd who were infected by the serpent's <lb/>
            venom. All those who had persecuted Philip repented, <lb/>
            and were ready to worship him, supposing him a god. <lb/>
            But he, diligently instructing them for a whole year, imbued <lb/>
            their minds with the knowledge of the supreme God, and <note type="footnote"> having been selected by the church for celebrating his feast. The oldest <lb/>
            inartyrologies placed it on the 25th of March. Its being transferred to the <lb/>
            1st of May seems to have arisen from the dedication on that day of a <lb/>
            church built to his honour at Rome in the sixth century. </note> <pb n="252"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. VIII.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            zealously sowed in the hearts of the believers all that <lb/>
            belonged to the true faith. Many thousands were thus con­ <lb/>
            verted and baptized by the apostle.</p>
          <p>By the abundant aid of divine grace, Philip also built <lb/>
            many churches, and ordained in them bishops and priests, <lb/>
            with the other ecclesiastical orders. Being recalled to Asia <lb/>
            by a revelation, he took up his abode at Hierapolis, where <lb/>
            he eradicated the malignant heresy of the Ebionites, who <lb/>
            deny that Jesus was the Son of G-od, and do not believe <lb/>
            that he took a true human body- in the virgin's womb. <lb/>
            Two of Philip's daughters accompanied him, consecrated <lb/>
            virgins, by whose ministry the Lord increased the numbers <lb/>
            of such holy women. The apostle himself, seven days <lb/>
            before his death, assembled the priests and deacons, with <lb/>
            the bishops of the neighbouring cities, and predicted in <lb/>
            their presence that he should live only seven days longer, <lb/>
            and he enjoined them all to stand firmly in the faith, and to <lb/>
            be always mindful of the doctrine of the Lord. Then the <lb/>
            blessed apostle, having exhorted the people at great length, <lb/>
            departed in the Lord in the eightieth year of his age and on <lb/>
            the 8th of May, his sacred remains being interred at <lb/>
            Hierapolis. Some years afterwards his two daughters were <lb/>
            buried there, one on his right the other on his left; and <lb/>
            many miracles are performed by the merits of the apostle in <lb/>
            answer to faithful prayers; and there resort affianced <lb/>
            spouses, and joyfully chant with loud voices: " Prostrate <lb/>
            before thy tomb, 0 Philip, mouth of the lamp, we beseech <lb/>
            thee to cause our petitions to reach the ears of the Almighty <lb/>
            Judge, that we may be saved from the punishment we have <lb/>
            deserved and obtain the heavenly joys for which we pray. <lb/>

            Abdias, forming the tenth book. All that is really known of this <lb/>

            gifts. He preached the gospel to the Parthians and Medes, <lb/>
            the Hircanians and Persians, the Bactrians and Indians, <lb/>
            and suffered martyrdom in the city of Calamine the 12th of <lb/>
            the calends of January [21st of December] not long <lb/>
            afterwards he became illustrious by numerous miracles in <lb/>
            the city of Edessa.</p>
          <p>We find many variations in the accounts given of the <lb/>
            apostles, arising both from their remote antiquity, and from <lb/>
            the vast distance of the regions in which the labourers in <lb/>
            Christ's field preached- to the barbarians, who so widely <lb/>
            differed from the Romans both in their customs and in their <lb/>
            languages. We may therefore have our doubts of some <lb/>
            things which have been handed down to us respecting the <lb/>
            holy apostles, because they have come to us from authors <lb/>
            but little known; and more especially because pope Gelasius <lb/>
            and other learned doctors have pronounced them to be <lb/>
            apocryphal. The illustrious prelate, St. Augustine,1 also <lb/>
            hesitated respecting some works of this description, and has <lb/>
            furnished an example against Faustus the Manichean, in his <lb/>
            scrupulous researches in regard to the life of St. Thomas. <lb/>
            What I have remarked on these contradictions, which are <lb/>
            discovered in ancient records through all parts of the world, <lb/>
            is not intended to disparage the accounts of the miracles of <lb/>
            holy men, but that whatever is recorded of the apostles or <lb/>
            other saints by the diligence of early writers should be <lb/>
            examined with extreme caution,2 for the confirmation of the <lb/>
            faith and the edification of manners. I will now, in the <lb/>
            name of God, pursue briefly my narrative of St. Thomas's <lb/>
            journeyings, which were abundantly fruitful, his preaching <note type="footnote"> with his two daughters, who were virgins, and are often confounded with <lb/>
            the daughters of Philip the deacon. It is supposed, from a passage in <lb/>
            Irenaeus, that the apostle survived at least till the year 81. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 St. Augustine against Faustus the Manichean, xxii. 79. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Considering the age in which Ordericus Vitalis flourished, this caution, <lb/>
            and the doubts just before expressed as to the apocryphal character of <lb/>
            many of these early ecclesiastical records, do credit to the author's judg­ <lb/>
            ment and candour. The passage may be taken as a sort of protest, once <lb/>
            for all, that although he has inserted in his history large extracts from <lb/>
            these legends, they must be taken for what they are worth. Considered as <lb/>

            Christ with glorious success, and his painful passage, by <lb/>
            martyrdom to eternal life.</p>
          <p>Thomas Didymus being at Cæsarea, the Lord Jesus Christ <lb/>
            appeared to him and commended him to Abbanes the minis­ <lb/>
            ter of Gondafor, king of the Indians, who invited him to <lb/>
            return with him to India, and build a royal palace after the <lb/>
            Roman manner. During the voyage Thomas conversed <lb/>
            mysteriously with Abbanes on the knowledge of his art, and <lb/>
            engaged to execute wonderful works of all kinds in marble <lb/>
            and wood. On the seventh day they reached Andronopolis, <lb/>
            after a prosperous voyage, and as they were landing were <lb/>
            struck with the sounds of voices singing to the music of flutes <lb/>
            and pipes and harps. They learnt that the king of that city <lb/>
            was celebrating the nuptials of his daughter Pelagia with <lb/>
            Dionysius. Heralds proceeded through the streets, proclaim­ <lb/>
            ing that all should come to the royal banquet, whether rich or <lb/>
            poor, nobles, citizens or strangers ; and that whoever refused <lb/>
            would offend the prince. Abbanes and Thomas, therefore, <lb/>
            presented themselves among the guests; but Thomas, as was <lb/>
            his habit, took no part in the merriment and the feast, but <lb/>
            was wholly occupied in heavenly contemplation. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            a Hebrew female singer, with a flute in her hand, went round <lb/>
            the tables singing such melodies as any of the guests required; <lb/>
            but when she came near St. Thomas, she stood lingering be­ <lb/>
            fore him, for observing that he neither ate nor drank, but that <lb/>
            his eyes were raised to heaven, she comprehended that he was <lb/>
            a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the Lord of heaven. Rejoic­ <lb/>
            ing therefore at finding one of her own race, she began sing­ <lb/>
            ing in her mother tongue : " The God of the Hebrews is one <lb/>
            only God ; the Creator of all things; who made the heavens <lb/>
            and the earth, and laid the foundations of the seas." On <lb/>
            hearing this, the apostle prayed more fervently, desiring the <lb/>
            Hebrew girl to repeat the sacred words she had sung, with <lb/>
            greater care. The steward of the feast, however, rebuked St. <lb/>
            Thomas because he neither ate nor drank, buffeting him on <note type="footnote"> 2 In other legends of this saint, the name of this place is written ill'an­ <lb/>

            India. </note> <lb/>

            the face. The apostle then predicted in Hebrew what would <lb/>
            presently befall him before the end of the banquet. And <lb/>
            thus it happened; the steward going forth to draw water <lb/>
            from a fountain, a lion attacked him, and, after sucking his <lb/>
            blood, departed. Dogs came and devoured his limbs, and <lb/>
            one of these animals, which was black, came into the guest- <lb/>
            chamber carrying in his mouth the right hand which had <lb/>
            buffeted the apostle. The guests were struck with astonish­ <lb/>
            ment at this spectacle, but the Hebrew singer, who alone <lb/>
            understood the apostle's prediction, threw down her flute, <lb/>
            and running to him began to kiss his feet, exclaiming: "This <lb/>
            is either a prophet or an apostle of God: for when the <lb/>
            steward struck him he foretold this catastrophe in the <lb/>
            Hebrew tongue, saying, 'I shall not rise from this banquet <lb/>
            until I see that hand brought hither by a black dog.' "</p>
          <p>The king, inquiring the cause of the disturbance and <lb/>
            hearing what had happened, called the apostle aside, and <lb/>
            entreated him to give his blessing to his daughter and her <lb/>
            husband. St. Thomas therefore accompanied the king to <lb/>
            the bride-chamber, and placing his hands with prayer on <lb/>
            the heads of both the espoused, gave them his blessing in <lb/>
            the name of God, repeating also the names of the patriarchs. <lb/>
            The apostle was then leaving the chamber, conducted by the <lb/>
            bridegroom, when a branch of a palm-tree loaded with fruit, <lb/>
            suddenly appeared in the hand of the young prince. It <lb/>
            filled him with delight, and he ran quickly to the bride and <lb/>
            plucked the fruit for her to taste; and when they bad both <lb/>
            partaken of it, they suddenly fell asleep, and both dreamed <lb/>
            the same dream. They saw, as it were, a mighty king <lb/>
            with a jewelled crown and ornaments, who stood between <lb/>
            them, and embracing both, thus addressed them: "My <lb/>
            apostle hath given you his blessing, to the end that ye may <lb/>
            be partakers of everlasting life." On their waking, each <lb/>
            told the other the vision they had seen, when, behold St. <lb/>
            Thomas stood in their presence, saying: " My Lord and <lb/>
            King, who just now spoke to you in the vision, brought <lb/>
            me in hither, although the doors are shut, in order that the <lb/>
            blessing I gave you may be brought to good effect. Tours <lb/>
            is the innocence which is the queen of all virtues, and the fruit <lb/>
            of everlasting salvation. Virginity is the sister of angels, and <lb/>
            the earnest of all felicity; virginity is the victory gained <pb n="256"/>

            over the passions, the trophy of faith, a triumph over the <lb/>
            enemy, and an assurance of eternal rest. For from corrup­ <lb/>
            tion springs uncleanness, from uncleanness guilt, from <lb/>
            guilt dismay.</p>
          <p>St. Thomas having discoursed thus, and more at large, in <lb/>
            praise of virginity, and on the foulness of lust, with the <lb/>
            many inconveniences which frequently arise from carnal <lb/>
            intercourse, Dionysius and Pelagia thankfully listened <lb/>
            to the teaching of the apostle, and thereupon two angels <lb/>
            appeared to them: " We are angels," they said, " sent by <lb/>
            God, in consequence of the apostle's blessing, that as long <lb/>
            as you observe his precepts, we may offer to the Lord all <lb/>
            your petitions."</p>
          <p>Instructed by these and other pious monitions, the husband <lb/>
            and bride threw themselves at the apostle's feet, saying, <lb/>
            " Confirm us in all truth, that nothing relating to the <lb/>
            knowledge of God be wanting to us." The apostle answered, <lb/>
            " I will come to you the following night, and fully instruct <lb/>
            you before I depart." He came accordingly, and having <lb/>
            initiated them both into the mysteries of eternal life, he <lb/>
            sanctified them by the water of baptism. After these events <lb/>
            he resumed his voyage; but in the course of time he sent <lb/>
            them one of his disciples, whom he ordained priest, in order <lb/>
            that he might be stationed and establish a church in that city, <lb/>
            in which a multitude of people were converted to God. It <lb/>
            became the seat of St. Thomas the apostle, and the Catholic <lb/>
            faith is held there to the present day. Dionysius became <lb/>
            bishop, his wife received from his hands the consecrated veil, <lb/>
            and after his death completed her twofold martyrdom; <lb/>
            having renounced her marriage rights, she refused also to <lb/>
            sacrifice to idols. She was consequently beheaded for'her <lb/>
            confession of Christ; and the following inscription was <lb/>
            placed over her tomb in the Greek tongue: " IN THIS PLACE <lb/>
            LIES THE WIFE OF DIONYSIUS THE BISHOP, AND DAUGHTER <lb/>
            OF THOMAS THE APOSTLE."</p>
          <p>On their arrival at Hierapolis, a city of India,1 Abbanes <note type="footnote"> 1 It was the tradition of the church in the time of Origen that St. <lb/>
            Thomas carried the faith among the Parthians, and even into India. The <lb/>
            French editors of Ordericus consider that there is no evidence of the <lb/>
            apostle having penetrated into the south of the peninsala, " Malgré la <lb/>
            prétention des Portugais d'avoir retrouve des traces et des monuments de </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            presented himself before his king Gondafor, and informed <lb/>
            him that he had brought with him a skilful architect whose <lb/>
            name was Thomas. The king consulted with him on the <lb/>
            plans of the palace he proposed building, and pointed out to <lb/>
            him the site on which he intended to erect it. Thomas <lb/>
            then took a rod, and measuring the ground said ; " Here I <lb/>
            shall place the gates; the entrance will be towards the east; <lb/>
            this first space will be the vestibule; next will come an <lb/>
            ante-chamber ; then the hall of audience; the fourth .space <lb/>
            will be the banqueting room; the fifth, the winter chamber; <lb/>
            the sixth the summer chamber; the seventh, the room for <lb/>
            burning perfumes; the eighth, the warm baths; the ninth, <lb/>
            the gymnasium; the tenth, the kitchens; the eleventh, the <lb/>
            cisterns and tanks; in the twelfth will be the hippodrome <lb/>
            and circular portico for the promenade."1 The king having <lb/>
            considered this arrangement, said to Thomas; "You are, in­ <lb/>
            deed, an architect, and deserve to build palaces for kings <note type="footnote"> son séjour sur la cote de Coromandel." It is, however, well known in <lb/>
            England that there is a church of native Christians of great antiquity on the <lb/>
            coast of Malabar, whose traditions are that it was founded by St. Thomas; <lb/>
            and the primitive simplicity and purity of their doctrine and institutions, <lb/>
            with their secluded and independent existence, afford considerable pre­ <lb/>
            sumptive evidence that their claims may be admitted. Geddes, in his <lb/>
            history of this church, says that on the discovery of Malabar by the <lb/>
            Portuguese in 1504, they found the south inhabited by the Christians of <lb/>
            St. Thomas, so calling themselves on account of their having been con­ <lb/>
            verted to the Christian faith by the apostle of that name. They have <lb/>
            always, or at least for 1300 years, been under the patriarch of Babylon. <lb/>
            Dr. Claudius Buchanan, who visited them a few years since, says in his <lb/>
            Christian Researches, " We have as good authority for believing that the <lb/>
            apostle died in India as that St. Peter died at Rome." St. Thomas is said <lb/>
            to have landed from Aden at Cranganore, near which, at Paroor, is the <lb/>

            and the king departed, leaving with him a large sum of <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>The apostle, however, began to journey through the <lb/>
            provinces and cities, preaching the word of God, baptizing <lb/>
            those who believed, and distributing alms abundantly among <lb/>
            the poor. He thus converted immense multitudes to the <lb/>
            Lord, ordained priests, and built churches, and for two <lb/>
            years, during the absence of Gondafor, established the <lb/>
            faithful. However, when the king returned and learnt how <lb/>
            the apostle bad been employed, he ordered both him and <lb/>
            Abbanes to be thrust into the lowest dungeon, bound in <lb/>
            chains. But while he was thinking of having them flayed <lb/>
            alive and then burnt, his brother Gad died, and as he was <lb/>
            much beloved there was great lamentation. The barbarians, <lb/>
            according to their usages, wrapped the corpse in purple and <lb/>
            fine linen, adding jewelled ornaments, and the king com­ <lb/>
            manded a monument to be erected to his brother of purple <lb/>
            stone, aDd his body to be deposited in a sarcophagus of <lb/>
            porphyry. While the workmen were preparing these mag­ <lb/>
            nificent works which delayed the performance of the funeral <lb/>
            rites, Gad himself, the dead man, rose again the fourth day <lb/>
            at the first hour, to the great astonishment and terror of <lb/>
            all: and the wailings, which according to Indian custom <lb/>
            accompany a royal funeral, were hushed into silence. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Gad blamed the king his brother for designing <lb/>
            to flay and to burn the favorite of Heaven, whom the angels <lb/>
            obeyed. He related that he had seen in heaven a wonder­ <lb/>
            ful palace, planned in the manner Thomas had proposed, <lb/>
            and reported besides much more on the merits of that holy <lb/>
            man, and the secrets of heaven. He then hastened to the <lb/>
            prison, freed the apostle from his fetters, and throwing <lb/>
            himself at his feet entreated his pardon for Gondafor.</p>
          <p>As the apostle was taking his departure, the king himself <lb/>
            now rendered more humane, came to meet him, and prostrat­ <lb/>
            ing himself before him entreated his forgiveness. And <lb/>
            now the apostle, finding the opportunity favourable, applied <lb/>
            himself to preaching amongst the barbarians and proclam­ <lb/>
            ing the truth. Among other things he said : " Jesus Christ, <lb/>
            my Lord, hath shown you great favour in that he bath revealed <note type="footnote"> 1 The word memoria is here used in the sense of monumentum. St. <lb/>
            Augustine uses the phrase, memoria. marmorata, a tomb of marble. </note> <lb/>

            his secrets to you. Lo, your provinces arc full of churches ; <lb/>
            prepare yourselves, therefore, that you may be sanctified." <lb/>
            Such words and many more he addressed to the princes,­ <lb/>
            instructing them in the faith and the true religion.</p>
          <p>All India speedly heard the report of the wonders which <lb/>
            the Lord wrought by the hands of his apostle, and great <lb/>
            multitudes of people were gathered to him from the cities <lb/>
            both far and near. They proposed to pay him divine honours, <lb/>
            offering him sacrifices of calves and rams, as they did to <lb/>
            their gods. Meanwhile king Gondafor, by the apostle's advice, <lb/>
            commanded them to wait a month until the whole province <lb/>
            was assembled, and that they should then do what he directed. <lb/>
            Accordingly, at the expiration of thirty days, multitudes of <lb/>
            people assembled on the plain at the foot of mount Gazus, <lb/>
            among whom there were a great number afflicted with divers <lb/>
            disorders. The apostle then desired them to gather all the <lb/>
            sick into one body, and placing himself in the midst, he <lb/>
            spread forth his hands to heaven and prayed on their behalf. <lb/>
            When his prayer was finished, a ray of light darted upon <lb/>
            them with such force that they all thought themselves on <lb/>
            the point of being destroyed by lightning. They fell pros­ <lb/>
            trate on the ground with the apostle, and remained in that <lb/>
            position for nearly half an hour, being sensible that the <lb/>
            gracious presence of God was among them ; for many who <lb/>
            had fevers, and the dumb, and the blind, and the lame, and <lb/>
            those who had other disorders, were healed by the power of <lb/>
            the Creator. All now rose from the ground, at the apostle's <lb/>
            command, and each one, full of joy for his recovery, glorified <lb/>
            the Lord.</p>
          <p>Then the blessed Thomas mounted on a rock where he <lb/>
            could see all the people, and be seen of them, and calling <lb/>
            for silence explained to them fully his true doctrine. The <lb/>
            Sunday following, nine thousand men were baptized, besides <lb/>
            women and children. The apostle afterwards, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of a revelation, undertook a journey to Upper India; <lb/>
            and there all the people hastened to hear him, and, being <lb/>
            witness of the signs and wonders which he wrought, were <lb/>
            so astonished that they did not dare to despise his preaching. <lb/>
            He cast out devils, gave sight to the blind, cleansed the <lb/>
            lepers, healed all diseases, both rheums and fevers, and <lb/>
            raised the dead. <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            A certain woman named Sintice, who had been blind for <lb/>
            six years, was so cured that no sign was left of her former <lb/>
            infirmity. Hearing of this, the curiosity of Mygdonia, wife <lb/>
            of Carisius, a cousin of the King Mesdeus, was excited, and <lb/>
            disguising herself she mingled among her handmaids while <lb/>
            the holy St. Thomas was preaching a saving discourse on <lb/>
            the true God. The whole multitude believed at the apostle's <lb/>
            teaching, and after a fast of seven days received baptism. <lb/>
            Mygdonia, however, after hearing the apostle's discourse, <lb/>
            would not again enter her husband's bed. Upon this, <lb/>
            Carisius went to the king in great anger, and obtained per­ <lb/>
            mission to have the apostle arrested and thrown into prison. <lb/>
            But Sintice conducted Mygdonia to the prison, and by <lb/>
            bribing the gaoler obtained access to the apostle's dungeon. <lb/>
            When he was informed of the faith of Mygdonia, he com­ <lb/>
            manded her to return immediately to her own house, care­ <lb/>
            fully close her chamber, and expect him. Accordingly at <lb/>
            midnight the apostle appeared in the chamber as he had <lb/>
            promised, and comforting Mygdonia instructed her in the <lb/>
            faith and appointed her a seven days' fast. On the eighth, <lb/>
            he returned in a similar manner, and baptized the believing <lb/>
            woman, and all others who received the faith. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Carisius, whose sister King Mesdeus had married, begged <lb/>
            that the queen Treptia might be sent to his own wife to <lb/>
            endeavour to recall her to her conjugal duties. King <lb/>
            Mesdeus consenting, the queen went to Mygdonia, and lavish­ <lb/>
            ing caresses on her, used every effort to induce her to return <lb/>
            to her former habits. But she, now confirmed in the faith <lb/>
            of Christ, earnestly refused, and becoming a champion in <lb/>
            the cause of truth, in her turn contended with Treptia, and <lb/>
            ended by persuading her to yield to Christ. For she <lb/>
            replied to that queen with endearing words, adroitly in­ <lb/>
            stilled into her mind a regard for the apostle, and gained <lb/>
            her heart by a discourse of this kind : " My sister Treptia, <lb/>
            if you knew all I have learnt, you would consider him not as <lb/>
            a man but a god, for be gives hearing to the deaf, he has <lb/>
            restored health in all manner of disorders, and sometimes <lb/>
            he has even raised the dead. He teaches that there is <lb/>
            another and immortal life, free from pain and all sorrow. <lb/>
            This very night he restored life to a dead man; for Sim­ <lb/>
            forus, the captain of the soldiers, went to the prison and, <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            taking upon himself the safe custody of the apostle, received <lb/>
            him from the gaoler and conducted him to his own house. <lb/>
            The apostle having prayed, restored to life the only son of <lb/>
            the captain, who lay dead. Even now he remains in that <lb/>
            house, teaching all who come to him, and healing all dis­ <lb/>
            orders." Treptia answered: " If it be as you say, let us go <lb/>
            and see this man ; and if I find these things to be true, I <lb/>
            also will immediately accept the faith. It is unwise not to <lb/>
            seek eternal life, and not to believe such extraordinary <lb/>
            gifts." They went therefore to the captain's house, but <lb/>
            having entered were unable to obtain access to the apostle, <lb/>
            who was engaged in laying his hands on people labouring <lb/>
            under various infirmities. The queen, at the sight of so <lb/>
            many miracles, exclaimed in astonishment, " Cursed of God <lb/>
            be those who do not believe the works of salvation." Then <lb/>
            a man was brought in by the apostle's command suffering <lb/>
            from elephantiasis, of horrible appearance, with a hoarse <lb/>
            voice, and his face rough with scabs. The apostle wept <lb/>
            over him, and praying a long time on bended knees, laid his <lb/>
            hand on him, supplicating God. Next, a boy appeared with <lb/>
            a cheerful aspect, and, leading a leper from a retired corner, <lb/>
            stripped him of his clothes, his skin also peeling off from his <lb/>
            body like a tunic, or as when one flays a calf. Being <lb/>
            brought to the apostle, he signed him with the sign of the <lb/>
            cross, and having baptized him, caused him to be clothed in <lb/>
            new white garments. At this spectacle the people magni­ <lb/>
            fied God, and the queen kissing the apostle's feet entreated <lb/>
            to be baptized ; and he, perceiving that the time of his de­ <lb/>
            parture from the body was at hand, baptized her with the <lb/>
            rest who were present.</p>
          <p>On the queen's return, she announced her conversion to <lb/>
            the king, and expressed her determination to continue in <lb/>
            the faith. Then the king's heart was troubled, and his <lb/>
            anger being raised against Carisius, he exclaimed, " While <lb/>
            I was endeavouring to recover your wife, I have lost my <lb/>
            own; for Treptia is become worse to me than Mygdonia to <lb/>
            thee." Whereupon be sent for St. Thomas, commanding <lb/>
            him to be brought into his presence with his hands bound <lb/>
            behind his back. The king on seeing him, commanded him <lb/>
            to use his influence with the women he bad deceived to <lb/>
            induce them to return to their conjugal duties. Upon his <pb n="262"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. VIII.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            refusing this, and endeavouring to bring his persecutors to <lb/>
            a saving faith, the king ordered iron plates to be heated, <lb/>
            and the apostle to be placed upon them, standing with bare <lb/>
            feet, until he fainted from pain. Immediately, however, a, <lb/>
            spring burst forth, and cooled the iron plates. Next, by the <lb/>
            advice of Carisius, he was thrown into the furnace at the <lb/>
            baths: but they were unable to heat the baths, and the <lb/>
            apostle again departed unhurt. At last they attempted to <lb/>
            compel him to offer sacrifice to the image of the sun. The <lb/>
            statue was of gold, standing in a golden car drawn by four <lb/>
            horses, and appeared to bold the reins loosely, while the car <lb/>
            was whirled rapidly through the sky. In the temple <lb/>
            heathen priests led the dance with barbaric rites, and, <lb/>
            virgins sung hymns to the melody of their lyres, with flutes <lb/>
            and timbrels, and fillets and censers. The king and his <lb/>
            courtiers having brought the apostle to the temple and <lb/>
            exhorted him to sacrifice to this image of the sun, address­ <lb/>
            ing the demon in the Hebrew tongue, he commanded him <lb/>
            to come forth and obey his orders. The demon, having <lb/>
            made his appearance, stood before the apostle, so that he <lb/>
            was visible to him only; and the apostle talked with the <lb/>
            devil in the Hebrew tongue, while no one knew what he <lb/>
            said, or with whom he was conversing.</p>
          <p>When, at length, St. Thomas had worshipped the Lord in <lb/>
            the idol-temple on his bended knees, and in presence of the <lb/>
            king had enjoined the demon, in Christ's name, to do injury <lb/>
            to no one, but immediately to destroy the molten image, <lb/>
            the idol instantly dissolved and melted like wax at the fire. <lb/>
            Then all the priests raised shrieks, and the pontiff pierced <lb/>
            the apostle through the body with a sword. The king and <lb/>
            Carisius took to flight, and there was a great tumult among <lb/>
            the people, as the greater part shouted for the apostle, and <lb/>
            sought for his murderer that they might burn him alive. <lb/>
            The apostle's body was honourably borne with hymns of <lb/>
            praise to the church, and being embalmed with precious <lb/>
            aromatics, great signs and miracles were wrought there, for <lb/>
            demoniacs were freed, and all diseases were healed.; <note type="footnote"> 1 These acts of St. Thomas are not borrowed directly from the false <lb/>
            Abdias, but from some other legend which has altered some of the details, <lb/>
            and shortened the conclusion. See note, p. 257, respecting the mission of <lb/>

          <p>A long time afterwards the Syrians obtained a promise <lb/>
            from Alexander, emperor of Rome, on his return from the <lb/>
            Parthian war after defeating Xerxes, that he would send to <lb/>
            the petty kings of India to demand that the remains of <lb/>
            St. Thomas should be restored to them.1 The body of the <lb/>
            apostle was therefore transported from India, and deposited <lb/>
            in the city of Edessa in a silver coffer, suspended by chains <lb/>
            of the same metal. There no idolaters, no heretics, no <lb/>
            Jews can live.</p>
          <p>Abgarus2 was chief, or king of Edessa, when he had the <lb/>
            honour to receive the letter written by our Saviours hand, <lb/>
            which is read by a newly baptized child, standing over the <lb/>
            gate of the city, when any barbarous tribe advances to <lb/>
            attack the place. The very same day the letter is read, the <lb/>
            invaders either make peace, or retreat, in terror both of our <lb/>
            Lord's letter, and of the prayers of St. Thomas the apostle, <lb/>
            surnamed Didymus, who having touched the Lord's side <lb/>
            cried out, " Lord, thou art my God."</p>
          <p>George Florence Gregory, the venerable archbishop of <lb/>
            Tours, writes that he had heard some particulars respecting <lb/>
            St. Thomas from one Theodore who bad lately travelled in <lb/>
            India, and on his return related what follows, as well as <lb/>
            other circumstances.</p>
          <p>" In India, at the place where the body of the blessed <lb/>
            apostle St. Thomas was first deposited, there is a monastery <lb/>
            and church of vast size, and built and ornamented with <lb/>
            great care. In this church the Lord works a great miracle. <lb/>
            A lamp burning before the tomb of the apostle gives, day <lb/>
            and night perpetually, a splendid light, by God's special <lb/>
            provision, though it is neither fed with oil nor supplied with <lb/>
            wicks. It is neither extinguished by the wind, nor is it <lb/>
            injured by any accident, nor does the flame diminish, re­ <lb/>
            ceiving its increase by virtue of the apostle in a manner <lb/>
            unknown to man, who can only attribute it to divine power. <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author speaks of the expedition of Alexander Severus against the <lb/>
            Parthians under their king Artaxerxes, founder of the dynasty of the <lb/>

            in the history of that emperor to countenance the demand here attributed <lb/>
            to him. It is, however certain, that as early as the fourth century, the <lb/>

            At the city of Edessa where, as we have already said, the <lb/>
            blessed remains of the apostle are deposited, at the feast of <lb/>
            the anniversary of his translation, a great concourse or <lb/>
            people assembled from foreign countries both in performance <lb/>
            of vows and for the purposes of commerce, and during a fair <lb/>
            held for thirty days there is free liberty to buy and sell <lb/>
            without payment of any tolls. In these days, which happen <lb/>
            in the fifth month, great and unusual favours are conferred <lb/>
            on the people. No quarrels take place in the throng, and <lb/>
            neither flies infest tainted meat, nor is there scarcity of <lb/>
            water for the thirsty crowd ; for although during the rest of <lb/>
            the year water is drawn from the wells at a depth of a <lb/>
            hundred feet; during the fair, if you only pierce the surface, <lb/>
            springs burst forth abundantly. There can be no doubt <lb/>
            that these wonders must be, attributed to the apostle's <lb/>
            power. When the days of the feast are expired, tolls are <lb/>

            sent by God's providence so washes the whole court of the <lb/>
            church from the filth and rubbish accumulated during the <lb/>
            fair, that that you would suppose the pavement had not <lb/>

          <p>Almighty God, our just and compasionate judge and <lb/>

            ineffable honour, chastises mankind by his terrors, and in <lb/>
            punishing, saves them by penitence. Let us supplicate him <lb/>
            while we groan in this valley of tears, let us give him thanks <lb/>
            for his unspeakable benefits, and let us hasten to him by <lb/>
            keeping his commandments. Let us also pray to St. <lb/>
            Thomas the apostle, surnamed Didymus, and confiding in <lb/>
            his intercession, say in our chaunts:</p>
          <p>" 0 Thomas, who didst touch the side of our Lord, we <lb/>
            beseech thee by those sacred wounds which have taken away <lb/>
            all the sins of the world, cleanse us from our guilt by thy <lb/>
            prayers. We feel the cruel wounds of our sins; we groan <lb/>
            in our trouble, and pray with tears : in pity offer for us thy <lb/>
            powerful intercession to God the thunderer. Amen. " <note type="footnote"> 1 The preceding paragraph is literally transcribed from Gregory of <lb/>

          <p>BARTHOLOMEW is a Syriac word, signifying the son of him <lb/>
            who suspends the watery It fell to this apostle's lot to <lb/>
            preach in Lycaonia; afterwards he carried the gospel into <lb/>
            Assyria and the third India. At length, when dwelling at <lb/>
            Albano, of the greater Armenia, he was flayed alive by the <lb/>
            barbarians, and beheaded by order of King Astyages, being <lb/>
            interred on the 9th of the calends of September [24th <lb/>
            August.] His sacred body was at first translated to the <lb/>
            island of Lipari, and thence to Beneventum in the year of <lb/>
            our Lord 809, where it is held by the faithful in pious <lb/>
            veneration. Our careful researches will now be directed <lb/>
            to the examination of the whole history of his passion, and <lb/>
            the following brief account is inserted from ancient manu­ <lb/>
            scripts.</p>
          <p>According to historians, India is divided into three <lb/>
            regions, which are reported to have contained five thousand <lb/>
            towns, and nine thousand peopled The first India extends <lb/>
            as far as Ethiopia; the second to the Medes; the third to <lb/>
            the extremity, where it is bounded on one side by the region <lb/>
            of darkness, on the other by the ocean. It was to this part of <lb/>
            India Bartholomew came, and entering a temple in which <lb/>
            stood the idol Astaroth,3 he made it his resting place ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the custom of pilgrims. On the apostle's arrival <note type="footnote"> 1 The word Bartholomew is evidently Syriac. Our author's version of <lb/>
            it, filius suspendentis aquas, which is given literally in the text, seems like <lb/>

            is difficult to conjecture its origin. It is probable that Bartholomew reallv <lb/>
            means the son of Tholomæa, or Tholomi, referring to the place of the <lb/>
            apostle's birth, as Simon the Canaanite is called in the Syriac Cananaia. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We cannot suppose that Ordericus would assign a population of only <lb/>

            tion is made in words, and not in figures.- </note><note type="footnote">3 The worship of this idol, the Syrian Astarte, was early introduced <lb/>
            among the Hebrews (1 Sam. xii. 10), and encouraged by Solomon and <lb/>
            Jezebel. Astarte was represented as a female, and like the Egyptian Isis <lb/>
            and the Ephesian Diana, typified the moon, while Dual was worshipped as <lb/>
            the sun. </note> <pb n="266"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. VIII.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            Astaroth became dumb, giving no answers to those who <lb/>
            consulted the idol, nor being able to succour those who were <lb/>
            injured. The temple now became full of diseased people, <lb/>
            Astaroth making no reply to those who daily offered sacri­ <lb/>
            fice ; the infirm therefore, who where attracted there from, <lb/>
            distant parts, miserably bewailed their sufferings, and the <lb/>
            idol-worshippers, neither profiting by their sacrifices, nor by <lb/>
            cutting themselves according to their custom, went to <lb/>
            another city where a demon named Berith 1 was worshipped, <lb/>
            and offering him sacrifice, inquired respecting the silence of <lb/>
            their own god, and other recent occurrences. The reply <lb/>
            was this; " Your god is held captive, bound in chains of flame, <lb/>
            that he cannot utter a word, nor scarcely breathe, since <lb/>
            Bartholomew the apostle of God arrived in this country." <lb/>
            They then asked him who this Bartholomew was ; to which <lb/>
            the demon answered: " He is the friend of the supreme God, <lb/>
            and is come into this country for the purpose of expelling the <lb/>
            gods worshipped by the Indians." The votaries of Astaroth <lb/>
            said: " Tell us by what tokens we may distinguish him <lb/>
            among the millions we see." The idol replied : "His hair <lb/>
            is black and curling, his skin fair, his eyes full, his nose <lb/>
            regular and straight, his ears covered by his long hair, his <lb/>
            beard is long and but slightly grey, and his stature is of <lb/>
            the middle height, neither long nor short. He wears a <lb/>
            white tunic, without sleeves, fastened with purple clasps, over <lb/>
            which is a white mantle having ruby coloured gems in the <lb/>
            corners. For twenty-six years he has worn the same <lb/>
            clothes, which are neither soiled nor have they grown old. <lb/>
            So also the sandals worn on his feet during the same period <lb/>
            exhibit no signs of decay. A hundred times in the day he <lb/>
            bends his knees before God, a hundred times in the night <lb/>
            he rises to pray. His voice is clear as the sound of a <lb/>
            trumpet. The angels of God are his companions, and per- <note type="footnote"> 1 See Judges viii. 33, and ix. 4, where this idol is called Baal-Berith. </note><note type="footnote"> a M. L. Prévost remarks that our author, or we should rather say the <lb/>
            legend he copies, has given St. Bartholomew a dress, the Byzantine <lb/>
            magnificence of which is little accordant with apostolic simplicity. The <lb/>
            colobium, here translated tunic, was a vestment without sleeves, or having <lb/>
            them very short and close-fitting, in opposition to the full sleeves of the <lb/>
            dalmatic, which was substituted for it in the dress of the priests by Pope <lb/>
            Silvester. However this may be, the whole description of the apostle <lb/>
            is highly graphic and characteristic. </note> <lb/>

            mit him neither to suffer fatigue nor hunger. His aspect is <lb/>
            always the same, the same spirit animates him, he is always <lb/>
            serene and happy. He foresees all things, knows all things, <lb/>
            and speaks and understands the languages of all the nations <lb/>
            of the earth. Even now he is aquainted with your inquiries, <lb/>
            and my replies respecting him. The angels of God obey him, <lb/>
            and are his precursors." Having said thus much and more, <lb/>
            the demon was silent.</p>
          <p>On their return, these people searched all the places fre­ <lb/>
            quented by strangers, narrowly observing their persons and <lb/>
            dress; but for two days they were unable to discover the <lb/>
            apostle. At length a demoniac named Seusticus cried out: <lb/>
            " Apostle Bartholomew, thy prayers send fire through me." <lb/>
            Upon which the apostle said: " Hold thy peace, and come <lb/>
            out of him." And the man, who for many years had been <lb/>
            tormented by an evil spirit, was freed from his power.</p>
          <p>Polemius,i the king of that country, having heard of these <lb/>
            occurrences sent to Bartholomew, entreating him to heal his <lb/>
            daughter who was a lunatic, and bit with her teeth, or tore <lb/>
            or beat, all who came within her reach. The apostle imme­ <lb/>
            diately arose, and accompanying the king's messenger, <lb/>
            commanded the girl to be released from the fetters with <lb/>
            which she was bound: and when the attendants were afraid <lb/>
            to come near her, the apostle said: " I hold in chains the <lb/>
            enemy who had taken possession of her; go then and loose <lb/>
            her, let her wash and eat, and bring her to me to-morrow <lb/>
            early;" they did, therefore, as the apostle commanded, and <lb/>
            the demon was no longer able to torment her. Then the <lb/>
            king loaded two camels with gold and silver, and precious <lb/>
            stones and garments, and sent them to the apostle, but as <lb/>
            he was not to be found, they were brought back to the <lb/>
            palace.</p>
          <p>At the first dawn of day on the morrow, when the king <lb/>
            was yet in his chamber, and the door securely closed, the <lb/>
            apostle appeared to him, all alone, and instructed him in the <lb/>
            true belief, and the doctrines of salvation. He treated, in <lb/>
            order, of the incarnation of the Son of God by the immacu­ <lb/>
            late virgin, and of the thrice-repeated temptation, and the <lb/>
            threefold victory. <note type="footnote"> 1 In the false Abdias, this prince is called Polymius, and the demoniac <lb/>

            The king Polemius, yielding to the apostolical teaching, <lb/>
            particularly ordered the idol priests to sacrifice on the <lb/>
            morrow. When therefore they were sacrificing at day break, <lb/>
            the demon broke silence, complaining of the torments to <lb/>
            which he was subjected by the angels. At the apostle's <lb/>
            command he also openly confessed the frauds by which he <lb/>
            had injured the people. Then the apostle said to the multi­ <lb/>
            tude ; " See what a god is this, that you thought could heal <lb/>
            you. Hear now the true God, your Creator, who dwells in <lb/>
            the heavens; and if you desire that I should pray for you, <lb/>
            and that all the sick now present be restored to health, <lb/>
            overturn this idol, and break it to pieces. When this is <lb/>
            done, I will consecrate the temple in Christ's name, and will <lb/>
            here sanctify all by his baptism." Upon this the king <lb/>
            commanded ropes and pulleys to be brought, but with all <lb/>
            their efforts, the crowd was unable to throw down the <lb/>
            image. Then the apostle said to them " Loose the fasten­ <lb/>
            ings." And when all were loosened, he commanded the <lb/>
            demon to go forth and demolish the image ; and he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately obeyed, and broke in pieces the idols of every descrip­ <lb/>
            tion. All therefore who were eye-witnesses shouted with <lb/>
            one voice: " There is but one God who is almighty, and <lb/>
            him his apostle Bartholomew preaches." Then the blessed <lb/>
            apostle spread out his hands to the Lord, and prayed long <lb/>
            for the salvation of all present. And when the multitude <lb/>
            answered "Amen," an angel of the Lord, having wings <lb/>
            and shining like the sun, appeared, and taking his flight <lb/>
            round the four sides of the temple, engraved with his finger <lb/>
            the sign of the cross on the corner stones. The apostle <lb/>
            commanded the people also to make with their fingers the <lb/>
            sign of the cross on their foreheads. He then showed them <lb/>
            a gigantic Egyptian, blacker than soot, his features keen, <lb/>
            his beard long, and his hair hanging down to his feet, his <lb/>
            eyes flashing fire, and emitting sparks like red hot iron.- <lb/>
            Sulphureous flames issued from his mouth and his nostrils, <lb/>
            he had bristly feathers, and wings like the sphinx, 1 his hands <lb/>
            were bound behind him, and he was secured by chains of fire. <lb/>
            This malignant devil, having been seen by all the people, was <lb/>
            set free by the angel, and receiving a command that he <lb/>
            should depart into desert places, where none of human kind <note type="footnote"> 1 The false Abdias for sphinx, reads hystrix, a porcupine. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            dwelt and there await the day of judgment, uttering a <lb/>
            fearful shriek with his terrible voice, he flew away and was <lb/>
            seen no more. At the same time the angel of the Lord <lb/>
            ascended to heaven in the sight of all.</p>
          <p>Hereupon King Polemius, with his wife, his two sons, and <lb/>
            his whole army, and all the people who were healed, and <lb/>
            the inhabitants of his own city and of the neighbouring <lb/>
            towns belonging to his kingdom, believing, was baptized; <lb/>
            and laying aside his diadem and his purple, devoted himself <lb/>
            to the apostle. Meanwhile, the priests and idolaters <lb/>
            assembled from all the temples, and thus complained to king <lb/>
            Astyages, the elder brother of their prince: " Your brother <lb/>
            has become the disciple of a magician who takes possession <lb/>
            of our temples, and breaks in pieces the images of our <lb/>
            gods." While they were making these sorrowful complaints, <lb/>
            the priests of other cities came with lamentations to repeat <lb/>
            the same tale. Astyages, incensed, sent a thousand armed <lb/>
            men in company with the priests to take the apostle <lb/>
            wherever they could find him, and bring him in chains <lb/>
            before him. Being brought to the king, and questioned by <lb/>
            him concerning the true God, he replied with firmness. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, it was told the king that his god Waldack had <lb/>
            fallen down, and was reduced to atoms. Then he rent his <lb/>
            purple robe, and commanded the blessed apostle to be <lb/>
            scourged with rods, and afterwards beheaded. And an <lb/>
            innumerable multitude of people from twelve cities, who <lb/>
            were believers, came with pomp and hymns, and transported <lb/>
            his body to a spot where a noble church was dedicated to the <lb/>
            apostle, and there they deposited his sacred remains. On <lb/>
            the thirtieth day after the deposit, the king Astyages and <lb/>
            all the priests were taken possession of by the devil, and <lb/>
            coming to the church acknowledged the apostle, and by the <lb/>
            just judgment of God fell dead. And great fear fell upon <lb/>
            the unbelievers; and those who witnessed the manifest <lb/>
            vengeance of God were converted to the faith, and baptized <lb/>
            by the priests whom the apostle Bartholomew had ordained. <lb/>
            The king Polemius had, in consequence of a revelation, been <lb/>
            ordained bishop by the apostle, with the acclamations of <lb/>
            the clergy and people. He worked miracles, and lived twenty <lb/>
            years in his episcopate, when, having well ordered and <lb/>
            established the infant church, he departed to the Lord. <pb n="270"/>

            Many years passed away; and again a persecution was <lb/>
            raised against the Christians. And when the heathen saw <lb/>
            the concourse of people which flocked to the tomb of the <lb/>
            blessed Bartholomew, offering him incessantly the incense <lb/>
            of their prayers, they were roused by envy to carry off his <lb/>
            body, and enclosing it in a leaden chest, they cast it into <lb/>
            the sea. But by God's providence, the leaden coffin, float­ <lb/>
            ing on the waves, was carried to the island of Lipari, <lb/>
            where it was revealed to the Christians that they should <lb/>
            receive it with honour. It was therefore interred with <lb/>
            suitable attendance, and a magnificent church built over <lb/>
            the tomb, with a choir of monks to perform divine worship.1</p>

          <p>MATTHEW, or Levi, as he relates in his own gospel, was <lb/>

            suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia while he was celebrating <lb/>
            mass, under Hyrtacus Adelphus, after he had converted <lb/>
            and baptized in the faith, of Christ the king Eglippus with <lb/>
            many thousands of his people. He thus happily departed <lb/>
            in the Lord on the eleventh of the calends of October [21st <lb/>
            of September]. The following account of the preaching <lb/>
            and passion of the blessed evangelist is copied from ancient <lb/>
            histories. <note type="footnote"> 1 This legend is borrowed almost literally from the false Abdias. <lb/>
            Nothing certain is known of the preaching of St. Bartholomew, or the <lb/>
            circumstances attending his death. The received opinion is, that he carried <lb/>
            the faith into Arabia Felix; but the city of Albano, where the scene of <lb/>
            his martyrdom is laid, was the capital of Albania on the shore of the <lb/>
            Caspian Sea. The Emperor Anastasius, having built the city of Daras in <lb/>
            Mesopotamia in 509, is said to have caused the relics of St. Bartholomew <lb/>
            to be translated there, it is not mentioned from whence. About the same <lb/>
            time they were believed to be deposited in the Isle of Lipari,according to <lb/>
            the tradition followed by our author. Being profaned by the Saracens in <lb/>
            803, they are said to have been collected by a Greek monk, and carried <lb/>
            to Beneventum the year following. </note> <pb n="271"/>

          <p>The apostle Matthew, after writing his gospel in Judea <lb/>
            in the Hebrew tongue, by the divine command went among <lb/>
            the Ethiopians, where he worked many miracles, and brought <lb/>
            multitudes to salvation. Having come to the great city <lb/>
            Nadaber, be detected the artifices of the magicians Zaroes <lb/>
            and Arphaxath, who said that they were gods, and thus <lb/>
            imposed upon the king Eglippus and his people. They <lb/>
            rendered men motionless as long as they pleased: they had <lb/>
            the art to blind them, and cause them to become deaf; <lb/>
            serpents inflicted wounds at their command, which they <lb/>
            healed by their incantations. Their fame spread through <lb/>
            all Ethiopia, so that crowds flocked to these magicians from <lb/>
            the furthest parts of the country, and the dupes worshipped <lb/>
            their deceivers. Indeed, as the proverb says, fear causes <lb/>
            more reverence to the workers of evil than love to the <lb/>
            kindly disposed.</p>
          <p>The merciful Lord, therefore, in his providential care for <lb/>
            mankind, sent Matthew the apostle to the relief of the <lb/>
            Ethiopians thus doubly black, both naturally and morally. <lb/>
            The Ethiopian Eunuch Candace,1who had been baptized by <lb/>
            Philip the apostolic deacon, upon seeing Matthew, threw <lb/>
            himself at his feet rejoicing, and brought him with great <lb/>
            reverence into his house. The friends of Candace resorted <lb/>
            to him, and hearing the word of life, believed in the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, many being baptized, when they perceived <lb/>
            that the apostle nullified all the mischief which the magicians <lb/>
            caused to men. In fact, these impostors wounded all whom <lb/>
            they got in their power that they might have the credit of <lb/>
            healing them ; and those passed for being cured whose <lb/>
            wounds no longer appeared. But Matthew, the apostle of <lb/>
            Christ, not only healed those who had been hurt by the <lb/>
            magicians, but all others who were brought to him, under <lb/>
            whatever diseases they were labouring. He also taught <lb/>
            divine truth to the people, so that all were astonished at <lb/>
            his eloquence, he being able to discourse with ease in the <lb/>
            Greek, Egyptian, and Ethiopic tongues. Candace, having <lb/>
            asked him questions in confidence, and in a kindly way, <lb/>
            the apostle clearly explained to him that the confusion of <note type="footnote"> 1 Candace was not the name of the eunuch baptized by St. Philip, but <lb/>
            of the queen in whose service he was. Acts viii. 27. It appears to have <lb/>

            tongues occurred at Babel from man's presumption; and <lb/>
            again how the Diety incarnate redeemed mankind, and over­ <lb/>
            threw the old enemy by Christ's humiliation; and how the <lb/>
            Holy Spirit kindled the flame of inspiration in his elect <lb/>
            servants, imparting to them the gift of tongues, and making <lb/>
            them fully to understand the hidden wisdom of the holy <lb/>
            scriptures. While the blessed apostle was engaged in freely <lb/>
            opening to his hearers many life-giving truths from the <lb/>
            treasures of wisdom, some one came and reported that the <lb/>
            magicians, with their serpents, were near at hand. These <lb/>
            serpents were crested, their breath was as a flame of fire, <lb/>
            and their nostrils gave forth a sulphureous odour, sufficient <lb/>
            to destroy those who inhaled it. Then St. Matthew crossed <lb/>
            himself, and in spite of . the remonstrances of Candace the <lb/>
            eunuch, went forth to meet them; and as soon as he stood <lb/>
            before the magicians, both the serpents lay down sleeping <lb/>
            at his feet. Upon this the apostle said to the magicians, <lb/>
            " Where is your art ? Rouse the serpents from their sleep, <lb/>
            if you are able." They accordingly endeavoured by their <lb/>
            magical charms to rouse up the serpents, but entirely failed. <lb/>
            A crowd had now assembled, and were astonished at what <lb/>
            they saw. At length the blessed apostle commanded the <lb/>
            fierce snakes, in the name of the Lord, to retire peaceably <lb/>
            to their own place, departing without doing harm to any <lb/>
            one. The serpents forthwith, raising their heads, began <lb/>
            to depart, and passing through the open gates of the city, <lb/>
            were never more seen.</p>
          <p>The holy evangelist then addressed the people, who were <lb/>
            full of joy, in an affectionate discourse, recounting to them <lb/>
            in order the original state of man, the delights of paradise, <lb/>
            the envy and craft of the apostate angel, the fall of Adam <lb/>
            the first man, in consequence of his prevarication, and his <lb/>
            recovery by the passion of the Son of God. While the <lb/>
            apostle was thus largely discoursing on these abundant <lb/>
            themes, his audience were suddenly startled by a tumult of <lb/>
            grief in which lamentations were made for the death of <lb/>
            Euphranon, the son of the king Eglippus. The magicians <lb/>
            conducted his obsequies, and not being able to restore him <lb/>
            to life, assured the king that his son was caught up by the <lb/>
            gods into their assembly above, persuading him that he <lb/>
            should be numbered among the divinities, and a temple <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            erected to his honour. But the queen Euphenisia received <lb/>
            a wiser counsel from the faithful Candace, and holding the <lb/>
            magicians in utter contempt, sent nobles of rank to bring <lb/>
            Matthew to the king. Upon his entering the palace, she <lb/>
            threw herself at his feet, and fervently and devoutly on­ <lb/>
            treated him to restore her son to life. The blessed apostle <lb/>
            commended her sincere faith, and prayed to Almighty God <lb/>
            to give life to the dead. Then taking the young man's <lb/>
            hand, he commanded him to arise in the name of the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, and immediately the young man rose up.</p>
          <p>At the sight of such a miracle the king was struck with <lb/>
            fear, and causing a crown and purple robe to be offered <lb/>
            him, sent heralds through all the towns and provinces of <lb/>
            Ethiopia, proclaiming: “Come to the city, and see the <lb/>
            Lord manifested in the guise of man.”Great multitudes, <lb/>
            therefore, assembled with tapers and lamps, with incense <lb/>
            and offerings of various kinds for sacrifice : but St. Mat­ <lb/>
            thew thus addressed them: “I am no god, but the servant <lb/>
            of Almighty God, who has sent me to free you from your <lb/>
            errors, and bring you to the knowledge of the true God, <lb/>
            that you may worship him. Take away this splendid crown, <lb/>
            and the silver and gold; go and erect a temple to the <lb/>
            Lord, in which you may assemble and hear the word of <lb/>
            God together."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, the crowd departed rejoicing, and sixty <lb/>
            thousand men set about building a temple to God, so that <lb/>
            the church was completed within thirty days. Matthew <lb/>
            called it the Church of the Resurrection, in memory of the <lb/>
            restoration of the king's son. It became his apostolic seat <lb/>
            for twenty-three years, and he attached to it priests and <lb/>
            deacons, ordained bishops in' the cities and towns, and <lb/>
            founded many churches. The king and queen, and the <lb/>
            different tribes of Ethiopia received the baptism of Christ, <lb/>
            and the magicians in terror made their escape into Persia. <lb/>
            Innumerable miracles were worked by St. Matthew, which <lb/>
            it is impossible to recount in detail. The blind received <lb/>
            sight, paralytics were cured, demoniacs liberated, and even <lb/>
            the dead were raised to life.</p>
          <p>The most Christian king Eglippus departed to the Lord <lb/>
            in extreme old age, and Hyrtacus Adelphus succeeded to <lb/>
            the government. He desired to marry Iphigenia. the <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> a: </note> <pb n="274"/>

            <lb/>
            daughter of the late king, a consecrated virgin who had <lb/>
            received the veil from the apostle's hands, and now presided <lb/>
            over a company of more than two hundred virgins. Hyrta­ <lb/>
            cus, hoping for success in his suit through the apostle's <lb/>
            influence, negociated with him for that purpose: "Take," <lb/>
            said he, " the half of my kingdom, so that I may be united <lb/>
            in marriage with Iphigenia.”Then the blessed Matthew <lb/>
            commanded the king, and Iphigenia, and all the people, to <lb/>
            assemble in the church on Sunday to hear the word of <lb/>
            Almighty God ; which was done accordingly. While strict <lb/>
            silence was observed in the congregation, the apostle dis­ <lb/>
            coursed concerning celibacy, and a fitting matrimony with <lb/>
            its proper results, expatiating on these subjects with wisdom <lb/>
            and eloquence. He showed clearly that indulgence in food <lb/>
            and the conjugal connexion were not sinful, though they <lb/>
            may involve some degree of pollution. " Bodily unclean­ <lb/>
            ness,’ ’he said, " might be purged by alms and good deeds, <lb/>
            while sins could not be washed away but by the tears of <lb/>
            penitence. If any one, after eating carnal food, presumes <lb/>
            on the same day to partake of the spiritual food of'the body <lb/>
            of Christ, he is guilty of a double crime, indecency and <lb/>
            presumption; not because he satisfied his appetite, but <lb/>
            because he aspired to the privileges of the eucharist against <lb/>
            order, and justice, and the laws of God. Thus, homicide <lb/>
            and falsehood, though in themselves sins, may yet appear <lb/>
            justified by their motives. For instance, if any one tells an <lb/>
            untruth to protect an innocent person, and thus shields him <lb/>
            against his enemy; or, if a judge condemns to death one <lb/>
            malefactor, to save the lives of many innocent persons; in <lb/>
            such cases the results are good and profitable. This plainly <lb/>
            appears in the homicides of Goliath and Sisera, of Haman <lb/>
            and Holophernes. Thus also when marriages are contracted, <lb/>
            they are founded on a right principle, if they are engaged <lb/>
            in with justice and sanctity. But if a king's servant should <lb/>
            presume to lift his eyes to his master's betrothed bride, he <lb/>
            would clearly commit not only an offence, but so grievous a <lb/>
            crime, that he would deserve to be cast alive into the flames. <lb/>
            His crime would be, not that he married a wife, but that he <lb/>
            committed injustice against his superior." By this discourse <lb/>
            and others of the like nature, the apostle -St. Matthew dis­ <lb/>
            suaded King Hyrtacus from marrying the consecrated virgin <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            Iphigenia, showing that he would incur the divine wrath if <lb/>
            he presumptuously contracted matrimony with her. This <lb/>
            only roused the king's wrath, and he departed in anger, <lb/>
            while the apostle, full of determination and cheerfulness, <lb/>
            continued his exhortations and prayers. Then he bestowed <lb/>
            his blessing, before all the people, on Iphigenia, who had <lb/>
            thrown herself at his feet, and gave the veil to all the vir­ <lb/>
            gins who were present. The whole congregation having now <lb/>
            received the sacred mysteries, the mass being celebrated, <lb/>
            returned to their homes, but the apostle remained near the <lb/>
            altar where he had just consecrated the Lord's body, and was <lb/>
            praying with uplifted hands when he received his death-blow. <lb/>
            For then a soldier sent by Hyrtacus stabbed the apostle in the <lb/>
            back and thus made him a martyr to Christ. On this being <lb/>
            reported, the populace rushed to the palace with torches, and <lb/>
            it was not without difficulty that the priests and deacons <lb/>
            and other religious persons, by their pious remonstrances, <lb/>
            prevented them from burning the king with all his court; <lb/>
            Meanwhile, Iphigenia gave to the priests and clergy all the <lb/>
            gold, and silver, and jewels she possessed, to enable them to <lb/>
            build a church worthy to be dedicated in honour of the <lb/>
            apostle, and the rest she ordered to be distributed among <lb/>
            the poor. Hyrtacus, on his part, first employed the wives <lb/>
            of his nobles, and afterwards the magicians, to persuade her <lb/>
            to agree to his wishes. At last, when his suit entirely failed, <lb/>
            he caused the building where she dwelt with the other vir­ <lb/>
            gins, serving God day and night, to be surrounded with <lb/>
            flames. But when the fire was raging on all sides, an angel <lb/>
            of the Lord appeared in company with Matthew the apostle, <lb/>
            and comforting the sacred virgins, promised them speedy <lb/>
            deliverance. Accordingly, before long, the Almighty sent a <lb/>
            powerful wind, which swept the conflagration entirely away <lb/>
            from the abode of his servant the virgin, and wrapt in flames <lb/>
            the king's palace, until it was entirely consumed, with all <lb/>
            his wealth. He made his escape, indeed, with great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty, saving his only son; but from that time he never <lb/>
            enjoyed a moments happiness. A powerful demon took <lb/>
            possession of his son, and dragging him rapidly to the tomb <lb/>
            of Matthew the apostle, the devil himself bound his hands <lb/>
            behind him, and forced him to confess his father's crimes. <lb/>
            As for the king, he was attacked by elephantiasis, and fell by <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>

            his own hand, having plunged his sword through his bowels, <lb/>
            and thus expiated the apostle's martyrdom. All the people <lb/>
            insulted his remains, and taking Behor, the brother of Iphi­ <lb/>
            genia, who had been baptized by the apostle, raised him to <lb/>
            the throne. He was twenty-five years old when he began <lb/>
            his reign, which lasted sixty-two years, during which he <lb/>
            maintained a firm peace with the Romans and Persians. All <lb/>
            the provinces of Ethiopia were supplied with churches, and <lb/>
            many wonderful miracles were wrought at the place of the <lb/>
            martyrdom of St. Matthew the apostle. He was the first <lb/>
            who published a gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he <lb/>
            wrote in the Hebrew tongue, and which was discovered on <lb/>
            his own revelation, in the reign of the emperor Zeno.1 Our <lb/>
            holy mother the church observes the festival of his memory <lb/>
            on the eleventh of the calends of October [September 21], <lb/>
            and lifts voice and heart to his honour with a sweet melody:</p>

          <p>Crato, the disciple of these apostles, has given a long <lb/>

            sufferings in Persia, comprising them in ten volumes, which <lb/>
            Africanus the historian translated into Latin. Abdias also, <lb/>
            who was ordained by those apostles bishop of Babylonia, <lb/>

            translated into Greek by his disciple Eutropius, from which <lb/>
            a Latin version was also made by Africanus.1 From these <lb/>
            works I propose to make a short extract for the use of those <lb/>
            who may wish to know the history of their preaching from <lb/>
            the beginning, and by what end they left this world and <lb/>
            departed to the realms above.</p>
          <p>Now the holy apostles Simon and Jude, having gone into <lb/>
            Persia by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, met there the <lb/>
            two magicians, Zaroes and Arphaxath, who had fled from the <lb/>
            presence of St. Matthew the apostle in Ethiopia.2 The doc­ <lb/>
            trine of these men was depraved, and full of deadly <lb/>
            blasphemy against the Lord and his prophets. The apostles <lb/>
            having arrived in Persia, fell in with Warardach, the general <lb/>
            and commander of the king of the Babylonians, whose name <lb/>
            was Xerxes, and who had engaged in war against the <lb/>
            Indians, in consequence of their having invaded his frontier. <lb/>
            On the apostles' arrival, the demons, who delivered false <lb/>
            oracles to those who sacrificed to them, became dumb in all <lb/>
            their temples, whereupon their worshippers resorted to the <lb/>
            temple of a neighbouring city for advice. There the <lb/>
            demons uttered groans, and intimated to those who came to <note type="footnote"> 1 " All the facts here alleged are apocryphal. We have no knowledge <lb/>

            consult them that their own gods could not speak in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Simon and Jude, the apostles of God. Then <lb/>
            Warardach, the general, caused the apostles to be searched <lb/>
            for, and on their being found, inquired who they were, and <lb/>
            whence they came; to which they replied that they were <lb/>
            Hebrews, and were come there on the errand of the salva­ <lb/>
            tion of men. Upon his entreating them to restore the <lb/>
            power of speech to their gods, they poured forth a prayer, <lb/>
            and gave permission. But the fanatics were immediately <lb/>
            led away by the demons, who predicted that a great battle <lb/>
            would ensue, and vast numbers be slain on both sides. The <lb/>
            apostles ridiculed this prediction, while the general was <lb/>
            . greatly alarmed; but at their instance he deferred till the <lb/>
            morrow despatching ambassadors to demand peace. The <lb/>
            heathen priests being incensed against the apostles, and <lb/>
            exclaiming that low persons, in tattered garments, ought not <lb/>
            to be allowed to speak, or be listened to in a city so magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent as Babylon, the general ordered both the apostles and <lb/>
            these outrageous priests to be kept in custody till the <lb/>
            morrow, and by the advice of the former, waited till then <lb/>
            the issue of the affair.</p>
          <p>The day following the word of the apostles was accom­ <lb/>
            plished. The envoys of the general returned, mounted on <lb/>
            swift dromedaries, with the ambassadors of the Indians, and <lb/>
            brought intelligence that all had happened as the apostles <lb/>
            had predicted. In short, the Indians restored the territories <lb/>
            they bad invaded, paved tribute, and concluded a treaty of <lb/>
            lasting peace. The general, finding that the apostles had <lb/>
            told the truth, as the event manifested, was enraged with <lb/>
            the priests, and causing a great fire to be kindled, ordered <lb/>
            them, with their accomplices, to be cast into the flames.</p>
          <p>The apostles, mindful of our Lord's commands, threw <lb/>
            themselves at the general's feet, scattering dust on their <lb/>
            heads, and implored the pardon of their enemies, proclaiming <lb/>
            loudly, to the admiration of all present, that such was the <lb/>
            teaching of the God of the Christians.</p>
          <p>In the end, Warardach ordered the priests to be numbered, <lb/>
            and an account taken of all their possessions, in order that <lb/>
            they might be made over to the apostles. The number of <lb/>
            the priests attached to the temples was found to be a <lb/>
            hundred and twenty, each of whom received from the taxes <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            a pound in gold: but the chief priest received four times as <lb/>
            much as the others. Their wealth in gold, and silver, and <lb/>
            vestments, and cattle was so immense that it could not be <lb/>
            reckoned. All this the general offered to the apostles, but <lb/>
            they utterly rejected the gift, and commanded it to be dis­ <lb/>
            tributed to the poor.</p>
          <p>At length, however, the general, having reported these <lb/>
            proceedings to the king, enlarging on the apostles' merits, <lb/>
            Zaroes and Arphaxad, who were then at court, took occasion <lb/>
            to depreciate them, endeavouring to instigate a persecution <lb/>
            of them, unless they consented to worship their gods. The <lb/>
            general, on his part, defended the apostles; and at length a <lb/>
            disputation was appointed to take place in the king's pre­ <lb/>
            sence. The magicians, having here spoken freely before all <lb/>
            the people, the advocates on the other side were dumb, and <lb/>
            for the space of nearly an hour no one of those who before <lb/>
            were so eloquent and loquacious could utter a word. At <lb/>
            length the magicians permitted them to speak, but they <lb/>
            found themselves unable to walk, and stepping backwards, <lb/>
            could see nothing, though their eyes were open. The spec­ <lb/>
            tators were much astonished at this prodigy, and reverenced <lb/>
            the magicians, more however from fear than love. This <lb/>
            spectacle was exhibited from dawn of day till the sixth hour, <lb/>
            when the advocates returned home in confusion.</p>
          <p>The general related all this to the apostles, who were <lb/>
            much beloved by him, and he assembled in his house the <lb/>
            advocates who bad been thus foiled, presenting them to the <lb/>
            apostles of God, that they might learn how, in obedience to <lb/>
            their instructions, they could triumph over the magicians. <lb/>
            The advocates, seeing before them men in mean attire, were <lb/>
            disposed to hold them in contempt; but Simon checked <lb/>
            their insolence by his shrewd remarks. He reminded them <lb/>
            distinctly that articles of little worth were often inclosed in <lb/>
            coffers of gold, enriched with diamonds; while precious jewels <lb/>
            were deposited in common boxes of wood; and that splendid <lb/>
            vases were filled with vinegar, while rich wines were stored <lb/>
            in vessels presenting externally a foul aspect. Thus a mean <lb/>
            exterior not unfrequently conceals the eminent virtues of <lb/>
            persons, who by their merits are especially pleasing to the <lb/>
            supreme Creator.</p>
          <p>Then the holy apostles gave salutary counsel to the advo­ <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XI.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            cates, and commended him to God by prayers, signing them <lb/>
            on their foreheads with the sign of the cross. Upon this, <lb/>
            Zebedee and the other advocates, coming before the king, <lb/>
            began to deride the magicians, who found no means of <lb/>
            harming them. At length, in their rage, they brought in a <lb/>
            number of serpents, to the great alarm of all the spectators. <lb/>
            The king immediately summoned the apostles, who on their <lb/>
            arrival filled their mantles with the serpents, and hurled <lb/>
            them boldly against the magicians. The serpents instantly <lb/>
            began to gnaw their flesh, till they howled like wolves, to <lb/>
            the great joy of all who witnessed the tortures of those <lb/>
            impious men. The king and all the people said to the <lb/>
            apostles, " Let them die." But they answered: “ We are <lb/>
            sent to bring back from death to life, not to cast down from <lb/>
            life to death." Then they prayed, and commanded the ser­ <lb/>
            pents to withdraw their venom from the magicians, and <lb/>
            depart to their own place. But the magicians suffered still <lb/>
            greater tortures when the serpents again gnawed their flesh <lb/>
            and sucked their blood to eradicate the venom. When the <lb/>
            serpents were departed, and the afflicted magicians, by the <lb/>
            apostles' advice, had neither eat, nor drunk, nor slept, for <lb/>
            three days, the apostles came to visit them, and instead of <lb/>
            returning evil for evil, healed their wounds. But the magi­ <lb/>
            cians still persisted in their malice, and as they had fled <lb/>
            from the presence of St. Matthew the apostle, in Ethiopia, <lb/>
            so they now retreated, covered with confusion, before the <lb/>
            two apostles, and raised against them the fury of the idola­ <lb/>
            ters through the whole of Persia. They went about <lb/>
            offering sacrifices in all the temples, and by their incanta­ <lb/>
            tions caused men to be suddenly motionless, and then free <lb/>
            to move; suddenly blind, and again restored to sight; now <lb/>
            deaf, and then able to hear. Thus they imposed on those <lb/>
            who sacrificed to idols, and were like themselves.</p>
          <p>At the entreaty of the king and his general, the apostles <lb/>
            continued in Babylonia, working great wonders in the name <lb/>
            of the Lord, making the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the <lb/>
            blind to see, and cleansing the lepers, and driving the <lb/>
            demons out of the bodies they had taken possession of. In <lb/>
            consequence they made many disciples, out of whom they <lb/>
            ordained priests, and deacons, and clergy, in the churches.</p>
          <p>The daughter of a very opulent satrap, who had been <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            seduced, was in great danger during childbirth, and the <lb/>
            deacon Eustosinus was consequently accused of having <lb/>
            debauched her. The apostles, hearing of this, required the <lb/>
            parents of the girl and the deacon to appear before them, <lb/>
            and had the infant also brought, which was born the same <lb/>
            day, at the first hour. Having commanded the infant to <lb/>
            speak, it said in a very clear voice: "This deacon is a chaste <lb/>
            and holy man; he has never polluted his flesh." The <lb/>
            parents insisted on learning who was the father of the child, <lb/>
            but the apostles replied: "It is our duty to absolve the <lb/>
            innocent, but not to make known the guilty."</p>
          <p>Nicharon, the king's friend, while engaging in warlike <lb/>
            exercises, was shot by an arrow in the knee, which could <lb/>
            not by any means be drawn out of the bone. Then the <lb/>
            blessed Simon invoked the Lord Jesus, and applying his <lb/>
            band, immediately drew out the arrow, and the man was <lb/>
            instantly healed, so that not even a sign of the wound <lb/>
            appeared.</p>
          <p>Two most ferocious tigresses, having escaped from their <lb/>
            dens, devoured all that came in their way. Then the people <lb/>
            fled to the apostles of God, who invoked the name of the <lb/>
            Lord Jesus, upon which the savage animals, which never <lb/>
            could be tamed, became gentle as lambs. During the day <lb/>
            they remained like sheep among the people, and returning <lb/>
            in the evening to the apostles' cell, became its guardians <lb/>
            when the apostles visited other cities. From hence they <lb/>
            took occasion mildly to instruct the people, pointing out <lb/>
            what men gifted with reason ought to do, and how they <lb/>
            ought to obey God, by the example of the brute animals <lb/>
            thus exhibited to their observation.</p>
          <p>At the entreaty of the king and the people the apostles <lb/>
            abode at Babylon one year and three months, during which <lb/>
            period more than sixty thousand men, besides women and <lb/>
            children, were baptized, the king and all his courtiers being <lb/>
            the first to receive the faith. For they saw that by a word <lb/>
            the sick were cured, the blind received sight, and the dead <lb/>
            were raised. Abdias, who had accompanied the apostles <lb/>
            from Judea, and had himself seen the Lord Jesus with his <lb/>
            own eyes, was ordained bishop, and the city [of Babylon] <lb/>
            was full of churches. All which being duly regulated, the <lb/>
            apostles departed, followed by crowds of disciples, to the <pb n="282"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XI.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            number of two hundred and upwards, and they went <lb/>
            through the twelve provinces of Persia and the cities thereof.</p>
          <p>It is now time that the passion of the holy apostles <lb/>
            should be related. The magicians Zaroes and Arphaxad, <lb/>
            of whom mention has been already made, committed abomi­ <lb/>
            nations throughout the country, pretending to be of the <lb/>
            race of the gods, but always fleeing from the face of the <lb/>
            apostles. They only remained in any city until such time <lb/>
            as they understood the apostles were at hand. There were <lb/>
            seventy priests of the idol temples in Sanir, who received <lb/>
            from the king a pound in gold each, four times a year, when <lb/>
            they celebrated the feast of the sun, that is to say, at the <lb/>
            beginning of spring and summer, autumn and winter. The <lb/>
            before-named magicians raised all the opposition in their <lb/>
            power against the apostles, and by preceding them had it in <lb/>
            their power effectually to do so.</p>
          <p>The holy apostles, having passed through all the <lb/>
            provinces, took up their abode at Sanir in the house of <lb/>
            Sennes their disciple. But on a sudden, about the first <lb/>
            hour of the morning, the priests rushed in a body to the <lb/>
            house of Sennes, shouting terribly that the enemies of their <lb/>
            gods should be given up. In short, they seized the holy <lb/>
            apostles, and dragged them to the temple of the sun. On <lb/>
            their entering the temple, the demons cried out through <lb/>
            some who were possessed: " What have we to do with you, <lb/>
            O apostles of the living God! since your entrance here the <lb/>
            flames consume us." In a chapel of the temple towards <lb/>
            the east there was a chariot of gold drawn by four horses, in <lb/>
            which was the statue of the sun encircled by rays also <lb/>
            wrought in gold. In another chapel the image of the moon <lb/>
            was wrought in silver, having a car drawn by a yoke of <lb/>
            oxen, all in the same metal. While the priests and ma­ <lb/>
            gicians, with the people, were urging the apostles to worship <lb/>
            the idols, they were conversing together in the Hebrew <lb/>
            tongue on a vision of the Lord, whom they beheld calling <lb/>
            them into the midst of the host of angels. The angel of <lb/>
            the Lord also appeared to them, and comforted them. Then, <lb/>
            procuring silence, they addressed the people, pointing out <lb/>
            to them in a reasonable manner their error of idly wasting <lb/>
            on the creature the worship which is due to God only; and <lb/>
            that it was injurious to him to enclose in buildings made <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            with hands the sun and the moon which he had created <lb/>
            from the beginning, and set in the heavens to give light <lb/>
            through all generations. While all were in amazement, <lb/>
            Simon commanded the demon to break in pieces the image <lb/>
            of the sun and his chariot; Jude also, in like manner, com­ <lb/>
            manded the image of the moon to be broken. Then two <lb/>
            Ethiopians, with their black skins and naked bodies, and <lb/>
            horrible features, were seen by all the people to come forth, <lb/>
            and while crushing the images uttered hoarse and lamentable <lb/>
            cries. Meanwhile the infuriated priests rushed on the <lb/>
            apostles, and slew them while they were rejoicing and giving <lb/>
            thanks to God. Sennes, their host, also suffered with them, <lb/>
            because he refused to sacrifice to the idols. At that very <lb/>
            time, when the heavens were perfectly serene, they shot <lb/>
            forth bright flashes of lightning, which rent the temple into <lb/>
            three parts from the highest pinnacle of the roof to the <lb/>
            lowest foundation. Zaroes and Arphaxad were struck by <lb/>
            the lightning and burnt to ashes.</p>
          <p>Three months afterwards King Xerxes confiscated the <lb/>
            property of the priests, and translated the bodies of the <lb/>
            apostles with great pomp to his own city, in which he <lb/>
            erected an octangular church, each of the angles containing <lb/>
            eighty feet, so that its circuit embraced eight times eighty <lb/>
            feet, the height being one hundred and twenty. It was <lb/>
            built entirely of hewn blocks of marble, squared and faced, <lb/>
            and the chapels were panneled with gilt plates. In the <lb/>
            centre of the octagon was placed a sarcophagus of pure <lb/>
            silver. Four years of incessant labour were employed in <lb/>
            the erection, and it was completed on the birth-day of the <lb/>
            two apostles ; that is to say, the fifth of the calends of <lb/>
            November [28th October], and worthy to be dedicated to <lb/>
            the honour of the saints.1 The faithful who venerate their <lb/>
            martyrdom, which they suffered even unto death for the <note type="footnote"> 1 This is another of the legends borrowed from the fictitious Abdias. <lb/>
            Nothing certain is known respecting the preaching and death of these two <lb/>
            apostles. Others have made St. Simon the Cananite journey in Lybia, <lb/>
            and even as far as England. As for St. Jude, cousin of oiu Lord, and <lb/>
            brother of St. James the Less, some made him exercise his apostleship in <lb/>
            Lybia, others in Persia. What appears more decided, is that he was <lb/>
            married and left children. According to Eusebius, two of his grandsons, <lb/>
            brought before Domitian as descendants of David, were sent home by that <lb/>
            prince, and lived till the time of Trajan. </note> <pb n="284"/>

          <p>JUDAS, Simon Iscariot, was of the tribe of Issachar, and <lb/>
            counted in the number of the twelve apostles. But in­ <lb/>
            flamed with a fatal covetousness, having sold his master and <lb/>

            the church, men who assume a sacred title without acting <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Jude is often confounded with Thaddeus, one of the seventy-two <lb/>
            disciples who were supposed to have been sent to Edessa by St. Thomas. <lb/>
            He is one of the apostles mentioned by St. Paul as having women in his <lb/>
            company, which was very natural, as he was a married man. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some particulars respecting St. Matthias are to be found in the col­ <lb/>

            century, by a monk of Treves. This apostle seems to have confined himself <lb/>
            to Palestine. </note> <lb/>

            worthily of it. Unworthy as he was, Judas had worthy and <lb/>
            mystical names by which false Christians are typified in the <lb/>
            church. For instance, Judas means confessing; by which <lb/>
            name those are signified, who, as the apostle says, " profess <lb/>
            that they know God, but deny him by their works.” More­ <lb/>
            over, Simon means obedient, by which word are signified <lb/>
            hypocrites and deceivers, and those who obey falsely, not <lb/>
            doing the will of God from love of him and desire of heaven, <lb/>
            but speciously following the traditions of their elders, for <lb/>
            vainglory and the applause of men. Many among them are <lb/>
            blinded by their covetousness, like Judas Iscariot, and quit­ <lb/>
            ting the pursuits and the companionship of good men, fall <lb/>
            readily into detestable crimes and become indissolubly <lb/>
            entangled in the snares of sin, enjoying a transitory reward <lb/>
            in the present life, and receiving some recompense for a <lb/>
            certain propriety and exterior decency of conduct, they are <lb/>
            elated with vanity; but in the future life they will wail, <lb/>
            inextricably chained, in the loathsome dungeons of hell, and <lb/>
            tormented for the sins they have committed with indescriba­ <lb/>
            ble forms of punishment, without any hope of forgiveness.</p>
          <p>The traitor Judas having withdrawn from the company <lb/>
            of the apostles, what did those merit who remained faithful <lb/>
            to the Lord Jesus ? Unspeakable honour and eternal <lb/>
            blessedness. Holy mother church holds, and every true <lb/>
            Catholic faithfully believes, that the twelve apostles are <lb/>
            truly blessed and exalted and partakers of everlasting <lb/>
            felicity. The salt of the earth and the light of the world, <lb/>
            the twelve hours of the eternal day, the fruitful branches of <lb/>
            the true vine, the fellow labourers with Christ, and fellow <lb/>
            heirs of his heavenly kingdom, their memories are every <lb/>
            where cherished in the hearts of the faithful, and who are <lb/>
            honoured by all nations who profess the true faith, and de­ <lb/>
            voutly reckoned the teachers of the people and rulers of the <lb/>
            churches, as being appointed by Christ judges of the world, <lb/>
            strict censors of the reprobate, but kind helpers of the <lb/>
            devout, and their constant intercessors. For, holding all <lb/>
            worldly things in contempt, they indissolubly attached <lb/>
            themselves to Christ who is the true vine and life eternal. <lb/>
            And now they reign in heaven with the King of kings, <lb/>
            joining with the angels in praising him for ever, and sitting <lb/>
            on twelve thrones, judge, with the Lord, the twelve tribes <pb n="286"/>

          </ab>
          <p>I PURPOSE now to treat of the companions and successors <lb/>
            of the apostles, and by God's help will give a faithful ac­ <lb/>
            count of some of them in my present work. I enter upon <lb/>
            this undertaking from no vain fancy that they need my <lb/>
            commendation, of whom God himself is the praise, who <lb/>
            reigns Triune through all eternity, and blesses his saints <lb/>
            with everlasting rewards in his own presence; but my <lb/>
            work is intended to exhibit my devotion to these blessed <lb/>
            saints, and to obtain their favour, in order that I may piously <lb/>
            obtain my own salvation through their intercession.</p>
          <p>Joseph, surnamed Barnabas, that is to say, the son of <lb/>
            consolation, and a native of the city of Cyprus, founded by <lb/>
            Cyrus king of Persia, was joined with Paul in his mission <lb/>
            to the gentiles the third year after our Lord's passion.1 He <lb/>
            was one of the seventy-two disciples of our Lord, and taking <lb/>
            part with the apostles both in their joys and tribulations, <lb/>
            ministered, as his name implies, the utmost consolation to <lb/>
            the faithful.</p>
          <p>In the first place, he sold the land he possessed and laid <lb/>
            the price of it at the apostles' feet. He gave the hand of <lb/>
            fellowship to Paul after his conversion, introducing him to <lb/>
            the apostles by whom he was as yet unknown and suspected, <lb/>
            and relating the account of his call to those who were igno­ <lb/>
            rant of it. He was sent by the apostles to Antioch, where <lb/>
            he rejoiced at seeing the grace of God manifested in the <lb/>
            disciples, and by his preaching a great multitude was con­ <lb/>
            verted to the Lord. Thence he went to Tarsus to find Saul, <lb/>
            and having found him brought him to Antioch, where both <lb/>
            sojourned a whole year and taught much people : there the <lb/>
            disciples were first called Christians.2</p>
          <p>Barnabus and Saul, being compassionate and benevolent, <lb/>
            brought the alms of the gentile believers to the brethren in <lb/>
            Judea. On their return from Jerusalem, after accomplish­ <lb/>
            ing this mission, they joined John whose surname was <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts iv. 36.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Acts xi. 29, 30; xii. 25; xiii. 1—48. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            Mark, and continued at Antioch among the prophets and <lb/>
            doctors. And as these were ministering to the Lord and <lb/>
            fasting, the Holy Ghost said unto them: " Separate me <lb/>
            Saul and Barnabas for the work whereunto I have called <lb/>
            them." And being sent forth by the Holy Ghost they <lb/>
            came to Seleucia, and then sailed to Cyprus. Afterwards <lb/>
            they struck Barjesus, the magician, who was also called Ely­ <lb/>
            mas, with blindness for a time, converted Sergius Paulus <lb/>
            the proconsul to the true faith, and brought great multi­ <lb/>
            tudes to the light of truth.1</p>
          <p>While, therefore, the elect walked in the way of faith and <lb/>
            righteousness, the reprobates, inflamed with rage, made a <lb/>
            tumult and drove the apostles out of their neighbourhood. <lb/>
            But they, rejoicing and filled with the Holy Ghost, preached <lb/>
            the word of God, and converted to the Lord great multi­ <lb/>
            tudes of Jews and Greeks.2</p>
          <p>Coming to Lystra they healed one who was lame from his <lb/>
            mother's womb ; on seeing which miracle the people took <lb/>
            them for gods, saying: " The gods are come down unto us <lb/>
            in the likeness of men." And they called Barnabas Jupiter, <lb/>
            and Paul Mercury. And the priest of Jupiter who was <lb/>
            near the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and <lb/>
            would have sacrificed with the people. But the apostles, <lb/>
            in horror of such an abomination, drove them away, and <lb/>
            rending their clothes ran among the people exclaiming <lb/>
            against it with much reasonable discourse, which with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty persuaded the crowd from sacrificing to them.3</p>
          <p>After this they came to Derbe, preaching the gospel there, <lb/>
            teaching many, and giving them instruction in virtue. And <lb/>
            passing through several provinces in which they made known <lb/>
            the word of God, at length they arrived at Jerusalem, and <lb/>
            being received by the holy apostles told what wonderful <lb/>
            things God had wrought by their means. At that time <lb/>
            some evil disposed persons raised questions respecting the <lb/>
            necessity of circumcision. Upon this the apostles took <lb/>
            counsel and sent Paul and Barnabas to Antioch to allay the <lb/>
            dissensions, who, coming there armed with an apostolic <lb/>
            epistle, succeeded by their preaching in exterminating the <lb/>
            impious heresy.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xi. 29, 30; xii. 25; xiii. 1—48.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Acts xiii. 49—52. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Acts xiv. 6—17.</note> <note type="footnote">Acts xiv. 6; xv. 1—21. </note> <pb n="288"/>

            <lb/>
            Like true pastors, they published the word of God, taught <lb/>
            the ignorant, healed the sick, and anxiously devoted them­ <lb/>
            selves to promote religion in every way. They therefore <lb/>
            frequently visited the churches in which they set forth the <lb/>
            true faith, using every precaution lest the neophytes should <lb/>
            fall into heresy. For they knew how crafty were the wiles <lb/>
            of Satan, and watched against the hearts of the regenerate be­ <lb/>
            coming foul with the deadly seed of the tares. Afterwards, <lb/>
            as Luke the evangelist relates, it seemed expedient that <lb/>
            Paul should return to Jerusalem, and Barnabas to Cyprus <lb/>
            his native city, having John, surnamed Mark, as his co­ <lb/>
            adjutor in the ministry. He had been a gentile, and, with <lb/>
            his companion Orduon, was in the service of Cyril, the <lb/>
            high priest of the execrable Jupiter, but was baptized by <lb/>
            Paul and Barnabas at a place called Iconium, and afterwards <lb/>
            faithfully accompanied them in their journeyings.</p>
          <p>At length, while the apostles just named were preaching <lb/>
            in Pamphilia, and many, both Jews and gentiles, believed in <lb/>
            the Lord, it was revealed to Paul by the vision of an angel <lb/>
            in the night that he should quickly go to Jerusalem, and <lb/>
            permit Barnabas to return to Cyprus. Having made known <lb/>
            the vision, they prayed on bended knees, and kissing each <lb/>
            other, bade farewell with many tears, and separated in the <lb/>
            body, never again saw each other in this life.1</p>
          <p>Barnabas and John now visited Laodicea and came to a <lb/>
            city called Anemoria,2 where certain prudent and well­ <lb/>
            disposed gentiles, having heard Christ preached, believed, <lb/>
            and being baptized, received the grace of the Holy Ghost. <lb/>
            They then sailed to Cyprus, where they found Timon and <lb/>
            Aristion, servants of the Lord. Timon was suffering from <lb/>
            a burning fever, but Barnabas having laid his hands on him, <lb/>
            with the holy gospel, invoking the name of our Lord Jesus, <lb/>
            the fever immediately left him, and his strength was so re­ <lb/>
            stored that he followed with joy the Lord's saints.</p>
          <p>By the instructions of the apostles, St. Barnabas always <note type="footnote"> 1 Acts xv. 2, 38, 39. It was not to return to Jerusalem that St. Paul <lb/>
            finally separated from St. Barnabas; and their parting does not appear to <lb/>
            have been so friendly as our author describes it. The sacred writer says, <lb/>
            " The contention was so sharp between them, that they parted asunder one <lb/>
            from the other." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pliny calls this place Anemurium. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            carried with him the gospel of St. Matthew the apostle, and, <lb/>
            wherever he found sick persons, laid it upon them, and they <lb/>
            were immediately healed of whatever disease they laboured <lb/>
            under. Barnabas also ordained Heraclius, who had been <lb/>
            baptized by the apostle Paul, bishop, for the teaching of the <lb/>
            faithful. Afterwards when Barnabas wished to gain admis­ <lb/>
            sion to Paphos, Barjesus, the Jewish sorcerer, whom Paul <lb/>
            had struck blind for a time, recognized the apostle, and <lb/>
            opposing him to the utmost of his power, forbade his entering <lb/>
            Paphos. The holy man, however, came. to a certain place <lb/>
            where he saw the heathens, both men and women, running <lb/>
            naked in public games. His indignation being roused he <lb/>
            cursed the temple; and immediately part of it fell down, <lb/>
            from the foundation upwards, and many of the heathens <lb/>
            were crushed and perished in the ruins, but those who <lb/>
            escaped took refuge in the temple of Apollo. The illustrious <lb/>
            champion of Christ now entered the city of Salamis, and <lb/>
            finding there a synagogue of Jews, he constantly preached <lb/>
            the gospel to them and converted many of the Jews to the <lb/>
            faith of Christ. Upon finding this, Barjesus displayed all <lb/>
            the malice of which he was capable, and raised a tumult <lb/>
            against the holy apostles of God. The Jews were willing to <lb/>
            arrest Barnabas and deliver him to the consul of Salamis, <lb/>
            having first subjected him to much suffering and various <lb/>
            kinds of tortures. At length, as they were dragging him to <lb/>
            judgment, bruised and shaken with their ill-usage, they <lb/>
            found that Eusebius, an illustrious and powerful man, and a <lb/>
            relation of the emperor's, had landed in the island, and <lb/>
            fearing that he would snatch their victim out of their hands, <lb/>
            they fastened a rope round his neck and dragged him lace­ <lb/>
            rated from the synagogue to the Hippodrome, and from <lb/>
            thence outside the gate. There they made a fire round <lb/>
            him and cruelly burnt him. Thus the blessed apostle, after <lb/>
            many sufferings and long conflicts, was burnt for the love of <lb/>
            Christ, and departed to everlasting joys. The impious <lb/>
            Jews, not content with his death, collected his remains, and <lb/>
            enclosing them in a leaden coffer, intended to throw it into <lb/>
            the sea; but John Mark, with Timon and Radon, carried <lb/>
            off the holy body by night and deposited it in the crypt <lb/>
            which had been formerly the habitation of the Jebuseans on <lb/>

          <p>MARK, the evangelist, was both the disciple and the scribe <lb/>
            of St. Peter the apostle, whose son he was in baptism, and <lb/>
            from whose dictation he wrote his gospel of our Lord Jesus <lb/>
            Christ. It is reported of him that he caused his thumb to <lb/>
            be cut off that he might be disqualified for the priesthood, <lb/>
            but was so far from being rejected by the apostles on that <lb/>
            account that they elected him bishop of Alexandria. When <lb/>
            St. Peter was at Rome, he called upon him to preach the <lb/>
            gospel to the Gentiles in Italy. “ Why,” he said, " do you <lb/>
            remain inactive with us ? you are fully informed of all that <lb/>
            Jesus of Nazareth did; arise and go to Aquileia, and there <lb/>
            propagate among the people the doctrines of the true <lb/>
            religion." Mark, having his province for preaching thus <lb/>
            allotted, and receiving the episcopal staff, took the road <lb/>
            assigned to him and arrived at Aquileia, which is the first <lb/>
            of the cities of Italy. He found there a young man afflicted <lb/>
            with leprosy, whose name was Ataulfus, son of Ulfinus, <lb/>
            the first and most illustrious of the citizens; and having <lb/>
            spoken with him, took him by the hand and arm, and im­ <lb/>
            mediately the hand and arm were cleansed of the leprosy. <lb/>
            Perceiving this, the youth ran to his father, and told him <note type="footnote"> 1 This history of St. Barnabas is compiled, with some slight variations, <lb/>
            from his Acts, alleged to have been written by his disciple John Mark. <lb/>

            with joy what Mark had done to him. Upon this, Ulfinus <lb/>
            hastening to the apostle, with a great crowd, found him <lb/>
            sitting at the eastern gate, and implored him with eager­ <lb/>
            ness to heal his son. Upon its being promised, if he be­ <lb/>
            lieved, he declared his belief in the Lord Jesus; whereupon <lb/>
            Mark baptized the young man, and he was entirely freed <lb/>
            from the leprosy. After this cure Ulfinus also, with all his <lb/>
            household, was baptized, and a multitude of the people <lb/>
            besides, on the same day. After some years, Mark, desiring <lb/>
            to see Peter, proposed to withdraw privately and go to <lb/>
            Rome; but the people, discovering his design, assembled <lb/>
            round him in great numbers at the dawn of day, and en­ <lb/>
            treated him with shouts to appoint them a pastor. Then <lb/>
            Hermagoras, being elected by the people, was taken by St. <lb/>
            Mark with him to Rome. There he was ordained by St. <lb/>
            Peter the apostle, first bishop of the Italian province, and <lb/>
            after many miracles which God wrought by him among the <lb/>
            people, be was martyred, with Fortunatus his arch-deacon, <lb/>
            in the reign of the emperor Nero, under Sebastus the <lb/>
            prefect, on the third of the ides [13th] of July.1</p>
          <p>As for the blessed St. Mark, he undertook the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the church of Alexandria by the command of St. <lb/>
            Peter the apostle, being the first who preached the gospel <lb/>
            of Christ in the land of Egypt. He also proclaimed the <lb/>
            true religion in Marmorica and Ammonian Libya, or the <lb/>
            Pentapolis; the inhabitants of this country being uncir­ <lb/>
            cumcised idolaters, in the practice of all uncleanness. When <lb/>
            therefore Mark arrived at Cyrene in the Pentapolis, and <lb/>
            found the natives immersed in execrable wickedness, begin­ <lb/>
            ning with a discourse on divine things, he healed the sick <lb/>
            in the name of the Lord, cleansing lepers, and expelling <lb/>
            many evil spirits by his word alone. Numbers who wit­ <lb/>
            nessed these miracles believed, and destroying their idols, <lb/>
            and cutting down their sacred groves, were baptized in <lb/>
            the name of the Triune God.</p>
          <p>After this, it was commanded him by a revelation of the <lb/>
            Holy Spirit that he should go to Alexandria.2 Mark there- <note type="footnote"> 1 The legend, which is evidently apocryphal, of this pretended patriarch <lb/>

            had been revealed; and they accompanied him to the ship, <lb/>
            and having broken bread together they parted from him, <lb/>
            saying: " Jesus Christ prosper you in your journey." He <lb/>
            reached Alexandria on the seventh day, and disembarking <lb/>
            from the ship hastened to the city, when, as he was en­ <lb/>
            tering it, his sandal burst. "Truly," he said, “my journey <lb/>
            is now at an end."</p>
          <p>The holy man gave his sandal to a certain cobbler named <lb/>
            Aniarius, to be mended; who, while at work upon it, <lb/>
            sharply punctured his hand, exclaiming at the same time: <lb/>
            " There is but one God." The blessed Mark hearing this <lb/>
            said, inwardly rejoicing: “ The Lord has prospered my <lb/>
            journey;" and spitting on his right hand he anointed the <lb/>
            man's hand, saying, " May this hand be healed in the name <lb/>
            of Jesus Christ the Son of the living God," and it was <lb/>
            instantly healed. The cobbler, struck by the presence of <lb/>
            such a man and the efficacy of his words, as well as by the <lb/>
            modesty of his appearance, requested him to honour his <lb/>
            house by eating bread with him. Mark entering with joy, <lb/>
            pronounced a blessing, with prayer, and made known the <lb/>
            tidings of the gospel to all who heard him, declaring that <lb/>
            the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. He <lb/>
            subsequently added to his instructions signs and wonders <lb/>
            in the name of the Lord, and Aniarius, being baptized with <lb/>
            his whole household and many of his neighbours, became <lb/>
            the assistant of his teacher in preaching the truth.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the idolaters of Alexandria, perceiving that <lb/>
            the Galilæan preacher was destroying their worship and <lb/>
            ceremonies, sought to put him to death and laid many <lb/>
            snares for him. But the blessed Mark, who knew their <lb/>
            designs, ordained Aniarius bishop, and three priests, Me­ <lb/>
            lirius, Paberius, and Cerdon, with seven deacons, and eleven <lb/>
            others with functions in the service of the church. After <lb/>
            that he went into the Pentapolis, and dwelt there two years, <lb/>
            comforting the brethren who were already believers, and <lb/>
            ordaining bishops and clergy in those parts. Returning <lb/>
            to Alexandria he found the brethren increased in faith and <lb/>
            grace. Seeing also a church built by them at a place called <note type="footnote"> for pharum, a pharos, or beacon. The French translator renders it <lb/>
            temple d'Alexandrie, supposing phanum to be a corruption of fanum. </note> <lb/>

            work by his exhortations and prayers.</p>
          <p>In the fulness of time, when the Christians were multi­ <lb/>
            plied, and the images of the idols overthrown, the heathen <lb/>
            learned the return of the holy apostle, and were filled with <lb/>
            rage at the miracles which they found him perform. For <lb/>
            he healed the sick, preached to the unbelievers, and made <lb/>
            the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. But though they <lb/>
            determined to arrest him, they were not able to find him; <lb/>
            so that they gnashed their teeth in their idolatrous cere­ <lb/>
            monies, and exclaimed in their orgies: " Great is the power <lb/>
            of this magician.” At length on Easter Sunday, that is the <lb/>
            eighth of the calends of May [24th April], at the time <lb/>
            when the feast of Serapis was celebrated, their spies dis­ <lb/>
            covered the apostle consecrating the most holy offering to <lb/>
            the Divine Majesty. These impious men immediately seized <lb/>
            the servant of God, and putting a rope round his neck, <lb/>
            dragged him cruelly over the stones, so that they were <lb/>
            sprinkled with his blood, and the soil stained with his torn <lb/>
            flesh. But while they were shouting with fury: " Let us <lb/>
            drag this buffalo to the bull-ring," St. Mark offered praises <lb/>
            to God, saying: " 0 Lord Jesus Christ, I give thee thanks <lb/>
            that thou hast thought me worthy thus to suffer for thy <lb/>
            name.”</p>
          <p>Night approaching, the idolaters threw him into prison, <lb/>
            while they consulted by what death he should be de­ <lb/>
            spatched. But at midnight, when the doors were close shut <lb/>
            and the keepers were slumbering before the gates, behold <lb/>
            there was a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord <lb/>
            descended from heaven and touching him, said: " Mark, <lb/>
            the servant of God, the first and chief publisher of his holy <lb/>
            laws throughout Egypt, lo, thy name is written in the book <lb/>
            of life, and thy memorial shall be preserved through all <lb/>
            ages. Thou art admitted into the fellowship of the hosts <lb/>
            above; in the heavens they shall receive thy spirit, and thy <lb/>
            rest shall know no end." On hearing this the blessed <lb/>
            Mark, stretching out his hands to heaven said: " I give <lb/>
            thee thanks, 0 Lord Jesus Christ, that thou hast not de­ <lb/>
            serted me, but hast remembered me among thy saints. <pb n="294"/>

            Receive, I beseech thee, 0 Lord Jesus Christ, my soul in <lb/>
            peace, and suffer me not to be longer separated from thee." <lb/>
            When he had said this, the Lord Jesus came to him in the <lb/>
            form, and clothed, as he bad dwelt with his disciples before <lb/>
            his passion, saying to him : " Peace be with thee, Mark, my <lb/>
            evangelist." Mark replied: Thanks be unto thee, O <lb/>
            Lord." And in the morning the whole populace of the <lb/>
            city assembled, and again putting the rope round his neck <lb/>
            dragged him away, saying: " Take this buffalo to the bull- <lb/>
            ring." And as he went along, he gave thanks to God, say­ <lb/>
            ing : " Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my spirit;" and <lb/>
            so saying, be gave up the ghost. An immense crowd of the <lb/>
            heathen now lighted a fire in the place which is called, “ Of <lb/>
            the Angels;” resolving to burn the sacred remains. But, <lb/>
            by God's providence, a violent tempest arose, with a strong <lb/>
            wind, and the sun's face was hidden, and there was loud <lb/>
            thunder. Heavy rain also fell from morning to night, so <lb/>
            that many houses were washed away and numbers perished. <lb/>
            The guards, in terror, abandoned the body of the saint and <lb/>
            fled; and some said, mocking, that Serapis raised the storm <lb/>
            on his feast-day in hatred of his enemy.</p>
          <p>Devout men then came and took the body and buried it <lb/>
            with honour in a tomb of hewn stone on the seventh of the <lb/>
            calends of May [25th April]. Thus St. Mark the evangelist, <lb/>
            the first bishop of Alexandria, suffered martyrdom for Christ, <lb/>
            and his body was buried on the eastern side of the city. <lb/>
            After a long course of years, when Alexandria was threatened <lb/>
            with the incursions of the infidels, who overran all the east <lb/>
            like locusts, and subdued the greatest part of the world both <lb/>
            to the north and the south, the faithful Christians translated <lb/>
            the apostle's remains to Aquileia where St. Mark first propa­ <lb/>
            gated the faith of Christ.1 The bishop of Aquileia therefore <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ST. LUKE the evangelist, a native of Syria, who practised the <lb/>
            art of medicine at Antioch with great skill, became a disciple <lb/>
            of the apostles of Christ, and following St. Paul even to his <lb/>
            martyrdom, remained constant in unblemished celibacy, <lb/>
            serving the Lord. By divine inspiration, he wrote his <lb/>
            gospel in the parts of Achaia, setting forth to the believing <lb/>
            Greeks our Lord's incarnation in a faithful narrative, and <lb/>
            showing how be was descended from the stock of David. <lb/>
            He afterwards published a special book for the purpose of <lb/>
            clearly recording the acts of the Apostles, and the first <lb/>
            beginning of the infant church. These two books Luke <lb/>
            dedicated to Theophilus, that, is one who loves God, and <lb/>
            published them for all who, under the inspiration of the <lb/>
            holy Ghost, are inflamed by a double charity. In his first <lb/>
            book he has described the true priesthood of Christ, in which <lb/>
            the Lamb of God has expiated the sin of the world by shed­ <lb/>
            ding his own precious blood. In the second, he has unfolded <lb/>
            the majesty of the ineffable Deity, to which the Son of God <lb/>
            has ascended at the right hand of the Father in human flesh, <lb/>
            and related the descent of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, on <lb/>
            the apostles in tongues of fire, through which the primitive <lb/>
            church shone with so glorious a light. In these two books of <lb/>
            Luke the spiritual physician, is found the true medicine by <lb/>
            which the deadly diseases of sin are expelled, and the remedy <lb/>
            of justification unto life is provided for all who religiously <note type="footnote"> 1 Every one knows that the republic of Venice claimed to be under the <lb/>

            blessed Martial of Limoges, whose extraordinary virtues have <lb/>
            raised him to the highest rank of saints after the apostles. <lb/>
            Aurelian, whom he restored from death in the name of the <lb/>

            extracts, invoking the Holy Spirit to vouchsafe his aid to <lb/>
            my undertaking.</p>
          <p>While our Lord Jesus Christ was preaching in Judea, <lb/>
            and great crowds of the Jews flocked around him, furnishing <lb/>
            him with things necessary for his human wants, and learning <lb/>
            the way of salvation by attentively listening to his instructions, <lb/>
            one of the noblest of the Jews of the tribe of Benjamin, <lb/>
            whose name was Marcellus, came to him, bringing with him <lb/>
            his wife Elizabeth, and his only son Martial, who was then <lb/>
            fifteen years of age. Beholding his marvellous works, and <lb/>
            the saving doctrines he preached, they believed in Christ <lb/>
            with contrite hearts, and at his command were baptized by <lb/>
            the blessed apostle St. Peter. When all the others returned <note type="footnote"> 1 It is the commonly received opinion that St. Luke wrote his gospel <lb/>
            while he was in Greece, about A.D. 53. He did not die in Bithynia as here <lb/>
            stated, but in Achaia, probably at Patras, at a very advanced age. The <lb/>

            to their own homes, Martial devoted himself entirely to the <lb/>
            Lord Jesus, and became one of his constant disciples. In <lb/>
            so doing, he closely attached himself to the apostle Peter. <lb/>
            to whom he was nearly related. He was a spectator of the <lb/>
            raising of Lazarus after being four days in the grave, as well <lb/>
            as of many other miracles. He ministered with Cleophas <lb/>
            at the last supper, and other mystical rites, and was present <lb/>
            with other disciples, at sundry appearances of our Lord <lb/>
            after his resurrection, and at his glorious ascension. He <lb/>
            partook of the blessings connected with the descent of the <lb/>
            Holy Spirit, and was abundantly endowed with his superna­ <lb/>
            tural gifts, so that be was well prepared by grace and faitli <lb/>
            for prosecuting vigorously the work of evangelizing.</p>
          <p>When the apostles were dispersed, Martial went to <lb/>
            Antioch with his kinsman St. Peter the apostle, and thence, <lb/>
            seven years afterwards, to Rome. There Peter and his <lb/>
            companions were hospitably entertained by Marcellus, the <lb/>
            consul, living for some time in his palace, and preaching <lb/>
            publicly to the Romans the saving precepts of eternal life. <lb/>
            At that time the Lord Jesus appeared to St. Peter, and <lb/>
            commanded him to send Martial to preach in the provinces <lb/>
            of Gaul. The apostle then called Martial to him, and duly <lb/>
            informed him of the divine command; upon hearing which <lb/>
            he wept bitterly, from fear of such distant countries and <lb/>
            barbarous tribes. But the blessed Peter gently consoled <lb/>
            him, and, reminding him of the divine monitions, sent him on <lb/>
            his errand of preaching the gospel. Without delay, therefore, <lb/>
            Martial, with two priests, Alpinian and Austriclinian, set for­ <lb/>
            ward on the journey enjoined him. Austriclinian, however, <lb/>
            dying on the road, Martial returned sorrowful to Rome, and <lb/>
            informed Peter of the death of his companion. But at the <lb/>
            apostle's command, he returned to his deceased brother, and, <lb/>
            touching his body with the apostle's staff, he was immediately <lb/>
            restored to life, by the merits and intercessions of the saints.</p>
          <p>Martial then, prosecuting his journey with his disciples, <lb/>

            the hand, and, raising her up, restored her to her father, <lb/>
            perfectly healed. He was holy, benevolent, humble, and <lb/>
            constant in prayer.</p>
          <p>The governor of the castle of Tulle whose name was Nerva, <lb/>
            and who was related to the emperor Nero, had a son who <lb/>
            was strangled by the devil. Upon this, the father and <lb/>
            mother of the deceased, with all the crowd who were present, <lb/>
            threw themselves at the feet of Martial and placed the <lb/>
            youth's corpse before him with loud cries and lamentations, <lb/>
            exclaiming in their grief: “Man of God, help us." The <lb/>
            holy pontiff had compassion on the sorrow of these people; <lb/>
            indeed he himself and his disciples wept with them, and they <lb/>
            joined in prayer to Almighty God for the restoration of life <lb/>
            to the dead. The prayer being ended, and the holy prelate <lb/>
            having commanded the dead man to arise whole in the name <lb/>
            of the crucified Saviour, he forthwith arose, and, throwing <lb/>
            himself at the feet of the holy man, began to cry out: <lb/>
            “ Baptize me, thou man of God, and sign me with the sign of <lb/>
            the faith;" adding: "Two angels came to TIle with great <lb/>
            swiftness, saying that I should be restored to life by the <lb/>
            prayers of the blessed Martial. Hell has no bounds; there <lb/>
            is nothing but weeping and bitterness, darkness, wailings <lb/>
            and groanings, and deep sorrow; the heat and cold are <lb/>
            intense and terrible, and never fail; there are the gnawings <lb/>
            of serpents, and insupportable smells, corruption and misery, <lb/>
            and the worm that never dies; there are infernal gaolers who <lb/>
            torment the souls they seize with various sufferings." <lb/>
            When he had made this and similar declarations, all the <lb/>
            people began to confess the Lord, and three thousand six <lb/>
            hundred souls of both sexes were baptized on the spot. <lb/>
            Many gifts were offered to the blessed man, all which he <note type="footnote">where the foundations of a fortification and many Roman antiquities have <lb/>
            been discovered. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            commanded to be given to the poor. After this he went to <lb/>
            the idol images, and broke and reduced to atoms all their <lb/>
            sculptured statues.</p>
          <p>The blessed prelate with his disciples came next to the <lb/>
            village of Ahun,1 and preached the true faith to the <lb/>
            idolaters, who were deceived by the snares of the devil. <lb/>
            Upon this the heathen priests assembled, and severely beat <lb/>
            the holy preachers. But they, blessing the Lord and <lb/>
            patiently bearing their ill-treatment for his sake, and faith­ <lb/>
            fully supplicating his aid in this imminent peril, their <lb/>
            persecutors were suddenly struck blind, and, holding each <lb/>
            other by the hand, groped their way to the statue of <lb/>
            Mercury. On their consulting the oracle as usual, it made <lb/>
            no reply, the demon being bound by the angels of God. <lb/>
            Having recourse to another idol they learned that their god <lb/>
            could give them no answer, because he was chained by the <lb/>
            angels of God in fetters of flame.</p>
          <p>The priests who had been struck blind, came therefore to <lb/>
            St. Martial, and throwing themselves at his feet implored his <lb/>
            pardon; and the holy bishop restored their sight, and, <lb/>
            presenting himself with all the people before the image of <lb/>
            Jupiter, he adjured the demon in the Lord's name to come <lb/>
            out, and break in pieces the statue in presence of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude; which command was immediately obeyed and the statue <lb/>
            reduced to atoms. Two thousand six hundred souls were <lb/>
            baptized there.</p>
          <p>A man who was paralytic, hearing of this miracle, caused <lb/>
            himself to be carried to the man of God. He was of high <lb/>
            family, and rich in gold and silver, and great possessions. <lb/>
            When now the man of God heard his entreaties and <lb/>
            perceived his faith, he took him by the hand, and, praying <lb/>
            for him, healed him. Thus restored to health, the paralytic <lb/>
            glorified God, and offered rewards to the man of God, which <lb/>
            he refused to accept,, and ordered all to be distributed among <lb/>
            the people.</p>
          <p>While St. Martial dwelt there, the Lord appeared to him <lb/>
            in a vision, saying: "Fear not to go down to Limoges, for I <lb/>
            will glorify thee in that place, and will be ever with thee." <lb/>
            Thereupon the blessed bishop, having encouraged those he <lb/>
            had baptized, commended them to the Lord, and went to the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ahun, near Guéret. </note> <pb n="300"/>

            city with his disciples. They were hospitably received in the <lb/>
            house of a noble widow named Susanna, and on the morrow <lb/>
            began to preach the Lord in public.</p>
          <p>There was a man afflicted with frenzy and bound in <lb/>
            fetters in the house where the man of God was entertained, <lb/>
            whom no one dared to unloose. Susanna having supplicated <lb/>
            the bishop to heal him as he had done others who were sick, <lb/>
            he yielded to her entreaties, and, making the sign of the cross <lb/>
            over the diseased man, his chains fell off, and he was made <lb/>
            whole. The noble mother, and her daughter Valeria, upon <lb/>
            witnessing this miracle, believed, and were baptized by the <lb/>
            holy bishop, with six hundred of their household.</p>
          <p>The priests of the idols, being incensed that the holy men <lb/>
            preached in the theatre, severely scourged them, and threw <lb/>
            them into prison; but St. Martial and his companions bore <lb/>
            patiently the injuries they received, giving thanks to God. <lb/>
            St. Martial was praying about the third hour of the day <lb/>
            following, when suddenly a light like that of the bright sun <lb/>
            shone in the dungeon, and the fetters of those who were <lb/>
            confined fell to pieces, and the doors were opened; so that <lb/>
            all who witnessed it entreated to be baptized. The city was <lb/>
            shaken with an earthquake, there were lightnings and <lb/>
            thunder, the heathen seeking in vain the protection of their <lb/>
            idols, for the priests who had scourged the holy men of God <lb/>
            were killed by a thunderbolt. The citizens, therefore, were <lb/>
            struck with universal terror, and, rushing to the prison, threw. <lb/>
            themselves at the bishop's feet, entreating pardon and help. <lb/>
            The bishop and his colleagues offering their prayers, <lb/>
            Aurelian and Andrew1 were restored to life, and, throwing <lb/>
            themselves on their knees, sought forgiveness, confessing <lb/>
            the true God, with all the people who saw with amazement <lb/>
            such unheard-of prodigies. The day following St. Martial <lb/>
            assembled the whole population, from the least to the eldest, <lb/>
            and, having addressed to them a suitable exhortation, <lb/>
            baptized them all. Thus twenty-two thousand believed in <lb/>
            the Lord, and submitted with joy to his saving worship.</p>
          <p>The holy bishop then hastened with all the people to the <lb/>
            temple, in which stood the statues of Jupiter, Mercury, <lb/>
            Diana, and Venus, and, destroying the images, converted the <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably two of the idol-priests so named. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            temple into a church dedicated to the honour of St. Stephen, <lb/>
            the first martyr.</p>
          <p>The blessed Susanna died happily in the Lord, and was <lb/>
            buried by St. Martial with great honour. She had conferred <lb/>
            . innumerable gifts and possessions on the holy bishop, and <lb/>
            had granted to him the service of a number of her slaves. <lb/>
            Moreover, her daughter Valeria devoted her virginity to the <lb/>
            Lord, and, full of the Holy Ghost, showed herself a model of <lb/>
            all good works. Hearing that Duke Stephen, to whom she <lb/>
            was betrothed, was on his road to Limoges, and feeling sure <lb/>
            that he would be grievously offended by her vow of chastity, <lb/>
            she distributed to the poor all her wealth in gold, and silver, <lb/>
            and vestments of various kinds, and precious stones. She <lb/>
            had already joined her mother in making over to the holy <lb/>
            bishop all their domains, with their slaves and serfs, that <lb/>
            after his death his holy remains might be there interred.</p>
          <p>Duke Stephen's principality extended from the river <lb/>
            Rhone to the ocean, and he possessed all the country on this <lb/>
            side the Loire, with Aquitaine, inhabited by the Gascons and <lb/>
            Goths.1 He was not called king, because no prince assumed <lb/>
            that title except Nero, who possessed the Roman empire. <lb/>
            On Stephen's reaching Limoges, he ordered Valeria, his <lb/>
            affianced bride, to be conducted to him, and, finding from the <lb/>
            conference that he was rejected by her, and that it was <lb/>
            certain he would never prevail on her to become his wife, <lb/>
            he became so enraged that he broke off the conversation, <lb/>
            and ordered her to be immediately led out of the city and <lb/>
            beheaded. Arrived at the place of execution she foretold the <lb/>
            sudden death of the executioner, and, spreading out her hands <lb/>
            in prayer, commended herself with confidence to the Lord <lb/>
            her God. During her prayer a voice was heard from above, <lb/>
            saying: " Fear not, Valeria, thou art expected in the celestial <lb/>
            brightness which never ends." The virgin rejoiced at <note type="footnote"> 1 We might be surprised to find the Goths and Gascons settled in <lb/>

            beginning of the fifth century (A.D. 412) that the Goths took possession of <lb/>
            the basin of the Garonne, and in the course of the sixth the province of <lb/>
            Novempopulanie changed its name for that of Gascony, derived from the <lb/>
            Gascons of Spain. The only historical personage of this country of the <lb/>
            name of Stephen was a count of Auvergne, killed by the Normans in <lb/>
            864. </note> <pb n="302"/>

            <lb/>
            <lb/>
            hearing these words, and, lifting up her eyes to heaven, said: <lb/>
            “ Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit." Having thus <lb/>
            spoken, she voluntarily offered her neck to the executioner, <lb/>
            who cut off her head with a single blow. Many persons saw <lb/>
            her spirit depart from the body, bright as the sun, and rising <lb/>
            to heaven in a globe of fire, with a choir of angels, singing: <lb/>
            Blessed art thou, Valeria, martyr of Christ, for thou hast <lb/>
            kept the commandments of God. Henceforth thou shalt be <lb/>
            for ever in his sight, in the brightness of the light that <lb/>
            knows no end."</p>
          <p>The squire of Duke Stephen, who had beheaded Valeria, <lb/>
            hearing these words hastened to his master, and told him all <lb/>
            he had seen and heard. Mentioning last the virgin's pre­ <lb/>
            diction of his own impending death, he was struck by an <lb/>
            angel, and fell at the duke's feet, and presently expired. <lb/>
            Fear and trembling seized the duke and all the people, and <lb/>
            the duke, covering himself with sackcloth, requested the <lb/>
            blessed Martial to come to him. On his arrival, the duke <lb/>
            prostrated himself at his feet, and said, with many tears : " I <lb/>
            have sinned, most holy man, in that I have shed the blood of <lb/>
            the righteous; but I pray thee to restore this my squire to <lb/>
            life, and cause me to believe in your God." Then the holy <lb/>
            bishop convoked the whole Christian population, and <lb/>
            exhorted them all to supplicate for the recovery of the dead <lb/>
            man. Silence being then made, he himself prayed with a <lb/>
            loud voice, and, his prayer ended, he approached the body of <lb/>
            the dead, and taking his hand commanded him to rise in the <lb/>
            name of the Lord. And he immediately arose, and, throwing <lb/>
            himself at the bishop's feet entreated to be baptized. Duke <lb/>
            Stephen, also, on seeing this miracle, knelt before the holy <lb/>
            bishop, imploring his forgiveness for the sin he had <lb/>
            committed. The blessed prelate, therefore, enjoined him a <lb/>
            penance for putting to death the virgin and martyr, and <lb/>
            baptized him with all his counts, and officers, and the whole <lb/>
            army, and all the people of both sexes, to the number of <lb/>
            fifteen thousand. The duke of whom we are speaking, gave <lb/>
            to Martial, his master in Christ, large sums of gold and <lb/>
            silver, that he might build churches to the honour of the <lb/>
            Lord. He also granted him large domains, with many <lb/>
            beneficiary estates, and vineyards, and serfs, in the province <lb/>
            of Limoges, to enable him to embellish the churches he built, <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            and to supply the wants of the clergy, who were to serve <lb/>
            God in them. lie afterwards erected a hospital for the <lb/>
            poor, to the charitable memory of Valeria, in which he <lb/>
            directed three hundred poor persons to be fed daily. He <lb/>
            also founded another, in which he made provision for refresh­ <lb/>
            ment being given daily to a crowd of the indigent, to the <lb/>
            number of six hundred; and he also built a church over the <lb/>
            tomb of St. Valeria, virgin and martyr.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Stephen, prince of the Gauls, was summoned <lb/>
            to Italy by order of the emperor Nero, and there served in <lb/>
            the army for six months with four legions of soldiers. <lb/>
            During his military service Stephen did not forget the divine <lb/>
            laws, but so ordered his troops that every one was satisfied <lb/>
            with his own, and if any committed robbery he suffered <lb/>
            death. After the term of his service was expired Stephen <lb/>
            obtained his leave of absence, but he was unwilling to return <lb/>
            to his own states until he had seen the blessed Peter the <lb/>
            apostle. He hastened therefore, with all his troops, to <lb/>
            Rome, and entering the city they found the apostle teaching <lb/>
            great crowds of people in a place called the Vatican. <lb/>
            Approaching the apostle with bare feet and sackcloth on <lb/>
            their loins, they knelt before him and humbly besought his <lb/>
            blessing. St. Peter, seeing the flower of the youth of Gaul, <lb/>
            and learning that they had all been instructed in the gospel <lb/>
            of Christ and baptized by the blessed Martial, was filled <lb/>
            with joy and gave blessings to the Lord. He made many <lb/>
            anxious inquiries of the pious duke concerning the manners <lb/>
            and grace and way of life of the holy bishop, and the duke <lb/>
            took pleasure in recounting many particulars of his goodness <lb/>
            and miracles, and the conversion of the people who hastened <lb/>
            from all parts to the font of holy baptism.</p>
          <p>When the duke had received absolution from the apostle <lb/>
            for having shed the blood of the innocent Valeria, he offered <lb/>
            him the two hundred gold livres which he had just received <lb/>
            as a donation from the emperor Nero, but the apostle <lb/>
            directed him to take the gold to the holy bishop, that he <lb/>
            might employ it in erecting churches or relieving the poor. <lb/>
            Having therefore received the apostolic benediction, Stephen <lb/>
            and his soldiers returned to Gaul, and at the duke's sugges­ <lb/>
            tion they visited their common father before they returned to <lb/>
            their own homes. Arriving at a certain royal palace called <pb n="304"/>

            <lb/>
            <lb/>
            St. Junien, they pitched their tents and pavilions on the <lb/>
            bank of the river Vienne.1 The heat of the weather <lb/>
            drove them to the river for refreshment both from the dust? <lb/>
            and from the sun's rays, when Hildebert, son of Arcadius <lb/>
            count of Poitou, was drowned by the devil at a place called <lb/>
            Gram, and died on the spot, nor could his body be found <lb/>
            although the whole army searched for it. Arcadius and all <lb/>
            the soldiers were overwhelmed with grief, and hastening <lb/>
            with lamentations to Limoges, he humbly implored the aid <lb/>
            of Martial on his son's behalf. Great crowds of Goths and <lb/>
            Saxons, and people of other provinces, had now flocked to <lb/>
            Limoges, desiring to hear the word of salvation from the <lb/>
            holy man. Arcadius therefore and all the people threw <lb/>
            themselves at Martial's feet, beseeching him with much <lb/>
            lamentation on behalf of the young man drowned in the <lb/>
            river. The holy man wept with them, and came to the <lb/>
            place clothed in sackcloth, and with naked feet. All present <lb/>
            joining in prayer, the mali of God adjured the demons, who <lb/>
            lurked in a hollow of the channel, that they should render <lb/>
            themselves visible to the people and bring the corpse of the <lb/>
            young man to the river-bank. Immediately the body was <lb/>
            cast ashore at the distance of about six furlongs, the demons <lb/>
            appearing in the shape of swine. At length, the people <lb/>
            making deprecatory prayers and the bishop adjuring, they <lb/>
            rushed violently from the river, and came and lay down at <lb/>
            the feet of St. Martial. They were like the Ethiopians, <lb/>
            black as soot, their feet enormous, their eyes terrible and <lb/>
            bloody, their whole body was covered with bristly hair, and <lb/>
            from their mouths and nostrils they breathed sulphureous <lb/>
            flames. Their speech resembled the croakings of the raven; <lb/>
            and when the bishop demanded their names one of them <lb/>
            answered; " I am called thousand-craft, because I have a <lb/>
            thousand arts of deceiving the human race." Another said; <lb/>
            “ I am called Neptune, because I have dragged numbers of <lb/>
            men into this hole and plunged them into the torments of <lb/>
            hell.” The holy bishop inquired, " Why do you wear rings <lb/>
            of fire on your snouts ?" The demons replied: " When we <lb/>
            have seduced the souls of men, it is by chains attached <lb/>
            to these we drag them to our master." The bishop asking <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a commune still called du Palais on the banks of the Vienne, <lb/>

            their master's name, they replied: " Strife, for lie never ceases <lb/>
            to stir up quarrels, and his rage and passion are without end." <lb/>
            The demons then entreating the bishop that he would talk <lb/>
            no more with them in Latin, and would not send them into <lb/>
            the abyss or the boundless ocean, he commanded them, in <lb/>
            the Hebrew tongue, to depart into a desert place, and to <lb/>
            hurt no living creature to the day of judgment. The <lb/>
            demons then flying through the air appeared no more. <lb/>
            And now the duke with the whole crowd of people, and all <lb/>
            the army collected from different provinces, and present at <lb/>
            this extraordinary spectacle, threw themselves at the feet of <lb/>
            the holy bishop pitifully imploring him to restore life to the <lb/>
            young man who then lay dead. The bishop, moved at their <lb/>
            distress, commanded all with one heart to make intercession <lb/>
            to the Lord, and taking the hand of the deceased said, " In <lb/>
            the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Hildebert arise;" and <lb/>
            he immediately arose and lived piously twenty-six years after­ <lb/>
            wards. While all who witnessed so glorious a miracle were <lb/>
            praising God, St. Martial called Hildebert and made inquiry <lb/>
            of him, for the edification of the hearers, what he saw while <lb/>
            he was dead. With some hesitation, he related as follows :—</p>
          <p>"Bathed in sweat from the intense beat of the sun, I <lb/>
            was washing myself in the river, when suddenly the demons <lb/>
            plunged me into a deep hole and drowned me. But when they <lb/>
            attempted to bind me in chains of fire, an angel of the Lord <lb/>
            stood by me and delivered me out of their hands. We had <lb/>
            begun to take the road to the east, when two bands of <lb/>
            demons opposed our progress, throwing at us fiery darts. <lb/>
            One of these bands attacked us in front, while the other <lb/>
            assaulted us in the rear. For my part I was terribly <lb/>
            frightened, but the angel my companion encouraged me; <lb/>
            beginning to sing with a melodious voice and sweet expres­ <lb/>
            sion : ‘ Bless the Lord, 0 my soul; and all that is within me, <lb/>
            praise his holy name. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities and <lb/>
            redeemeth thy life from the pit.’ 'At length we reached the <lb/>
            purgatorial fire, where Christians are punished for such of <lb/>
            their daily transgressions as are not aggravated to mortal sins. <lb/>
            Purgatory is a river of fire, with a bridge across, over which <lb/>
            the angel of the Lord conducting me stood still, and taking <lb/>
            my hand said : ‘ Here you will remain until, being cleansed <lb/>
            from all your sins, you are fit to be a partaker of the <note type="footnote"> YOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XVII.</note><lb/>
            <lb/>
            <lb/>
            heavenly kingdom.’ This being passed we arrived at the <lb/>
            gate of Paradise, near which we found a crowd of demons <lb/>
            assembled, whose rage and whose slanders I horribly feared. <lb/>
            But at that moment a voice was heard from heaven, saying: <lb/>
            ' Let the soul of the young man return to his body, and let <lb/>
            him live twenty-six years.' The angel who conducted me <lb/>
            was of incredible beauty, his whole aspect surpassing the <lb/>
            human race. To my inquiries concerning our doctor, St. <lb/>
            Martial, he replied : ‘ His merit in heaven is great because he <lb/>
            has continued in celibacy, and is and means to be free from <lb/>
            the love of women. From his youth he began to serve the <lb/>
            Lord and attach himself to the blessed Peter, never <lb/>
            returning to his father's house. As he is known to be free <lb/>
            from the concupiscence of the flesh, so he will be delivered <lb/>
            from the pains of death. Twelve angels are commissioned <lb/>
            by the Lord to attend him constantly, who do not suffer him <lb/>
            to be weary, nor to hunger or thirst, but preserve him from <lb/>
            all evil and shield him from every touch of sorrow.’ ”</p>
          <p>While Hildebert was relating these things and others <lb/>
            similar to them, the hearts of the bishop and the duke and <lb/>
            all the assembled people were gladdened, and they offered <lb/>
            thanksgivings to the Lord for all the benefits conferred <lb/>
            upon them. Hildebert, observing the angel's admonitions, <lb/>
            shaved his bead, and attaching himself to the blessed prelate <lb/>
            devoted himself to the service of the Lord, neither drinking <lb/>
            wine nor eating flesh. He went bare-foot, and was satis- <lb/>
            Red with bread and water for food, and sackcloth for <lb/>
            raiment. He gave himself up to constant prayers, and <lb/>
            frequent fastings, and. the continual performance of good <lb/>
            works. All that he inherited from his parents he distributed <lb/>
            to the poor; and reserved nothing for himself on the mor­ <lb/>
            row. Multitudes followed his example, and renouncing <lb/>
            their own wills hastened to Christ by the narrow way.</p>
          <p>Duke Stephen published an ordinance directing that <lb/>
            through all the nations which were subject to his dominion, <lb/>
            the temples and idols should be broken down and burnt <lb/>
            with fire, and that they should worship the one only God, <lb/>
            whom they should strive to obey. He himself, as he had <lb/>
            learnt from his master, observed a life of religion towards <lb/>
            God. He was liberal in alms, just in his judgments, care­ <lb/>
            ful for the poor, docile, and devoted to the priests and all <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            the ministers of God; lie was the wise father of the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians, but a fierce persecutor of the pagans. From the day <lb/>
            of his baptism he was never defiled by connection with <lb/>
            any woman, but lived in chastity to the day of his death.</p>
          <p>There was in the city of Bordeaux a count named Sige­ <lb/>
            bert, who for six years was grievously afflicted with para­ <lb/>
            lysis. Hearing the miracles which were wrought by the <lb/>
            blessed Martial, he directed his wife Benedicta to go with <lb/>
            all haste to the man of God, and, taking with her twenty- <lb/>
            six livres in gold and a sufficient sum in silver, implore <lb/>
            the favour of God through the intercession of his friend. <lb/>
            She used the utmost despatch in preparing what was com­ <lb/>
            manded, and hastened to the man of God with an escort of <lb/>
            two thousand eight hundred horsemen. On her arrival she <lb/>
            earnestly petitioned the man of God for her husbands health, <lb/>
            which he, rejoicing in her faith, promised to restore. He <lb/>
            therefore delivered his staff to the matron, commanding her <lb/>
            to lay it on her husband and he would be healed. He <lb/>
            refused to accept the gold and silver, but according to the <lb/>
            Lord's commandment conferred the spiritual benefits <lb/>
            gratuitously. He baptized the noble Benedicta and all the <lb/>
            companions of her journey, and dismissed them to their <lb/>
            homes confirmed in the faith.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, when the populace of Bordeaux flocked to <lb/>
            the idol temples and the priests burnt incense, the demon <lb/>
            said that be would come out at the command of a certain <lb/>
            Hebrew named Martial, and published with sorrow the <lb/>
            great virtues of the holy bishop and his honour with God. <lb/>
            As the matron was entering the city on her return, the <lb/>
            elders of the people proceeded to meet her, and told her all <lb/>
            that they had heard from Jupiter. Then the countess sent <lb/>
            for the chief pontiff of the idols, and commanded him that <lb/>
            he should go to all the temples, except those of the unknown <lb/>
            God, and utterly destroy them. She then with her Chris­ <lb/>
            tian companions implored God's mercy, and coming in his <lb/>
            name to her husband's bed, placed on him the blessed <lb/>
            apostle's staff. Immediately his limbs, which had been <lb/>
            injured by the contraction of the nerves, and dried up by <lb/>
            fever, became instantly as though they bad never lost their <lb/>
            power. After the just-named Count Sigebert was healed <lb/>
            be went with a great retinue to the holy bishop and was <note type="footnote"> 2 x </note> <pb n="308"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XVII.</note><lb/>
            regenerated by him, with all his followers, in the water of <lb/>
            holy baptism. He returned abundant offerings of prayers <lb/>
            and thanks for the heavenly benefits conferred upon him, <lb/>
            and lived many years afterwards happily in the service of <lb/>
            . the Lord.</p>
          <p>It happened on a certain occasion, that when the city of <lb/>
            Bordeaux was, for the presumption of the inhabitants, in <lb/>
            danger of being consumed by fire, the flames threatening its <lb/>
            entire destruction, the pious Benedicta, in full faith, op­ <lb/>
            posed the staff of the man of God to the progress of the <lb/>
            fire, invoking the aid of the Creator, whose omnipotence <lb/>
            she confessed. And the conflagration was immediately <lb/>
            extinguished, so that no traces of fire remained.</p>
          <p>At that time Martial, the bishop of Christ, moved by <lb/>
            divine inspiration, went to the bank of the river Garonne, <lb/>
            and preached the gospel to multitudes who flocked to him <lb/>
            at a place called Mortagne ; remaining there three months in <lb/>
            the saving work of his divine mission. Nine demoniacs <lb/>
            brought by their parents in chains from the city of Bordeaux <lb/>
            were healed by St. Martin, the demons being expelled. <lb/>
            The demons also, who by virtue of Christian faith were <lb/>
            expelled from the city of Bordeaux, incensed with those <lb/>
            whom they had subjugated, took possession of some mise­ <lb/>
            rable idolaters, and entering their bodies grievously vexed <lb/>
            them. Their parents therefore brought them to the man of <lb/>
            God, at whose prayers and commands their malignant <lb/>
            enemies issued forth from their mouths with torrents of <lb/>
            blood, and were no more seen.</p>
          <p>On one occasion when the blessed St. Martial preached <lb/>
            in Mortagne, and crowds of people flocked to hear the true <lb/>
            doctrine, Count Sigebert resolved to join him with a con­ <lb/>
            siderable body of soldiers, and to show his friendship by <lb/>
            supplying him with all that was necessary for meat and <lb/>
            drink. Among other things he desired a quantity of fish, <lb/>
            and despatched his servants to the sea for the purpose of <lb/>
            fishing. When at last the fishermen, bringing with them <lb/>
            many kinds of fish, were looking forward with anxiety <lb/>
            to reach the shore, a sudden storm arose and threatened <lb/>
            them with shipwreck and destruction. The countess Bene­ <lb/>
            dicta, who with a crowd of people was on the shore waiting, <lb/>
            saw the danger in great alarm. And now men began to <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            sink with the boats, when the devout woman, extending her <lb/>
            hands towards heaven, called upon God with a loud voice, <lb/>
            and the storm immediately ceased. The fishermen, with <lb/>
            their boats, and fish, and nets, came safe to the harbour, and <lb/>
            all who saw it glorified God.</p>
          <p>On his return from Mortagne the amiable prelate again <lb/>
            visited Limoges, and thence went to a village called Ansae. <lb/>
            It boasted an idol of Jupiter held in great veneration by <lb/>
            the heathen, which drew together numbers of sick folk <lb/>
            labouring under various infirmities. On the bishop's arrival <lb/>
            the demon was dumb, but at the request of the inhabitants <lb/>
            the man of God commanded him to come out of the image, <lb/>
            and breaking the statue show himself to the people in a <lb/>
            visible form. There forthwith issued from the statue what <lb/>
            had the appearance of a negro boy, .black as soot, covered <lb/>
            with dark and rough hair from head to foot, and fire <lb/>
            flashing from his mouth, nostrils, and eyes, with a sulphu­ <lb/>
            reous smell. Thus the saint showed the people what sort of <lb/>
            god they had worshipped, and repeated his order to the <lb/>
            demon that he should destroy the image ; which he accord­ <lb/>
            ingly reduced to powder, and never again appeared. Then <lb/>
            the venerable bishop assembled round him all the sick, and <lb/>
            making the sign of the cross over them healed them in the <lb/>
            name of the Lord, baptizing all those who appeared to <lb/>
            dwell in that place. Returning afterwards to his own see, <lb/>
            he caused oratories to be built, and decorated them care­ <lb/>
            fully with rich ornaments. One he dedicated to the honour <lb/>
            of St. Stephen the first martyr, his own kinsman, and <lb/>
            another to St. Peter the apostle, his own master.1 The altar <lb/>
            was overlaid all round with plates of gold. When the <lb/>
            churches were built, the blessed bishop fixed a day for the <lb/>
            consecration, and Duke Stephen caused preparations to be <lb/>
            made for entertaining all who came to the holy solemnity. <lb/>
            When however the holy bishop was celebrating the mass, <lb/>
            Herve, count of Tours, was carried off by the devil, as well as <lb/>
            his Christian wife. But the holy man did not suffer them <lb/>
            to be long tormented, but calling them to him, he rebuked the <note type="footnote"> 1 The cathedral of Limoges is still under the invocation of St. Stephen. <lb/>
            The church here called St. Peter's, has been known by the name of St. <lb/>
            Martial since the time that the relics of that apostle of the Limousin were <lb/>
            deposited in it. </note> <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XVII.</note><lb/>
            devils for taking possession of them. But they replied, that <lb/>
            it was permitted them on account of the transgression of <lb/>
            the count and his wife, who, contrary to the bishop's precept, <lb/>
            had polluted themselves with carnal knowledge the whole <lb/>
            night. Upon the count and the people entreating favour <lb/>
            for the possessed, the holy bishop restored them to sound <lb/>
            health and vigour, expelling the demon in the name of the <lb/>
            Lord. The church of St. Peter was consecrated on the <lb/>
            sixth of the nones [2nd] of May, in the reign of the emperor <lb/>
            Nero, when so dazzling was the light shed in it on the day <lb/>
            of dedication, that it was scarcely possible to distinguish <lb/>
            one person from another.</p>
          <p>These ceremonies being duly performed, the blessed Mar­ <lb/>
            tial ordained Aurelian to succeed him in the see of Limoges <lb/>
            after his own decease. He also caused Andrew the priest <lb/>
            to preside over the church of St. Peter the apostle, settling <lb/>
            in it Hildebert, son of Count Archadius, and thirty-six <lb/>
            clerks besides, for whom Duke Stephen provided out of his <lb/>
            own domains an abundant revenue, to supply food and <lb/>
            clothing.</p>
          <p>Much has been written on the life of the blessed Martial, <lb/>
            which cannot be fully recounted in detail. To sum up his <lb/>
            character shortly, he was deeply imbued with divine wis­ <lb/>
            dom, illustrious for his piety, exemplary in his morals, and <lb/>
            regarded with awe for the miracles he wrought. Holding <lb/>
            the world cheap, and loving God and his neighbour, for him <lb/>
            " to live was Christ, to die was gain." He restored, as we <lb/>
            have often noticed, sight to the blind, and caused the deaf <lb/>
            to hear, the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, and the dead <lb/>
            to return to life. There are many other particulars worthy <lb/>
            to be recorded, as Aurelian remarks, of works done by St. <lb/>
            Martial by the grace of Christ, which would be considered <lb/>
            as apocryphal by unbelievers, if they were committed to <lb/>
            writing.</p>
          <p>In the year 40, after our Lord's resurrection, when the <lb/>
            blessed Martial was praying, as he was wont, the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus Christ appeared to him in glory with his disciples, <lb/>
            and having graciously saluted him by name, predicted that <lb/>
            the fifteenth day from thence would be the period of his <lb/>
            departure out of this world. The holy man, full of joy, gave <lb/>
            thanks to God, and during two weeks, prepared for his end <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            with fasting, and watching, and prayer. After a short ces­ <lb/>
            sation, to rest his wearied limbs, he rose in the night for <lb/>
            prayer at the hour appointed, and continued his prayers <lb/>
            and divine lauds to the second hour of day. Then he <lb/>
            offered the holy sacrifice to the Lord, for himself and the <lb/>
            whole church, at the second hour, and afterwards preached <lb/>
            diligently until the evening. Towards the close of day, as <lb/>
            night approached, he took the nourishment to which he <lb/>
            rigorously confined himself, viz. bread and water.</p>
          <p>The period of his vocation being near, the holy man con­ <lb/>
            voked his brethren and announced to them, that the day of <lb/>
            his departure was at hand; making known the same also <lb/>
            by messengers he despatched through all the provinces and <lb/>
            districts which he had gained for the Lord. Great numbers <lb/>
            assembled in deep sorrow, viz., the people of Poitou, Berry, <lb/>
            Auvergne, Gascony, and Gothia. The day of his death <lb/>
            drawing near, at the request of all he went out of the gate <lb/>
            of the city called the Lime-gate, and there delivered a <lb/>
            discourse on the true faith and the divine operations, and <lb/>
            profitably recounted the blessed virtues which adorn the <lb/>
            Christian life. At the end of his discourse he gave the <lb/>
            benediction to the people, commending them to God in <lb/>
            devout prayer, and then causing himself to be carried into <lb/>
            the oratory of St. Stephen, and lying there in sackcloth and <lb/>
            ashes waited his end, while, with bended knees and hands <lb/>
            outstretched to heaven, he caused prayers to be offered to <lb/>
            aid him in his last struggle. At the close he thus addressed <lb/>
            the Lord: " Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my spirit <lb/>
            and whilst those who stood around were weeping and pray­ <lb/>
            ing, he made a sign with his hand for silence, and said to <lb/>
            them: " Be still, hear ye not the songs of praise proceeding <lb/>
            from heaven ? surely the Lord cometh, as he promised <lb/>
            and immediately a great light shone around, and the voice <lb/>
            of the Lord was heard calling him, and saying: " Blessed <lb/>

            by the glorious light, while a concert of angels was heard. <lb/>
            On the morrow, at the third hour, a paralytic who touched <lb/>
            his bier immediately became sound. When his body was <lb/>
            carried forth for burial, at the moment of the departure <lb/>
            towards the church of St. Stephen, the heavens were opened <lb/>
            and continued open while the bearers of the holy remains <pb n="312"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. XVIII."/><lb/>
            carried them to the place of interment. Moreover, as a <lb/>
            multitude of infirm persons was collected at the funeral, <lb/>
            the blessed Alpinian taking the sudarium of the holy bishop <lb/>
            applied it to the bodies of the sick, and invoking the name <lb/>
            of Christ all were healed. Among the rest a dropsical man <lb/>
            was brought from Toulouse, with six blind persons and four <lb/>
            demoniacs, who, on the day following the obit of the holy <lb/>
            bishop, were presented before his tomb, and healed by the <lb/>
            touch of the sacred napkin.</p>
          <p>Innumerable other miracles were wrought by the most <lb/>
            holy prelate after his interment, the great number of which <lb/>
            forbids their being reduced to writing in detail. Probably <lb/>
            larger volumes, if they were written, would not content <lb/>
            those who are dissatisfied with the present account.1</p>
          <p>May the holy bishop Martial, the cotemporary of Christ <lb/>
            and the companion of the apostles, who was the pious pastor. <lb/>
            of Limoges, and the first who preached to the people of the <lb/>
            west, intercede for us who speak of him, that, protected by <lb/>
            his prayers, we may be found worthy to be partakers of the. <lb/>
            eternal inheritance. Amen.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>HAVING determined to compose a history from the works <lb/>
            of former writers, I commenced with ecclesiastical history, <lb/>
            in the beginning of which I collected some short accounts <lb/>
            of the holy apostles. Now, by God's help I shall endeavour <lb/>
            to give a regular series of the Roman bishops, beginning <lb/>
            with St. Peter the apostle, to whom Christ gave the keys of <lb/>
            the kingdom of heaven; an undertaking I consider neces­ <lb/>
            sary, and useful to studious persons and others who desire <lb/>
            instruction. My careful researches extend through eleven <lb/>
            centuries, from the time that the Almighty Emanuel came <lb/>
            to us, veiled in the flesh which he borrowed from the im- <note type="footnote"> 1 These supposed acts of St. Martial appear to have been substituted <lb/>
            for the original, which was then lost, a few years before 994, the date of <lb/>
            the second translation of his relics. Till that time it was believed, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Gregory of Tours, that the period of his mission could not be carried <lb/>
            higher than the reign of Trajan. A council at Limoges in 1029, another <lb/>
            at Bourges in 1031, and, finally, a bull of the holy see, sanctioned the <lb/>
            assertions of the fictitious account. </note> <pb n="313"/>

            iaculate virgin. The city of Rome, which from its very <lb/>
            foundation carried its fasces in triumph over all its neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, and which, by God's providence, extended its fron­ <lb/>
            tiers to the Euphrates and the Ocean, saw also many <lb/>
            illustrious champions, who, by God's aid, held the reins of <lb/>
            ecclesiastical discipline. It is delightful to trace their tri­ <lb/>
            umphant course over the waves of this world, that those <lb/>
            who walk in the steps of the Christian heroes may strive to <lb/>
            imitate their noble acts which lead to salvation.</p>
          <p>The blessed SIMON PETER, the prince of the apostles, son <lb/>
            of John, and born at Bethsaida., in the province of Galilee, <lb/>
            first filled the see of Antioch during seven years. He then <lb/>
            went to Rome in the reign of Claudius, to oppose Simon <lb/>
            Magus, and there preaching governed the church twenty- <lb/>
            five years. He often disputed before Nero and the people <lb/>
            against Simon, whom he defeated; and his martyrdom by <lb/>
            Nero at the same time as that of St. Paul, took place in the <lb/>
            year 36 from the passion of our Lord, on the third of the <lb/>
            calends of July [29th June].1</p>
          <p>LINUS, son of Herculanus, and born in Tuscany, occupied <lb/>
            the see of Rome eleven years, three months, and twelve <lb/>
            days, suffering martyrdom on the sixth of the calends of <lb/>
            December [25th November]. Following the precept of the <lb/>
            apostle Peter, he decreed that no woman should enter a <lb/>
            church without having her head covered.2</p>
          <p>CLETUS, born at Rome, sat twelve years, one month, eleven <lb/>
            days, and suffered under Domitian on the sixth of the <lb/>
            calends of May [26th April]. The see remained void <lb/>
            twenty days. Rufinus, priest of Aquileia, says in the pre­ <lb/>
            face of his history of Clemens, that Linus and Cletus <lb/>
            performed the functions of bishops during the life of Peter <lb/>
            the apostle, and afterwards succeeded him. 1 am much <lb/>
            surprised that so sensible a critic and historian, and one so <lb/>
            well read, both in Greek and Latin authors, should not have <lb/>
            recollected, that both these bishops finished their blessed <note type="footnote"> 1 See former notes on the date of St. Peter's ministry at Antioch and <lb/>
            Rome, and his martyrdom, pp. 194 and 195. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has followed the martyrology of Ado in placing the death <lb/>
            of Linus on the 25th of December. It is generally placed on the 23rd of <lb/>
            September. It is very doubtful whether this pope and his successor <lb/>
            suffered martyrdom. </note> <pb n="314"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. XVIII."/><lb/>
            course by martyrdom, and that no one suffered persecution at <lb/>
            Rome for the cause of Christ until the thirteenth year of <lb/>
            Nero, after the fall of Simon Magus. Linus suffered in the <lb/>
            time of Vespasian, and Cletus in the persecution under <lb/>
            Domitian.1</p>
          <p>CLEMENS, born at Rome on the Celian Mount, whose <lb/>
            father was Faustinus, filled the see ten years, two months, <lb/>
            ten days, and was thrown into the sea under the emperor <lb/>
            Trajan on the ninth of the calends of December [23rd No­ <lb/>
            vember]. The see was vacant twenty-one days. Following <lb/>
            the discipline of the blessed Peter the apostle, he was so <lb/>
            eminent for the ornaments of a good conversation, that he <lb/>
            was esteemed by the Jews and Gentiles, as well as by the <lb/>
            Christians, whose poor he caused to be all registered, not <lb/>
            suffering those who had been purified by holy baptism to <lb/>
            become public mendicants. He gave the consecrated veil <lb/>
            to Flavia Domitia, a virgin who was niece of Domitian and <lb/>
            espoused to Aurelius, and confirmed Theodora the wife of <lb/>
            count Sisinnius in her resolution of chastity. Her husband, <lb/>
            having been led by his passions to follow her as she secretly <lb/>
            entered the church, was immediately by St. Clemens' <lb/>
            prayers struck blind and deaf. His servants seeking to <lb/>
            remove him could not find the door, although they searched <lb/>
            for it all round for some time, until Theodora obtained by <lb/>
            her prayers on her husband's behalf, that he and his attend­ <lb/>
            ants might depart. Conducted home, his blindness still <lb/>
            continued, and when mass was ended Theodora stated all <lb/>
            the circumstances to Pope Clemens, who exhorted the <lb/>
            people to offer their prayers. He himself, with the woman, <lb/>
            visited the diseased man, and by his supplications caused <lb/>
            his sight and hearing to be immediately restored. But <lb/>
            though he recovered his bodily senses, he lost his reason, <lb/>
            and ordered Clemens, whom he accused of following his <lb/>
            wife, to be siezed and brought to him. His servants also <note type="footnote"> 1 This pope is also called Anaclete. The history of these first two <lb/>
            successors of St. Peter is very obscure. There appears to be no foundation <lb/>
            for the opinion of Rufinus, but the fact which our author opposes to it, is, <lb/>
            as already observed, doubtful. [23rd September ? 78—91. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 If we believe, with the church, the existence of this saint, she must <lb/>

            for this story but the very suspicious Acts of SS. Nereus and Achilles. </note> <pb n="315"/>

            attached ropes to stone pillars, and dragged them within <lb/>
            and without the house. Sisinnius and his servants being <lb/>
            thus Iliad, Clemens departed, and Theodora spent the whole <lb/>
            day in weeping and praying for her husband. At length in <lb/>
            the evening Peter the apostle appeared to her and com­ <lb/>
            forted her, saying: " Sisinnius shall be saved by thee, in <lb/>
            order that the word spoken by my brother Paul the apostle <lb/>
            be fulfilled: ' the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the <lb/>
            believing wife.' "1 Sisinnius, recovering his reason, caused <lb/>
            Theodora to invite Clemens to come to him, and confessing <lb/>
            his former folly, declared his belief in Almighty God, and <lb/>
            being confirmed in the faith was baptized the following <lb/>
            Easter, with three hundred and twenty-three persons of <lb/>
            both sexes.2 Many noble and illustrious persons believed <lb/>
            through him, and professing the true faith received baptism.</p>
          <p>Publius Torqueanus, count of the sacred offices, becoming <lb/>
            jealous of the increase of the Christians, gave money to his <lb/>
            officers in various provinces, to stir up opposition to the <lb/>
            name of Christ. A tumult of the people took place at Rome, <lb/>
            while Mamertine was prefect, and by command of Publius <lb/>
            Torqueanus, Clemens was privately brought before him ; but <lb/>
            the bishop, by his sensible replies, endeavoured to bring him <lb/>
            over to the true faith. The tumult still raging, a report <lb/>
            concerning Clemens was forwarded to Nerva, and also to <lb/>
            Trajan. The rescript of Trajan ordered that if Clemens <lb/>
            refused to sacrifice to the idols, he should be banished to the <lb/>
            city of Chersona, beyond the Euxine Sea. But the Lord <lb/>
            gave such grace to the blessed Clemens that even the heathen <lb/>
            judges grieved for him. Julian, the president, sorrowfully <lb/>
            commended him by prayer to God, and supplied him with <lb/>
            a ship, freighted with all that his comfort required, and he <lb/>
            was accompanied in his exile by many devout persons, both <lb/>
            of the clergy and laity. The holy pope found at his place of <lb/>
            banishment more than two thousand Christians, condemned <lb/>
            to hew blocks of marble; and rejoiced that they were <lb/>
            suffering for the name of Christ, instructing them fully in <lb/>
            the doctrine of patience and keeping the faith. Hearing <lb/>
            that they had to fetch water on their shoulders six miles, he <note type="footnote"> 1 1 Cor, vii. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The whole of this legend of St. Theodora is apocryphal, as it is easy to <lb/>
            discover. </note> <pb n="316"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. XVIII."/><lb/>
            prayed the Lord to give them water. When his prayer was <lb/>
            ended, he saw a lamb standing on a hill, and gently struck <lb/>
            with a short rod the spot which the lamb had pointed out, by <lb/>
            lifting its foot; whereupon a fountain burst forth supplied <lb/>
            by copious springs, and speedily forming a river. This being <lb/>
            known, the whole province flocked together, and great <lb/>
            numbers listened to the teaching of St. Clemens, so that in <lb/>
            one day five hundred souls, or more, were baptized; and in <lb/>
            less than a year seventy-five churches were erected, the idols <lb/>
            being demolished by the believers.</p>
          <p>After three years, a malicious accusation was forwarded to <lb/>
            Trajan at the instance of the pagans; and he sent the tribune, <lb/>
            Aufidius, who put to death many Christians by various kinds <lb/>
            of suffering. After this general massacre he ordered Clemens <lb/>
            to be embarked alone on the sea, and thrown into the waves <lb/>
            with an anchor attached to his neck. While this was doing, <lb/>
            Phæbus and Cornelius, with a crowd of Christians, stood on <lb/>
            the shore praying, with floods of tears, when the sea receded <lb/>
            for almost three miles from the shore, and people walking on <lb/>
            the dry land saw a strange spectacle. For they found a <lb/>
            small building, having the appearance of a marble chapel, <lb/>
            built by angelic hands, and the body of St. Clemens deposited <lb/>
            therein in a stone coffin by the ministry of angels, with the <lb/>
            anchor by which the body had been sunk laid near. It was <lb/>
            revealed to the disciples that they should not remove the <lb/>
            body, as, on the recurrence of the anniversary of St. <lb/>
            Clemens' martyrdom, the sea would again recede, and for <lb/>
            seven days permit approach to the tomb. Many miracles <lb/>
            were wrought there, and all the heathen in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            believed in Christ, and became servants of Him who liveth <lb/>
            and reigneth for ever and ever. Amen.1</p>
          <p>By a constitution of Clemens's, the altar-cloth, the chair, <lb/>
            and the candelabrum, were to be burnt when they became <lb/>
            worn out.</p>
          <p>ÅNACLETUS,2 a Greek, of Athens, filled the see nine years <lb/>
            two months, ten days; and on his death the third of the <lb/>
            ides [13th] July, it was vacant sixteen days. By a decree of <note type="footnote"> 1 The details respecting St. Clemens contained in this and the preceding <lb/>

            his no accusation was to be received against a priest, except <lb/>
            it were preferred by men of character and probity, above <lb/>
            suspicion.</p>
          <p>EVARISTUS, a Jew, of Bethlehem, whose fathers name was <lb/>
            Juda, filled the see nine years, ten months, two days, in the <lb/>
            reigns of Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan.1 After his <lb/>
            martyrdom the see was vacant eighteen days. Evaristus <lb/>
            appointed seven deacons to attend the bishop during his <lb/>
            preaching, to be witnesses of his doctrine,2 and to supply the <lb/>
            place of eyes in his superintendence of all parts of his diocese. <lb/>
            He also decreed that a man should not divorce his wife, or <lb/>
            the wife leave her husband; and that no church should have <lb/>
            a new bishop while the former was alive.</p>
          <p>ALEXANDER was born at Rome, in the quarter of the Bull's <lb/>
            Head, his father's name being also Alexander. He filled the <lb/>
            see ten years, seven months, eleven days. He introduced <lb/>
            the custom of blessing houses, by sprinkling holy water in <lb/>
            which salt was mixed; as well as the reference to our Lord's <lb/>
            passion, in the prayer used by the priest in celebrating mass. <lb/>
            The Lord wrought many miracles, and brought salvation to <lb/>
            many souls by his instrumentality. At length he was <lb/>
            beheaded on the Nomentan way, on the fifth of the nones <lb/>
            [3rd] May, and the see was vacant thirty-five days.</p>
          <p>SIXTUS, born at Rome in the Latin Street [viâ Latinâ] <lb/>
            whose father's name was Pastor, sat ten years, two months, <lb/>
            one day. He decreed that none but persons in orders should <lb/>
            presume to touch holy things. He also introduced into the <lb/>
            [canon of the] mass, the hymn of angels and men, to be sung <lb/>
            by the priests in the presence of the people: " Holy, holy, <lb/>
            holy, Lord God of sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of <lb/>
            thy glory: hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he that <lb/>
            cometh in the name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest." <lb/>

            the gloss, " lest the bishop's detractors should attribute to him errors in his <lb/>
            preaching, which he had not committed ;" a curious instance of the use of <lb/>

            conversation of any one who brought forward charges against <lb/>
            the clergy, should be narrowly scrutinized, and that no <lb/>
            attention should be paid to such as were ignorant of the true <lb/>
            faith, whose lives were irregular, or who came from the <lb/>
            houses of Christ's enemies. At length he suffered martyrdom <lb/>
            on the nones [5th] of April, and at his death the bishopric <lb/>
            was vacant fourteen days.</p>
          <p>TELESPHORUS, a Greek, held the see eleven years, three <lb/>
            months, twenty-one days, in the time of Antonine and <lb/>
            Marcus Aurelius. This pope ordained that the fast before <lb/>
            Easter should last seven weeks, and the midnight mass at the <lb/>
            feast of the Nativity, and introduced the hymn of the angels, <lb/>
            that is the " Gloria in excelsis," as the commencement of the <lb/>
            holy office. He was at length martyred on the Jones [5th] <lb/>
            of January. The see was then vacant for seven days.1</p>
          <p>HYGINUS, an Athenian, who had been a philosopher, held <lb/>
            the bishopric four years, three months, four days, in the <lb/>
            time of Verus and Marcus. He forbade metropolitans to hear <lb/>
            causes in the absence of all the bishops of their provinces; <lb/>
            and bishops without the assistance of their clergy; otherwise <lb/>

            observed three times a year, of corn, wine, and oil, according <lb/>
            to the prophecy the fourth, the seventh, and the tenth. <lb/>
            At last he was martyred on the third of the ides [14th] of <lb/>
            October, under the emperor Alexander, and the see was <lb/>
            void six days. At that time Calepodius the priest, with <lb/>
            Astirius and Palmatius, consular men, and two hundred of <lb/>

          <p>URBAN, a Roman, sat four years, ten months, and twelve <lb/>

            Holy Ghost by the imposition of the bishop's hands, after <lb/>
            baptism, for their confirmation in the Christian faith. In <lb/>

            it, and if he fails let him suffer the punishment he would <lb/>
            have had inflicted on another." This pope suffered martyr­ <lb/>

            January], and the bishopric was in abeyance seven days.2</p>
          <p>CORNELIUS, a Roman, sat two years, two months, and <lb/>
            three days.3 This pope disinterred the apostles' remains <lb/>
            by night, at the request of St. Lucina. He deposited <lb/>
            the body of St. Paul on the road to Ostia, and that of <lb/>
            St. Peter in the temple of Apollo on the golden mount at <lb/>
            the Vatican.4 Cornelius was exiled to Centum Cellæ in the <lb/>
            reign of Decius, but was afterwards brought back to Rome, <lb/>
            where he made many conversions, and was beheaded on the <lb/>

            At length he was beheaded on the eighth of the ides [6th] <lb/>
            of August with six deacons—Felicissimus, Agapitus, Janu­ <lb/>

            Melchiades the bishop, with the holy priests and deacons, to <lb/>
            perform the obsequies of the martyr for Christ. Timotheus <lb/>
            was thus honourably interred in the garden of Theona, a <lb/>
            Christian matron, near the tomb of St. Paul. But Silvester <lb/>
            was arrested by order of Perpenna Tarquin, and thrown into <lb/>
            prison to be tortured on the morrow as a confessor of <lb/>
            Christ. Meanwhile, however, the prefect, while at dinner, <lb/>
            was choked by a fish-bone in his throat, and Silvester was <lb/>
            joyously released from prison, while his persecutor was car­ <lb/>
            ried with mourning to the grave. Silvester was thirty <lb/>
            years old when he was ordained deacon, and soon afterwards, <lb/>
            at the entreaty of all the people, he was ordained priest by <lb/>
            Melchiades the holy bishop. On his death, Silvester was <lb/>
            unanimously elected pope. He was illustrious for his virtues, <lb/>
            and the merit of his sanctity procured for him the esteem <lb/>
            of all men.</p>
          <p>An enormous dragon appeared on the Tarpeian mount, on <lb/>
            which the Capitol stands, and the magicians with the sacri­ <lb/>
            legious virgins resorted to it once a month, with sacrifices <lb/>
            and offerings, descending three hundred and forty-five steps, <lb/>
            as if they were going to the infernal regions. The dragon <lb/>
            rose suddenly, and though he did not go forth, his breath so <lb/>
            poisoned the air of the neighbourhood, that it caused a <lb/>
            great mortality, and especially there was much lamentation <lb/>
            for the death of children. At length, the heathen, having <lb/>
            entreated Silvester's help, he enjoined a three-days' fast on <lb/>
            the Christians, after which, as he had been instructed in a <lb/>
            vision by St. Peter the apostle, he descended with three <lb/>
            priests and two deacons, and in the might of God chained <lb/>
            up the dragon, so that the whole city, from that day and <lb/>
            ever afterwards, delivered from its pestiferous breath, gave <lb/>
            thanks to God. Many of the Romans who witnessed this, <lb/>
            having thus escaped the plague of the dragon, and believing <lb/>
            in Christ, were baptized.</p>
          <p>The emperor Constantine, compelling the Christians to <lb/>
            sacrifice to idols, and making great slaughter among those <lb/>
            who refused to worship images, Silvester retired from the <lb/>
            city, with his clergy, and concealed himself for some time on <lb/>
            Mount Soracte, devoted to fasting and prayer. The avenging <lb/>
            hand of God, however, struck Constantine with elephantine <pb n="326"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II. CH. XVIII."/><lb/>
            leprosy, and thus checked the effusion of the blood of his <lb/>
            servants. The emperor, in despair at such a calamity, <lb/>
            inquired anxiously for some cure for his disorder, and by <lb/>
            the abominable counsel of the priests of the Capitol, ordered <lb/>
            a crowd of infants, to the number of three thousand, to be <lb/>
            massacred, that a bath might be prepared of their blood, in <lb/>
            which, plunging while it was yet reeking, he was told his <lb/>
            leprosy would be cured. But when Constantine went forth <lb/>
            from his palace to the baths, and perceived crowds of women <lb/>
            bitterly bewailing the [threatened] slaughter of their child­ <lb/>
            ren ; he inquired the cause of such great lamentation, and <lb/>
            learning the fact, was dreadfully shocked. He condemned <lb/>
            such savage cruelty, and extolling the humanity of the Ro­ <lb/>
            man government in a long and eloquent speech, ordered the <lb/>
            children to be restored to their mothers unharmed, adding <lb/>
            liberal gifts, with provisions and carriages, and thus sent <lb/>
            them away to their homes rejoicing.</p>
          <p>The night following, the blessed apostles Peter and Paul <lb/>
            appeared to him in a vision, and admonished by them, he <lb/>
            recalled Silvester and his clergy, and heard from his mouth <lb/>
            instruction in the true way of salvation, and truly submitted <lb/>
            to him in all things. Then the pope imposed on himself <lb/>
            and the whole Christian population a week's fast, at the end <lb/>
            of which, on Saturday evening, he ordered the laver of sal­ <lb/>
            vation to be prepared in the Lateran palace, and consecrated <lb/>
            it according to the ritual. Constantine was then baptized, <lb/>
            and while a bright light shone round for nearly half an <lb/>
            hour, he was cleansed of his leprosy, and confessed that he <lb/>
            had seen Christ.</p>
          <p>By command of the emperor Constantine, a council of <lb/>
            forty-four bishops was assembled at Rome. In it Pope <lb/>
            Silvester disputed with twelve of the most learned Jews, <lb/>
            overwhelming them by God's help, with a mass of powerful <lb/>
            authorities. He contended against the rabbins Abiathar and <lb/>
            Joases, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are <lb/>
            one God. Against the scribes Godoliah and Anna, he <lb/>
            showed clearly, from the books of the prophets, that Christ <lb/>
            was born of a virgin, tempted by the devil, betrayed by a <lb/>
            disciple, arrested by his enemies, mocked and scourged; <lb/>
            that he drank vinegar, and was sold; that his garments were <lb/>
            divided by lot; that he was nailed to the cross, dead, and <pb n="327"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 314—335.]"/><lb/>
            buried. Against Dohet and Chusi, masters, and Bonoin <lb/>
            and Arohel, interpreters of the law, he showed the vast <lb/>
            benefits arising from the incarnation, the temptation, and <lb/>
            the passion of Christ. Against the pharisees Jobal and <lb/>
            Thara, it was authoritatively maintained that Jesus Christ <lb/>
            is perfect God and perfect man, who, in his human nature, <lb/>
            was tempted, suffered, and died, that he might procure the <lb/>
            salvation of all men; but the divine nature was exempt <lb/>
            from suffering, as the light which shines upon a tree, when <lb/>
            an incision is made by the stroke of an axe, receives no <lb/>
            impression. A copious argument was sustained by Seleon <lb/>
            the priest, that the Son of God is rightly called the Lamb <lb/>
            without spot, because he was slain for the offences of the <lb/>
            whole people. He was born of the virgin, that we may be <lb/>
            horn of our virgin mother the church. He was thrice <lb/>
            tempted, that he might deliver us from the like temptation; <lb/>
            taken, that we may be set free; bound, that we may be <lb/>
            liberated from the bonds of the curse; mocked, that he <lb/>
            might deliver us from the illusions of the demons; sold, <lb/>
            that he might redeem us; humbled, that we might be <lb/>
            exalted; a captive, that he might deliver us out of captivity <lb/>
            to the demons; stripped, that the nakedness of the first <lb/>
            man, by which death entered into the world, might be <lb/>
            covered ; crowned with thorns, that he might eradicate from <lb/>
            us the thorns and thistles of the original curse; having gall <lb/>
            for meat, and vinegar for drink, that he might bring us into <lb/>
            a land flowing with milk and honey; and finally, sacrificed <lb/>
            on the altar of the cross, that he might take away the sins <lb/>
            of the whole world. Here the cause of the devil failed, <lb/>
            who, having set calf against calf, and goat against goat, <lb/>
            could not find a lamb to set against the Lamb without spot. <lb/>
            Our King died, that he might subdue the power of death; <lb/>
            he was buried, that he might consecrate the tombs of the <lb/>
            saints; he rose again, that be might give life to the dead; he <lb/>
            ascended into heaven, that be might not only restore to man <lb/>
            the paradise he has lost, but might also open to him the <lb/>
            gates of heaven. He now sits at the right hand of the <lb/>
            leather, that he may grant the prayers of believers; and he <lb/>
            will come to judge the living and the dead, that he may <lb/>
            render unto every one according to his works. This is the <lb/>
            true faith of Christians.</p><pb n="328"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">[B. II. CH. XVIII.</note>When Silvester bad argued these and many other matters <lb/>
            with great force, and Seleon, in the silence of the other <lb/>
            Jews, had commended the statements of the pope, Zambri <lb/>
            the twelfth, who was a very skilful magician, put himself <lb/>
            forward in opposition. This man chose to contend, not with <lb/>
            the authentic words of scripture, but with magic arts, de­ <lb/>
            manding that a mad bull should be brought to him in the <lb/>
            presence of them all. The pope and the emperor assenting, <lb/>
            presently the bull of Terence, who was so fierce that a hun­ <lb/>
            dred stout soldiers could hardly hold him, was brought in; <lb/>
            And upon Zambri's whispering something secretly into its <lb/>
            ear, the wretched animal groaned, and its eyes leaping from <lb/>
            their sockets, instantly expired. Upon this, the crowd of <lb/>
            Jews began to insult Silvester, and for nearly two hours <lb/>
            there was a violent tumult. The emperor, having at length <lb/>
            enforced silence, Silvester, advancing to the magician, <lb/>
            demanded whether he could restore to life, in the name of <lb/>
            the Lord, the bull which he bad just put to death. This <lb/>
            Zambri was unable to do, but he declared loudly and swore, <lb/>
            by the life of the emperor, that if Silvester would recover <lb/>
            the bull from death, all the Jews would renounce the law of <lb/>
            Moses, and embrace the religion of Christ. Hearing this, <lb/>
            the holy pontiff spread out his hands, and prayed for some <lb/>
            time in tears, and on bended knees. His prayers being <lb/>
            ended, he drew near to the bull, and cried with a loud voice : <lb/>
            " In the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified by the Jews <lb/>
            under Pontius Pilate, rise up, and stand quickly." The <lb/>
            animal immediately arose, and the holy bishop, having set <lb/>
            free its horns from the bonds, " Go peaceably," he said, "to <lb/>
            the herd to which you belong." And the bull immediately <lb/>
            returned to the herd with all gentleness. Then all the Jews <lb/>
            threw themselves at the feet of Silvester, and entreated that <lb/>
            they might be regenerated by the water of baptism.</p>
          <p>Helena, herself, the emperor's mother, appeared in public <lb/>
            without reserve, kissing the feet of the pope in the sight of <lb/>
            all, and begging him to assign her a place of penance. At <lb/>
            the same moment, many demons came out of the bodies <lb/>
            they had taken possession of, confessing that they were <lb/>
            compelled to depart by the commands of St. Silvester.</p>
          <p>In the disputation between the Jews and Christians, <lb/>
            which has been already mentioned, the empower and senate <pb n="329"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 335.]</note><lb/>
            appointed Zenophilus and Crato censors and umpires, the <lb/>
            one being a Greek and the other a Latin. Both were skil­ <lb/>
            ful orators, men of ,,-it, and lovers of truth, and had been for <lb/>
            a long time held in the highest esteem in the Roman court, <lb/>
            as men of probity and contemners of avarice. Both were <lb/>
            heathens, so that they might favour neither party on account <lb/>
            of religions, but study only to promote justice, neither <lb/>
            Christians nor Jews suspecting them of inclining to their <lb/>
            side.</p>
          <p>On the triumph of the Christian cause through Silvester, <lb/>
            many gentiles as well as Jews believed, and as the <lb/>
            controversy was held in the beginning of the first month, <lb/>
            they changed their names, and were baptized at Easter. <lb/>
            From that time the Lord's name began to be magnified by <lb/>
            the Roman people, and the company of the faithful <lb/>
            throughout the world to be strengthened, and greatly exalted <lb/>
            everywhere by the power of God.</p>
          <p>At the command of Constantine, Silvester assembled a <lb/>
            council of 318 bishops at Nice, in Bithynia, and of 227 at <lb/>
            Rome. It was decreed that no layman should prosecute a <lb/>
            charge against a clerk, and that the oppressed should choose <lb/>
            their own judges. Deacons were to wear dalmatics, and to <lb/>
            cover their right arm with a linen napkin. No clerk was to <lb/>
            proceed in the civil courts for any cause whatever, nor to <lb/>
            plead before any judge except in the ecclesiastical court. <lb/>
            The sacrifice of the mass was not to be celebrated with a silk <lb/>
            or coloured altar-cloth, but with one of linen only, as it is <lb/>
            read our Lord's body was so wrapped by Joseph at his burial. <lb/>
            Whoever wishes to become a soldier of the church, and to <lb/>
            rise in the ranks, he must be a reader for twenty years, an <lb/>
            exorcist for thirty days, an acolyte five years, a sub-deacon <lb/>
            five years, a deacon seven years, a priest three years; and <lb/>
            afterwards, if he be worthy, he may be made a bishop. <lb/>
            Silvester died at last, after a long course of excellence, on <lb/>
            the sixth of the calends of January [31st December].1 The <lb/>
            see was vacant 165 days. <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Silvester's feast occurs in the Roman breviary on this day. It <lb/>
            need hardly be remarked, that almost all our author has said of him is of <lb/>
            a legendary character. It does not appear even that the council of Nice <lb/>
            was convoked by the pope; and his great age not allowing him to be <lb/>

            Ardea, where he was buried, and the other in the city of <lb/>

            ten months in exile for the Catholic faith; but after the <lb/>

            was three years in exile for the faith ; but afterwards, joining <lb/>
            the party of the Arians, he was recalled by Ursatius and <lb/>
            Valens, the heretical priests, and violently persecuted the <lb/>
            Catholics. At length he was interred on the seventh of the <lb/>

            time, but being expelled from Rome he was made bishop of <lb/>
            Naples. Damasus merits great praise for his virtues. He <lb/>
            made researches for, and discovered, many remains of saints <lb/>
            to whose memory he composed verses. Being maliciously <lb/>
            accused of adultery by two deacons, Concordius and Calixtus, <lb/>
            he was acquitted of the charge, and his accusers condemned <lb/>
            by a synod of forty-four bishops. He ordered the psalms <lb/>
            to be sung regularly day and night in the churches, and <lb/>
            transmitted a decree to that effect to the priests and bishops <lb/>
            and monasteries. Damasus had a great regard for St. Jerome <lb/>
            the interpreter of the divine law, supporting him with his <lb/>
            pontifical authority, and encouraging him to establish the <lb/>
            true sense of the scriptures. He ordained sixty-two bishops <lb/>
            in different cities. He was buried near his mother, in the <lb/>
            church which he built on the road to Ardea, on the third of <lb/>

            the clergy, and people, in great triumph. However, Festus, <lb/>
            chief of the senate, and Probinus, ex-consuls, and other <lb/>
            senators, commenced disturbances in the city, and attacked <lb/>
            all who were in communion with Symmachus with such <lb/>
            violence that they even dragged nuns from their convents <lb/>
            and retreats, and, regardless of their sex, scourged them <lb/>
            until their naked bodies were wounded with the stripes. <lb/>
            They fought daily against a church in the middle of the city, <lb/>
            where many priests and others of the faithful were slain. <lb/>
            Among others, Dignissiulus and Gordian, priests, were taken <lb/>
            and slain with staves and swords, as well as many other <lb/>
            Christians. None of the clergy were safe in the city, by <note type="footnote"> 1 November 22, 493—July 19, 514. The consecration of Symmachus <lb/>

            night or by day; and Faustus, the ex-consul, was the only <lb/>
            one who fought for the church. Notwithstanding, Sym­ <lb/>
            machus maintained himself from the consulship of Paulinus <lb/>
            to that of Senator. He drove into banishment the <lb/>
            Manicheans, whom he discovered at Rome, and burnt their <lb/>
            images and books before the gates of the basilica of <lb/>
            Constantine. He enriched the churches of the saints with <lb/>
            a variety of ornaments, and ordained one hundred and <lb/>
            seventeen bishops. He ordered the angelic hymn1 to be <lb/>
            sung every Sunday. Every year he supplied money and <lb/>
            clothes to the bishops who were banished to Africa and <lb/>
            Sardinia. He ransomed captives in Liguria and other <lb/>
            provinces, and distributed largely to the poor. After many <lb/>
            good works he was interred in the church of St. Peter, on <lb/>
            the nineteenth day of the month of July; and the bishopric <lb/>
            was vacant seven days.</p>
          <p>HORMISDAS, born in Campania, son of Justus, of the city <lb/>
            of Frusinone, filled the see eight years, and seventeen days. <lb/>
            By the advice of King Theodoric he sent to Constantinople <lb/>
            Eunodius, bishop of Pavia; and Fortunatus, bishop of <lb/>
            Catania; to absolve the Greeks who had been excom­ <lb/>
            municated on account of the heresies of Peter, bishop of <lb/>
            Alexandria; and Acacius of Constantinople. But the <lb/>
            emperor Anastasius, favouring the Eutychian heresy, sent <lb/>
            back the envoys in great haste, and in his rescript to the <lb/>
            pope, among other things, said haughtily: "It is ours to <lb/>
            command, not to be commanded.”Not long afterwards, by <lb/>
            God's permission, he was struck with thunder. He was <lb/>
            succeeded by Justin, a Catholic, who willingly submitted to <lb/>
            the directions of the pope in all things, and received with <lb/>
            honour Germanus, bishop of Capua, and the other envoys <lb/>
            from the apostolic see, who were conducted by the consul <lb/>
            Vitalian, and a great company of monks and men of rank, <lb/>
            from the Round Tower to the city of Constantinople. Some <lb/>
            of the clergy who were accomplices with Acacius, envious of <lb/>
            such a triumph, shut themselves up in the great church of <lb/>
            St. Sophia, and taking counsel together, sent a message to <lb/>
            the emperor, that unless Acacius, their bishop, was <lb/>
            unconditionally restored, they would refuse submission to <lb/>
            the apostolic see. At this time, Clovis, king of the Franks, <note type="footnote"> 1 The Gloria in Excelsis, mentioned before, p. 318. </note> <pb n="339"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 523—526.]"/><lb/>
            becoming a Christian, sent an offering to the tomb of St- <lb/>
            Peter the Apostle, with precious jewels. The aforenamed <lb/>
            pope flourished from the consulship of Senator to the time of <lb/>
            Symmachus and Boëtius, and ordained fifty-five bishops in <lb/>
            different places. He was interred in the church of St. Peter, <lb/>
            the Apostle, on the eighth of the ides [6th] of August. <lb/>
            The bishopric was vacant seven days.1</p>
          <p>JOHN, a native of Tuscany, son of Constantius, sat two <lb/>
            years, nine months, and sixteen days, from the consulship of <lb/>
            Maximus to that of Olibrius. At that time Justin, the <lb/>
            orthodox emperor, wished to extinguish all heresies, and <lb/>
            have the churches in which they were taught consecrated <lb/>
            to the true faith. At this Theodoric Walamir, being a <lb/>
            heretic, was much incensed, and determined on ravaging <lb/>
            the whole of Italy with the sword. Pope John was re­ <lb/>
            quested by the king at Ravenna to undertake a mission to <lb/>
            Constantinople, which, though he was sick, he accomplished, <lb/>
            and while there gave sight to a blind man. He was received <lb/>
            with great honour by the emperor Justin whom he crowned, <lb/>
            and obtained from him indulgence for the heretics to save <lb/>
            Italy from devastation. Meanwhile, the heretic king put <lb/>
            to death the illustrious senators and ex-consuls Symmachus <lb/>
            and Boethius. Pope John also, and the senators who had <lb/>
            been honourably entertained by the emperor, were treache­ <lb/>
            rously arrested by Theodoric on their return; and the pope <lb/>
            was imprisoned at Ravenna and suffered martyrdom on the <lb/>
            fifteenth of the calends of June [18th May]. Theodoric <lb/>
            himself, by the will of God, died suddenly ninety-eight days <lb/>
            afterwards. Pope John consecrated fifteen bishops. His <note type="footnote"> 1 A.D. 514—523. The mission of the bishops of Pavia and Catania to <lb/>
            Constantinople took place in 515. It was on a second mission, in 517, <lb/>
            that the emperor Anastasius made a reply in much the same terms as are <lb/>
            here reported. Doubts are entertained whether he was really struck by <lb/>
            lightning on the 8th of July of the year following, as also before stated, p. <lb/>
            113. It is certain, however, that he expired in the midst of the fright <lb/>
            occasioned by the thunder storm. Justin succeeded him the next day. <lb/>
            The pope's legates arrived at Constantinople the 25th of March, 519. It <lb/>
            has been already observed, that Acacius was dead ten years before. The <lb/>
            dispute respecting him was limited to the question whether his name <lb/>
            should be retained in the diptichs. The resistance made by part of the <lb/>
            clergy entrenched in Sta. Sophia is a mere fable. It was not with this <lb/>
            pope, Iut with his predecessor Anastasius, that Clovis corresponded after his <lb/>
            conversion. </note> <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>

            body was translated from Ravenna to the church of St. <lb/>
            Peter at Rome; and the bishopric was vacant fifty-eight <lb/>
            days.1</p>
          <p>FELIX, a Samnite, son of Castorius, filled the see four <lb/>
            years, two months, and thirteen days, in the time of The­ <lb/>
            odoric, and Alaric his nephew, and of the emperor Justinian, <lb/>
            from the consulship of Tiburtius to that of Lampadius and <lb/>
            Orestes. He was inaugured without tumult, and ordained <lb/>
            twenty-nine bishops. lie was interred in the church of St. <lb/>
            Paul the Apostle on the fourth of the ides [12th] of Oc­ <lb/>
            tober. The bishopric was vacant three days.2</p>
          <p>BONIFACE, born at Rome, whose father's name was Sigi­ <lb/>
            buld, sat two years, twenty-five days, in the time of Alaric, <lb/>
            the heretic, and the emperor Justinian. At his election there <lb/>
            was great dissension, both among the clergy and in the <lb/>
            senate, for twenty-eight days. Dioscorus was consecrated <lb/>
            at the same time in the basilica of Constantine; but, by <lb/>
            God's will, he died shortly afterwards on the second of the <lb/>
            ides [14th] of October. He had numerous partisans. As for <lb/>
            Boniface, he gave dishes of meat to the priests and deacons, <lb/>
            and notaries, supplied from his own patrimony, and made <lb/>
            abundant provision of food for the clergy when famine <lb/>
            threatened. He assembled a synod in the church of St. <lb/>
            Peter, and chose the deacon Vigilius for his successor, but <lb/>
            afterwards, repenting his having subscribed the act, erased <lb/>
            his signature in the presence of the clergy and senate. He <lb/>
            was interred at St. Peter's on the seventeenth day of the <lb/>
            month of October, and the see was void two months fifteen <lb/>
            days.3</p>
          <p>JOHN MERCURY, a Roman, son of Projectus, of the Cœlian <lb/>
            Mount, filled the see two years, four months, six days, in <lb/>
            the time of Alaric and Justinian. That pious emperor, <note type="footnote"> 1 A.D. 523—526. In speaking of heresies in this paragraph, the Arians <lb/>

            actuated by warm devotion to the Christian religion drew <lb/>
            up a statement of his belief, which he sent to the apostolical <lb/>
            see, with his own signature and many valuable gifts, by <lb/>
            'the hands of Eparchius and Demetrius. John consecrated <lb/>
            twenty-one bishops. He was interred at St. Peter's on the <lb/>
            sixth of the calends of June [27th May], and the see was <lb/>
            void six days.1</p>
          <p>AGAPITUS, a Roman, son of Gordian, a priest, filled the <lb/>
            see eleven months, eighteen days. Theodotus, king of the <lb/>
            Goths, who had put to death Amalasonta, daughter of king <lb/>
            Theodoric, sent him to Justinian the emperor, by whom he <lb/>
            was honourably received at Constantinople. While there <lb/>
            he procured the banishment of Anthemius, bishop of that <lb/>
            city, because he denied the two natures of Christ. Having <lb/>
            consecrated Mennas, a Catholic, bishop of Constantinople, <lb/>
            he died there on the tenth of the calends of May [22nd <lb/>
            April.] His body was conveyed to Rome in a leaden coffin, <lb/>
            and interred at St. Peter's on the twelfth of October, and <lb/>
            the bishopric was vacant one month twenty-eight days.2</p>
          <p>SILVERIUS, a native of Campania, son of Hormisdas, <lb/>
            bishop of Rome, sat one year, five months, six days. He <lb/>
            owed his elevation to the tyrant Theodotus, who was in­ <lb/>
            duced by bribery to effect it by violence and terror. Two <lb/>
            months afterwards, by God's will, Theodotus died, and <lb/>
            Witigis having carried off and married the daughter of <lb/>
            Amalasonta, ascended the throne. The emperor Justinian <lb/>
            commissioned Belisarius the patrician to deliver Italy from <lb/>
            the Goths. The patrician consequently laid siege to Naples, <lb/>
            which he took by storm, putting all the Goths and citizens <lb/>
            to the sword, so that not even the priests and nuns in the <lb/>
            monasteries escaped. Soon after this Witigis, collecting an <lb/>
            army of Goths, besieged Rome for a whole year, vast num­ <lb/>
            bers perishing by the sword as well as by the famine which <lb/>
            now prevailed throughout the world. No one was allowed <lb/>
            to enter or depart from the city. All property, private and <lb/>
            public, not excepting the churches, was destroyed by fire, <lb/>
            and the inhabitants were either butchered, or fell victims to <lb/>

            Belisarius to defeat the Goths and save Rome. The em­ <lb/>
            press requested Silverius to recall the heretic Anthemius, <lb/>
            but the pope putting his trust in God refused compliance, <lb/>
            and defended the sentence of his predecessors by his own <lb/>
            authority. Upon this, the empress commanded Belisarius <lb/>
            the patrician to send Silverius into exile, and to substitute <lb/>
            Anthemius as his vicar-general in the church of Rome. <lb/>
            Belisarius very reluctantly complied with the orders of the <lb/>
            empress, and the pope being charged by false witnesses <lb/>
            with plotting to deliver up Rome to the Gothic king, by <lb/>
            introducing him at the Asinarian gate near the Lateran, he <lb/>
            was arrested in the Pincian palace. Antonine, the patrician, <lb/>
            then sharply rebuked the pope, and John the sub-deacon, <lb/>
            removing the pallium from his shoulders, divested him of <lb/>
            his pontifical robes in his chambers and dressed him as a <lb/>
            monk. Silverius was banished to the island of Pontia, <lb/>
            where, after great suffering, and being reduced to bread and <lb/>
            water for sustenance, he was buried on the twelfth of the <lb/>
            calends of July [20th June]. He consecrated eighteen <lb/>
            bishops, and after his death performed many miracles in <lb/>
            healing the sick. The see was void fourteen days.1</p>
          <p>VIGILIUS, a Roman, son of the consul John, filled the <lb/>
            see fifteen years, six months, twenty-six days. At this time <lb/>
            Belisarius defeated Witigis, and John, the bloody master- <lb/>
            general of the army, pursued him all night and made him <lb/>
            prisoner. The captive king being conducted to Constan­ <lb/>
            tinople, Justinian received him into favour, and creating <lb/>
            him patrician and count, sent him to reside on the Persian <lb/>
            frontier, where he remained until his death. The emperor <lb/>
            also conferred on Belisarius the highest military dignity, and <lb/>
            employed him in Africa. Deceiving Guittarith, king of the <lb/>
            Vandals, with friendly professions, Belisarius put him to <lb/>
            death, and restored Africa to the dominion of Rome, from <lb/>
            which it had been detached ninety-nine years. He then <lb/>
            visited Rome, and made many offerings to God and St. <note type="footnote"> 1 A.D. 536—538. Theodotus was killed towards the month of August, <lb/>
            536. Belisarius came from Sicily to Italy in the spring of that year; took <lb/>
            Naples after a siege of twenty-two days, and entered Rome the 10th of <lb/>
            December. The siege of Rome by Witigis was in 537—538. Silverius <lb/>
            was first banished to Patara in Lycia, afterwards to the island of Palmaria - <lb/>
            on the coast of Italy, where he was starved to death. </note> <pb n="343"/>

            Peter, distributing also alms to the poor, from the spoils of <lb/>
            the Vandals.</p>
          <p>The Empress Theodora urged Pope Vigilius, also, to <lb/>
            recall the heresiarch Anthemius, but he positively refused, <lb/>
            adhering strictly to the opinions of his predecessors. At <lb/>
            the suggestion therefore of some ill-disposed Romans, who <lb/>
            imputed the death of Silverius to the pope, Anthemius <lb/>
            sent an imperial commissioner, arrested Pope Vigilius in <lb/>
            the church of St. Cecilia, and carried him to Constantinople <lb/>
            by way of Sicily. For two years the Greeks used the whole <lb/>
            influence of the imperial authority to induce him to recall <lb/>
            the heretic, as he had promised when he filled the office of <lb/>
            deacon. But the pope persisted in his refusal, preferring <lb/>
            an honourable death to a dishonourable life. At length, <lb/>
            when upon his strongly declaring his resolution in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Justinian and Theodora, some one struck him in <lb/>
            the face, the pope fled to the church of St. Euphemia, and <lb/>
            clung to the pillar of the altar. But he was forced out of <lb/>
            the church and dragged round the city by a rope about his <lb/>
            neck till the evening. He was then committed to close <lb/>
            custody, and the Roman clergy who had attended him were <lb/>
            sent to different mines.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Goths elected Totila king, and soon after­ <lb/>
            wards laid siege to Rome. During the continuance of the <lb/>
            siege the famine in the city was so severe that mothers <lb/>
            were ready to feed on their own children. Totila at length <lb/>
            gained entrance into the city, of which he held possession <lb/>
            for some time, the people sheltering themselves in the <lb/>
            churches. But afterwards the emperor sent Narses his <lb/>
            eunuch and chamberlain into Italy, who defeated the army <lb/>
            of Totila who fell in the battle. The emperor Justinian <lb/>
            was full of joy at this intelligence, and on the petition of <lb/>
            Narses and the Romans set at liberty Pope Vigilius and his <lb/>
            clergy; but he died of stone at Syracuse. His body was <lb/>
            brought to Rome and interred in the church of St. Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus, on the Salarian road, when the see was void three <lb/>
            months and five days. This pope consecrated eighty-one <lb/>

            He was consecrated by two bishops, John of Perugium <lb/>

            Numbers of the religious, and well-informed, and noble <lb/>
            persons separated from his communion in the persuasion <lb/>
            that Pelagius was a party to the death of Pope Vigilius, in <lb/>
            consequence of the sufferings he had undergone. Pope <lb/>
            Pelagius, therefore, and Narses consulted, and a procession <lb/>
            having been formed from the church of St. Pancras, when <lb/>
            litanies were sung, and hymns and anthems chanted, on <lb/>
            their arrival at St. Peter's, the pope ascended a pulpit, <lb/>
            holding the gospels in his hand with the crucifix raised on <lb/>
            high, and satisfied the people that he had done no injury to <lb/>
            Vigilius. He consecrated forty-nine bishops. Pelagius was <lb/>
            buried at St. Peter's on the 6th of the nones [2nd] of March. <lb/>
            The bishopric was vacant three months, and twenty-five days.'</p>
          <p>JOHN, a Roman, son of the illustrious Anastasius, filled the <lb/>
            see twelve years, eleven months, and twenty-six days. At <lb/>
            that time the Heruli having elected Sindbal their king, <lb/>
            were bent on subjugating the whole of Italy, but Narses <lb/>
            slew their king and entirely defeated them. He also, by <lb/>
            God's aid, put to death Amingus [Lothaire], and Buceline, <lb/>
            chiefs of the Franks, who invaded Italy, to which he restored <lb/>
            peace and prosperity. The Romans, however, from envy, <lb/>
            accused him to Justinian, and raised disturbances against <lb/>
            his government. Nurses therefore, upon finding himself <lb/>
            deprived of his dignities by the emperor, called in the <note type="footnote"> lifetime of his predecessor, but we date his popedom from the death <lb/>
            of Silverius. Witigis was taken prisoner, and sent to Constantinople in <lb/>
            540. Belisarius's expedition to Africa was undertaken in 532, and the <lb/>
            war ended by the captivity of Gelimer, king of the Vandals, in 534, <lb/>
            Nothing is known of the person our author calls Guittarith, and his <lb/>
            murder by Belisarius. The latter returned from Africa to Rome in the <lb/>
            beginning of 547, soon after the pillage of the city by Totila. Vigilius <lb/>
            arrived at Constantinople the 25th of January. We have no other account <lb/>
            of the ill treatment he received in 551, proceeding to the length of his <lb/>
            being buffeted in the presence of the emperor and empress; indeed Theo­ <lb/>
            dora was not then living, having died in 548. Rome was taken by Totila <lb/>
            the second time in 549. Pope Vigilius died at Syracuse the 10th of <lb/>

            one bishops, and was buried in the church of St. Peter <lb/>

          <p>BENEDICT, a, Roman, SOIl of Boniface, sat four years, one <lb/>
            month, and twenty-eight days.2 King Alboin led the <lb/>
            Lombards into Italy in the year of our Lord 568. A great <lb/>
            famine then afflicted Italy and compelled it to submit to <lb/>
            Alboin. Upon learning this, the emperor Justinian sent to <lb/>
            Egypt, and causing ships loaded with corn to be despatched <lb/>
            to Rome, thus saved the city from the famine which <lb/>
            threatened it. This emperor, for his numerous victories over <lb/>
            foreign enemies, received the surnames of Alamannicus, <lb/>
            Gothicus, Vandalicus, and Africanus. He founded a church, <lb/>
            within the walls of Constantinople to the honour of Christ, <lb/>
            which is called in Greek "Hagia," meaning Santa Sophia. <lb/>
            This building so surpasses all others that it stands unrivalled <lb/>
            among all the edifices in the world. Justinian was a prince <lb/>
            devoted to the Catholic faith, pure in his conduct and just <lb/>
            in his judgments, so that he succeeded in all his enterprises. <lb/>
            In his time Cassidorus, a senator who afterwards became a <lb/>
            monk, distinguished himself at Rome both in sacred and <lb/>
            profane learning. Among his other excellent works, one of <lb/>
            the principal is a commentary on the Psalms.</p>
          <p>At that time also Dionysius, who was made an abbot at <lb/>
            Rome, composed an admirable work on calculating Easter.</p>
          <p>Priscian, also, a native of Cæsarea, but established at <lb/>

            without the emperor's confirmation, because Rome was <lb/>
            besieged by the Lombards who were fearfully devastating <lb/>
            Italy. In his time there was much bloodshed and excessive <lb/>
            rain. The pope was suddenly carried off by a contagious <lb/>
            pestilence, and died on the 7th of the ides [7th] of February; <lb/>
            and was buried at St. Peter's. He consecrated forty-eight <lb/>

          <p>GREGORY, a Roman and philosopher, son of Gordian the <lb/>
            prætor, a man of the highest rank, and of the most excellent <lb/>
            Sylvia, presided over the Roman see thirteen years, six <lb/>
            months, ten days, in the reigns of the emperors Tiberius, <lb/>
            Constantine, Maurice, and Phocas.1 Gregory composed <lb/>
            forty homilies on the gospels; he wrote commentaries on <lb/>
            the Psalms and Ezekiel, and published a pastoral and a dia­ <lb/>
            logue, with many other works which we cannot stay to <lb/>
            enumerate. This incomparable doctor was highly distin­ <lb/>
            guished for deep wisdom and great learning, both in the <lb/>
            writings and discourses of his useful labours, by which he <lb/>
            rendered the greatest service to the sons of the church of <lb/>
            God. He added to the canon of the mass the words, "And <lb/>
            grant thy peace in our days," &amp;c.2 The Roman patrician <lb/>
            and exarch came to Rome while Gregory was pope, and <lb/>
            occasioned great troubles.3 On his return to Ravenna, he <lb/>
            seized the cities of Sutri, Bomarzo, Amelia, re'rouse, and <lb/>
            some others held by the Lombards. Upon this, the king <lb/>
            Agilulf, being greatly incensed, attacked Perouse with a <lb/>
            powerful army, besieging in it Maurision, general of the <lb/>
            Lombards, who had submitted to the Romans, whom he <lb/>
            made prisoner in a few days, and immediately put to death. <lb/>
            Not long afterwards, Agilulf, having returned to Pavia, <lb/>
            made a lasting peace with the Romans, through the media­ <lb/>
            tion of the blessed pope Gregory.</p>
          <p>At the same time, St. Gregory commissioned the servants <note type="footnote"> 1 September 3, 590—March 12, 604. It was not St. Gregory's father <lb/>
            who was prætor of Rome, but the bishop himself before his conversion. <lb/>
            His popedom did not correspond with the reign of Tiberius Constantine, <lb/>
            but only with those of the two other emperors here named. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The words added are, dies nostros in iua pace disponas, atque ab <lb/>

            the pope, having concluded a peace with the Lombards, <lb/>
            caused the granaries of the church to be opened, and corn <lb/>
            to be sold at the rate of thirty bushels of wheat for a <lb/>
            shilling. This pope was buried in the church of St. Peter, <lb/>

            in whose rebellion many had fallen. Peace, therefore, pre­ <lb/>

            Petronius, filled the see twelve years, eleven months, and <lb/>
            twenty-two days, in the time of the emperor Heraclius.2 His <lb/>
            good deeds were numerous and his teaching zealous. He <lb/>
            appointed that every Saturday there should be a procession, <lb/>
            departing from the,church of St. Apollinarius, and going to <lb/>
            St. Peter's, the people accompanying it with hymns and <lb/>
            spiritual songs. He consecrated eighty-one bishops, and <lb/>
            was buried on the fourth of the ides [12th] of October, in <lb/>
            the church of the blessed martyr St. Agnes, which be had <lb/>
            himself built from the foundation.3 The bishopric was vacant <lb/>
            one year, seven months, and seventeen days.</p>
          <p>SEVERIN, a Roman, son of Albienus, filled the see two <lb/>
            months and two days, under the emperor Heraclius. He <lb/>
            was mild and liberal, and very kind to the clergy and the <lb/>
            poor. In his time the Lateran palace was violently pillaged <lb/>
            by the Roman army under the command of Maurice, keeper <lb/>
            of the records, and Isaac, patrician and exarch. This pope, <lb/>
            having consecrated four bishops, was buried at St. Peter's, <lb/>
            on the nones [2nd] of August. The see was vacant three <lb/>
            months and twenty-four days.4</p>

            probable that Petronius held some local magistracy to which the name had <lb/>
            been transferred. It was revived in still later times as a title of honour, if <lb/>
            not of office. Not only do the early English historians sometimes use the <lb/>

          <p>THEODORE, a Greek, son of Bishop Theodore, and born <lb/>
            at Jerusalem, filled the see six years, five months, eighteen <lb/>
            days.2 At that time the abandoned Maurice, keeper of the <lb/>
            records, revolted against Isaac the patrician, and secured <lb/>
            the adhesion of the army and magistrates by oaths. But <lb/>

            close imprisonment to await their punishment.3 Isaac him­ <lb/>
            self, however, by God's will, soon after died suddenly, and <lb/>
            Theodore Calleopa was sent by the emperor to succeed him <lb/>
            in the government of Italy. Pope Theodore was very pious <lb/>
            and good. He deposed Pyrrhus and Paul, heretical bishops <lb/>
            of Constantinople,4 and consecrated forty-six bishops. He <lb/>
            was interred at St. Peter's, on the ides [15th] of May; and <lb/>

            overturned and stripped the altar belonging to the see of <lb/>

            insomuch that he had some of them placed in confinement, <lb/>
            some he sent into banishment, and others were subjected to <lb/>
            scourging. Hearing this, Pope Martin assembled one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and five bishops at Rome, and condemning the heretics, <lb/>
            confirmed the faith of the church of God. Afterwards, <lb/>
            however, at the instigation of Paul, the emperor Constantine <lb/>
            sent Theodore into Italy as exarch, and he caused Pope <lb/>

          <p>EUGENIUS, born at Rome in the first or Aventine quarter, <lb/>
            and son of Rufinian, was bred to the church from his <lb/>
            infancy. He filled the see two years, nine months, and <lb/>
            twenty-four days.2 He was a most excellent bishop, and <lb/>
            excommunicated Peter, bishop of Constantinople, for his <lb/>
            heresy.3 He consecrated twenty-one bishops; and was <lb/>
            buried at St. Peter's on the 4th of the nones [4th] of July. <lb/>

          <p>VITALIAN, born at Segni in Campania, and son of Ana­ <lb/>
            stasius, filled the see fourteen years and six months. He <lb/>
            was a strict observer of order, and consecrated ninety-seven <lb/>
            bishops. At that time the emperor Constans besieged <lb/>
            Romoald, the SOil of King Grimoald, in Beneventum, but <note type="footnote"> 1 The council assembled by Pope Martin was held in the month of <lb/>

            the city of the monuments which embellished it. He also <lb/>
            wrought much evil on the Italians and other nations who <lb/>
            owed him allegiance, but was soon afterwards assassinated <lb/>
            in Sicily by his own attendants while he was bathing. On <lb/>
            his death, the tyrant Mezentius usurped the throne. It <lb/>
            was now that the Saracens massacred vast numbers of the <lb/>
            Christians in Sicily. However, Pope Vitalian was then <lb/>
            dead, and was buried at St. Peter's on the 6th of the <lb/>
            calends of February [27th of January], and the bishopric <lb/>

          <p>ADEODATUS, a Roman who had been a monk, and son <lb/>
            of Jovian, filled the see four years, two months, and five days. <lb/>
            Mezentius was now put to death by the Italian army at <lb/>
            Syracuse, and his head, with those of several of the judges, <lb/>
            was carried to Constantinople. The Saracens then took <lb/>
            Syracuse, putting a multitude of the citizens to the sword, <lb/>
            and returned to Alexandria, carrying with them the rich <lb/>
            booty which the emperor Constans had lately brought from <lb/>
            Rome. This pope consecrated forty-six bishops, and was <lb/>
            interred at St. Peter's on the 6th of the calends of July <lb/>
            [21st of June]. The bishopric was void three months and <lb/>

            and thunder storms that the harvest could not be got in; <lb/>
            but the next year the grain sprung up self-sown.2</p>
          <p>DONUS, a Roman, son of Maurice, filled the see one year, <lb/>
            five months, and ten days. At that time a comet appeared <lb/>

            days, in the time of the emperors Constantine, Heraclius, <lb/>
            and Tiberius.2 At that time the moon was eclipsed for <lb/>
            eighteen days in the month of June.3 A great mortality <lb/>
            ensued; parents with three or four of their children being <lb/>
            carried to the grave together. The pope's legates were <lb/>
            honourably received by the emperors in the royal city, and <lb/>
            a general council of one hundred and fifty bishops of the east <lb/>
            was assembled to discuss the Catholic faith. George of <lb/>
            Constantinople, being convicted of heresy, submitted quietly <lb/>
            to its decision; but Macharius, bishop of Antioch, persisting <lb/>
            in his obstinacy, was condemned with his followers, and <lb/>
            being deposed by a unanimous decree was banished to <lb/>
            Rome.4 Theophanius was made abbot in the island of <lb/>
            Sicily. Pope Agatho consecrated eighteen bishops. He <lb/>

          <p>LEO the younger, a Sicilian by birth, son of Paul, sat ten <lb/>
            months and seventeen days. He was very eloquent, well <lb/>
            read in the sacred scriptures, learned in the Greek and <lb/>
            Latin languages, and he took the lead in chanting and <lb/>
            psalmody, and was zealous in all good works. He convoked <lb/>
            the sixth general council in the palace of the emperor Con­ <lb/>

            good works. He flourished in the time of Justinian and <lb/>
            Heraclius. At that time the moon was completely over­ <lb/>
            shadowed by a cloud, while the rest of the sky was clear, <lb/>

            vomited lava for ten days, and the whole neighbourhood <lb/>
            was destroyed by the ashes of the eruptions. This pope <lb/>
            consecrated twelve bishops; and was himself buried at St. <lb/>
            Peter's on the eighth of the ides [8th] of May. The see <lb/>

            filled the see thirteen years, eight months, and twenty-three <lb/>
            days, in the time of the emperor Justinian son of Constan­ <lb/>
            tine.2 On the death of Pope Conon, part of the people <lb/>
            elected Theodore the arch-priest, and another part Paschal, <lb/>
            the arch-deacon; but while there was great contention, the <lb/>
            clergy chose Sergius. Paschal had privately given a bribe <lb/>
            to John Plantinus, the exarch, hoping through him to <lb/>
            obtain forcible possession of the papacy, but he was disap­ <lb/>
            pointed.3 Some time afterwards he was dismissed from the <lb/>
            arch-deaconry for practising magical charms, and five years <lb/>
            afterwards died impenitent. The emperor Justinian ordered <lb/>
            a synod to be held in the imperial city, the acts of which <lb/>
            confirmed by his own signature, he sent to Pope Sergius at <lb/>
            Rome by the hands of Sergius, master of the offices.4 But <lb/>
            the pope, finding that some things were inserted contrary <lb/>
            to the decline of the church, refused his subscription. This: <note type="footnote"> 1 October 21, 686—September 21, 687. M. Le Prévost proposes to <lb/>

            The council in Trullo was held in 691, its decrees being subscribed by two <lb/>
            hundred and eleven bishops. In 692, the emperor sent them to the pope, <lb/>
            who did not even condescend to read them; and in 693 Zacharias, the <lb/>
            protospathaire, was sent to Rome to arrest Sergius. This enterprise cer­ <lb/>

            thaire, was despatched to Rome by the emperor with orders <lb/>
            to arrest the pope, and bring him to Constantinople. But <lb/>
            the Almighty stirred up the troops at Ravenna and the <lb/>
            Pentapolis, who marched to Rome and blockaded the city <lb/>
            gates, that they might have an opportunity of killing <lb/>
            Zachary, while he, much alarmed, fled to the pope's own chain­ <lb/>
            ber, and pusillanimously concealed himself under the bed in <lb/>
            terror of his life. The soldiery from Ravenna, entering Rome <lb/>
            by St. Peter's gate, beset the Lateran palace with their <lb/>
            armed bands, and when the gates were shut against them, <lb/>
            threatened to demolish them unless they were immediately <lb/>
            opened. Upon this, the holy pope went out and gave an <lb/>
            honourable reception to the soldiers and the people who <lb/>
            had hastily assembled for his protection, addressing them <lb/>
            in courteous terms, so that their fury was assuaged. But, <lb/>
            full of zeal for God and love for the prelate, they would not <lb/>
            relinquish the guard of the palace until they had driven <lb/>
            the before named spathaire from the city with disgrace. <lb/>
            His employer, also, the providence of God speedily so <lb/>
            ordering it, was driven from his throne, while the church of <lb/>
            God and its first bishop were by Christ's help preserved <lb/>
            in safety. Pope Sergius discovered by a divine revelation a <lb/>
            large piece of the true cross in a silver case in the sanctuary <lb/>
            of St. Peter's, and directed that it should be adored by the <lb/>
            people every year on the feast of the exaltation of the <lb/>
            cross.1 He also ordered that at the moment of breaking <lb/>
            the Lord's body, the Agnus Dei should be sung thrice by <lb/>

          <p>JOHN, a Greek, sat three years, two months, and twelve <lb/>
            days.1 By his intercession Theophylact, exarch of Italy, <lb/>
            was saved from being put to death in a tumult of the Roman <lb/>
            people. He also caused Gisulf, chief of the Lombards, who <lb/>
            burnt and ravaged Campania, to retire into his own states, <lb/>
            after receiving large sums for the ransom of his prisoners. <lb/>
            This pope consecrated fifteen bishops, and was buried at <lb/>
            St. Peter's, the see remaining void one month and eighteen <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>JOHN, a Greek, son of Plato, filled the see two years, six <lb/>
            months, and seventeen days. He flourished in the reigns of <lb/>
            Tiberius and Justinian,2 and was a most learned and elo­ <lb/>
            quent prelate. He also carefully repaired many of the <lb/>
            cemeteries of the saints and the churches which had fallen <lb/>
            to decay and become ruinous.3 It was then that Aribert, <lb/>
            king of the LOIn bards, son of Raginbert, duke of Turin, <lb/>
            restored to St. Peter the Cottian Alps, and recorded the <lb/>
            donation in a charter with golden letters.4 The emperor <lb/>
            Justinian also, by the aid of Turbel, king of the Bulgarians, <lb/>
            recovered the throne which he had lost, and caused the <lb/>
            usurpers Leo and Tiberius to be put to death in the circus <lb/>
            before all the people.5 Pope John ordained nineteen bishops. <lb/>
            He was buried at St. Peter's, before the altar of St. Mary, <lb/>
            mother of God, which he had himself erected, on the fifteenth <lb/>

          <p>CONSTANTINE, a Syrian, whose fathers name was John, <lb/>
            filled the see eight years and fifteen days.1 In his time <lb/>
            there was a severe famine at Rome which lasted three years, <lb/>
            and was followed by a season of extraordinary plenty. The <lb/>
            emperor Justinian sent the patrician Theodore into Italy, <lb/>
            who took Ravenna, and sent the contumacious archbishop <lb/>
            Felix2 into exile in Pontus, deprived of sight. The pope, at <lb/>
            the emperor's request, undertook a journey to Constanti­ <lb/>
            nople with a numerous retinue, and was very honourably <lb/>
            received by Justinian and Tiberius his son and the people. <lb/>
            Not long afterwards Philip put Justinian to death and <lb/>
            usurped the throne, but in a very short time he was de­ <lb/>
            posed, and Anastasius, who succeeded, conformed to the <lb/>
            orthodox belief.3 This pope consecrated sixty-four bishops, <lb/>
            and was buried at St. Peter's of the ides [8th] of January; <lb/>
            the bishopric remaining void forty days.</p>
          <p>GREGORY [II.], a Roman, son of Marcellus, filled the see <lb/>

            the emperors Anastasius, Theodosius, Leo, and Constan­ <lb/>

            year following. Justinian II. was beheaded October 11, 711, and his suc­ <lb/>

            in restorations than new buildings. He sent Boniface into Germany in <lb/>
            718. There appears some exaggeration in our author's account of the <lb/>
            effects of the inundation of the Tiber in 717 ; according to other historians <lb/>
            the flood in the quarter of the Via Lata did not exceed the height of a <lb/>

            The river Tiber overflowed its banks and inundated Rome <lb/>
            for seven days, so that it rose above the passage of the <lb/>

            man's stature and a half. Pope Gregory and his clergy, <lb/>

            God, after the eighth day the flood abated. Anastasius, <lb/>
            driven from the throne, engaged in battle with Theodosius,1 <lb/>
            but he was defeated and forced to become a monk. The <lb/>
            infidel nation of the Saracens, having afflicted Spain for ten <lb/>
            years, attempted to pass the Rhone into France, when they <lb/>
            were met by Eudes duke of Aquitain, and defeated with a. <lb/>
            slaughter of 300,000 of the enemy, while 1,500 Franks only <lb/>
            are said to have fallen. At that time a fiery rain was seen <lb/>
            to fall from the sky in some place in Campania, which burnt <lb/>
            up the wheat and barley and pulse. When Leo was <lb/>
            emperor, Constantinople was twice besieged by the Saracens, <lb/>
            but God protecting it, the city was not taken, but 300,000 <lb/>
            of the inhabitants perished by famine and pestilence.</p>
          <p>Liutprand, king of the Lombards, at that time oppressed <lb/>
            the Romans, but at the intercession of the people, and <lb/>
            respecting his prayers and sanctity, he was induced to spare <lb/>
            them. Duke Basil and Paul the exarch,2 with other mal­ <lb/>

            across the Rhone, but it is plain by the amount of the number of the slain, <lb/>
            that he is speaking of the battle of Toulouse. Three consecrated sponges <lb/>
            which Eudes pretended to have received from the pope, and which he <lb/>
            distributed to his soldiers, greatly contributed to inflame the zeal of the <lb/>
            Christians. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The conquest by Liutprand of the greatest part of the towns in the <lb/>
            duchy of Rome was effected in 729. It was the exarch Eutychius who <lb/>
            attempted to obtain possession of the city, and he did enter it, but in a <lb/>
            peaceable manner, through the good offices of the pope with his powerful <lb/>
            ally. The emperor took measures against the pope as early as 72G at least <lb/>
            when Jordan, the keeper of the rolls, and Lurion (in the MSS. called <lb/>
            Barion), were killed by the Romans, and the duke Basil driven out of the <lb/>
            city. The exarch Paul, who was not better treated by the Romans in <lb/>
            727, fell during an insurrection at Ravenna in 728. The imprisonment <lb/>
            and murder of Exhilharat, duke of Naples (written Exclarat in the MSS.), <lb/>

            God's providence, resisted their attempts, and protected the <lb/>

            and John Lurion, and Exhilharat the duke, with his son <lb/>
            Adrian, and entirely frustrated the emperor's nefarious <lb/>
            designs. He had decreed that no image of our Saviour or <lb/>
            of his holy mother, or of any saint, martyr, or angel, should <lb/>
            be allowed in the churches, pretending that they were all <lb/>
            forbidden. He therefore commanded all images in the im­ <lb/>
            perial city to be removed and committed to the flames, <lb/>
            threatening all who opposed with loss of their heads or their <lb/>
            limbs. Leo deposed Germanus, bishop of Constantinople, <lb/>
            who resisted this decree, and elevated the priest Anastasius <lb/>
            in his place. In the month of January, the star which is <lb/>
            called Antefer, shone with bright rays in the west. <lb/>
            After this Tiberius Petasus made an attempt on the crown, <lb/>
            but he was defeated and slain by Eutychius the exarch <lb/>
            and the Romans who had flown to arms.1 Pope Gregory <lb/>
            consecrated one hundred and fifty bishops, and, after many <lb/>
            good works, was buried at St. Peter's on the ides [1st] of <lb/>
            February. The bishopric was vacant one month and five <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>GREGORY, a Syrian, whose father's name was John, filled <lb/>
            the see ten years, eight months, and twenty-five days, in the <lb/>
            reigns of the emperors Leo and Constantine. He was much <lb/>
            distinguished for his sanctity, piety, wisdom, and eloquence <lb/>
            in the Greek and Latin tongues. He founded many sacred <lb/>
            buildings, and added ornaments to several churches. A <lb/>
            synod consisting of ninety-three bishops was convoked by <lb/>
            him at Rome, in opposition to the heresies of the emperors <lb/>
            Leo and Constantine, who had cast out the images of Christ <lb/>
            and his saints from the churches, and irreverently burnt <lb/>
            them. He added the following words to be recited by the <lb/>
            priest in the canon of the mass : “ Whose holy festival is <lb/>

            was then that Thrasimond, duke of Spoleto, having sought <lb/>
            refuge at Rome, four cities were taken from the Romans. <lb/>

            at St. Peter's on the fourth of the calends of December <lb/>

          <p>ZACHAUT, a Greek, son of Polychronius, filled the see ten <lb/>
            years, three months, and fourteen days.3 Adorned with <lb/>
            every virtue he conferred great benefits on the church. In <lb/>
            his time Italy was in a very disturbed state: the pope, <lb/>
            however, had an interview with King Liutprand, and suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded in negotiating a treaty of peace for twenty years, <lb/>
            and, recovering the prisoner Liutprand, died in the thirty- <lb/>
            second year of his reign, and was succeeded by Ratchis, son <lb/>
            of Pemmon duke of Forli. Then while the emperor Constan­ <lb/>
            tine marched against the Arabs, one Artabasdus contrived <lb/>
            to usurp the government, but Constantine assembling the <lb/>
            army of the cast took the imperial city by storm, and de­ <lb/>
            prived the rebel and his accomplices of sight. At that time <lb/>
            Carloman, son of Charles Martel, king of the Pranks, became <lb/>

          <p>STEPHEN, a Roman, son of Constantine, sat five years <lb/>
            and twenty-eight days.1 The people had elected another <lb/>
            Stephen, a priest; but, three days afterwards, rising from <lb/>
            sleep in good health, and sitting down for the despatch of <lb/>
            business, he was suddenly deprived of sense and the power <lb/>
            of speech, and died the next day. Upon this, Stephen, the <lb/>
            deacon, a man adorned by every virtue, was elected pope. <lb/>
            At that time Astulph, king of the Lombards, cruelly <lb/>
            persecuted the church, and used every effort to reduce Rome <lb/>
            itself to subjection. In consequence, the pope, finding that <lb/>
            neither money nor prayers were of any avail, was under the <lb/>
            necessity of undertaking a journey to France, to implore <lb/>
            protection for the church. He was received with high <lb/>
            honour by King Pepin and the Frank nobles, and was <lb/>
            entertained the whole winter at the Abbey of St. Deny's, <lb/>
            near Parish Soon afterwards Pepin laid siege to Pavia with <lb/>
            an army of Franks, and compelled Astulph to swear to a <lb/>
            treaty of peace with the Romans, but, as soon as Pepin <lb/>
            retired to his own states, Astulph broke his oath, besieging <lb/>
            Rome for four months, and violating the cemeteries, in which <lb/>
            he disinterred the bodies of many of the saints. At the <lb/>
            pope's entreaty Pepin again besieged Pavia, and, forcing the <lb/>
            perjured king to surrender Ravenna, Narni, Rimini, and <lb/>
            many other towns, added them to the patrimony of St. <lb/>
            Peter. Not long afterwards Astulph perished while he was <lb/>
            hunting, by a stroke divinely directed, and Duke Desiderius <lb/>
            took possession of the throne.3 Pope Stephen consecrated <note type="footnote"> nephew, was deposed the August following, and Ratchis, duke of Friuli, <lb/>

            He was buried at St. Peter's on the calends [1st] of May, and <lb/>
            the see was void five days.</p>
          <p>PAUL, a Roman, brother of Stephen, filled the see ten <lb/>
            years and one month, in the time of Constantine and Leo.1 <lb/>
            His good deeds were many ; he ordained sixty bishops, and <lb/>
            after his death the see remained void one year and one <lb/>
            month, while the intruder Constantine took possession of <lb/>
            the apostolical seat.</p>
          <p>STEPHEN, a Sicilian, son of Olybus, filled the see three <lb/>
            years, five months, and twenty-eight days.2 He was a firm, <lb/>
            wise, and excellent prelate, and rendered great services to the <lb/>
            church. Before his election an unprecedented outrage was <lb/>
            committed at Rome; for Toto, duke of Nepi, compelled <lb/>
            George, bishop of Præneste, very reluctantly, to consecrate <lb/>
            the duke's brother Constantine pope, he being a layman.3 <lb/>
            Soon after the ordination George fell sick, and became so <lb/>
            infirm that he never afterwards sang mass. For his right <lb/>
            hand dried up and became so palsied that he could not raise <lb/>
            it to his mouth. A year after Rome was delivered up to <lb/>
            Christopher the dean, and Sergius the sacristan, and Duke <lb/>
            Toto was treacherously assassinated by Demetrius and <lb/>
            Gratiosus. Upon this, Stephen was lawfully elected pope <lb/>
            with the general consent; and not long afterwards the <lb/>
            intruder Constantine, with his brother Passibius, and <lb/>
            Theodore, bishop and apostolic-vicar, were seized by some <lb/>
            ruffians, who deprived them of sight; and Christopher, with <lb/>
            his son Sergius and several others, perished by the craft and <lb/>

            instructed in the holy scriptures, and in the rules of the <lb/>
            sacred canons.1</p>
          <p>In the month of April a synod of bishops assembled in <lb/>
            the church of St. Saviour, near the Lateran palace, and Con­ <lb/>
            stantine, who from a layman had been so precipitately made <lb/>
            a clergyman and pope, was unanimously condemned. The <lb/>
            synod further decreed, under penalty of excommunication, <lb/>
            that no layman, or person of any order, should be raised to <lb/>
            the popedom, except by passing through the regular degrees <lb/>
            of orders; and that all which this Constantine had sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned in ecclesiastical affairs and divine worship should be <lb/>
            performed anew, except baptism and holy unction. Pope <lb/>
            Stephen consecrated thirty bishops, and was buried at St. <lb/>
            Peter's, the bishopric remaining void eight days.</p>
          <p>ADRIAN a Roman, son of Theodore who lived in the <lb/>
            district of the Broadway, filled the see twenty-three years, <lb/>
            ten months, and seventeen days.2 Of noble rank and grace­ <lb/>
            ful person, he was moreover firm, devout, and holy. In his <lb/>
            time Desiderius, king of the LOIn bards, inflicted great evils <lb/>
            on Rome, on Ravenna, and on the places subject to them. <lb/>
            In consequence Charlemagne, at the pope's request, under­ <lb/>
            took an expedition into Italy, and after besieging Pavia for <lb/>
            five months, by God's help forced it to surrender; and <lb/>
            marching from thence to Rome, he and his army entered the <lb/>
            city, amidst the highest honours, on the Saturday before <lb/>
            Easter. He sent Desiderius captive to France, with his <lb/>
            queen, and restored the patrimony of St. Peter which he <lb/>
            had seized.3 Pope Adrian founded and ornamented churches <note type="footnote"> 1 Sergius had been sent as legate to King Pepin immediately after <lb/>

            emperor Constantine to assemble a council of three hundred <lb/>
            and fifty bishops at Nice, the acts of which he caused to be <lb/>
            translated from Greek into Latin.1 In the twentieth year of <lb/>
            this papacy the Tiber overflowed its banks as far as the door <lb/>
            of St. Peter's church, doing great injury to the citizens ; but <lb/>
            the pope ordered processions, and the Lord in his mercy <lb/>
            abated the flood.2 He consecrated one hundred and eighty- <lb/>
            five bishops, and was buried at St. Peter's on the seventh of <lb/>

          <p>LEO [III.], a Roman, son of Aizuppius, sat twenty years, <lb/>
            five months, and sixteen days,3 following in all things the <lb/>
            examples of his predecessors. While he was engaged in the <lb/>
            due performance of his office, and on a certain day was going <lb/>
            in procession with the people to the church of St. Peter, <lb/>
            Paschal the primicier, and Campol the sacristan,4 rushed <lb/>
            from an ambush with their armed followers, and dispersing <lb/>
            the terrified and unarmed populace, made an attempt to <lb/>
            deprive the pope of his tongue and his eyes before the very <lb/>
            altar of St. Peter. But some days afterwards Albinus the <lb/>
            chamberlain released him from prison, and the Lord <lb/>
            Almighty restored him to perfect health. Winigis, also, <lb/>

            from his office of deacon.1 At that time the emperor <lb/>
            Lothaire sent to Rome Drogo, archbishop of Metz, with his <lb/>
            own son Lewis, attended by many bishops, abbots, and <lb/>
            counts. On their route they made great slaughter in the <lb/>
            towns and country, so that the native inhabitants, terrified <lb/>
            at their cruelty, were forced to take refuge in woods and <lb/>
            dens. Then, on a certain day, the sky grew black with <lb/>
            clouds, and some of Drogo's chief attendants were struck <lb/>
            with lightning and killed. Lewis, however, proceeded to <lb/>
            Rome, when Pope Sergius anointed him with holy oil, and <lb/>
            consecrated him king of the Lombards.2 This pope or­ <lb/>
            dained twenty-three bishops and founded several abbies and <lb/>
            churches. He was buried at St Peter's, and the bishopric <lb/>
            was vacant two months and fifteen days.</p>
          <p>LEO [IV.], a Roman, son of Radvald, sat eight years, <lb/>
            three months, and six days.3 He shone brightly, like the <lb/>
            sun, in the world, by his inestimable gifts, serving the <lb/>
            church of God in various ways, both by building and <lb/>
            embellishing churches, and by other useful undertakings. <lb/>
            Presently, after the death of Pope Sergius, the Saracens <lb/>
            pillaged the .churches of St. Peter and St. Paul; but as <lb/>
            their fleet was returning to Africa it was destroyed by a <lb/>
            tempest.4 At that time there was such an earthquake at <lb/>
            Rome that all the elements seemed in disorder. Pope Leo <lb/>
            prohibited laics from remaining in the sanctuary while <lb/>
            mass was celebrated. In the first year of his papacy, he <lb/>
            drove away by his merits and prayers a basilisk which, lurk­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE now given, in a short chapter, such an account of a <lb/>
            hundred popes who presided in the apostolical see after St. <lb/>
            Peter, as I could collect from the writings of Pope St. Da­ <lb/>
            inasus to Jerome, or in the Pontifical.3 But further, respect­ <lb/>
            ing the forty popes who filled the apostolical see from the <lb/>
            time of Leo IV. to the present time, I have not yet been <lb/>
            able to discover any genuine accounts; I shall, therefore, <lb/>
            venture to say but little about them. Their names only it <lb/>
            will be my endeavour to supply in regular order, but I am <lb/>
            under the necessity of observing silence on their origin and <note type="footnote"> 1 The fire here mentioned is that which is represented by Raphael in <lb/>
            his celebrated picture, which goes by the name of Incendio del Borgo. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Pope Leo IV. repaired many of the churches and monasteries, which <lb/>
            he enriched and embellished, particularly the churches of St. Peter and <lb/>
            St. Paul, from which he was anxious to remove all traces of the devasta­ <lb/>
            tions made by the Saracens. The repairs of the walls of Rome, and the <lb/>
            fortifications with which he surrounded the Vatican, including the church <lb/>
            of St. Peter, commenced in 848. These latter works lasted six years. <lb/>
            Gibbon remarks of Pope Leo: “ The capital of Christendom owed its <lb/>
            salvation as much to the heroism of the pope Leo IV. as to the valour of <lb/>
            the imperial troops. Born a Roman, the courage of the first ages of the <lb/>
            republic glowed in his bosom." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It is generally understood that the Pontifical, attributed during the <lb/>
            middle ages either to Pope Damasus or St. Jerome, was the work of <lb/>
            neither; but its history is too obscure and too complicated a subject to be <lb/>
            discussed in a note. Suffice it to say, that it now bears the name of <lb/>
            Anastasius the librarian, who, if not its author, was at least its compiler and <lb/>
            editor. Ordericus has miscounted the number of popes contained in his <lb/>
            list, which (including the antipope Felix II.) amounts to one hundred and <lb/>

          <p>IT is our duty to devote ourselves unceasingly to the Cre­ <lb/>
            ator's praise in all his works, although his majesty and <lb/>
            might are beyond our powers of comprehension, and we are <lb/>
            quite incapable of speaking in fitting terms of his ineffable <lb/>
            loftiness and unwearied lovingkindness. These are exhi­ <lb/>
            bited in every page of the Old and New Testament; these <lb/>
            are the subjects of the study and meditations of every wise <lb/>
            man. But who can penetrate the mystery of the immensity <lb/>
            of God ? The knowledge of the love of Christ is above the <lb/>
            skill of man, while to search it out and embrace it, and use <lb/>
            our utmost efforts in pursuing it, is both our proper task <lb/>
            and fraught with the fulness of everlasting salvation. For <lb/>
            this, holy men whose worth is recorded in authentic writings, <lb/>
            now associated with the angels, triumph in the heavens; <lb/>
            having despised transitory things and courted eternal <lb/>
            realities, and abhorred carnal delights, that they might <lb/>
            enter upon the blessed fruition of those that are spiritual. <lb/>
            Following their Saviour's footsteps through the difficult <lb/>
            path of a holy life, they have left us a salutary example, by <lb/>
            imitating which we also may reach by the way of righteous­ <lb/>
            ness the heavenly inheritance; an enterprise rendered so <lb/>
            difficult to our sloth and weakness by the burden of our <lb/>
            sins. Still it is our duty to struggle faithfully in their <lb/>
            steps and follow the course they have pursued, that partici­ <lb/>
            pating in their merits, we may, by God's mercy, be one day <lb/>
            found worthy to share the joys of their blessed society.</p>

            William, surnamed Calculus, a monk of Jumiege, who <note type="footnote"> 1 Dacia. At the time our author wrote, and, indeed, long afterwards, <lb/>
            Denmark was confounded with Dacia; the Danes called Daci, and the <lb/>
            Norwegians, Norici. We may also observe, that the Normans as well as <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxon writers made no distinction between the tribes of the <lb/>
            Northmen who came from Denmark, and the Norwegians. They are for <lb/>
            the most part indiscriminately called Danes; Denmark having been more <lb/>
            known, lying nearer to the eastern coast of England, and consequently <lb/>
            supplying, at one time at least, the great body of the adventurers. It need <lb/>
            hardly be remarked that both these people were derived from a common <lb/>
            stock. Rollo, we know, came from Norway. Tradition still points out <lb/>
            the coves where his gallies were fitted out, near Aalesund, on a small island <lb/>
            at the mouth of the Romsdal's Fjord. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The word panegyric is justly applied. The work of Dudo de St. <lb/>
            Quentin : Dudonis super congregationem S, Quintini decani de moribus <lb/>
            et actis primorum Normanniæ Ducum libri iii., published in Duchesne's <lb/>
            Historic Normannorum Scriptores Antiqui, is, in truth, much less a <lb/>
            history, properly so called, than a verbose, rhetorical, and often false <lb/>
            panegyric of the first three dukes of Normandy. Though the author had <lb/>
            great opportunities for collecting and describing faithfully the events of the <lb/>
            times, as he lived at the courts of Richard I. and Richard II., he has <lb/>
            in most cases either omitted, altered, or falsified the facts, and replaced <lb/>
            them sometimes by the exaggerations of the grossest flattery, and at others <lb/>
            by accounts taken hap-hazard from the lives of persons who lived in earlier <lb/>
            times, or from traditions altogether fabulous. The consequence is, that <lb/>
            instead of throwing light on the annals of the first age of Norman history, <lb/>
            he has only made the darkness in which they are involved more visible. <lb/>
            The three dukes of Normandy, whose history was written by Dudo, are <lb/>
            Rollo, William I., surnamed Longue-Epée, and Richard I., surnamed <lb/>
            Sans-Peur. </note> <pb n="376"/>

            flourished somewhat later, and added a short but perspi­ <lb/>
            cuous account of the four succeeding dukes.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 This historian is vastly superior to Dudo de St. Quentin, but still he <lb/>
            has committed the error of copying and adopting the, more or less, <lb/>
            monstrous fables of his predecessor, and his work has had the misfortune <lb/>
            of being disfigured by a continuation, the author of which has so interpolated <lb/>
            it, and made so many injudicious additions, as to have essentially altered <lb/>
            its character. William de Jumièges wrote the histories of Richard II., <lb/>
            Richard III., Robert I., and William II., called at first the Bastard, <lb/>
            and afterwards the Conqueror. It appears from what Ordericus Vitalis <lb/>
            here says, that the eighth book of William de Jumièges in our editions was <lb/>
            not written by him, as it gives the history of Henry I., eighth, or rather <lb/>
            ninth duke of Normandy. In point of fact, he died in 1090, and his work, <lb/>
            as it now stands, extends far beyond that year. </note></p><pb n="377"/>

          <p>I COMMENCE my present undertaking with speaking of that <lb/>
            vine of the Lord of hosts which he himself plants,1 and <lb/>
            preserves throughout the world against the devices of <lb/>
            Behemoth. The shoots of this vine were freely propagated <lb/>
            by the labours of the Lord's husbandmen in the country <lb/>
            formerly called Neustria, but now Normandy,2 producing <lb/>
            abundant fruit in men devoted to a holy life. These faith­ <lb/>
            ful labourers founded in that province many monasteries <lb/>
            where the true branches of the vine, that is good Christians, <lb/>
            planted themselves in common accord, in order to struggle <lb/>
            more safely to the end against the wiles of their spiritual <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>The blessed bishop Ouen, who flourished in the time of <lb/>
            Dagobert king of the Franks and his son Clovis, and was of <lb/>
            distinguished worth both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs, <lb/>
            founded a convent for nuns at Fecamp, and another for <lb/>
            monks in the city of Rouen, where he was himself buried in <lb/>
            the year of our Lord 678, and his remains lay undisturbed <lb/>
            for one hundred and sixty-five years, until Rouen was <lb/>
            ravaged by the Northmen.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 The metaphor of our Lord's vine, so frequently used in the holy <lb/>
            scriptures and the writings of the fathers, seems to have been a favourite <lb/>
            with our author. He had already made use of it in the commencement of <lb/>
            his first book. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was a common error to consider Neustria as synonymous with Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy ; it included not only Normandy, but all the territory between <lb/>
            the Meuse, the Scheldt, the Loire, and the sea. More lately, indeed, the <lb/>
            name was no longer given to the country between the Seine and the Loire, <lb/>
            and from this era may be dated the improper application of the term to <lb/>
            describe exclusively sometimes Brittany, sometimes Normandy. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 St. Ouen, who died, not in 678, but in 683, cannot be considered the <lb/>
            actual founder of the convent for nuns at Fécamp, which was commenced <lb/>
            by his contemporary, St. Waninge, in 658. Still less did he erect that of <lb/>
            St. Peter at Rouen, which took his name when his remains were translated <lb/>
            there, but which dates its foundation as far back as the reign of Clotaire I. </note> <pb n="378"/>

          <p>In the time of this bishop, St. Wandrille collected a <lb/>
            numerous society of monks at Fontenelles, and the blessed <lb/>
            Philibert, the brave standard-bearer of this noble army, shed <lb/>
            lustre on Jumièges.1</p>
          <p>In earlier times, also, when Hilperic, and Childebert his <lb/>
            nephew, governed the Franks, and protected the innocent <lb/>
            against evil-doers by their royal authority, Evroult, a native <lb/>
            of Bayeux, guided by the instructions of an angel, founded a <lb/>
            monastery in the forest of Ouche.2 He thus effected the <lb/>
            reformation of the rude natives who before lived by plunder <lb/>
            and robbery, attracting them to a better course of life by <lb/>
            the doctrines he taught them and the miracles he exhibited. <lb/>
            In other places also the Lord propagated his vine by the <lb/>
            labours of faithful husbandmen, abundantly filling the <lb/>
            hearts of the Gauls with the sweetness of his salvation.</p>
          <p>The kingdom of the Franks having been, by God's favour, <lb/>
            highly exalted above the neighbouring nations, and widely <lb/>
            extended by the frequent triumphs of the Frank kings, <lb/>
            Pepin, Charlemagne, and Lewis the Pious,3 avarice, pride, <lb/>
            and lust, began to prevail excessively among all ranks of <lb/>
            men, from the highest to the lowest, plunging them into <lb/>
            the depths of iniquity, and. causing them to rebel against <lb/>
            the Author of their salvation, whose commandments they no <lb/>
            longer obeyed. Both the clergy and laity of every degree, <lb/>
            infected with these disorders, fell from their former virtue, <lb/>
            and yielding to the seductions of the world, the discipline <lb/>
            for which they were once remarkable, became enervated and <lb/>
            extinct. Still the divine compassion long spared the guilty, <lb/>
            calling them to repentance in various ways. The penitent <lb/>

          <p>In the time of Charles, king of the Franks, surnamed the <lb/>
            Simple, Biorn, also called Iron-sides, son of Lodbroc, king of <lb/>
            the Danes, accompanied by Hasting, his tutor, and a nume­ <lb/>
            rous band of young warriors, issued from their homes like <lb/>
            a sword from the scabbard, for the destruction of the <lb/>
            nations. Suddenly sweeping over the shores of France, <lb/>
            like a whirlwind rising from the sea, and reducing to ashes <lb/>
            towns, cities, and holy minsters, for thirty years the invaders <lb/>
            and their confederates harassed the Christians with con­ <lb/>
            tinual inroads.1 Then Rouen and Noyon, Tours and <lb/>
            Poictiers, and other principal cities, were burnt,2 the de­ <lb/>
            fenceless inhabitants were butchered, the monks and clergy <lb/>
            were scattered, and the relics of the saints were either left <lb/>
            unhonoured in their tombs within the ruined churches, or <lb/>
            were transported by their pious worshippers to desolate <lb/>
            places.</p>
          <p>But, in the dispensations of Providence, the same race <lb/>
            which inflicted desolation on Neustria, became not long <lb/>
            afterwards the means of her restoration. About thirty <lb/>
            years after the ravages of Hastings,3 Duke Rollo, at the head <lb/>
            of a powerful band of Danish youths, invaded Neustria, and <lb/>
            strove by ceaseless attacks to exterminate the Franks. In <lb/>
            a pitched battle he slew their standard-bearer Roland, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The whole of this paragraph, borrowed by Ordericus from preceding <lb/>
            writers, is a tissue of misrepresentations, which contemporary writers enable <lb/>
            us to correct. Biorn I., king of Upsala, surnamed Jarnsida (Ironsides), <lb/>
            appears to have lived about the end of the eighth century, or beginning of <lb/>
            the ninth, and he never set foot in France. Hasting, whose invasions and <lb/>
            ravages are singularly exaggerated, according to authentic accounts did not <lb/>
            make his appearance in the valley of the Loire and in Brittany till 867, <lb/>
            and again in 869 and 882; afterwards, in that of the Somme, in 890. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Rouen was first ravaged the 14th of June, 841, Tours in 853, and <lb/>
            Noyon in 859. As for Poitiers, it was first attacked in 855, but making a <lb/>
            vigorous defence, it did not fall into the hands of the Northmen till 863. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 According to the Saxon Chronicle, followed by Henry of Huntingdon <lb/>
            and Florence of Worcester, Rollo landed in Normandy in A.D. 876. Our <lb/>
            author, who has placed the invasions of Hastings under the reign of Charles <lb/>
            the Simple, here makes his first expedition in France to have been in 847 <lb/>
            or 848, forgetting that he had before told us that Rouen was first attacked <lb/>
            by the Northmen a hundred and sixty-five years after the year 678, and <lb/>
            consequently in 843, which of all his calculations is that nearest the truth. </note> <pb n="380"/>

            defeated Reginald duke of Orleans with the army of the <lb/>
            Franks. He besieged the city of Paris for four years, but, <lb/>
            God defending it, was unable to reduce it. Baieux he took <lb/>
            by storm, putting to the sword its count Berenger, whose <lb/>
            daughter Poppa be married, and had by her a son called <lb/>
            William Longue-epée.4. In this and innumerable other <lb/>
            conflicts he crushed the Franks, and laid waste almost the <lb/>
            whole kingdom, as far as Burgundy, with fire and sword. <lb/>
            The Franks being unable to resist these attacks, and uniting <lb/>
            in their supplications for peace, King Charles gave his <lb/>
            daughter Gisela in marriage to Rollo, and ceded to him in <lb/>
            perpetuity the entire country from the river Epte to the <lb/>
            ocean.3</p>
          <p>In consequence, Rollo was baptized by the lord Francon, <lb/>
            Archbishop of Rouen, in the year of our Lord 912, and <lb/>
            casting away the idols which he before worshipped, with <lb/>
            all his army devoutly embraced Christianity. He died <lb/>
            five years after his baptism.4 William, his son, who suc- <note type="footnote"> 1 Roland seems to have been a supposititious character, invented by the <lb/>
            Norman historians; and the person they call Duke of Orleans was a duke <lb/>
            of Maine, killed under the walls of Rouen in 885. Rollo, who is not <lb/>
            mentioned in any authentic account till 911, was not present at this battle, <lb/>
            nor at the siege of Paris. All that concerns his taking Baieux, including <lb/>
            Count Berenger and his daughter Poppa, is still the subject of controversy. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The French editors of Ordericus Vitalis consider that all these expedi­ <lb/>
            tions of Rollo, as well as his marriage with Gisela, are but attributions to <lb/>
            that chief of misrepresentations of anterior occurrences. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It certainly appears from a charter of Richard I. to the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Denys, that his grandfather Rollo took the name of Robert. This is the <lb/>
            only authentic proof we have of his baptism, and there is reason to <lb/>
            doubt his having been so faithful and zealous a Christian as our author <lb/>
            supposes. It appears, however, that he did make donations or restitutions <lb/>
            to several churches, and particularly to those of St. Denys in France and <lb/>
            Rouen in Normandy. </note><note type="footnote"> The French editors of Ordericus consider that Dudo made a great <lb/>
            mistake in fixing the death of Rollo five years after his baptism, namely, in <lb/>
            917, an account, they say, implicitly copied by all the authors of the <lb/>
            middle ages. Our Saxon Chronicle says, under the year 876, when it <lb/>
            first mentions, and for the only time, Rollo's invasion of Norway, “ And <lb/>
            he reigned fifty winters," which would agree with our author's calculation <lb/>
            —917. M. Le Prévost, however, says that several MSS. of the Saxon <lb/>
            Chronicle (one as old as 1001) place Rollo's death fifteen years after his <lb/>
            baptism, namely, in 927. M. Deville quotes a passage from Frodoard, <lb/>
            which speaks of Rollo retaining the son of Odo as an hostage, to prove that <lb/>
            the Norman duke was alive in 928; but M. Le Prévost refers to another </note> <pb n="381"/>

            laid in ruins by Hasting.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 942, when Lewis was king of <lb/>
            the Franks, Duke William was murdered by the treachery <lb/>
            of Arnulph governor of Flanders; and Richard his son, then <lb/>
            a boy of twelve years of age, became duke of Normandy, <lb/>
            and through various turns of fortune, soma prosperous and <lb/>
            some adverse, held the dukedom fifty-four years. Among <lb/>
            his other good deeds, he founded three monasteries, one at <lb/>
            Fécamp, dedicated to the Holy Trinity,1 another at Mont <lb/>
            St. Michel in honour of St. Michael the archangel, and the <lb/>
            third at Rouen in honour of St. Peter the apostle, and St. <lb/>
            Ouen the archbishop.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 996, on the death of Richard the <lb/>
            elder, he was succeeded by Richard Gonorrides his son,2 <lb/>
            who piously governed the duchy of Normandy thirty years. <lb/>
            He rebuilt the abbey of Fontenelles which St. Wandrille <lb/>
            had founded and Hasting had ruined ; and Judith his wife, <lb/>
            sister of Geoffrey earl of Brittany, founded a monastery at <lb/>
            Bernai in honour of St. Mary, mother of God.</p>
          <p>On the death of Richard Gonnorides, his young son <lb/>
            Richard succeeded, but be held the dukedom not quite a <lb/>

            have been the party to that treaty. M. Le Prevost also adduces the <lb/>
            testimony of the monk Richer, to prove that Rollo was slain in 925, when <lb/>

          <p>William his son, who was then only eight years old, was <lb/>
            invested in the duchy of Normandy, which he governed <lb/>
            firmly fifty-three years, notwithstanding the machinations of <lb/>
            his jealous enemies. He devoted himself to follow the <lb/>
            example of his ancestors in all that related to the worship <lb/>
            of God, and by his favour surpassed them all in wealth and <lb/>
            power. He founded two monasteries at Caen ; one for monks <lb/>
            in honour of St. Stephen the first martyr, and the other for <lb/>
            nuns in honour of the Holy Trinity.</p>
          <p>The barons of Normandy, moved by the zeal for holy reli­ <lb/>
            gion which they observed in their princes, were eager to <lb/>
            imitate them, and animated themselves and their friends to <lb/>
            similar undertakings for the good of their souls. They vied <lb/>
            with each other in taking the lead in such good works, and <lb/>
            in the liberality with which they made ample endowments. ! <lb/>
            The most powerful nobles held themselves cheap if they had <lb/>
            not on their domains some establishment of monks or clergy <lb/>
            provided by them with whatever was necessary for the <lb/>
            service of God.</p>
          <p>Thus Roger de Toni founded the abbey of Chatillon, <lb/>
            otherwise called Conches,1 where Abbot Gislebert, a man of <lb/>
            great worth and wisdom, rose to eminence. Goscelin <lb/>
            d'Arques was the founder of a monastery, outside the walls <lb/>
            of Rouen on the mount of the Holy Trinity, commonly <lb/>
            called St. Catherine's,2 which the venerable abbot Isambert <lb/>
            governed with much prudence and piety. William, count <lb/>
            d'Eu, at the instance of Lesceline his pious wife, caused the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Mary to be built on the river Dive,3 the disci- <note type="footnote"> November, 1028, and the probability is that both he and his father died in <lb/>

          <p>In the time of Duke Robert I., Gislebert, count of <lb/>
            Brionne, made an inroad with three thousand armed fol­ <lb/>
            lowers into the district of Vimeux, but it did not turn out as <lb/>
            prosperously as he expected; for Ingelran, count of Ponthieu <lb/>
            opposed him with a strong body of troops, and, giving him bat­ <lb/>
            tle, vanquished and put to flight all his force, taking some of <lb/>
            the fugitives prisoners and killing or wounding others. In this <lb/>
            extremity a knight named Herluin, being in peril of his <lb/>
            life, and using every effort to save himself by flight, made <lb/>
            a vow that if be escaped safely from this imminent danger, <lb/>
            be would never again devote himself to any other service <lb/>
            than that of God. Being delivered in honour, by God's <lb/>
            help, from the fate which threatened him, the knight, mind­ <lb/>
            ful of his vow, retired from the world and founded an abbey <lb/>
            on his estate, at a place called Bee, which he dedicated to <lb/>
            St. Mary, mother of God.1 The clergy of God's holy church <lb/>
            then elected this noble and pious man to be the first abbot <lb/>
            of the new monastery he had built. While it was under <lb/>
            his rule Lanfranc, Anslem, and other profound philoso­ <lb/>
            pliers, resorted there to the Christian schools ;2 and there <lb/>
            William Fitz-Giroie, and Hugh count of Mellent, and other <lb/>
            illustrious knights, enlisted themselves in the army of Christ. <lb/>
            There, up to the present time, numbers both of clerks and <lb/>
            layman live under the monastic rule, and fighting against the <lb/>
            devil, laudably devote themselves to God's service.</p>
          <p>Humphrey de Vieilles, son of Thurold, began to erect <lb/>
            two monasteries, one for monks and the other for nuns, at <lb/>
            Preaux, which his son Roger de Beaumont kindly fostered, <lb/>

          <p>IT was determined by Hugh and Robert that the monastery <lb/>
            should be erected at Norrei,2 a vill belonging to them near <lb/>
            Grand-mesnil; and the work was already in progress, when a <lb/>
            report was carried to William Fitz-Giroie their uncle, that <lb/>
            his nephews, Hugh and Robert, had commenced building a <lb/>
            convent. This knight had been a man of great eminence <lb/>
            in that age, terrible to his enemies, faithful to his friends. <lb/>
            He was at the head of a powerful family, including sons, <lb/>
            brothers, and numerous nephews, who were formidable to <lb/>
            their foes, far and near. This knight, being invited by <lb/>
            William Talvas, son of William Belesme, to his nuptials, <lb/>
            and unsuspectingly accepting the invitation, was, without <lb/>
            any cause of accusation cruelly deprived of his eyes and his <lb/>
            genitals, and the tips of his ears cut off. So odious a crime <lb/>
            rendered Talvas universally detested, and some time after­ <lb/>
            wards he was stript of his honours by his own son Arnulf.</p>
          <p>William Giroie was all his life devoted to holy church, <lb/>
            and held the monks, and clergy, and other men of religion <lb/>
            in high honour. Twice he made pilgrimages to the tomb <lb/>

            enjoyment of health and prosperity, and a second time when <lb/>
            he had suffered the outrage which we have just mentioned. <lb/>
            On his return from this second pilgrimage he determined <lb/>
            on quitting the world, and going to Bee, there assumed the <lb/>
            monastic habit, and piously granted the church of Ouche <lb/>
            to that abbey. Upon this, abbot Herluin sent Lanfranc, <lb/>
            who was afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, with three <lb/>
            other monks to Ouche, causing them to re-establish there <lb/>
            the divine worship which had fallen into disuse. Mantling <lb/>
            ivy overspread the mouldering walls of the church, and the <lb/>
            place was deserted, except by two aged monks, Restould <lb/>
            and Ingran, who maintained the service of God in deep <lb/>
            poverty, but to the best of their power, in the desolate <lb/>
            wilderness.</p>
          <p>Some time afterwards, when William Giroie was informed <lb/>
            of his nephews' vow to build a monastery, he sought them <lb/>
            out and thus addressed them : " It causes me great joy, my <lb/>
            dear sons, to find that Almighty God has vouchsafed to <lb/>
            inspire you with the design of building a house in his name. <lb/>
            But you must be sensible that the spot on which you have <lb/>
            begun to build is not suited for a habitation of monks, <lb/>
            because it wants water, and the forest is at too great a. <lb/>
            distanced It is quite certain that these two elements are <lb/>
            absolutely necessary to the subsistence of a convent. Now, <lb/>
            if you will take my advice, I will point out to you a more <lb/>
            convenient site. The place is in the canton of Ouche, where <lb/>
            there formerly dwelt a holy abbot, the friend of God, whose <lb/>
            name was Evroult, who assembled there a large body of <lb/>
            monks, and after performing many miracles died happily <lb/>
            in the Lord. Restore that monastery which was ruined by <lb/>
            the pagans. You will find there abundance of water, and <lb/>
            I possess a forest close by which will enable me to supply <lb/>
            the convent with whatever is necessary. Come then and <lb/>
            see this spot, and if it pleases you, let us join in building <lb/>
            there a house of God, and place in it a company of faith­ <lb/>
            ful men who shall offer continual prayers on our behalf; <lb/>
            and we will endow it from our domains with such secure <note type="footnote"> 1 It was almost indispensable in those times that the monasteries should <lb/>
            be established near the verge of extensive forests for two reasons; first, on <lb/>
            account of having an abundant supply of fuel, and, secondly, for the <lb/>
            pasturage of their large herds of swine. </note> <note type="footnote"> TOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <pb n="386"/>

            worship of God."</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this, his nephews Hugh and Robert <lb/>
            thanked him for his proposal, and they all proceeded <lb/>
            together to survey the spot he had pointed out. On their <lb/>
            coming there, a book containing the life of the holy father <lb/>
            Evroult was presented to Robert, which he carefully perused <lb/>
            and explained with intelligence to Hugh and the rest of his <lb/>
            companions. Need I say more ? The situation of Ouche <lb/>
            pleased the two brothers; but as it had been formerly <lb/>
            granted to the abbey of Bee, and certain monks from that <lb/>
            convent were already stationed there, as before mentioned, <lb/>
            the brothers made over to the abbot and monks of Bee a <lb/>
            vilI called La Roussière,1 securing in exchange the fee <lb/>
            of the land at Ouche.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1050, the plan of restoring the <lb/>
            abbey of Ouche being thus determined on, William and <lb/>
            Robert, the sons of Giroie, with Hugh and Robert, the sons <lb/>
            of Robert Grand-Mesnil, applied to William duke of <lb/>
            Normandy, and informing him of their intentions entreated <lb/>
            the assistance of his paramount authority in the good work <lb/>
            they had undertaken. They likewise made over the place <lb/>
            so often mentioned to his guardianship, on a tenure so free <lb/>
            that neither they nor any other persons whosoever should <lb/>
            claim from the monks or their people either rent or cus­ <lb/>
            tomary dues, or anything else except the benefit of their <lb/>
            prayers. The duke, very willingly acceding to their wishes, <lb/>
            ratified the charter of the possessions which his nobles <lb/>
            granted to St. Evroult, and caused it to be confirmed by the <lb/>
            signatures of Mauger, archbishop of Rouen, and his <lb/>
            suffragan bishops.</p>
          <p>Hugh and Robert, having the duke's licence to choose an <lb/>
            abbot, then proceeded to Jumièges, and besought the lord <lb/>
            Robert, who was then superior of that abbey, to allow the <lb/>
            monk Theodoric to take the government of their new abbey; <lb/>
            and abbot Robert, readily complying with the request of his <lb/>
            noble guests, yielded to them the monk whom he well knew <lb/>
            to be well qualified for such a pastoral care. Hugh and <note type="footnote"> 1 This is still the name of a commune in the arrondissement of Bernal, <lb/>

            Robert now, with great satisfaction, presented him to the <lb/>
            duke, who receiving him with due distinction, delivered to <lb/>
            him the pastoral staff, as the custom was, thus giving him <lb/>
            the preferment of the abbey of Ouche. Afterwards Hugh, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux,1 with Osbern his archdeacon, and others <lb/>
            of his clergy, came to Ouche with the venerable monk <lb/>
            Theodoric in their company, and there solemnly consecrated <lb/>
            him on the 3rd of the nones [5th] of October, being the <lb/>
            Lord's day. Thus ordained, he betrayed no pride or <lb/>
            arrogance, but both by his words and works pointed out <lb/>
            the way of true religion to those over whom he was set. <lb/>
            Brought up from his childhood in the Lord's house he had <lb/>
            learnt by long practice the regular course of a religious life. <lb/>
            He was constant in holy prayers, in vigils, in fasting. He <lb/>
            so exposed himself to the rigour of the cold, that he some­ <lb/>
            times went without a cloak the whole winter. However, <lb/>
            one day when he was preparing, as he was wont, to offer <lb/>
            the sacrifice of the mass, lie perceived a cloak of dazzling <lb/>
            whiteness laid on the altar. Not doubting that it was placed <lb/>
            there by no human hands but by the ministry of angels, he <lb/>
            returned thanks to God, and investing himself with it <lb/>
            joyfully performed the divine service. That this happened <lb/>
            in the church of Jumieges, while he was yet a cloistered monk, <lb/>
            I have heard from trustworthy monks who then belonged <lb/>
            to that monastery. He was baptized by the venerable <lb/>
            Theodoric abbot of Jumièges,2 who caused him to be <lb/>
            educated according to the monastic rule in the school of <lb/>
            Christ and loved him much. Arriving at man's estate and <lb/>
            being proved fruitful in good works, the abbot appointed <lb/>
            him his vicar, to the great gain of the brethren's souls ; and <lb/>
            he was afterwards made master of the novices, and charged <lb/>
            with the care of the monastery as prior. At length, as we <lb/>
            have before related, he was translated from Jumieges in the <lb/>
            time of abbot Robert, and placed at the head of the new <lb/>
            abbey of Ouche, in the year of our Lord 1050, the fourth <lb/>
            indiction, being the nineteenth year of the reign of Henry <note type="footnote">1 Hugh, who was bishop of Lisieux from 1049 to 1077, was son of <lb/>
            William Count d'Eu, and Lesceline, foundress of the abbey of St. Pierre­ <lb/>

            William duke of Normandy.</p>
          <p>In founding the new society, Theodoric had the assistance <lb/>
            of his nephew Rodolph, with Hugh the chanter, and others <lb/>
            of the brethren who suited his purpose. It was with them <lb/>
            and by them that the new abbot zealously established a <lb/>
            regular system, and mild discipline, and becoming order, in <lb/>
            divine worship. He admitted as probationers for a change <lb/>
            of life applicants of every age and rank, diligently instructing <lb/>
            them in the rule of the holy father St. Benedict. Among <lb/>
            the first of those he humbly taught a stricter life in the school <lb/>
            of Christ, were Humfrey, Reginald, and Fulk, son of the dean <lb/>
            Fulk, with some other skilful grammarians. He like wise treated <lb/>
            with the greatest kindness Riculf, an old man, and Roger, <lb/>
            both country priests, and Durand the gardener, with Geof­ <lb/>
            frey, Olrie, and other simple disciples. As these were unable <lb/>
            to comprehend the depths of scripture doctrine, he fed them <lb/>
            with the milk of pious exhortation, and imparted to them <lb/>
            health and strength in their faith and devotion by the <lb/>
            example of his holy life. In that house of God, also, Her­ <lb/>
            bert and Berenger, Joscelin and Rodolf, Gislebert and <lb/>
            Bernard, Richard and William, with other youths of good <lb/>
            natural disposition, were carefully instructed in reading, <lb/>
            singing, and writing, and the diligent prosecution of other <lb/>
            useful studies, suitable to the servants of God seeking to <lb/>
            acquire the true knowledge. Meanwhile, the rude natives, <lb/>
            witnessing the growth of so much holiness on a barren soil, <lb/>
            now long deserted, were struck with admiration. This was <lb/>
            the salvation of some, the ruin of others. Those who <lb/>
            remarked the good conversation of the monks imitated their <lb/>
            example; while others, becoming jealous of them, caused <lb/>

            Roger de Montgomery,1 Visco unt d'Exmes,began to be jealous <lb/>
            of his neighbours, because they showed more zeal for the love <lb/>
            of God than himself, and he bethought him what work he <lb/>
            could undertake of a like nature for the good of his own soul. <lb/>
            He therefore resolved on attaching to himself Gislebert, <lb/>
            abbot of Chatillon, with his monks, who had begun to <lb/>
            establish themselves at Norrei; but, on Hugh and Robert's <lb/>
            altering their plans, as before mentioned, refused to follow <lb/>
            them, nay, more, left them altogether, accusing them of fickle­ <lb/>
            ness, for having changed the site of their intended monas­ <lb/>
            tery. Roger de Montgomery, therefore, invited these <lb/>
            monks, and granted Troarn to them, that they might there <lb/>
            erect an abbey, expelling the twelve canons who had been <lb/>
            placed there by his father.2 These secular clergy being thus <lb/>
            ejected because they abandoned themselves to gluttony, <lb/>
            debauchery, carnal delights, and worldly occupations, he <lb/>
            settled in their place monks who were subject to regular <lb/>
            discipline. In short, under the government of father Gis­ <lb/>
            lebert, the monks established a strict religious rule in the <lb/>
            church of St. Martin at Troarn, the maintenance of which <lb/>
            they committed to their successors to the time of their <lb/>
            death, and which has been preserved to this day under the <lb/>
            enlightened fathers Gerbert, Durand, and Arnulf succes­ <lb/>

          <p>I wish now to take some short notice of Circle, son of <lb/>
            Arnold-le-Gros, of Courceraut,3 son of Abbo the Breton, <lb/>
            whose family conferred many benefits on the monks of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, in order that posterity may know who and what he <lb/>
            was. He derived his origin from nobles of the highest <lb/>
            rank, both of France and Brittany, and distinguished himself <lb/>
            by his virtues and courage in the reigns of Hugh the Great <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger II. de Montgomery, who by his marriage with Mabel, daughter <lb/>
            of William Talvas, inherited the vast domains of that family. He was <lb/>
            afterwards one of the most distinguished followers of William duke of <lb/>
            Normandy and conqueror of England, by whom he was created earl of <lb/>
            Shrewsbury. There are frequent notices of this great nobleman in the <lb/>
            course of the present history, the more so, perhaps, as Odelirius, our author's <lb/>
            father, attended him to England, and became his trusty counsellor, being <lb/>
            probably born in the earl's household. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In 1050 Roger de Montgomery substituted monks for the canons who <lb/>

            and Robert, kings of the Franks. His sister Hildiarde had <lb/>
            three sons and eleven daughters, who, being married to <lb/>
            honourable men, gave birth to numerous sons, who, in the <lb/>
            next generation, became formidable to their enemies in the <lb/>
            wars in France, England, and Apulia. Among the other <lb/>
            gallant exploits of Giroie, was his battle, in concert with <lb/>
            William of Belesme, against Herbert, count of Maine. <lb/>
            William and his followers were vanquished and put to flight; <lb/>
            but Circle stood firm, and bore the brunt of the conflict, <lb/>
            until Herbert and his troops were forced to retreat, and <lb/>
            Giroie gained a victory, which, to this day, commands the <lb/>
            applause of all who are informed of it. Heugon,1 a powerful <lb/>
            Norman knight, offered him his only daughter in marriage, <lb/>
            and gave him Montreuil and Echaufour, and all his lands <lb/>
            adjoining these two places. Heugon dying soon afterwards, <lb/>
            Geroie succeeded to all his domains, although the lady to <lb/>
            whom he was betrothed died prematurely before the mar­ <lb/>
            riage. In consequence, William de Belesme introduced <lb/>
            Giroie to Richard the duke of Normandy at Rouen; and <lb/>
            the generous duke, in acknowledgment of his high deserts, <lb/>
            granted all the lands of Heugon to him and his heirs for ever. <lb/>
            On his return, Giroie married Gisela, a daughter of Turstin <lb/>
            de Bastembourg, by whom he had seven sons and four daugh­ <lb/>
            ters, whose names are as follows: Arnold, William, Fulk, <lb/>
            Ralphmal-Corona, Robert, Hugh, and Giroie; Herem­ <lb/>
            burge, Hawise, Emma, and Adelaide.</p>
          <p>Possessing richly all that this world can give, children, <lb/>
            riches, and ample domains, the brave knight so often men­ <lb/>
            tioned faithfully served the Giver of all good things, and <lb/>
            reverenced his church, and servants, and worship. From his <lb/>
            own funds he erected six churches to God's honour, two of <lb/>
            which were at Verneuces, one dedicated to St. Mary, mother <lb/>
            of God, and the other to St. Paul, doctor of the gentiles. <lb/>
            The third, in a vill called Glos, in the canton of <lb/>
            Lisieux, was dedicated to St. Peter, prince of the apostles; <lb/>
            the fourth at Echaufour, to St. Andrew the apostle; the <note type="footnote"> 1 The commune of Heugon derives its present name from this baron, <lb/>

            and the sixth at Hautrive, to St. Martin the confessor. <lb/>
            With such saints as his patrons, this brave knight lived long <lb/>
            in honour in this world, and, dying, obtained, as we trust, by <lb/>
            the merits of their intercessions, the pardon of his sins and <lb/>
            everlasting rest in the society of the blessed.</p>
          <p>At the death of Giroie, his sons were of tender years, <lb/>
            except two, Arnold and William, who had received knight­ <lb/>
            hood under these circumstances : Gislebert, count of Brionne, <lb/>
            relying on his valour, and coveting an extension of his <lb/>
            boundaries, invaded the territories of the young heirs with <lb/>
            a formidable band, endeavouring to wrest Montreuil from <lb/>
            them by force of arms. However, they collected a body of <lb/>
            their kinsmen and retainers, and, boldly offering battle to <lb/>
            Gislebert in the open fields, defeated him with much slaugh­ <lb/>
            ter, and put him to flight, not long afterwards forcibly <lb/>
            seizing, by way of revenge, the burgh called Sap.1 Mean­ <lb/>
            while, Duke Robert interfered, and compassionating the <lb/>
            orphans, while lie praised their bravery, he induced Gisle­ <lb/>
            bert to cede Sap to them, that the peace might be lasting. <lb/>
            In the end, that same count, giving uneasiness to the seven <lb/>
            sons of Giroie, and attempting to recover the burgh of Sap, <lb/>
            which he bad given up to them at the instance of Duke <lb/>
            Robert, met his death through their boldness and courage, <lb/>
            although he was attended by a large body of men.2</p>
          <p>All these brothers were brave and generous, skilled and <lb/>
            active in warlike exercises, formidable to their enemies, <lb/>
            gentle and courteous to their associates. They prospered in <lb/>
            various ways; but, notwithstanding, such is human life, they <lb/>
            fell to decay at last. It would be too long and impossible <lb/>
            for me to relate distinctly the acts of all the brothers; but I <lb/>
            am desirous, at least to leave something on record for pos- <note type="footnote"> 1 Sap is a village near Montreuil and St. Evroult. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It has been already remarked that the circumstances which caused the <lb/>
            death of Gislebert, count of Brionne, were far from honourable to his <lb/>
            memory. It appears that on two occasions he took advantage of the youth <lb/>
            and weakness of Giroie's sons, to endeavour to wrest from them one of the <lb/>
            best of their patrimonial domains. At the same time the details of his <lb/>
            death, which did not take place till after the succession of Duke William, <lb/>
            are also discreditable to the family of Giroie, two of whom, as William de <lb/>

            terity as to the end of each. Arnold, the eldest, a brave <lb/>
            and honourable man, while one day amusing himself with <lb/>
            sports at Montreuil, in wrestling with a powerful young <lb/>
            man, fell against the sharp angle of a bank, and breaking <lb/>
            three of his ribs, died on the third day afterwards. William, <lb/>
            the second in order of birth, lived for many years, and all <lb/>
            his life governed his brothers; for he was eloquent and gay, <lb/>
            liberal and brave, beloved by his inferiors, and the terror of his <lb/>
            enemies. None of his neighbours ventured to make inroads <lb/>
            on his territories in any shape, nor to subject his people to <lb/>
            any kind of exactions. He exercised episcopal jurisdiction <lb/>
            in the lands of Montreuil and Echaufour, and no archdeacon <lb/>
            was permitted to interfere with the priests of 'those two <lb/>
            lordships; for it happened that when his father Giroie suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the domains of Heugon, as before related, he <lb/>
            inquired of the inhabitants of the district in what bishopric <lb/>
            it was situated. They replied that they belonged to no bishop­ <lb/>
            ric ; upon which he exclaimed: " This is quite wrong; far <lb/>
            be it from me to live without a pastor, and exempt from the <lb/>
            yoke of ecclesiastical discipline." Upon further inquiry, <lb/>
            which of the neighbouring bishops was most devoted to his <lb/>
            religious duties, being informed of the virtues of Roger, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux, he placed all his territories under his <lb/>
            jurisdiction, persuading Baldric de Bauquencei and his sons­ <lb/>
            in-law Wascelin d'Echanfré and Roger de Merlerault, who <lb/>
            enjoyed a similar exemption, to place their domains, in like <lb/>
            manner, under the same bishop. Roger, bishop of Lisieux, <lb/>
            observing that these nobles made a voluntary surrender of <lb/>
            their immunities, complimented them on their devotion, and <lb/>
            granted them the privilege that the clergy on their estates <lb/>
            should not be impleaded out of their lords' jurisdiction, and <lb/>
            should be exempt from the oppressions of the archdeacon's <lb/>
            visitations. This privilege was strictly maintained by <lb/>
            William de Giroie, who obtained the same exemption for the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult from Bishop Hugh.1 <lb/>
             <note type="footnote">1 This exemption from episcopal jurisdiction of territories which were the <lb/>

            much beloved by Richard and Robert dukes of Normandy, <lb/>
            for the fidelity which he maintained towards his liege lords <lb/>
            Robert de Belesme, Talvas and Geoffrey, and others, either <lb/>
            his [feudal] superiors or allies. In so doing he was sub­ <lb/>
            jected to constant molestation and even danger. He even <lb/>
            voluntarily razed his own castle of Montacute1 to effect the <lb/>
            redemption of his Lord Geoffrey de Mayenne, when he was <lb/>
            taken prisoner by William Talvas, and his liberation was <lb/>
            refused on any other terms than the demolition of that <lb/>
            castle which overawed the territories of Talvas. The release <lb/>
            of Geoffrey from captivity having been thus obtained, he <lb/>
            built the castle of St. Ceneri on the Sarthe, for the baron <lb/>
            Giroie, in return for the devoted fidelity he had shown. <lb/>
            I could say much more of this William de Giroie, but <lb/>

            account of his knowledge of letters and skill in other arts. <lb/>
            He was also called Mala-corona, because in his youth he <lb/>
            gave himself up to military exercises and other frivolities. <lb/>
            He was versed in medicine, and in many deep secrets of <lb/>
            nature, so that old men even now speak of him with wonder <lb/>
            to their children and grand-children. In the course of time, <lb/>
            he retired from the seductions of the world to the convent <lb/>
            of Marmoutier, where he became a monk under the abbot <lb/>
            Albert, and devoutly prayed to God that his body might be <lb/>
            overspread with the loathsome disease of leprosy, that so his <lb/>
            soul might be cleansed from the foulness of his sins. Ob­ <lb/>
            taining his pious wish, he died happily six years after his <lb/>
            conversion.</p>
          <p>Hugh, the sixth brother, was unfortunately slain in the <lb/>
            flower of his youth; for while he was returning one day <lb/>
            from the castle of St. Scholasse, accompanied by his brothers <lb/>
            and a large retinue, lie stopped near the church of St. Ger­ <lb/>

            and his own squire, hurling a spear carelessly, mortally <lb/>
            wounded him. Being of an amiable disposition, he pre­ <lb/>
            sently called for the squire and said to him privately: <lb/>
            “ Flee with all haste, for you have severely wounded me. <lb/>
            God have mercy on you! escape before my brothers are <lb/>

            Roger. Adelaide, the fourth, married Solomon de Sable, <lb/>
            and bore him Reginald, whose son Lisiard is now a great <lb/>
            supporter of Henry, king of England, against the count of <lb/>
            Anjou. Having said enough of the family of Giroie, let us <lb/>
            now return to the matter from which we have somewhat <lb/>
            digressed.</p>
          <p>In the first year of the foundation of the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, William and Robert, sons of Giroie, and Hugh and <lb/>
            Robert, their nephews, assembled at Ouche, with their sons, <lb/>
            nephews, and barons. Consulting together for the advantage <lb/>
            of the unfinished monastery which they had begun to erect, <lb/>
            they agreed in common that each of them should at his <lb/>
            death bequeath his body to St. Evroult with the whole o <lb/>
            his substance, and that none of them should make a gift <lb/>
            whether of tithes, or of a church or anything appertaining <lb/>
            to a church, nor even offer it for sale, without first giving the <lb/>
            option to the monks of St. Evroult. This agreement was <lb/>
            firmly ratified by the priest Fulcoin, and Osmond Basset, by <lb/>
            Louvet and Fulk, sons of Fredenlend, Odo the Red and <lb/>
            Richard son of Gulbert, Robert de Torp, and Giroie des <lb/>
            Loges, with others their barons. The founders of the monas­ <lb/>
            terv then took account of their possessions, and granted a <lb/>
            fair portion, according to their ability, to the church they <lb/>
            were building.</p>
          <p>These are the possessions which Robert and Hugh and <pb n="396"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. CH. II.</note><lb/>
            Arnold, sons of Robert de Grand-mesnil, granted to the <lb/>

            the church, and all the tithes, with the priests glebe and <lb/>
            three plough-lands, together with the vill called Soulange; <lb/>
            in Ouillie, all the benefice which Tezcelin the clerk held, <lb/>
            and the tithes of the mills of that vill; English-Ville with its <lb/>

            in the vilI called Oth, the monastery, the priest's land, <lb/>
            and the tithes of the mills of that vill; and in the monastery <lb/>
            of Guéprei, they gave that part which their father Robert <lb/>
            held; besides the tithe of La Bigne, and at Beaumais the <lb/>
            third part of a mill with the tithe of the same; and the be­ <lb/>
            nefice of the priest Fulcuin, namely the church and tithe of <lb/>
            Grand-mesnil, and the tithe of the mill of Olivet ; one yearly <lb/>
            tenant at Colleville with the tithe of the whole vill; also the <lb/>
            tithe of wax, and the tithe of St. Pierre d'Entremont; <lb/>
            moreover the church in the village called Fougi, and that <lb/>
            portion of the tithes of Coulonces which was held by their <lb/>
            father Robert. Hugh gave the lands of Quilli to the afore­ <lb/>
            said abbey, on the petition of the lords of that vill, whose <lb/>
            tenure was allodial; also the tithe of all his ploughs and <lb/>
            beasts of burden, and the tithe of Mont-Chauvet, both of tolls <lb/>
            and of corn, and the church of Louvigni with the priest's <lb/>
            glebe. He gave besides the land called Noyer-Mesnard; at <lb/>
            the place named Mesnil Bernard, one plough-land, and the <lb/>
            fields of the vilI of La Tanaisie; moreover the cell of Manselles <lb/>

          <p>When Theodoric had been, by the grace of God, conse­ <lb/>

            Fresnel, the church of Our Lady of the Wood,1 as it was <lb/>
            held by a certain monk of the name of Placidus. Moreover, <lb/>
            Hubert de Anceins sold to the abbot the church of that vilI, <lb/>
            and some acres of land. All these belonging to the lord­ <lb/>
            ship of William Fitz-Osbern the steward, were granted by <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Next, Robert son of Giroie, ratifying and confirming all <lb/>
            that his brothers and nephews with their allies had given to <lb/>
            the abbey of St. Evroult, gave also to the same, of his own <lb/>

            lain, and the whole tithes of Siral, and of all the lands <lb/>
            which he should thereafter acquire. Then also, Ralph, son <lb/>
            of Godfrey, his man-at-arms, gave with his consent the <lb/>
            church of Radon to the same abbey. Hearing of these <lb/>
            benefactions, a good knight named Wadon de Dreux made <lb/>
            a gift of the church of St. Michael on the Arve, in the <lb/>
            canton of Evreux, with the consent of the lords under whom <lb/>
            he held it, and his sons, kindred, and friends.</p>
          <p>These were the benefactions with which William and <lb/>
            Robert and others their kinsmen, endowed the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, and, making a charter of them, presented it to <lb/>
            William duke of Nomandy for his confirmation. The duke <lb/>
            gave a favourable reception to their petition, and graciously <lb/>
            ratified their donations to the before-mentioned abbey. He <lb/>
            also granted this special privilege to the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, that it should be for ever exempt from all foreign <lb/>
            jurisdiction. With respect also to the election of the abbots, <lb/>
            he vested it entirely in the chapter of the brethren, subject <lb/>
            to the rules of regular discipline, but on condition that the <lb/>
            votes were not corruptly obtained, either by favouritism, or <lb/>
            relationship, or certainly not by bribery. At the end of <lb/>
            the charter the duke had this clause inserted, ratifying the <note type="footnote"> - 1 “ Sanctæ Mariæ de Bosco," Notre-Dame-du-Bois, originally the mother <lb/>

          <p>The same year Robert de Grand-mesnil put off the secular <lb/>
            habit, and submitted to the monastic rule under abbot <lb/>
            Theodoric at St. Evroult. We have already mentioned that <lb/>
            he was the SOIl of Robert de Grand-mesnil, a powerful <lb/>
            baron by Hawise the daughter of Giroie. In his childhood <lb/>
            he applied himself diligently to letters, and was distinguished <lb/>
            among those of his own age for his retentive memory. But <lb/>
            from his earliest youth he began to despise the inaction <lb/>
            of learning, and sought with eagerness the toils of arms, <note type="footnote"> 1 Formerly St. Denis-en-Lions. This seems to have been a favourite <lb/>

            becoming for five years an esquire of Duke William. He <lb/>
            was then raised by the same duke to the honours of chivalry; <lb/>
            and having been knighted, received at the duke's hands <lb/>
            noble rewards. Reflecting however on the chances of life, <lb/>
            he chose rather to serve humbly in the Lord's house than <lb/>
            to flourish like grass in the courts of the wicked. For he <lb/>
            recollected the perils of worldly warfare, which had been <lb/>
            experienced by his father and a host of others, who attack­ <lb/>
            ing their enemies fell into the snares which they had laid <lb/>
            for others and perished. Thus lis father Robert joined <lb/>
            with Roger de Toni in battle against Roger de Beaumont, <lb/>
            in which fight Roger de Toni, with his two sons Elbert and <lb/>
            Elinance were slain outright, and Robert received a mortal <lb/>
            wound in his bowels. Being carried off the field he survived <lb/>
            three weeks, and divided his lands between his sons Hugh <lb/>
            and Robert. Dying on the 14th of the calends of July <lb/>
            [18th of June], he was interred without the church of St. <lb/>
            Mary at Norrei.1 This calamity roused his son Robert to <lb/>
            strive in a better warfare. His first intention was to found a <lb/>
            convent at Norrei, as it has been already stated, for the <lb/>
            good of his soul and those of his ancestors, and to endow it <lb/>
            liberally with the whole of his patrimony, if his brother <lb/>
            Hugh consented. But his plans being changed, by the <lb/>
            advice of his uncle William Giroie, he made the general <lb/>
            deed of gift, jointly with his brother Hugh of the possessions <lb/>
            already enumerated, and coming to St. Evroult there <lb/>
            solemnly professed himself a monk according to the rule of <lb/>
            St. Benedict. He suffered much inconvenience in supplying <lb/>
            the necessities of the church, and often laid hands on the <lb/>
            substance of his kinsfolk, who were very wealthy, charitably <lb/>
            distributing it in the support of the faithful, for the <lb/>
            salvation of their souls. Paying his mother Hawise <lb/>
            forty livres of Rouen, he deprived her of her dowry, con­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>TIlE venerable abbot Theodoric zealously enforced the <lb/>
            monastic rule, and studied, both in his words and actions the <lb/>
            profit of the community entrusted to his charge. He was <lb/>
            a Norman by birth, of the district of Talon; he was of <lb/>
            middle stature, his face ruddy, and his voice agreeable ; well <lb/>
            versed in the sacred scriptures, and engaged in the duties <lb/>
            of divine worship from childhood to old age. But as tares <lb/>
            spring up unexpectedly among the wheat and are roofed <lb/>
            out by the careful husbandman at the time of harvest, <lb/>
            and delivered to the destroying flames, so sons of Belial are <lb/>
            mingled in the company of the faithful, until at the time <lb/>
            predestined, they are detected by the righteous Judge, and <lb/>
            strictly subjected to the punishment they deserve. In the <lb/>
            time of abbot Theodoric there was a monk in the society of <lb/>
            Evroult named Romanus, who was instigated by the devil to <lb/>
            to steal the linen, and breeches, and other articles of that <lb/>
            nature; and when he was repeatedly called to account by <lb/>
            father Theodoric for such misdeeds, he stoutly denied being <lb/>
            guilty of the theft, though he soon after confessed it. One <lb/>
            night, however, while he was in bed he was seized by the <lb/>
            demon and grievously tormented. The monks heard his hor­ <lb/>
            rible shrieks, and, coming to him and shaking him, sprinkled <lb/>
            him with holy water, and with difficulty released him from the <lb/>
            evil spirit which tormented him. Being come to himself, <lb/>
            the monk understood that the devil bad obtained this power <lb/>
            over him on account of the thefts he had committed, and <pb n="403"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1050—1057.]"/><lb/>
            made promises of keeping himself for the future from such <lb/>
            offences. But afterwards he returned like a dog to his <lb/>
            vomit, so that father Theodoric ordered his cowl to be <lb/>
            stripped off, and turned him out of the convent. Thus expelled <lb/>
            from the society of the brethren, it is reported that he <lb/>
            undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but what was his <lb/>
            future lot we are wholly uninformed.</p>
          <p>A certain priest whose name was Ansered, who lived in <lb/>
            the commune of Sap led a very irregular life. But while <lb/>
            suffering from disease he entreated the monks of St. Evroult <lb/>
            to give him the habit of St. Benedict. Wrapped in this <lb/>
            he was carried to the abbey and sent to the infirmary. But <lb/>
            as soon as he recovered from his sickness, he resumed as <lb/>
            nearly as possible the same irregularity of conduct which <lb/>
            he had exhibited under the secular dress, so true it is as a <lb/>
            wise writer says;­ <lb/>
            " No change of clime can bring an altered mind.”1</p>
          <p>This mail changed, indeed, his habit, but not his habitual <lb/>
            conduct. The abbot Theodoric observed his reprehensible <lb/>
            life and conversation, and heard that he detested the <lb/>
            religious rule; for he had sent word to his father and <lb/>
            mother that he was slandered, and entreated them to remove <lb/>
            him from the monastery. The abbot therefore, acting in <lb/>
            this case on the apostolic precept, " Put away from among <lb/>
            yourselves the wicked person;" and that which saith: "If <lb/>
            an unbelieving brother depart, let him depart,”2 permitted <lb/>
            him to retire from the abbey and enter again into the world. <lb/>
            The man, adding sin to sin, kept company with a woman of <lb/>
            light chraacter: and not satisfied with her, made love to <lb/>
            another whose name was Pomula. He made an appoint­ <lb/>
            ment with her that they should go together to the shrine of <lb/>
            St. Giles, hoping to keep the affair from coming to <lb/>
            the knowledge of his parents and friends. Having fixed <lb/>
            with her a place of meeting from which they should <lb/>
            proceed in company, he himself set forth with some pilgrims <lb/>
            who were going to the church of St. Giles. The woman, <lb/>
            however, without informing Ansered, broke her engagement <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Cœlum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt." </note><note type="footnote"> Hor. Ep. I. xi. 27. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I Cor. v. 13—vii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> DD2</note> <pb n="404"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. III. CH. III."/><lb/>
            <lb/>
            and formed a connection with another clerk. Ansered, <lb/>
            arriving at the appointed place of meeting, and not finding <lb/>
            the woman there, said to his fellow pilgrims : "I must <lb/>
            return home, having forgotten something for which I have <lb/>
            occasion ; but you need not lose any time on the road, for <lb/>
            I shall soon overtake you." Retracing, then, his steps, and <lb/>
            getting into the house in which the woman lived, by night, <lb/>
            he found her in bed with the clerk. She signified to her <lb/>
            lover that Ansered was there, upon which the clerk snatched <lb/>
            up an axe, and striking Ansered on the head killed him on <lb/>
            the spot. He then enclosed the body in a sack, and drag­ <lb/>
            ging it to a distance concealed it from sight in a hole in the <lb/>
            ground. Sometime afterwards the body was found, for the <lb/>
            wild beasts had disinterred it, devouring a leg and a thigh, <lb/>
            and the discovery was made by the offensive smell. Indeed <lb/>
            it was so pestiferous that no one could go near the spot. <lb/>
            His father and mother, who were attached to him more than <lb/>
            to any others, took up the remains and buried them outside <lb/>
            the cemetery of the church. Such was the end of one who <lb/>
            preferred returning to the vanities of the world, to spend­ <lb/>
            ing his days with the servants of God in the religious life <lb/>
            which would lead him upwards to the heavenly kingdom.</p>
          <p>Another priest, whose name was Adelard, having assumed <lb/>
            the monastic habit in consequence of his infirmities, gave to <lb/>
            God and St. Evroult and his monks the church of Sap, with <lb/>
            the tithes, of which he was enfeoffed, to be held by them in <lb/>
            perpetuity. But having recovered his health, he repented <lb/>
            of what he had done, and was bent on returning to the <lb/>
            world. Abbot Theodoric, upon hearing this, caused the <lb/>
            rule of St. Benedict to be read to him, and then thus <lb/>
            addressed him : "You have heard the rule under which you <lb/>
            have engaged to serve, if you can keep it, continue with us, <lb/>
            but if you cannot, depart free ;” for he would not detain <lb/>
            any such against their will. Whereupon, Adelard, obsti­ <lb/>
            nately persisting in his evil design, withdrew himself from <lb/>
            the monastery, and resumed the secular habit which he had <lb/>
            relinquished ; but when he sought to recover the church of <lb/>
            Sap which he bad made over to the monks of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            Hugh de Grantmesnil, to whom the lordship of Sap be­ <lb/>
            longed, would not consent. He therefore retired among <lb/>
            his relations at Friardel, for he was of a good family, and <pb n="405"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 1050—1057.]"/><lb/>
            lived there nearly fifteen years. But lie was never restored <lb/>
            to good health, being afflicted with incessant infirmities. <lb/>
            At last, perceiving that his end was approaching, and <lb/>
            alarmed at the punishment which awaited his apostacy, <lb/>
            he entreated abbot Mainer, who was the fourth in succes­ <lb/>
            sion from the venerable Theodoric, that he might be allowed <lb/>
            to resume the monastic habit which be had forfeited for <lb/>
            his sins. But he died three weeks after his request was <lb/>
            granted, being in such a state of weakness that he could not <lb/>
            dispense with female attendance, so that he never returned <lb/>
            alive to the monastery from winch he had withdrawn.</p>
          <p>In the time of William, duke of Normandy, Ivo, son of <lb/>
            William de Belesme, held the bishopric of Séez,1 and, on the <lb/>
            death of his brothers Warin, Robert, and William, inherited <lb/>
            the town of Belesme as his father's heir. The bishop was <lb/>
            handsome in person, learned, wise, and eloquent; witty, and <lb/>
            of a most cheerful temper. He treated his clergy and the <lb/>
            monks with parental kindness, and held Abbot Theodoric in <lb/>
            great reverence, as among the chief of his friends. They <lb/>
            had much private intercourse, for the city of Seez is only <lb/>
            seven leagues from the abbey of St. Evroult.2 Roger de <lb/>
            Montgomery, Viscount d'Exmes, had married Mabel, the <lb/>
            bishop's niece, with whom he acquired a large portion of the <lb/>
            domains of William de Belesme. This Roger, at the sug­ <lb/>
            gestion and by the advice of the bishop, transferred the <lb/>
            church of St. Martin at Séez to Theodoric, abbot of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and, in conjunction with his wife, earnestly begged <lb/>
            that he would erect a monastery in that place. The bishop <lb/>
            without delay commenced the work assigned to him, in the <lb/>
            Lord's name, and settled at Séez Roger, a monk of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, in priests orders, together with Morin and Engel­ <lb/>
            bert, and others of his disciples, while he often repaired <lb/>
            thither himself, remaining sometimes four or five weeks at a <lb/>
            time, urging the prosecution of the work for the love of <lb/>
            God and the good of posterity.3 Now, this Mabel was <lb/>
            both powerful and politic, shrewd and fluent, but extremely <note type="footnote"> 1 He was bishop of Séez from 1035 to 1070. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The leagues here spoken of appear to be about 2200 toises, of six feet <lb/>

            cruel. Still she had a high regard for the excellent Theodoric, <lb/>
            and in some things submitted to his admonitions, although <lb/>
            in general she was severe with men of religion. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, her son Roger, whose cruelties to his wretched <lb/>
            dependants has made him notorious in the times in which <lb/>
            I live, was brought to Roger and the rest of the monks <lb/>
            settled at Seez, to receive from them the holy sacrament of <lb/>
            baptism.</p>
          <p>True grace makes those in whose hearts it rules the <lb/>
            delight of the good and the terror of evil-doers. Thus Abbot <lb/>
            Theodoric was deservedly beloved by all good men, while he <lb/>
            was feared by the wicked. As far as possible avoiding <lb/>
            worldly cares, he devoted himself with earnest zeal to the <lb/>
            worship of God. But, though diligent in the offices of <lb/>
            prayer, he did not neglect such manual labours as were fitting <lb/>
            his station. He was a skilful scribe, and he left to the <lb/>
            young monks of St. Evroult some splendid specimens of his <lb/>
            calligraphy. The book of Collects, the Gradual, and Anti­ <lb/>
            phonary, were all written in the convent with his own <lb/>
            hand. He procured also, by gentle solicitations, from <lb/>
            his colleagues who accompanied him from Jumieges, several <lb/>
            precious books of the divine law. Thus, his nephew <lb/>
            Rodolf transcribed the Heptateuch,1 and the missal from <lb/>
            which the mass was sung daily in the choir; Hugh, his <lb/>
            companion, made a copy of the commentary on Ezekiel, and <lb/>
            the Decalogue, and the first part of the moral books; and <lb/>
            Roger the priest, of the Paralipomena, the books of Solo­ <lb/>
            mon, and the third part of the moral books.</p>
          <p>The worthy abbot, so often named, by these scribes and <lb/>
            other antiquaries whom he succeeded in engaging in this <lb/>
            work, during the eight years he governed the convent of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, was able to procure for the library of the abbey <lb/>
            all the books of the Old and New Testament, with the <lb/>
            entire works of the eloquent Pope Gregory. From the <lb/>
            same school proceeded some learned and excellent penmen, <lb/>
            such as Berenger, who was afterwards made bishop of <lb/>
            Venusa, Goscelin and Rodolph, Bernard, Turketil, and <lb/>
            Richard, with many more, who filled the. library at St. <lb/>
            Evroult with the works of St. Jerome and St. Augustine, St. <note type="footnote"> 1 The first seven books of the Old Testament. The books before men­ <lb/>
            tioned were offices used in the daily services of the church. </note> <pb n="407"/>

            Ambrose and Isidore, Euscbius and Orosius, and other <lb/>
            doctors of the church,1 while, by their useful labours and <lb/>
            example they encouraged the youths who were to succeed <lb/>
            them in similar pursuits.</p>
          <p>These novices the man of God himself instructed, often <lb/>
            admonishing them carefully to shun the idleness of an <lb/>
            unstable disposition, which is apt to enervate both mind and <lb/>
            body ; and addressing them in such words as these: "One <lb/>
            of the brethren in a certain convent was guilty of repeated <lb/>
            transgressions of the monastic rule, but he was a good scribe, <lb/>
            and so applied himself to writing that he copied of his own <lb/>
            accord a bulky volume of the holy scriptures.2 After his <lb/>
            death, his soul was brought before the tribunal of the <lb/>
            righteous Judge. There the evil spirits sharply accused <lb/>
            him, laying to his charge his innumerable offences; the holy <lb/>
            angels, on the other hand, produced the volume which the <lb/>
            brother bad transcribed in the sanctuary of the Lord, <lb/>
            counting letter for letter of the enormous volume against <lb/>
            the several sins which the monk bad committed. At last <lb/>
            the letters had a majority of only one, against which all the <lb/>
            devices of the devils failed to discover an equivalent failing. <lb/>
            The mercy of the Judge was, therefore, extended to the sin­ <lb/>
            ful brother, and his soul was permitted to return to the <lb/>
            body, in order that he might enjoy an opportunity of <lb/>
            amending his life. Reflect frequently, my dearly beloved <lb/>
            brethren, on this example, and cleanse your hearts from vain <lb/>
            and sinful desires, offering continually the works of your <lb/>
            hands as an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord your God. <note type="footnote"> 1 The French editors of Ordericus caused diligent search to be made in <lb/>
            the public library at Alencon, to which the books saved at the destruction <lb/>

            here mentioned might have escaped the ravages of time or violence, but <lb/>
            nothing was discovered which could be traced to the period of abbot Theo­ <lb/>

            belonged to Queen Emma, and was given to the abbey of St. Evroult by <lb/>

            Shun sloth, that deadly poison, with the utmost care, for <lb/>
            what saith one holy father Benedict?—‘ Sloth is the mortal <lb/>
            enemy of the soul.’ Ponder often, also, on what is said by <lb/>
            a doctor of eminence in his Lives of the Fathers: that <lb/>
            only a single evil spirit vexes with his wiles the monk who <lb/>

            cloister, and to hanker after the soul-destroying vanities of <lb/>
            the world, and indulgence in fatal delights. You, indeed, <lb/>
            have not the means of feeding the poor with your alms, <lb/>

          <p>By such admonitions, Father Theodoric instructed his <lb/>
            disciples, diligently stirring them up by argument, by <lb/>
            entreaty, and by rebuke, to those good works of which he <lb/>
            he himself set them the example, not only in the oflices of <lb/>
            devotion, but by writing and other useful occupations. For <lb/>
            these he was hated by some of the monks, who preferred <lb/>
            secular concerns to their religious duties. Alas ! they cen­ <lb/>
            sured him for that which merited the highest respect; while <lb/>
            they muttered: “This man is not fit to be an abbot, for he <lb/>
            undervalues and neglects all worldly thrift. But how are <lb/>
            the men of prayer to subsist, if the men of the plough are <lb/>
            not forthcoming ?1 He must be a fool who is more anxious <lb/>
            about reading and writing in his monastery than about the <lb/>
            means of procuring subsistence for the brethren." Some <lb/>
            of the monks indulged insolent talk of this description, <lb/>
            wronging the man of God with more of the same sort; but <lb/>
            William, the son of Giroie, constantly paid him deep reve­ <lb/>
            rence for his sanctity, and checked the ebullitions of the <note type="footnote"> 1 We are obliged to use a p riphrasis for one of those antithetical <lb/>

            malcontents, whom I forbear to name, with great severity, <lb/>
            affording hint ready aid in all contentions which arose, both <lb/>
            within and without the monastery. However, after some <lb/>
            time, this noble soldier resolved on a journey to Apulia, <lb/>
            upon business in which the welfare of the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Evroult was concerned; and during his absence, which was <lb/>
            much prolonged, the holy father Theodoric was left alone and <lb/>
            forlorn in Normandy.</p>
          <p>The conduct of wicked men is no less repugnant to the <lb/>
            good, than theirs is to men of corrupt minds ; so that as <lb/>
            good men, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, use all the means <lb/>
            in their power to bring the wicked into the way of righteous­ <lb/>
            ness ; so these, actuated by the malignant influence of the <lb/>
            devil, often strive zealously to turn the righteous into the <lb/>
            paths of wickedness. They may not, perhaps, succeed in <lb/>
            ruining them utterly, but they are sometimes able to per­ <lb/>
            plex them in various ways, and cause them to be sluggish in <lb/>
            their sacred calling. In this manner, while the abbey of <lb/>
            Evroult was rising, and, enriched by good works, was <lb/>
            becoming glorious both in the sight of God and man, some <lb/>
            flagitious persons fomented various grudges against the <lb/>
            society, causing infinite trouble in what concerned the sub­ <lb/>
            sistence, and the clothing, and the sacred entertainments1 of <lb/>
            the monks. But although tempestuous waves threatened to <lb/>
            overwhelm the ship of the church, Christ, her true spouse, <lb/>
            graciously manifested the brightness of his presence to <lb/>
            succour his servants and confound the machinations of their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>I propose in this place to give a true account of what <lb/>
            happened to Mabel, daughter of William Talvas, though it is <lb/>
            somewhat out of order. This lady caused many troubles, <lb/>
            iniquitously contrived, to the monks of St. Evroult, on <lb/>
            account of the hatred she bore to the founders of the abbey, <lb/>
            notwithstanding that the monastic rule was strictly observed <lb/>
            from the beginning, and the offices of charity were duly <lb/>
            performed to all comers, as the custom is to this day. For <lb/>
            she, as well as her father and all her kindred, fostered a <lb/>
            never-ceasing animosity against the family of Giroie. But <lb/>
            as her husband Roger de Montgomery loved and honoured, <note type="footnote"> 1 Aganeu ; in the strict sense of the word, the love-feasts, peculiar to <lb/>
            the apostolic and primitive ages of the church. </note> <lb/>

            the monks, she did not venture to exhibit any open signs of <lb/>
            her malicious feeling. She therefore made the abbey her <lb/>
            frequent resort, attended by numerous bands of armed <lb/>
            retainers, under pretence of claiming the hospitality of the <lb/>
            monks,1 but to their great oppression in the indigence to <lb/>
            which they were subjected by the barrenness of their lands. <lb/>
            At one time, when she had taken up her abode at the abbey <lb/>
            with a hundred men-at-arms, and was questioned by abbot <lb/>
            Theodoric why she came with such a splendid retinue to the <lb/>
            abode of poor anchorites, and was warned to abstain from <lb/>
            such absurdity, she exclaimed, in great wrath: " When I <lb/>
            come again, my followers shall be still more numerous.” <lb/>
            The abbot replied: " Trust me ; unless you repent of this <lb/>
            iniquity you will suffer what will be very painful to you." <lb/>
            And so it happened: for the very night following she was <lb/>
            attacked by a disorder which caused her great suffering. <lb/>
            Upon this, she gave instant orders for being carried forth <lb/>
            from the abbey, and, hastening in a state of alarm to By from <lb/>
            the territory of St. Evroult, she passed by the dwelling of a <lb/>
            certain farmer named Roger Suisnar, whose infant child she <lb/>
            caused to suck her nipple, which occasioned her the severest <lb/>
            pain. The infant died soon afterwards, while Mabel reached <lb/>
            her home restored to health. She lived fifteen years after­ <lb/>
            wards, but never ventured to return to St. Evroult, after <lb/>
            having there suffered under the chastisement of God; and <lb/>
            from thenceforth she was very careful not to meddle, either <lb/>
            for good or evil, with the occupants of the abbey, so long as <lb/>
            she enjoyed the checquered delights of the present life. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding, she had a great regard for abbot Theodoric, <lb/>
            and confided to him much more than to the convent of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, the cell of St. Martin, as I have already remarked <lb/>
            in anticipation.</p>
          <p>[A.D. 1016—1030.]2 While Pope Benedict filled the <note type="footnote"> 1 A common grievance in the feudal ages. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author here begins an account of the Norman conquests in the <lb/>
            south of Italy, which is far from satisfactory ; it is therefore proposed to <lb/>
            inquire shortly how much truth and how much error it contains. It was in <lb/>
            the year 1016 that a band of forty Norman pilgrims returning from Mount <lb/>
            Garganus, met Melo the Lombard, who invited them to assist him in <lb/>
            recovering Apulia. But it belonged at that time to the Greek emperor <lb/>
            hot to the Saracens, although the latter had ravaged it for two centuries, <lb/>
            but without establishing any settlement. The year following, Melo, with </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            apostolic see, the Saracens of Africa made an annual descent <lb/>
            with their galleys on the coast of ApnEa, levying with <lb/>
            impunity whatever contributions they pleased from the <lb/>
            degenerate Lombards, of the Apulian cities, and the Greek <lb/>
            colonies in Calabria. In those days, Osmond surnamed <lb/>
            Drengot, hearing William Repostel insolently boast, in the <lb/>
            presence of the Norman nobles, of having dishonoured his <lb/>
            daughter, slew him in the presence of Robert the duke, in a <lb/>
            wood where they were hunting. For this crime he was <lb/>
            forced to make his escape with his sons and nephews, first <lb/>
            into Brittany, afterwards into England, and at length, to <lb/>
            Beneventum. He was the first Norman who established <lb/>
            himself in Apulia, having obtained from the prince of <lb/>
            Beneventum the grant of a, town as a settlement for himself <lb/>
            and his heirs. Afterwards, a Norman knight who had gone <lb/>
            on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with a hundred men-at-arms, <lb/>
            was hospitably entertained with his followers, on their return, <lb/>
            by the Duke Waimalch, who humanely kept them several <lb/>
            days, in order that they might refresh themselves. While <lb/>
            they were there twenty thousand Saracens made a descent on <lb/>
            the coast of Italy, and demanded, with great threats, tribute <lb/>
            from the inhabitants of Salernum. While the duke and his <lb/>
            guards were gathering the tribute from the citizens, the <note type="footnote"> the help of the Normans, recovered this fine country from the Greeks, but <lb/>
            in 1019 he was in turn defeated by Bugienus, and his Norman auxiliaries <lb/>
            were reduced to two hundred and seventy. Osmond, or Godfrey Drengot, <lb/>
            did not arrive until the year 1020. William Repostel was not the favourite <lb/>
            of Duke Robert, but of his father, Richard II. By the intervention of <lb/>
            Pope Benedict VIII., this fresh band of Normans was received with open <lb/>
            arms by the Lombard chief, who employed them in various wars against <lb/>
            the Greeks, the Saracens, and sometimes among themselves. The story of <lb/>
            the 20,000 Saracens surprised by one hundred Normans while they were <lb/>
            taking refreshment in a meadow near Salerno, appears to be pure inven­ <lb/>
            tion. In Naples the Normans first established themselves at A versa, a city <lb/>
            they built in the year 1030, on lands granted them by Sergius III., the <lb/>
            then duke of Naples. Drengot was dead when the Emperor Conrad <lb/>
            created his brother Ranulf count of Aversa in 1038. About that time <lb/>
            William Bras-de-fer, Drogon, and Humphrey, the sons of Tancred de <lb/>
            Hauteville, came into Italy. William, as the eldest, was acknowledged <lb/>
            their chief, and assumed the title of count of Apulia in 1043. Drogo, who <lb/>
            succeeded him in 1046, was assassinated at the instigation of the Greeks. <lb/>
            Robert Guiscard did not obtain the government until after the death of <lb/>
            Humphrey (1051—1057). Further particulars of the Normal, conquests <lb/>
            in the south of Italy will be found in the course of the present work. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            pirates disembarked from their fleet, and began to prepare <lb/>
            their meal in full security, and with great delight, on a <lb/>
            grassy plain lying between the city and the sea-shore. The <lb/>
            Normans, witnessing this, and finding that the duke was <lb/>
            collecting money to pacify the infidels, gently rebuked <lb/>
            the Apulians for thus ransoming themselves like defenceless <lb/>
            women, instead of defending themselves, sword in hand, like <lb/>
            brave men. They then flew to arms, and, making a sudden <lb/>
            attack on the Africans who were waiting for the tribute in <lb/>
            perfect security, many thousand of them were slain on the <lb/>
            spot, and the rest were driven with disgrace to the refuge of <lb/>
            their ships. The Normans returning, laden with gold and <lb/>
            silver plate and other valuable booty, were much pressed by <lb/>
            the duke to remain in honour at Salernum ; but as they were <lb/>
            anxious to re-visit their own country, they declined to accept <lb/>
            his proposal. Some of them, however, promised to return, <lb/>
            or speedily to send to the duke a chosen band of Norman <lb/>
            youths. When, therefore, they had reached their native <lb/>
            land, they had much to tell their countrymen of all that <lb/>
            they had seen, and heard, and done, and suffered. In the <lb/>
            end, some of them, fulfilling their engagement, retraced their <lb/>
            steps to Italy, and by their example induced a number of <lb/>
            their light-hearted countrymen to join in their enterprize. <lb/>
            In short, Turstin surnamed Citel, and Ranulph; Richard, <lb/>
            son of Ansquetil de Quarrel,1 the sons of Tancred de <lb/>
            Hauteville, viz. Drogo and Humphrey; William and <lb/>
            Herman; Robert surnamed Guiscard, and Roger with their <lb/>
            six brothers ; William de Montreuil, Arnold de Grant-mesnil, <lb/>
            and many others, left Normandy and reached Apulia, not all <lb/>
            together, but at different times. On their arrival, they in <lb/>
            the first instance took service, as mercenaries against the <lb/>
            infidels under the Duke Waimalch and other nobles. After­ <lb/>
            wards, however, disputes arising, they attacked those to <lb/>
            whom they were previously subject, and by force of arms <lb/>
            reduced Salernum, Bari, and Capua, with the whole of <lb/>
            Campania and Calabria, under their own dominion. They <lb/>
            also gained possession, in Sicily, of Palermo, Catania, Castel- <lb/>
            Giovanni, and other cities and fine towns which are held by <lb/>
            their heirs to the present day. <note type="footnote"> 1 Richard de Caret married a daughter of Tancred de Hautville, and <lb/>
            obtained for his share of the conquest the principality of Capua. </note> <pb n="413"/>
             </p>
          <p>Among the Normans who crossed the Tiber, no one <lb/>
            distinguished himself more than William de Montreuil, son <lb/>
            of William Giroie, and, being appointed to the chief <lb/>
            command of the Roman troops, he carried the banner of St. <lb/>
            Peter to the conquest of the fertile plains of Campania. <lb/>
            Being a friend and brother of the monks of St. Evroult, to <lb/>
            whom he made large grants, as already mentioned, before he <lb/>
            left Normandy, he sent to desire them to despatch a trusty <lb/>
            messenger, by whom he might forward the presents be had <lb/>
            prepared for them. His father William being informed of <lb/>
            this, voluntarily offered to undertake the mission for the <lb/>
            good of holy church. Abbot Theodoric heard the proposal <lb/>
            with mingled joy and grief; joy, at the devotion which <lb/>
            inflamed the heart of his friend, and induced him, old as he <lb/>
            was, to undertake so toilsome a journey; grief, at losing the <lb/>
            society of one who was ready at all good works. At length, <lb/>
            the holy father and Robert the prior, with the whole chapter, <lb/>
            commended the Lord William to God's protection, selecting <lb/>
            for his companions Humphrey, a most intelligent monk, and <lb/>
            Roger of Jumièges, a skilful penman, with twelve other <lb/>
            honourable attendants. Crossing the Alps he travelled to <lb/>
            Rome, and thence pursued his journey to ApnEa, where he <lb/>
            found his son and other friends, kinsfolk, and relations. <lb/>
            His arrival caused them all the greatest joy, and, prevailing <lb/>
            on him to remain with them a considerable time, during <lb/>
            which he was entertained with the highest distinction, they <lb/>
            committed to his charge many magnificent presents for the <lb/>
            support of the abbey for which he was a suitor. Wishing <lb/>
            however to send relief to the poor brethren without delay, <lb/>
            be sent back the monk Humphrey, with a considerable sum of <lb/>
            money; but, by the mysterious decrees of God's providence, <lb/>
            this enterprize turned out otherwise than he had hoped; <lb/>
            for Humphrey, having got as far as Rome, determined to <lb/>
            winter there, in the monastery of St. Paul the apostle. But <lb/>
            he was poisoned by the Romans for the sake of the gold he <lb/>
            had in his possession, and so the venerable pilgrim died in <lb/>
            the confession of the faith of Christ, on the ides [13th] of <lb/>
            December. Shortly afterwards William himself took his <lb/>
            departure for Normandy, conveying a large sum of money, <lb/>
            but when he reached Gaieta, so called from the nurse of <lb/>
            Æneas the Trojan, he was seized with a mortal disease. <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            Thereupon he summoned to his side the two knights, <lb/>
            Ansquetil du Noyer, son of Ascelin, and Theodelin de <lb/>
            Tanie, and thus addressed them: " You know that your <lb/>
            twelve companions who came out of Normandy together in <lb/>
            full health, all but you are dead; I also am attacked by a <lb/>
            severe disease which is fast hurrying me to the grave. I <lb/>
            therefore commend to your custody Ansquetil, in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Theodelin as witness, the money of which I am the <lb/>
            bearer, in order that you may honestly carry it to the lord <lb/>
            abbot Theodoric, and my nephew Robert, and the other <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult, for whom I am now in a foreign land. <lb/>
            Ye are both liege-men of the abbey, and are bound to do it <lb/>
            faithful service. Let no love of lucre lead you astray. <lb/>
            Reflect well that all your comrades having perished, you <lb/>
            only survive, through the merits of the blessed Evroult, in <lb/>
            order perhaps that you may faithfully render him this <lb/>
            service. Bear my last farewell to the monks at St. Evroult, <lb/>
            whom I love in Christ as my own life, and earnestly entreat <lb/>
            them to supplicate Almighty God on my behalf with zealous <lb/>
            fervour." With this and such-like discourse he brought <lb/>
            forth the gold, and rich palls, with a silver chalice, and other <lb/>
            articles of great price, and, making an exact inventory of <lb/>
            them delivered them to Ansquetil. Not long afterwards, his <lb/>
            sickness prevailing to extremity, the noble knight departed <lb/>
            in the faith of Christ, on the nones [5th] of February, and <lb/>
            received honourable interment in the church of St. Erasmus, <lb/>
            bishop and martyr,1 which is an episcopal see. Ansquetil and <lb/>
            Theodoliu then pursued their journey into France, and <lb/>
            arrived safely at home. Some days afterwards Ansquetil <lb/>
            went to St. Evroult and announced to the brethren the <lb/>
            death of the lord William and his companions, but observed <lb/>
            total silence as to the money with which he had been <lb/>
            entrusted and had already dishonestly converted to his own <lb/>
            use. On hearing the death of the founder of their abbey <lb/>
            the monks were in great tribulation, and zealously offered <lb/>
            prayers, and masses, and other sacred offices on behalf of his <lb/>
            soul to God, in whom all things live; which are diligently <lb/>
            continued by their successors to the present day. When <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Elmo, or Erasmus, bishop of Formiæ, and martyr, who perished <lb/>

            Ansquetil had returned home, his comrade Théodelin came <lb/>
            to St. Evroult and inquired of the monks what had been <lb/>
            brought to them from Apulia, and was astonished to find <lb/>
            that they had received nothing but the sorrowful tidings of <lb/>
            the death of their friends. He therefore related to them the <lb/>
            whole truth, describing all that bad occurred, both in <lb/>

            nations. Upon this, Abbot Theodoric sent for Ansquetil, <lb/>
            and demanded from him the money committed to his charge. <lb/>
            At first he denied having received it, but, being confronted <lb/>
            with Theodelin, he admitted the truth : "I did receive," he <lb/>
            said, " the money you demand from my lord William ; part of <lb/>
            it I have applied to my own use, and the rest I deposited at <lb/>
            Rheiims, by the advice of my lord Rodolph Mala-Corona, <lb/>
            who met me there." On hearing this the monks despatched <lb/>
            him twice to Rheins to Gervase the archbishop,1 to recover <lb/>
            the money deposited, once in company with Reginald of Sap, <lb/>
            one of the monks, and again with Fulk. The monk was <lb/>
            received with great kindness by the metropolitan, who <lb/>
            assisted him, as far as it was in his power, in the object of <lb/>
            his journey. For while he was bishop of Mans, often <lb/>
            repairing to the court of William, duke of Normandy, with <lb/>
            whom he was intimate, the monks of St. Evroult used to give <lb/>
            him honourable entertainment with all his attendants. On <lb/>
            seeing therefore the monk Fulk, he was anxious to return <lb/>
            kindness for kindness. But as a long time had elapsed, and <lb/>
            Ansquetil had carelessly deposited the things for which Fulk <lb/>
            made inquiries, he was only able to recover a few of the least <lb/>
            valuable of all the articles which were sent from Apulia; <lb/>
            with difficulty obtaining the silver chalice, two chasubles, an <lb/>
            elephant's tooth, a griffin's claw, and some others. The <lb/>
            monks, taking into consideration the fraudulent conduct of <lb/>
            Ansquetil, summoned him to trial in their court at St. <lb/>
            Evroult, where Richard d'Ayranches, son of Turstin, and <lb/>
            many other barons appeared to support him. But, on the <lb/>
            just complaints of the monks, judgment was fairlv <lb/>
            pronounced against him of forfeiture of the whole of the fief <lb/>
            he held of the abbey. In the end, by the mediation of <lb/>
            friends on both sides, this agreement was made: Ansquetil <note type="footnote"> 1 Gervais of Chateau-du-Loir, bishop of Mans, 1036—1055, archbishop <lb/>
            of Rheims, 1055—1067. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            openly confessing his guilt, gave pledges to abbot Theodoric <lb/>
            for his future good conduct, and humbly supplicated pardon <lb/>
            from the monks ; and, as a compensation for the loss which <lb/>
            he had caused them by his default, he surrendered to the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Evroult, in the presence of many witnesses, the <lb/>
            third part of the burgh of Ouche, which he possessed as heir <lb/>
            to his father. In token of this, he offered on the altar of St. <lb/>
            Evroult one mantle of silk, of which a cope was made for the <lb/>
            chanter. The monks, thereupon, satisfied by his penitence, <lb/>
            pardoned his offences, and kindly restored to him all the rest <lb/>
            of his fief, except the part which he had surrendered by the <lb/>
            advice of his friends. Not long afterwards Ansquetil went <lb/>
            into Apulia, where he was slain.</p>
          <p>The old enemy never fails to disturb the peace of the <lb/>
            church by the incentives of manifold temptations, bringing <lb/>
            those with whom he is able to prevail into subjection to <lb/>
            worldly vanities, and grievously afflicting those who by pru­ <lb/>
            dent watchfulness in the simplicity of the Catholic faith <lb/>
            stand manfully upright in the perfection of their Christian <lb/>
            virtues. When therefore he saw a regular monastery rising <lb/>
            by God's help, in the forest of Ouche, and that abbot <lb/>
            Theodoric was by word and deed profiting the souls both of <lb/>
            young and old in the neighbouring town, he burnt with the <lb/>
            same malice which wrought the expulsion of the protoplast <lb/>
            Adam from Paradise through the desire of the forbidden fruit, <lb/>
            and stirred up the prior Robert, after the death of William <lb/>
            de Giroie, to a presumptuous opposition against his abbot; <lb/>
            and by the dissensions thence arising for a long time dis­ <lb/>
            quieted the minds of the subject members of the fraternity. <lb/>
            This Robert, as 1 have fully noticed before, was of high rank, <lb/>
            being the brother of Hugh de Grant-mesnil; and all the <lb/>
            levity of his youth, indomitable resolution, ;and worldly <lb/>
            ambition, still clung to him. His continence and other <lb/>
            monastic virtues were praiseworthy; while, on the other <lb/>
            hand, as Horace says :­ <lb/>
            " Man's happiness is ne'er complete, <lb/>
            he was reprehensible for many failings. For whether 'nat <lb/>
            he coveted was right or wrong, he was hasty and headstrong <lb/>
            in gaining his ends, and was quickly irritated when anything <note type="footnote"> 1 Odes, B. II. xvi. v. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            he heard or saw offended him ; more prone to lead than to <lb/>
            follow, to command than to obey. His hand was always <lb/>
            open both to receive and to disburse, and his month to give <lb/>
            ready vent to his wrath in violent ebullitions. Illustrious <lb/>
            by the high lineage already mentioned, and being <lb/>
            one of the founders of the abbey in which he had <lb/>
            collected from all parts brothers whose duty was to perform <lb/>
            divine worship, and having amply endowed them with all <lb/>
            things necessary for their subsistence, he found himself' <lb/>
            unable to submit to the strict rules of a monastic life in the <lb/>
            new establishment. He therefore frequently complained in <lb/>
            private to his spiritual father, that the holy man was more <lb/>
            occupied with his religious duties than with secular concerns. <lb/>
            He even sometimes opposed him openly, and found fault <lb/>
            with some of his acts simply relating to exterior objects. <lb/>
            So that the man of God often took refuge in his quiet <lb/>
            retreat at Seez, abiding there six or eight weeks, doing God's <lb/>
            work in peace and zealously promoting the salvation of men <lb/>
            by all the means in his power. He thus waited for the <lb/>
            improvement of his refractory brother, fulfilling the apostle's <lb/>
            admonition : " Give place unto wrath."1 Finding, however, <lb/>
            that the rancour and the scandals did not cease, but rather <lb/>
            increased, to the great injury of the brethren, he tendered <lb/>
            his pastoral staff to William the duke of Normandy, offering <lb/>
            to resign his rank and office of abbot. The duke thereupon, <lb/>
            taking judicious counsel, committed the whole matter to the <lb/>
            decision of Mauritius, archbishop of Rouen, enjoining him <lb/>
            to inquire diligently into the causes of the dissension, and <lb/>
            to make such order thereon as, by the advice of prudent <lb/>
            counsellors, he should think right.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1056, the eighth indiction, when <lb/>
            Pope Victor filled the apostolic see, Henry, surnamed the <lb/>
            Good, emperor of the Romans, and son of Conon [Conrad] <lb/>

            bishop of Lisieux, Ansfrid, abbot of Préaux and Lanfranc, <lb/>
            prior of Bee, with several other dignitaries of sound <lb/>
            judgment, assembled at the abbey of St. Evroult; and <lb/>
            celebrated the feast of the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul <lb/>
            on the third of the calends of July [29th June]. Having <lb/>
            inquired into and carefully considered the grounds of the <lb/>
            dissension, it was ordered that the abbot Theodoric should <lb/>
            continue the government of the abbey, as he had done before, <lb/>
            and Robert the prior was admonished, in the fullest terms, to <lb/>
            conform to his vows of poverty in Christ, and to obey his <lb/>
            spiritual father, for the love of God, in all humility. The <lb/>
            commissioners having returned home, a short period of repose <lb/>
            was enjoyed by the flock at St. Evroult; but a year after­ <lb/>
            wards, when the news arrived of the death of William de <lb/>
            Circle, the smothered strife again broke out, and disputes <lb/>
            adverse both to the spiritual and temporal welfare of the <lb/>
            monks distracted the community. And now Theodoric, to <lb/>
            whom peace was dear, was in difficulties on every side. For <lb/>
            at Séez it was out of his power to promote the salvation of <lb/>
            souls, and to finish the building of the cell which Roger and <lb/>
            his wife had begun to erect, because they were then much <lb/>
            occupied by worldly affairs, and exposed to serious attacks <lb/>
            from their enemies in various quarters; while at St. Evroult <lb/>
            he could neither further his own good nor that of others, <lb/>
            by reason of the vexations which he had to endure from <lb/>
            some of the more influential monks. At last, after long <lb/>
            reflection upon the course he ought to pursue, according to <lb/>
            the will of God, he determined to abandon all and undertake <lb/>
            a pilgrimage to the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ON the fourth of the calends of September [August 24th], <lb/>
            abbot Theodoric left Seez, where he had rested long, and, <lb/>
            proceeding to St. Evroult, convoked a chapter of the monks <lb/>
            to whom he made known his intentions, and admonishing, <lb/>
            absolving, and blessing them all, he commended them to <lb/>
            God. Thence he went to Lisieux, and surrendered his cure <lb/>
            of souls to the bishop, by whom he was much beloved; then <lb/>
            he commenced his holy pilgrimage for Christ amidst the <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            tears of many of his friends. Herbert de Montreuil, the <lb/>
            first monk he admitted to the monastery of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            accompanied him, as well as the clerk William, surnamed <lb/>
            Bonne-Ame, son of Radbod bishop of Seez, who some time <lb/>
            afterwards held the metropolitan see of Rouen for nearly <lb/>
            twenty-six years.</p>
          <p>In those days there existed a noble hospital on the con­ <lb/>
            fines of the territories of the Bavarians and Huns,1 which <lb/>
            the truly Christian and powerful barons of the neighbouring <lb/>
            provinces had founded for the reception of the poor and <lb/>
            pilgrims. At that time Ansgot, a Norman, governed this <lb/>
            hospital, having been elected by the natives. He was a <lb/>
            cousin of Robert de Toni, called the Spaniard, who had <lb/>
            borne arms with distinction under Richard and Robert, <lb/>
            dukes of Normandy ; but inspired with the fear of God, he <lb/>
            had relinquished all worldly advantages, and had chosen to <lb/>
            undergo voluntary poverty during the remainder of his life <lb/>
            for Christ's sake. Recognizing Theodoric and his compa­ <lb/>
            nions as countrymen, he gave them a cordial reception and <lb/>
            entertained them for some days with great hospitality, <lb/>
            paying them the kindest attentions.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a certain religious, the chief bishop of the <lb/>
            Bavarians, going on a pilgrimage arrived at the hospital, <lb/>
            where he was honourably received, with all his retinue, as <lb/>
            the custom was by the liberal Ansgot, and prevailed on to <lb/>
            sojourn for a while. He also earnestly recommended the <lb/>
            venerable Theodoric and his attendants to the care of this <lb/>
            bishop, pointing out his sanctity as a father in God, and his <lb/>
            worldly rank in his own country. The bishop, hearing the <lb/>
            abbot's character, gave thanks to God, and, cordially paying <lb/>
            the respect due to a man of his station, took him in his <lb/>
            company as far as Antioch. There a difference of opinion <lb/>
            arose among the pilgrims. Some of them wished to con­ <lb/>
            tinue their journey by land, as they had hitherto, prosecuted <lb/>
            it, the whole way to Jerusalem. Others, alarmed for their <lb/>
            safety among the fierce infidels, determined to take ship <lb/>
            and pass into the Holy Land by sea. In this proposal the <lb/>
            bishop and abbot, with some others, concurred. While, <lb/>
            however, the bishop was engaging a ship and an able crew, <note type="footnote"> 1 M. Pertz conjectures that this hospital was situated at Mölk in Lower <lb/>
            Austria, where a celebrated abbey was founded twenty-six years afterwards. </note> <note type="footnote"> EE2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            and a certain religious, who was archimandrite of the con­ <lb/>
            vent of St. Simeon in the port of Syria, 1 was hospitably <lb/>
            entertaining Theodoric and his companions, Herbert the <lb/>
            monk of St. Evroult was seized with the desire of hastening <lb/>
            his journey, and preferred to continue his pilgrimage to the <lb/>
            holy places by land rather than by sea. His abbot accord­ <lb/>
            ingly gave him permission to go as he pleased. Taking, <lb/>
            therefore, the road through the country, with a crowd of <lb/>
            pilgrims on foot, and having reached Laodicea, he there fell <lb/>
            sick, and was compelled to abide for some time, his com­ <lb/>
            panions proceeding on their way. As soon as he was able <lb/>
            to rise from his bed, he did not take one step further in <lb/>
            advance, but bidding farewell to the east, turned westward, <lb/>
            and hastened back to Normandy.</p>
          <p>The bishop, with Theodoric and William Bonne-Ame <lb/>
            with their companions, embarked at the port of St. Simeon, <lb/>
            and sailed to the island of Cyprus. They found there on <lb/>
            the sea-shore a convent founded by St. Nicholas the con­ <lb/>
            fessor, arch bishop of Myria.2 Entering the church, they per­ <lb/>
            formed their devotions as each was inspired by divine grace ; <lb/>
            and Theodoric, on rising from his prayers, during which he had <lb/>
            wept much, sat down exhausted in the church, for his frame <lb/>
            was shattered by the weight of years, his sufferings at sea, <lb/>
            and other fatigues. The bishop, his faithful companion, <lb/>
            inquiring of him what had happened, he replied: " I had <lb/>
            proposed, my father, to visit the earthly Jerusalem, but I <lb/>
            believe that the Lord has otherwise disposed of his servant. <lb/>
            I am suffering great bodily anguish, and I am led to think <lb/>
            that I must turn my face to the heavenly, instead of the <lb/>
            earthly, Jerusalem." The bishop made answer, " Rest here, <lb/>
            dearest brother, while I go to procure a lodging for your <lb/>
            reception." The bishop leaving him for this purpose, <lb/>
            Theodoric approached the altar, and was for some time <lb/>
            engaged in prayer to God, whom he had faithfully served <lb/>
            from his youth upward. He then prostrated himself <note type="footnote"> 1 This port appears to correspond with a place called by the Arabs <lb/>
            Soueyda, on the northern shore of the gulf, at the mouth of the Orontes. <lb/>
            It took its ancient name from St. Simeon Stylites, who died in a monastery <lb/>
            near it about the year 592, </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is a place, marked St. Nicholas on the maps, near Cape St. <lb/>

             <pb n="421"/>
            before the altar, with his face to the east, and decently <lb/>
            gathering his robe round him, lay on his right side, as if he <lb/>
            was composing himself for sleep, when laying his head on <lb/>
            the marble step, and crossing his hands on his breast, he <lb/>
            thus gave up his devout soul to God who created it, on the <lb/>
            calends [the 1st] of August.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the bishop having prepared a lodging, called <lb/>
            the servant of the man of God, and sent him to the church <lb/>
            to conduct his master to it. But when he found the holy <lb/>
            man lying dead in the church, he returned to the bishop in <lb/>
            great alarm, and trembling, told him of the unexpected <lb/>
            calamity. The bishop, however, not believing that the man <lb/>
            of God had so suddenly departed, said to him : " The good <lb/>
            old man is much exhausted by his sufferings at sea, and the <lb/>
            intense heat; and therefore he is enjoying refreshing sleep <lb/>
            in the coolness of the church on the cold marble. Let us <lb/>
            go and see him." He then proceeded to the church, <lb/>
            attended by his clergy. But when he had carefully felt the <lb/>
            body of his comrade, and found that it was really chilled in <lb/>
            death, he was overpowered with grief. Immediately col­ <lb/>
            lecting all the pilgrims who, dispersed in their several <lb/>
            lodgings, were procuring refreshments, he commanded them <lb/>
            to assemble in the church, while he fully made known to <lb/>
            the inhabitants of the place the character of the companion <lb/>
            of their pilgrimage who there lay dead. The inhabitants <lb/>
            were filled with joy for his holy life, and freely offered their <lb/>
            services to the other pilgrims. The bishop, then, with his <lb/>
            clergy, paid the last offices to the remains of the defunct, <lb/>
            ordering the rest of the pilgrims to prepare a place for his <lb/>
            interment before the church-door. Having, therefore, dug <lb/>
            a grave with their staves where the bishop directed, they <lb/>
            returned to the pavement where the corpse lay, with the <lb/>
            bishop standing by, to carry it forth for burial. But it <lb/>
            was so ordered by God that the body was so heavy, that <lb/>
            they were utterly unable to raise it from the spot where <lb/>
            the holy man fell asleep. The bishop and all the spec­ <lb/>
            tators were much astonished at this, and consulted together <lb/>
            for some moments what was to be done. At length the <lb/>
            bishop, divinely inspired, said: "This was a most holy <lb/>
            In an, and his life, as it is now clearly manifest, was well <lb/>
            pleasing to God. I am, therefore, of opinion that he <lb/>
            ought to be interred in a spot more worthy of him, and <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            that his remains ought to be treated, with all the reve­ <lb/>
            rential ceremony which it is in our power to bestow. I <lb/>
            propose, therefore, with the assistance of my clergy, to <lb/>
            offer the holy sacrifice of the mass for the good of his soul, <lb/>
            and you shall prepare a more fitting grave for him near the <lb/>
            altar." The pilgrims giving a willing consent, and the <lb/>
            mass being performed with all reverence, and the grave <lb/>
            carefully made, they raised the corpse without difficulty and <lb/>
            decently interred it before the altar; and there afterwards <lb/>
            many persons suffering from fevers and other disorders were <lb/>
            miraculously cured.</p>
          <p>The monks of St. Evroult were filled with grief when <lb/>
            they received intelligence of the death of their reverend <lb/>
            father on the return of his fellow pilgrims to Normandy. <lb/>
            They did not fail of performing faithfully the due offices of <lb/>
            religion for the repose of his soul, and his memory is yearly <lb/>
            kept to the present day with a solemn service on the <lb/>
            calends [1st] of August. They also studiously adhered to <lb/>
            the religious rules which he had learned from the venerable <lb/>
            abbots Richard of Verdun, William of Dijon, and Theodoric <lb/>
            of Jumièges, 1 and had faithfully transferred to the new <lb/>
            establishment committed to his charge, which rules are still <lb/>
            diligently taught to the novices preparing themselves for <lb/>
            the monastic life.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1059, the twelfth indiction, the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult elected for their abbot, Robert de <lb/>
            Grant-mesnil, considering with reason the many advan­ <lb/>
            tages of such a choice, arising both from his illustrious <lb/>
            descent, his zeal for the interests of the community, and his <lb/>
            aptitude and perseverance in business. His election being <lb/>
            ratified by the unanimous assent of the entire chapter, he <lb/>
            was conducted to Evreux by a delegate of the brethren who <lb/>
            presented him to Duke William, and, announcing the elec­ <lb/>
            tion, petitioned the duke to confirm it. The duke consent- <note type="footnote"> 1 Richard de Verdun died July 14, 1046; William de Di:on, January 1, <lb/>

             <pb n="423"/>
            ing, invested the abbot elect with the exterior jurisdiction <lb/>
            of the convent by the crosier of Ives, bishop of Séez, and <lb/>
            William, bishop of Evreux, committed to him the interior <lb/>
            cure of souls in matters spiritual, by episcopal consecration <lb/>
            on the eleventh of the calends of July [June 21st]. <lb/>
            Robert, thus made abbot, entered diligently on the admi­ <lb/>
            nistration of the conventual concerns, making abundant <lb/>
            provision from the wealth of his family of all things neces­ <lb/>
            sary for the service of God. Far from diminishing the <lb/>
            proper observances which his pious predecessor had insti­ <lb/>
            tuted, be augmented them, having regard to what was <lb/>
            timely and reasonable, and taking for his guide the <lb/>
            authority of the ancients and the practices of neighbouring <lb/>
            communities. While yet a novice he had, by the permis­ <lb/>
            sion of the venerable Theodoric, visited the abbey of Cluni, <lb/>
            at the time that Abbot Hugo, the glory of the monastic <lb/>
            order in our days, presided over that community. Return­ <lb/>
            ing some time afterwards from Cluni he brought with him, <lb/>
            by the indulgence of the generous Hugh, an illustrious <lb/>
            monk named Bernefrid, who was afterwards made a bishop, <lb/>
            and obtained his assistance while he assimilated the prac­ <lb/>
            tices of the monks of St. Evroult to the Clunian model. <lb/>
            During the abbacy of Robert, Mainer, SOIl of Gunscelin <lb/>
            d'Echoufour, came to St. Evroult for his probation: he <lb/>
            afterwards rose to the government of the convent, which he <lb/>
            ruled well twenty-one years and ten months.</p>
          <p>At that time Ralph, surnamed Mala-Corona, came to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, where he abode a long time with Abbot Robert, <lb/>
            who was his nephew. As I have before remarked, he was <lb/>
            studious from his childhood, and learnt the secrets of <lb/>
            science with signal success, in the schools of France and <lb/>
            Italy, being deeply skilled in astronomy as well as in gram­ <lb/>
            mar and dialectics, and also in music. He was so complete <lb/>
            a master of the art of medicine, that at Palermo, where the <lb/>
            most ancient school of medicine bad long flourished, he <lb/>
            was unrivalled except by one most skilful matron. But <lb/>
            although his learning was so extensive and profound, he did <lb/>
            not abandon himself to a peaceful life, but served in the <lb/>
            wars, and often distinguished himself among his comrades, <lb/>
            both in council and in the field. The natives of Montreuil <lb/>
            still relate many things which appear to us wonderful con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            cerning his experiments in cases of disease and other <lb/>
            accidents, such as they were witnesses of themselves, or <lb/>
            heard from their fathers, to whom he was well known by <lb/>
            his long residence among them. At last, apprehending the <lb/>
            destruction of a tottering world, and taking the precaution <lb/>
            of a prudent retirement, he despised its luxury, and betook <lb/>
            himself to Marmoutier, a cell dependent on the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Martin at Tours, where for seven years he lived in sub­ <lb/>
            mission to the monastic rule under Albert its venerable <lb/>
            abbot. After he bad been confirmed in that order, he came <lb/>
            to St. Evroult, by permission of his abbot, to assist his <lb/>
            nephew, who had lately undertaken the government of the <lb/>
            new monastery. This noble soldier having obtained from the <lb/>
            Lord by earnest prayers the disease of leprosy to expiate <lb/>
            the multitude of sins which burdened his conscience, his <lb/>
            nephew gave him a chapel which he had built in honour of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, where he lived for a considerable time, having <lb/>
            the monk Goscelin for his own comfort and the service of <lb/>
            God, and did much good by his counsels to numbers who <lb/>
            flocked to him on account of his deep wisdom and high rank.</p>
          <p>At his earnest request, Abbot Robert invited Hugh, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux, a true father and director of the monks, <lb/>
            who came and consecrated the chapel 1 in honour of the <lb/>
            holy confessors St. Evroult, St. Benedict, and Leudfrid, on <lb/>
            the second of the nones [6th] of May. Report says that <lb/>
            this church was founded as early as the time of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            and that it was his custom to retire to it, to the exclusion <lb/>
            of all worldly cares, in order that he might devote himself <lb/>
            more earnestly to heavenly contemplations. The site is <lb/>
            pleasant and well suited to a hermit's life. The little river <lb/>
            Carenton flows through a wild valley, dividing the bishopric <lb/>
            of Lisieux from that of Evreux. The summit of the moun­ <lb/>
            tain is clothed with a forest, the thick foliage of which <lb/>
            forms a screen from the blasts of the wind; the chapel <lb/>
            stands on the declivity, between the wood and the rivulet, <lb/>
            surrounded by an orchard. A fountain bursts out before <lb/>
            the door, which forms the source of the Ouche, from which <lb/>
            the whole district round derives its name.</p>
          <p>It need be no matter of wonder that the bishop of Lisieux <lb/>
            should consecrate a chapel in the diocese of Evreux. At <note type="footnote"> 1 This chapel stood between the abbey and the village of Echaufour. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            that time, three prelates of distinguished liberality and <lb/>
            great courtesy presided over adjoining dioceses. Hugh, son <lb/>
            of William count d'Eu, was bishop of Lisieux; William, <lb/>
            son of Gerard Fleitel, was spiritual ruler of the people of <lb/>
            Evreux; and Ives, son of William de Belesme, had the cure <lb/>
            of souls at Seez. These three bishops were then distin­ <lb/>
            guished in Normandy for their zeal and unanimity, so that <lb/>
            each of them, as time and circumstances required, adminis­ <lb/>
            tered all divine offices on the confines of a neighbouring <lb/>
            diocese the same as if it were his own, without any conten­ <lb/>
            tion or jealousy.</p>
          <p>At the instigation of the devil, who never ceases from <lb/>
            mischief to mankind, violent hostilities broke out between <lb/>
            the French and the Normans. Henry, king of France, and <lb/>
            Geoffrey Martel, the valiant count of Anjou, crossed the <lb/>
            frontiers of Normandy with numerous forces and committed <lb/>
            great ravages. On the other hand, William, the brave duke <lb/>
            of Normandy, was not slow in taking ample revenge for the <lb/>
            injury done, taking many of the French and Angevins <lb/>
            prisoners, putting some to death, and throwing numbers <lb/>
            into prison, where they long suffered. The reader who de­ <lb/>
            sires to make himself acquainted with the particulars of the <lb/>
            attacks and devastations, which ensued on one side or the <lb/>
            other, will find them described in the works of William, a <lb/>
            monk of Jumieges, surnamed Calculus, and William of <lb/>
            Poitiers, archdeacon of Lisieux, who have written the his <lb/>
            tory of Normandy with great care, and dedicated their <lb/>
            works to William, then king of England, whose favour they <lb/>
            wished to secured</p>
          <p>At that time Robert, son of Circle, revolted against <lb/>
            Duke William, and, uniting with the Angevins, strongly <lb/>
            garrisoned his castles of St. Ceneri and La Roche d'Igé, <lb/>
            holding them for some time against the attacks of the duke <lb/>
            with Norman troops. But all mortal strength is transitory <lb/>
            and fades like the flower of grass, for this great soldier, after <lb/>
            his gallant actions, while he was making merry as he sat <lb/>
            by the hearth in winter, seeing his wife Adelaide (who was <lb/>
            the duke's cousin) with four apples in her hand, snatched <note type="footnote"> 1 For an account of this war, which took place in 1054, See William de <lb/>

            two of them in sport, unconscious of their being poisoned, <lb/>
            and ate them in spite of all her efforts to prevent him. <lb/>
            The poison made rapid progress, and to the great grief of his <lb/>
            friends, he expired five days afterwards, on the 8th of the ides <lb/>
            [6th] of February. On his death Arnold, SOil of William de <lb/>
            Circle, succeeded to the command, in his nucleus place, <lb/>
            encouraging the townsmen by his entreaties and admoni­ <lb/>
            tions to defend to the last the inheritance of his father. <lb/>
            But the prudent duke disarmed his hostility with smooth <lb/>
            words, and engaged him by his promises to consent to <lb/>
            peace. Arnold, by the advice of his friends, agreed to the <lb/>
            duke's proposals, and paying his homage, was invested with <lb/>
            the fiefs of Montreuil, Echoufour, St. Ceneri, and all the <lb/>
            domains he inherited from his ancestors. On the peace <lb/>
            being settled, abbot Robert requested permission from the <lb/>
            duke to transfer the body of his uncle, which had lain buried <lb/>
            at St. Ceneri for three weeks, to the abbey of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            The duke at first refused, actuated by his recent animosity; <lb/>
            but being ashamed to keep alive his resentment against the <lb/>
            dead, he presently gave his consent. The abbot lost no time <lb/>
            in translating the corpse of Robert de Circle to St. Evroult <lb/>
            in a coffin of wood, and honourably buried it in the monks' <lb/>
            cloister. All who were present wondered that, though the <lb/>
            body bad lain dead three weeks, no offensive smell was <lb/>
            observed. Some persons pretend that the virulence of the <lb/>
            poison which killed him had dried up all the humours in the <lb/>
            body of the deceased, so that there was nothing to offend <lb/>
            the nostrils of the by-standers.</p>
          <p>The monks of St. Evroult were well pleased that Arnold <lb/>
            was restored to his lawful jurisdiction, and with his support <lb/>
            resisted the oppressions of some troublesome persons who <lb/>
            had taken advantage of their defenceless state. In the <lb/>
            time of Abbot Theodoric and Robert his successor, Baldric <lb/>
            and Viger de Bauquencey and their people, had not only <lb/>
            carried themselves insolently towards the monks, and were <lb/>
            insubordinate to them as their lords, but often harassed <lb/>
            them and their servants. Robert, on his becoming abbot, <lb/>
            thought it disgraceful to submit any longer to such <lb/>
            conduct. He therefore, having consulted the brethren, gave <lb/>
            up the rebels to his cousin, that he might chastise with a <lb/>
            soldiers strong hand the stubbornness of men who were too <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            proud to submit to the gentle rule of the monks. Arnold <lb/>
            laid upon them the burden of many hard services, compel­ <lb/>
            ling them and their people to guard his fortified castles <lb/>
            of Echaufour and St. Ceneri. Upon this they earnestly <lb/>
            entreated abbot Robert and the monks that they would be <lb/>
            pleased to take them again under their own rule, promising <lb/>
            in future entire submission and better conduct. The abbot <lb/>
            and monks, listening to their prayers, besought Arnold to <lb/>
            restore them to their service under the church, which to <lb/>
            those who are humble and well disposed is truly liberal.</p>
          <p>At this time Roger, the eldest son of Engenulf de Aquila, <lb/>
            was slain. Engenulf and his wife Richveride came to St. <lb/>
            Evroult in deep grief, entreating the prayers and good <lb/>
            offices of the monks for the good of the souls of themselves <lb/>
            and their SOIl Roger, which were granted ; and they there­ <lb/>
            upon offered his best horse to God and the monks. The <lb/>
            horse being very valuable, Arnold begged to have it, yielding <lb/>
            up Baldric and his people with the fief of Bauquencey to be <lb/>
            subject to the monks as before. This was done: Arnold <lb/>
            receiving the horse from his cousin Robert and restoring <lb/>
            Baldric with the land of Bauquencey to his former tenure <lb/>
            under the abbey. Baldric, overjoyed at having thus escaped <lb/>
            from the burdensome service of Arnold, granted to the <lb/>
            monks a domain which he possessed in the vilI of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            as also his land upon the rivulet of Douet Villars, and that <lb/>
            of the Norman Mica and Benignus. Then Baldric swore <lb/>
            fealty to abbot Robert with joined hands, promising suit <lb/>
            and service, and demanding that his fief should not again <lb/>
            be severed from the estates of the monks. They granted <lb/>
            and ratified this, and both Baldric and Robert his son, from <lb/>
            that time to the present day, have done service to none but <lb/>
            the monks for the lands of Bauquencey.1</p>
          <p>The abbey of St. Evroult stands in the fief of Bauquencey, <lb/>
            and this Baldric was a man of high birth. For Gislebert, <lb/>
            Count de Brionne, nephew of Richard duke of Normandy, <lb/>
            gave his niece in marriage to Baldric the German, who <lb/>
            came into Normandy, with Viger his brother, to take service <note type="footnote"> 1 Such surrenders of lay fiefs to the monasteries, for the purpose of <lb/>
            holding under them, were very common in England, the object being to <lb/>
            escape from the rapacities of the feudal lords, and exchange the military <lb/>
            service for a milder tenure under the church. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            under the duke. From this marriage sprung six sons, <lb/>
            besides several daughters, viz.: Nicholas de Basqueville; <lb/>
            Fulk d'Aunoun; Robert de Courcy; Richard de Neuville, <lb/>
            Baldric de Bauquencey; and Viger of Apulia. They all dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished themselves by great valour under Duke William, <lb/>
            from whom they received great riches and honours, and left <lb/>
            to their heirs vast possessions in Normandy.</p>
          <p>Baldric who, with his brother Viger, held the fief of <lb/>
            Bauquencey, gave his sister Elizabeth in marriage to Fulk de <lb/>
            Bonneval, a brave knight, and for her dowry the church of <lb/>
            St. Nicholas, built by his father, with the lands adjoining. <lb/>
            Fulk, not forgetful of the life to come, presented to God, <lb/>
            for the good of his soul and those of his kindred, his son <lb/>
            Theodoric, to whom abbot Theodoric was baptismal sponsor, <lb/>
            offering to St. Evroult the youth and the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Nicholas of which we have just spoken. Baldric, Viger, <lb/>
            and William de Bonneval, readily confirmed these offerings; <lb/>
            they, and many others who were present, assisting as legal <lb/>
            witnesses of the gift, for the greater security of the church. <lb/>
            Among them was Roger, son of Tancred de Hauteville, who <lb/>
            afterwards went into Italy, and, by God's help, became <lb/>
            master of a great part of Sicily, having attacked, defeated, <lb/>
            and subdued the Africans, Sicilians, and other nations, <lb/>
            unbelievers in Christ, who ravaged that island. The boy <lb/>
            Theodoric, thus separated from the world and devoted to <lb/>
            God, lived fifty-seven years under the monastic rule, and, <lb/>
            rising to the priesthood by regular degrees, waged his <lb/>
            spiritual warfare with great fidelity.</p>
          <p>At that time Guy, surnamed Bollein, great nephew of <lb/>
            the elder Giroie, lived in high honour with his wife <lb/>
            Hodierna in the Corbonnois, and, having gained much wealth <lb/>
            by his military service, managed his affairs with entire credit. <lb/>
            He had several sons, of whom Norman and Walter served <lb/>
            in the wars, while Godfrey and William, surnamed Gregory, <lb/>
            being devoted to learning, obtained the office of priests.</p>
          <p>The aforesaid Guy, by the inspiration of God, and his <lb/>
            natural feeling for abbot Robert, who was his cousin, showed <lb/>
            great regard for the monks of St. Evroult, and shut out <lb/>
            from the world and from himself his son William, a boy <lb/>
            about nine years old, whom he placed in the convent of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, to serve God under the monastic rule, on the feast <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            of All Saints. Then William le Prevost, a noble knight <lb/>
            the lad's uncle, gave to St. Evroult the church with the <lb/>
            whole vili of Augeron, vowing himself and the whole of <lb/>
            his substance to the same patron at the end of his life. <lb/>
            By the grace of God the boy William grew up in a virtuous <lb/>
            course and was diligent in his studies, so that his superiors <lb/>
            gave him the surname of Gregory. Carefully nurtured in <lb/>
            the bosom of our holy mother the church, and entirely shut <lb/>
            out from the tumults of the world and carnal indulgences, <lb/>
            lie made great advances in those pursuits which are so <lb/>
            especially fitting the sons of the church, being an excellent <lb/>
            reader and chanter, and exceedingly skilled in copying and <lb/>
            illuminating books. The works executed by his own hands <lb/>
            are still very useful to us in reading and chanting, and serve <lb/>
            for examples to deter us from idleness by the exercise of <lb/>
            similar diligence. Assiduous from his very childhood at <lb/>
            the offices of devotion and vigils, and submitting with <lb/>
            moderation even in his old age to fastings and other mace­ <lb/>
            rations of the flesh, he was a strict observer of monastic <lb/>
            discipline himself, and a zealous monitor of those who in­ <lb/>
            fringed the holy rule. He had committed to his tenacious <lb/>
            memory the Epistles of St. Paul, the Proverbs of Solomon, <lb/>
            and other portions of sacred scripture, which he quoted in <lb/>
            his daily conversations for the benefit of those with whom <lb/>
            he conferred. Devoted to these pursuits, he has already <lb/>
            spent fifty-four years in the order of monks, and still con­ <lb/>
            tinues the practice of good works, in his usual manner, <lb/>
            under abbot Roger, that by ending well he may attain to <lb/>
            the assurance of eternal rest.</p>
          <p>While the community at the abbey of St. Evroult was <lb/>
            nobly augmented by the accession of forty monks, and the <lb/>
            monastic rule was there regularly observed according to the <lb/>
            order of the divine Lord, its fame spread far and wide, <lb/>
            disposing numbers of persons to become attached to it. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, some being infected with a rancorous hatred <lb/>
            were punished by the sharp edge of their own malice. <lb/>
            Abbot Robert, endowed with genuine liberality, received <lb/>
            willingly all who came from every quarter to enter on their <lb/>
            probation, and steadily supplied the brethren with all things <lb/>
            necessary for their subsistance and clothing. The revenues <lb/>
            indeed of the abbey, which was situated in a barren district, <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            were inadequate to supply the abbots liberality; but, as <lb/>
            it has been already remarked, he often went among his noble <lb/>
            relations and obtained from them the means which he ap­ <lb/>
            plied for the benefit of the monks with the willing consent <lb/>
            of the donors.</p>
          <p>The old chapel, built by St. Evroult, being a small and <lb/>
            rude edifice, he laid the foundations, in the first year of his <lb/>
            rule, of a new church in a noble style of architecture which <lb/>
            he resolved to dedicate to St. Mary, mother of God, and to <lb/>
            enrich with many altars of the saints. On account also of <lb/>
            the holy relics which were deposited in the old church in <lb/>
            the time of St. Evroult (but on account of the lapse of time <lb/>
            men now living are ignorant of their names, acts, and places <lb/>
            of deposit), he determined to make the new building of <lb/>
            such dimensions that it should include within its walls the <lb/>
            whole of the ancient chapel, and thus for ever honourably <lb/>
            contain the bones and tombs of the saints which lay hidden <lb/>
            within. But he was compelled to desist from his undertak­ <lb/>
            ing by the stormy times which began to threaten, and no <lb/>
            one among his successors ventured to carry out the work in <lb/>
            the proportions and on the plan and site which he bad <lb/>
            intended.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1059, the thirteenth indiction, <lb/>
            Henry, king of France, after a glorious and prosperous <lb/>
            reign, demanded of John, a physician of Chartres, who from <lb/>
            some accident was called the Deaf, a potion which should <lb/>
            restore his health and prolong his life; but, being very <lb/>
            thirsty, under the influence of his inclination more than of <lb/>
            his physician's advice, he made his chamberlain bring him <lb/>
            water privately, while the medicine, passing through his <lb/>
            intestines, gave him great pain, and before they were cleared <lb/>
            by it. Thus, drinking without the knowledge of his leech, <lb/>
            he died, alas! on the morrow, to the great grief of his peo­ <lb/>
            ple.1 He left the sceptre of France to his son Philip, who <lb/>
            was still of tender years, appointing Baldwin, duke of <lb/>
            Flanders, his guardian and regent of the kingdom. The <lb/>
            duke was a fitting person to undertake his trust, having <lb/>
            married Adela, daughter of Robert, king of France, by <lb/>
            whom he had Robert, the Frisian, the queen of England, <note type="footnote"> 1 Henry IV., king of France, died, not in 1059, but on the 29th of <lb/>

            and Eudes, archbishop of Treves, with other children of high <lb/>
            rank.1</p>
          <p>The same year died Frederick, son of Duke Gothelon, <lb/>
            who was also called Pope Stephen, he was succeeded by <lb/>
            Gerard, called also Nicholas.2 This was the third year of <lb/>
            Henry IV., son of Henry Conrad the emperor, and Agnes, <lb/>
            empress, who reigned fifty years, being the eighty-seventh <lb/>
            emperor from Augustus.</p>
          <p>Pope Nicholas died A.D. 1063, and was suceeded by Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, bishop of Lucca, at which time Sigefred, bishop of <lb/>
            Mayence, and Gunter, of Bamberg, and many other bishops <lb/>
            and nobles, made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem with numerous <lb/>
            attendants.3</p>
          <p>At that period, grave dissensions arose between William, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, and his barons. For one ambitious <lb/>
            man eagerly endeavoured to supplant another, so that bitter <lb/>
            quarrels sprung up from various causes to the great injury <lb/>
            of the wretched people. At this men of a cruel turn of <lb/>
            mind found reason to rejoice, while all who loved piety and <lb/>
            tranquillity were deeply grieved. Among those who regarded <lb/>
            these disputes with satisfaction were Roger de Montgomery <lb/>
            and Mabel his wife, who took the opportunity of gaining the <lb/>
            duke's favour by fair professions, while they exasperated him <lb/>
            against their neighbours by their crafty manoeuvres. The <lb/>
            duke, naturally passionate, gave the reins to his wrath, <lb/>
            more than justice required, disinheriting the distinguished <lb/>
            knights, Rodolph de Toni, Hugh de Grant-mesnil, and <lb/>
            Arnold d'Echaufour, with their barons, and compelling them <lb/>
            to undergo a long exile without any real cause of offence. At <lb/>
            the same time, Robert, abbot of St. Evroult, was cited before <lb/>
            the duke's court, and a day appointed him to answer the <note type="footnote"> 1 Baldwin V., earl of Flanders (1034—1067), married Adelaide of <lb/>

            charges which were falsely alleged against him. For Rainer, <lb/>
            a monk of Châtillon, whom he had raised to be prior of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and had admitted without reserve to his most privy <lb/>
            councils, as a confidential friend, had accused him of certain <lb/>
            words, spoken in jest and thoughtlessly, of the duke's per­ <lb/>
            sonal character. Abbot Robert, finding his sovereign to <lb/>
            be violently enraged against himself and his whole kindred, <lb/>
            and bent on their ruin, and having friendly intimation which <lb/>
            satisfied him that the marquis's1 anger menaced him with <lb/>
            bodily injury, he determined, by the advice of Hugh, bishop <lb/>
            of Lisieux, to escape from the wrath which threatened him, <lb/>
            before it inflicted any irreparable calamity. Accordingly, on <lb/>
            the sixth of the calends of February [January 27], in the <lb/>
            third year of his rule as abbot [A.D. 1061], after chanting at <lb/>
            vespers the antiphon, Peccata mea, Domine, he took his <lb/>
            departure, and, mounting on horseback with two monks, Fulk <lb/>
            and Urse, travelled through France, and thence proceeded <lb/>
            to present himself to Pope Nicholas, and lay his case before <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the duke of Normandy, by the advice of the <lb/>
            venerable Ansfrid, abbot of Preaux, Lanfranc, prior of <lb/>
            Bee, and other ecclesiastics, required Rainer, abbot of the <lb/>
            convent of the Holy Trinity at Rouen, to send to him <lb/>
            Osbern, prior of Cormeille, who, little suspecting the duke's <lb/>
            intentions, was by him invested with the dignity of abbot of <lb/>
            St. Evroult in a synod at Rouen, the duke using the crozier <lb/>
            of St. Mauritius, the archbishop, for the investiture. <lb/>
            Thereupon, Bishop Hugh, by the duke's order, conducted <lb/>
            Osbern to Preaux, and there consecrated him abbot; and <lb/>
            then taking him to St. Evroult, at the command of the <lb/>
            imperious duke, set him over the sorrowing monks. This <lb/>
            proceeding caused them the greatest trouble and perplexity; <lb/>
            for, while their abbot was still alive, a prelate who had laid <lb/>
            the foundations of the new church, had admitted many of <lb/>
            them into the order, and whose expulsion had been effected, <lb/>
            not by the judgment of a synod on just accusations, but by the <lb/>
            tyrannical will of the imperious marquis, they were reluctant <lb/>
            to receive another ruler; but, on the other hand, they did <lb/>
            not dare openly to refuse, fearing the duke's anger. At <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author is speaking of William I., duke of Normandy. See the <lb/>
            note at p. 397 as to the various titles given to the dukes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            length, by the bishop's advice, they preferred to submit to <lb/>
            the violent intrusion, and to tender their obedience to the <lb/>
            master provided for them, rather than continue without any <lb/>
            government, being in opposition to the power of God, and <lb/>
            running the risk of ruining the new abbey, by drawing on <lb/>
            themselves the still more violent displeasure of the duke by <lb/>
            resisting his will.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Arnold d'Echaufour took signal vengeance for <lb/>
            the act which disinherited him, by desolating the district of <lb/>
            Lisieux, plundering and burning, and either putting to the <lb/>
            sword or making prisoners the inhabitants for three years <lb/>
            together.1 Coming one night to Echaufour, with only four <lb/>
            men-at-arms, he secretly gained admission into the castle <lb/>
            with his followers, and, raising great shouts, they so terrified <lb/>
            the garrison which the duke had placed there, consisting of <lb/>
            sixty men, that they deserted the fortifications which it was <lb/>
            their duty to defend, and fled. Arnold forthwith set it on <lb/>
            fire, causing great loss to the enemy. At another time, he <lb/>
            committed the town of St. Evroult to the flames; and his <lb/>
            retainers, with drawn swords in their hands, made a diligent <lb/>
            search in every corner of the monastery for Osbern, the <lb/>
            new abbot, threatening him with instant death. But Provi­ <lb/>
            dence bad so ordered it, that he was then absent. Some <lb/>
            days afterwards, Herman the cellarer went privately to <lb/>
            Arnold, and gently rebuked him for having threatened the <lb/>
            ruin of an abbey which his father had founded for the repose <lb/>
            of his soul. Arnold listened with reverence to the remon­ <lb/>
            strances of the servant of God, and, touched with the <lb/>
            remembrance of his fathers piety, bewailed his own ill-con­ <lb/>
            duct towards the abbey of St. Evroult, promising in his <lb/>
            penitence a becoming amends. Accordingly, he soon after­ <lb/>
            wards came to St. Evroult, and, offering on the altar a token <lb/>
            of his repentance for his evil deeds, sought absolution, <lb/>
            putting Abbot Osbern in security for the future ; for the <lb/>
            cellerer bad adroitly insinuated the truth that it was no <lb/>
            ambition of the new abbot which had led to his elevation, <lb/>
            but that be was compelled by the power of the duke, and <lb/>
            instigated by his own superiors, to undertake the govern- <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author has omitted to tell us in this place, from whence he made <lb/>

            ment of the widowed abbey, much against his own <lb/>
            wishes.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Abbot Robert had made his way to Rome, <lb/>
            where he laid before Pope Nicholas precise details of the <lb/>
            circumstances which had induced him to undertake the <lb/>
            journey. The pope, who was a native of France, received <lb/>
            his countryman with great kindness, heard his complaints <lb/>
            with interest, and promised to support him in his difficult <lb/>
            position. Robert also paid a visit to his relations in Apulia, <lb/>
            where they had obtained possession of many cities and <lb/>
            towns by force of arms. After having a conference with <lb/>
            them, he returned to Normandy, furnished with apostolical <lb/>
            letters, and accompanied by two cardinal's clerks, and boldly <lb/>
            presented himself at the court of Duke William, which he <lb/>
            then held at Lillebonne.1 Hearing that Abbot Robert with <lb/>
            the papal legates were arrived for the purpose of claiming <lb/>
            the abbey of St. Evroult, and to take proceedings against <lb/>
            Osbern, who was made abbot in his place by the duke's <lb/>
            command, as an intruder on the rights of another, he was <lb/>
            violently enraged, saying that " he would willingly receive <lb/>
            the envoys which the pope, as the common father of Chris­ <lb/>
            tians, sent to him, touching the faith and the Christian <lb/>
            religion, but that if any monk in his territories brought <lb/>
            charges against him, he would hang him with contempt on <lb/>
            the highest tree in the neighbouring forest." Bishop Hugh, <lb/>
            hearing this, communicated it to Robert, recommending him <lb/>
            to avoid the presence of the angry prince. He, therefore, <lb/>
            departed in haste, retiring to the abbey of St. Denys, the <lb/>
            apostle of the Gauls, in the neighbourhood of Paris, where <lb/>
            he was received by his cousin Hugh, the venerable abbot, <lb/>
            and was for some time honourably entertained by him, and <lb/>
            others, his friends and relations, who were among the most <lb/>
            powerful of the French nobility. From thence he sent a <lb/>
            message, to Abbot Osbern that both should appear at <lb/>
            Chartres, before the Roman cardinals, when, the controversy <lb/>
            being carefully inquired into, they should both submit them­ <lb/>
            selves unhesitatingly to the final judgment of ecclesiastical <lb/>
            authorities, according to the decrees of the sacred canons. <note type="footnote"> 1 The dukes of Normandy had here one of their favourite and most <lb/>
            frequented seats; Julia-Bona, sedes regia a dominis Normannorum <lb/>
            multum amata et frequentata, says Robert du Mont's Chronicle. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            On receiving the summons, Osbern declared that he would <lb/>
            willingly go to the court of Rome; but, by the advice of <lb/>
            others, he did not appear at the appointed time and place. <lb/>
            Whereupon Robert, by means of a servant of the abbey <lb/>
            taken by Arnold, sent letters, by the pope's authority, <lb/>
            excommunicating Osbern as an intruder, and positively <lb/>
            requiring all the monks of the abbey of St. Evroult to sub­ <lb/>
            mit to him.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to describe the troubles with which the <lb/>
            church of St. Evroult was now harassed, both within and <lb/>
            without. Here was Robert, one of their founders, and <lb/>
            their chief ruler, unjustly expelled from his seat, and <lb/>
            compelled to become a fugitive from house to house <lb/>
            in foreign lands; while a stranger was thrust into this <lb/>
            place by the secular arm, who, though a man of ability, <lb/>
            and both religious and zealous for the interests of their <lb/>
            order, was naturally enough suspicious and apprehen­ <lb/>
            sive and little disposed to put confidence in the native <lb/>
            brethren. When, therefore, they heard of the excommuni­ <lb/>
            cation launched against the intruding abbot, and received <lb/>
            the monition of father Robert commanding his sons to join <lb/>
            him, with the pope's concurrence, some of them, turning <lb/>
            their backs on Normandy, accompanied their abbot to the <lb/>
            apostolic see. Almost all, indeed, were desirous to depart, <lb/>
            but the young and the infirm, being more closely confined, <lb/>
            were obliged to remain against their will. Those who were <lb/>
            strong enough, and who assumed greater liberty, went <lb/>
            into voluntary exile with their venerable father; whose <lb/>
            names are as follows: Herbert and Hubert de Montreuil, <lb/>
            and Berenger, son of Arnold, a skilful penman. These three <lb/>
            monks, carefully educated from their childhood in the Lord's <lb/>
            house, and their minds stored with sound learning, were all <lb/>
            their lives valuable members of a community devoted to <lb/>
            God's service. There were also Reginald the Great, a <lb/>
            skilful grammarian; Thomas of Angers, of noble birth ; <lb/>
            Robert Gamaliel, an excellent chanter; Turstin, Reynold <lb/>
            Chevreuil, and Walter the Little. All these abandoning <lb/>
            Neustria, their native soil, after suffering various accidents <lb/>
            reached Sicily, from whence some of them afterwards returned, <lb/>
            while others, devoting their services to their shepherd, even <lb/>
            to the end, closed their days in Calabria. <note type="footnote"> FF2 </note> <pb n="436"/>

          <p>The lord Mainer, who had been appointed prior by abbot <lb/>
            Robert before he quitted the abbey, first betook himself to Bee <lb/>
            a few days after his departure, and was the first to consult <lb/>
            with Lanfranc prior of Bee, about substituting another <lb/>
            abbot. He therefore implacably offended the father who <lb/>
            had received his first profession. Alarmed at his denun­ <lb/>
            ciations, and exposed with shame to the taunts of his parti­ <lb/>
            sans, Mainer obtained leave from abbot Osmond to migrate <lb/>
            to Cluni, where he submitted for a year to undergo with <lb/>
            zeal the rigour of that ride under the venerable abbot <lb/>
            Hugh.</p>
          <p>Amongst all these changes, the abbey of St. Evroult <lb/>
            suffered great devastations, being robbed of many of the <lb/>
            domains it before possessed. The neighbouring lords, who <lb/>
            were kinsmen or tenants of the Circles, seeing the right <lb/>
            heirs expelled, inflicted grievous troubles and losses on the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult. For each seized a farm, or a church, <lb/>
            or tithes; and the new abbot, being a stranger, was unac­ <lb/>
            quainted with all the grants of possessions to the monks, <lb/>
            and he hesitated to inquire of those in whom he placed no <lb/>
            confidence respecting the domains which Robert son of Heu­ <lb/>
            gon, and Giroie son of Fulk de Montreuil, Roger Gulafre,1 <lb/>
            and other evil-disposed neighbours, had usurped. So that <lb/>
            at this period the abbey of St. Evroult lost many estates <lb/>
            which to this hour it has never recovered.</p>
          <p>On the death of Pope Nicholas, he was succeeded by <lb/>
            Alexander, to whom abbot Robert presented himself with <lb/>
            eleven monks of St. Evroult, and laid before him at length <lb/>
            the wrongs of himself and his companions in exile. The <lb/>
            pope comforted them with paternal kindness, and assigned <lb/>
            them the church of St. Paul at Rome, where they might <lb/>
            dwell and observe their rule, until they were able to <note type="footnote"> 1 A person of the family of Goulafre, Gulielmus Gulafra, figures in the <lb/>

            William de Montreuil to his assistance, a call which he <lb/>
            found him ready to attend to. This knight was standard- <lb/>
            bearer to the pope, and had reduced Campania by force of arms <lb/>
            and brought back the natives who were cut off by various <lb/>
            schisms from catholic unity to submission to St. Peter <lb/>
            the apostle. He gave to his exiled cousin and his monks <lb/>
            the half of an ancient city called Aquina.1 Robert after­ <lb/>
            wards went to Richard prince of Capua, son of Ansquetel <lb/>
            de Quarel,2 from whom he received much civility, but he did <lb/>
            not carry into effect the promises he made with so much <lb/>
            courtesy. Robert, finding himself deluded by empty hopes, <lb/>
            reproached him in much anger for his degeneracy from his <lb/>
            father, whom he knew well, and taking leave of him, betook <lb/>
            himself to Robert Guiscard, duke of Calabria.3 The duke <lb/>
            paid him great honours as his natural lord, and begged him <lb/>
            to take up his abode permanently with his monks in his <lb/>
            territory. Robert Guiscard's father, Tancred de Hauteville, <lb/>
            who was born in the Cotentin, had twelve sons and several <lb/>
            daughters by his two lawful wives. He gave up his patri­ <lb/>
            monial estate to one of the sons whose name was Geoffrey, <lb/>
            apprising the rest that they must gain their livelihood by <lb/>
            their courage and by their talents beyond the bounds of <lb/>
            their native land. All these young men migrated to Apulia, <lb/>
            not together but at different times, in the guise of pilgrims <lb/>
            with scrip and staff, that they might not fall into the hands <lb/>
            of the Romans. In the course of events they all became <lb/>
            dukes and counts in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. Geoffrey <lb/>

            Robert Guiscard obtained the highest rank, and was the <lb/>
            most powerful, having, after the death of his brothers Drogo <lb/>
            and Humfrey1 long possessed the principality of Apulia, and <lb/>
            conquered the dukedom of Calabria from the Lombards and <lb/>
            Greeks, who struggled hard to defend their ancient rights <lb/>
            and independence, trusting in their great cities and towns, <lb/>
            but were at last reduced to submission by the event of arms. <lb/>
            Crossing the Ionian sea with a small but brave band of <lb/>
            Normans joined by Cisalpine troops, Robert Guiscard in­ <lb/>
            vaded Macedonia, twice gave battle to Alexius, emperor of <lb/>
            Constantinople, and put to flight his immense army, defeat­ <lb/>
            ing him both by sea and land.2</p>
          <p>This lord, as I have mentioned before, received with <lb/>
            honour abbot Robert and his monks, assigning to him the <lb/>
            church of St. Euphemia, which stands on the shore of the <lb/>
            Adriatic Sea, where the ruins of an ancient city called <lb/>
            Brescia,3 and commanding him to build a monastery there <lb/>
            in honour of St. Mary, mother of God. The duke, as well as <lb/>
            other Normans, made large grants to this abbey, commend­ <lb/>
            ing themselves to the prayers of the faithful who were <lb/>
            already collected or should be thereafter gathered there for <lb/>
            the service of Christ. In this abbey was buried Fredesend, <lb/>
            wife of Tancred de Hauteville; on whose behalf her son <lb/>
            Guiscard endowed the church of St. Euphemia with a large <lb/>
            farm. The same prince committed to father Robert the <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author omits to mention William Bras-de-fer, the eldest brother, <lb/>

            Mediterranean, to the west of Nicastro, near the confines of the two Cala­ <lb/>

            on the site of a place called Brixia, but on that of Lampetia. Our author <lb/>
            must have confounded it with a village of the same name situate in the <lb/>
            environs of Brescia, and consequently at the other extremity of Italy. <lb/>
            The abbey of St. Euphemia, which was founded long before the arrival of <lb/>
            the Normans, had been plundered and reduced to ruins, with all the <lb/>
            neighbouring country, by the Arabs of Sicily, who so often carried fire and <lb/>
            sword through this part of the coast of Calabria in the latter part of the <lb/>
            ninth and the beginning of the tenth centuries. Restored by the Norman <lb/>
            princes, it flourished for a long period. Richard, one of the abbots, was <lb/>
            witness to a charter of Bonhomme, archbishop of Cosenza, in 1199; and a <lb/>
            monk named Peter was transferred from it to the bishopric of Strongoli in <lb/>

            abbey of the Holy Trinity in the city of Venosa.1 Robert <lb/>
            selected Berenger, a monk of St. Evroult, son of Arnold, <lb/>
            who was soil of Heugon, whom be presented to Pope Alex­ <lb/>
            ander to be admitted to the government of the abbey of <lb/>
            Venosa.. Receiving the papal benediction, he administered <lb/>
            it with distinction during the period that Alexander, <lb/>
            Gregory, and Desiderius, filled the apostolical see, but in <lb/>
            the time of Pope Urban he was advanced to the bishopric of <lb/>
            that city, having been elected by the people. Born of a <lb/>
            noble family, Berenger obeyed the monastic rule from his <lb/>
            childhood under abbot Theodoric at St. Evroult, and dis­ <lb/>
            played superior talent in reading and chanting, as well as in <lb/>
            the art of copying boobs. Having in the end, as already <lb/>
            related, followed his abbot into banishment, and been chosen <lb/>
            by him to undertake the pastoral charge of the abbey <lb/>
            at Venosa, he found there only a small company of <lb/>
            twenty monks, very much occupied with worldly vanities, <lb/>
            and very slothful in God's service; but by God's grace he <lb/>
            raised the number of the community to one hundred, and <lb/>
            inspired them with so much zeal for religion, that several of <lb/>
            them were made bishops and abbots, and filled these high <lb/>
            dignities of our holy mother church to the honour of the <lb/>
            true King and the salvation of souls. Moreover, this great <lb/>
            duke committed also a third monastery, built in the city of <lb/>
            Melito2 in honour of St. Michael the archangel, to abbot <lb/>
            Robert, which he presented to William of Ingran, who was <lb/>
            born and became a clerk at St. Evroult, but whose profession <lb/>
            of a monk was made at St. Euphemia. These three Italian <lb/>
            monasteries therefore follow the usage of the chant at St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and observe the same monastic rule, so far as the <lb/>
            habits of that country and the inclinations of the inmates <lb/>
            allow.</p>
          <p>Two uterine sisters of Abbot Robert, Judith and Anna, <lb/>
            remained at Ouche in the chapel of St. Evroult, and having <lb/>
            taken the veil apparently renounced the world, and were <lb/>
            devoted to God only, in purity of body and soul. These <lb/>
            nuns, hearing that their brother Robert flourished under the <lb/>
            protection of the temporal power in Italy, and finding <lb/>
            themselves of small account and without support in <note type="footnote"> 1 Venosa is an episcopal city of the Basilicata. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An episcopal city in the Lower Calabria. </note> <lb/>

            Normandy, they went into Italy and relinquishing the veil <lb/>
            gave themselves up with ardour to a worldly life, and both of <lb/>
            them married husbands who were unconscious of their <lb/>
            having taken the vows. Roger, count of Sicily, married <lb/>
            Judith, and another count, whose name I cannot recollect, <lb/>
            married Emma. Thus, from love of the world, both quitted <lb/>
            the veil the emblem of a religious life, and thus rendering <lb/>
            void their first faith, neither were blessed with children, and <lb/>
            for a short interval of temporal felicity they incurred the <lb/>
            displeasure of their heavenly Spouse.</p>
          <p>After the departure of Abbot Robert, his uncle Robert <lb/>
            Mala-Corona, perceiving the bitter persecution which was <lb/>
            raging against his relations, and that strangers were ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to power in the abbey of St. Evroult which he and his <lb/>
            brothers had founded for the service of God, withdrew from <lb/>
            the chapel of St. Evroult, where, as already mentioned, he <lb/>
            had taken up his abode, and retired to Marmoutier in which <lb/>
            convent he had first made his monastic profession, and where <lb/>
            he soon afterwards made a glorious end on the fourteenth <lb/>
            of the calends of February [19th January], having lived <lb/>
            seven years under the conventual rule.</p>

          <p>AT this time, Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou, after a <lb/>

            departed this life,1 leaving his honours to his nephew <lb/>

            mented his influence and power, surpassing all the neigh­ <lb/>

          <p>When war broke out between the Normans and their <lb/>
            neighbours in Brittany and Maine, Duke William, by the <lb/>
            advice of his counsellors, determined on restoring concord <lb/>
            among his own barons, and recalling the exiles.3 Moved <lb/>
            therefore by the entreaties of Simon do Montfort, and <lb/>
            Waleran de Breteuil in the Beauvais, and other powerful <lb/>
            friends and neighbours, be recalled Rodolph de Toni and <lb/>
            Hugh de Grant-mesnil, great nobles who had been disinhe­ <lb/>
            rited and forced into exile with their followers as before <lb/>
            related, and who were now restored to their hereditary <lb/>
            estates. Arnold also, after levying war for three years, <lb/>
            accepted a truce from the duke, and paid a visit to his friends <lb/>
            and relations who had great possessions in Apulia, from <lb/>
            whence be soon afterwards returned with a large sum <lb/>

            This Osbern, son of Herfast, a native of the district of Caux, <lb/>

            black and grey hair. Severe towards the silly and the super­ <lb/>

            disciplinarian, urging them, both with chidings and stripes, <lb/>
            to progress in reading, singing, and writing. He made with <lb/>
            his own hands writing implements for the youths and the <lb/>
            uninstructed, preparing for them tablets overspread with <lb/>
            wax, and required daily from each the portion of work <lb/>
            assigned to them. An enemy to idleness, he had the art of <lb/>
            impressing on the youthful mind profitable pursuits, and <lb/>
            thus prepared for implanting the riches of science in future <lb/>
            years. Osbern was at first a canon of Lisieux, at the time <lb/>
            the lord Herbert was bishop ;1 but being afterwards desirous <lb/>
            of submitting himself to a stricter rule, he threw off the <lb/>
            secular habit; and, to amend his life according to God's <lb/>
            will, secluded himself in the new monastery which Goscelin <lb/>
            d'Arques had founded on the mount of the Holy Trinity at <lb/>
            Rouen, where Abbot Isembert, a man of singular piety in <lb/>
            our age, then flourished. Abbot Rainier, Isembert's succes­ <lb/>
            sor, sent Osbern, after passing his probation in the order, to <lb/>
            establish the monastic rule at Cormeilles, where William <lb/>
            Fitz-Osbern, steward of Normandy, was founding an abbey <lb/>
            in honour of St. Mary, mother of God. When, however, - <lb/>
            Abbot Robert was deprived of his office, in the manner <lb/>
            already described, Osbern was unwittingly and unwillingly <note type="footnote"> 1 Herbert, bishop of Lisieux, 1022—1049. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            preferred to the government of the abbey of St. Evreux, <lb/>
            which he administered with diligence and success, so far as <lb/>
            the troubles of those unhappy times permitted, for five years <lb/>
            and three months.</p>
          <p>By leave of his abbot Rainier, he had brought with him <lb/>
            to St. Evroult a very learned and religious monk whose <lb/>
            name was Witmund, and made use of his counsels and <lb/>
            suggestions as long as he lived. This monk was an <lb/>
            accomplished musician as well as grammarian, of which he <lb/>
            has left us evidence in the antiphons and responses which <lb/>
            he composed, consisting of some charming melodies in the <lb/>
            antiphonary and collection of versicles. He completed the <lb/>
            history of the life of St. Evroult by adding nine antiphons <lb/>
            and three responses. He composed four antiphons to the <lb/>
            psalms at vespers, and added the three last for the second <lb/>
            nocturn, with the fourth, eighth, and twelfth response, and <lb/>
            an antiphon at the canticles, and produced a most beautiful <lb/>
            antiphon for the canticle at the gospel in the second vespers. <lb/>
            The history of the life of St. Evroult had been already written <lb/>
            by Arnulph, precentor of Chartres,1 a pupil of Fulbert, bishop <lb/>
            of that see, at the request of Abbot Robert, for the use of <lb/>
            his monks; and it was first recited by two young monks, <lb/>
            Hubert and Rodolph, sent for that purpose by the abbot of <lb/>
            Chartres. Afterwards, Reginald the Bald composed the <lb/>
            response, “To the glory of God,” sung at vespers, with seven <lb/>
            antiphons which still appear in the service books of the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult. Roger de Sap, also, and other <lb/>
            studious brethren produced, with pious devotion, several <lb/>
            hymns having the same holy father for their subject, and <lb/>
            which they placed in the library of the abbey for the use of <lb/>
            their successors.</p>
          <p>Abbot Osbern, still tortured with anxiety in consequence <lb/>
            of the apostolical anathema under which he was compelled to <lb/>
            live, determined, on prudent advice, to send an envoy to Rome, <lb/>
            by whom he would humbly implore the papal benediction. <note type="footnote"> 1 This life of St. Evroult, the founder of the abbey of Ouche which <lb/>
            afterwards bore his name, was written about the end of the seventh century, <lb/>
            although Vossius thought it to be of the sixth, and Baillet of the eighth. <lb/>
            Ordericus Vitalis has inserted it in the sixth book of his history, and <lb/>
            Mabillon has published it entire, with notes and additions, in his Recueil, <lb/>

            He therefore instructed Witmund, a monk of great sagacity, <lb/>
            to indite a suppliant epistle, which a young monk whose <lb/>
            name was Bernard, with the addition of Mather, an excel­ <lb/>
            lent penman, was carefully to commit to writing. The <lb/>
            following is the text of this epistle:</p>
          <p>“To our apostolical lord, Alexander,1 vicar of St. Peter, <lb/>
            the common and most excellent father of mankind-his <lb/>
            humble servant at a far distance, Osbern, abbot of St. <lb/>
            Evroult in Normandy, sends health, devoted submission, <lb/>
            and his most earnest supplication.</p>
          <p>“Since, holy father, it belongs to your office, in prefer­ <lb/>
            ence to and above all other bishops of the church, to extend <lb/>
            your care over the whole of Christendom, to seek zealously <lb/>
            to gain souls, and by your authority to restore concord <lb/>
            where dissensions have arisen, an obscure abbot as I aID, <lb/>
            but still clinging to the shelter of your bosom, I lift my <lb/>
            voice to you with intense earnestness of mind, imploring <lb/>
            your indulgence, and beseeching you to deign to interpose <lb/>
            your righteous authority to deliver me from what I suffer <lb/>
            from certain distractions in the order to which I belong. <lb/>
            The case is this. The abbey of St. Evroult, which I now <lb/>
            possess, was formerly held by a cousin of your faithful <lb/>
            servant, William of Normandy, the lord abbot Robert, who <lb/>
            for some cause of offence, vacated his office and departed. <lb/>
            Upon this the sovereign prince of that country and the <lb/>
            bishops of the church made me abbot in his place, and, as <lb/>
            they then alleged and still allege, to remove my own doubts <lb/>
            and fears, they duly and according to God's will conse­ <lb/>
            crated me to the vacant dignity. I know not whether they <lb/>
            are right; but this I assuredly know, from my own con­ <lb/>
            science, that I obtained the style and office of abbot neither <lb/>
            by importunity, nor by bribery, nor by favour, nor by <lb/>
            obsequiousness, or any other crafty device, but that as <lb/>
            far as I am concerned I took it upon me solely in obedience <lb/>
            to the commands of my superiors, and that in so doing no <lb/>
            charge was brought against me. Abbot Robert has become <lb/>
            the superior of a convent in Calabria, at a great distance <lb/>
            from our country, and there his wrath and hatred are still <lb/>
            inflamed against me; and he continues to slander and <lb/>
            threaten me, asserting that I have usurped his office con- <note type="footnote"> 1 Pope Alexander II., November 30, 106] -April 2], 1070. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            trary to the laws of God. This schism is both full of <lb/>
            danger to the souls of those who are placed under my <lb/>
            charge, and places me in great perplexity between the two <lb/>
            parties. For, on the one hand, I do not presume to dis­ <lb/>
            obey the bishops of my own province, who assert that I am <lb/>
            regularly appointed, and enjoin me to hold my place; while, <lb/>
            on the other hand, I dread the wrath and hatred of my <lb/>
            accusing brother, especially as we are both priests and <lb/>
            monks. As indeed the voice of an apostle thunders in our <lb/>
            ears : 'He that hateth his brother is a murderer ;’1 who can <lb/>
            sufficiently express the greatness of the crime of a priest <lb/>
            and a monk who hates his brother? And who does not <lb/>
            know that if in this state of mind he presumes to offer the <lb/>
            sacrifice of the altar, he perils his soul ?</p>
          <p>" Therefore, most apostolical lord, the venerable father of <lb/>
            all Christendom, prostrate on the earth at the feet of your <lb/>
            merciful benignity, I earnestly supplicate with tears and <lb/>
            groans that you who occupy the place of St. Peter in vigi­ <lb/>
            lantly feeding the Lord's flock, and guarding them from the <lb/>
            crafty devices of wolves, would be pleased in your zeal for <lb/>
            God to abate by a righteous judgment this fierce contro­ <lb/>
            versy between me and the brother of whom I speak, and <lb/>
            altogether remove the present perplexity from my mind. <lb/>
            Accordingly, my prayer is, that by virtue of your authority <lb/>
            you cause to appear both myself and those who took part in <lb/>
            my consecration, together with Abbot Robert, my accuser, <lb/>
            before fit and lawful judges, who shall impartially try the <lb/>
            cause; so that, if it be found that I was rightly instituted to <lb/>
            the office of abbot, I may continue to hold it; if improperly, <lb/>
            I may surrender it. Graciously yielding to this my prayer, <lb/>
            you will fulfil your office in a praiseworthy manner, and <lb/>
            will conduct brothers into the way of peace. For whether <lb/>
            it happens that I have to remain or to depart, my brother's <lb/>
            anger will be set at rest by the decision of the judge, and I <lb/>
            shall be freed from perplexity, and shall serve God in peace <lb/>
            and security. 0 bishop of the bishops of the church, and <lb/>
            father of fathers, the appointed refuge for all who are in <lb/>
            tribulation, I beseech you by the holy power of binding and <lb/>
            loosing which is vested in you over all mankind, listen to <lb/>
            these my words of sincerity, and as far as I ask what is <note type="footnote"> 1 1 John iii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            right, grant what I ask. And that you may believe I speak <lb/>
            the truth, I call the omniscient God as witness, who knows <lb/>
            that in my conscience, the language of my mouth is that of <lb/>
            my heart. In conclusion, most pious lord, I especially <lb/>
            request in all humility that you will be pleased, of your <lb/>
            paternal kindness, to reply by letter under your seal by the <lb/>
            envoy I send, so that I may learn the success of my peti­ <lb/>
            tion, and what course you will take in the matter, and when <lb/>
            and where; and having obtained some certainty, my per­ <lb/>
            plexities may be at an end, and I may rejoice that I have <lb/>
            raised my voice to a most merciful comforter. Farewell! <lb/>
            Glorious father, most excellent ruler, and supreme head of <lb/>
            the church on earth ; farewell ! watch over the Lord's fold; <lb/>
            which may you so do that you may meet the last judgment <lb/>
            in security. Amen.”</p>
          <p>This letter was carried to Rome by William, priest of St. <lb/>
            Andrew, at Echaufour, and presented to Pope Alexander. <lb/>
            The venerable pontiff read it in the presence of the Roman <lb/>
            conclave, and having carefully examined the matter ab­ <lb/>
            solved Osbern at the request of abbot Robert who was <lb/>
            there present, sending back the bearer of the letter re­ <lb/>
            joicing to his own country with the papal benediction. As <lb/>
            for Robert, he now despaired of ever returning to Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy on account of the wrath of duke William, and being <lb/>
            honourably detained in Calabria, as already mentioned by <lb/>
            G-uiscard and the other Normans who had usurped foreign <lb/>
            domains, his former indignation against Osbern was allayed, <lb/>
            and he now kindly interceded with the pope for the man <lb/>
            he had before cruelly attacked by his subtle accusations. <lb/>
            William the priest, having accomplished his mission, re­ <lb/>
            turned in safety to those who had sent him, and rejoiced <lb/>
            the hearts of the monks of St. Evroult by relating what he <lb/>
            had seen and heard at Rome.</p>
          <p>Osbern, now secure in his office, laudably occupied him­ <lb/>
            self both in the interior and exterior duties which devolved <lb/>
            upon him. He only admitted four novices to profession, <lb/>
            on account of the persecution to which he had been subject, <lb/>
            but he diligently and profitably instructed in the sacred <lb/>
            arts those whom he found admitted by his predecessors. <lb/>
            He instituted a yearly anniversary on the sixth of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ordericus calls the assembly of the cardinals, Romanus senatus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            calends of July [26th] June, for the fathers and mothers, <lb/>
            and brothers and sisters, of all the monks of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            The names of all the brethren are registered on a long roll <lb/>
            when, called by God, they first make their profession. To <lb/>
            these were added, underneath, those of their fathers and <lb/>
            mothers, and brothers and sisters. This roll was kept near <lb/>
            the altar throughout the year, and an especial commemora­ <lb/>
            tion is made before God of the persons inscribed, when the <lb/>
            priest says in celebrating the mass : Animas famulorum, <lb/>
            famularum tuarum, &amp;c., "Vouchsafe to join to the society <lb/>
            of thine elect the souls of thy servants, both men and women, <lb/>
            whose names are written in the roll presented before thy <lb/>
            holy altar." The anniversary on the sixth of the calends of <lb/>
            July, of which we are now speaking, is thus conducted. All <lb/>
            the bells are rung for some time, both night and morning, <lb/>
            for the office of the dead. The roll of the deceased is spread. <lb/>
            open on the altar, and prayers are faithfully offered to God, <lb/>
            first for the dead, and afterwards for living relations and <lb/>
            benefactors, and all the faithful in Christ. The morning <lb/>
            mass is solemnly sung by the abbot himself, assisted by all <lb/>
            the clergy in their sacred vestments. The almoner as­ <lb/>
            sembles in the convent on that day as many indigent <lb/>
            persons as there are monks, and the cellarer provides each <lb/>
            with a sufficiency of meat and drink in the strangers' apart­ <lb/>
            ment, and after the chapter the whole community devotes <lb/>
            itself to the service of the poor as in the Lord's supper. <lb/>
            This institution of Abbot Osbern is still carefully main­ <lb/>
            tained in the abbey of St. Evroult, and it is likewise <lb/>
            zealously observed by the monks of Noyon' and Bocher­ <lb/>
            ville,2 and others which follow its rules.</p>
          <p>The man of God so often named had a particular regard, <lb/>
            as I have said before, for the sick and the poor, supplying <lb/>
            their wants liberally with all things necessary. He there­ <lb/>
            fore ordered that seven lepers should, for the love of God, <lb/>
            have a yearly maintenance from the abbey, and that the <lb/>
            portions of seven monks should be daily distributed among <lb/>
            them by the cellarer in meat and drink. This custom was <note type="footnote"> 1 Noyon-sur-Audelle, now Charleval, which was a priory under the rule <lb/>

            observed by abbot Osbern and his successor Mainer, as <lb/>
            long as they lived; but when Serlo succeeded, as men's <lb/>
            minds change, the institution was altered, and in the time <lb/>
            of abbot Roger the number of the sick, in the name of the <lb/>
            Lord, was reduced to three.</p>
          <p>CH. VIII. Duke William's invasion of Maine, under cover <lb/>
            of protecting the interests of the young Count Herbert— <lb/>
            Death of his aunt Bertha and her husband by poison, and <lb/>
            of his sister Margaret, the young heiress.</p>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1064, on the death of Herbert the <lb/>
            younger, count of Maine, duke William crossed the Sarthe <lb/>
            with a strong army, and received with clemency many of the <lb/>
            people of Maine, who submitted to him, remaining under <lb/>
            his dominion for the rest of his life, that is, for twenty-four <lb/>
            years. The young count, after the death of his father <lb/>
            Herbert the elder1 (who was commonly called Herbert <lb/>
            Watch-dog, on account of the destructive inroads which his <lb/>
            neighbours of Anjou continually made on his territories), <lb/>
            by his mother Bertha's advice, placed himself and his <lb/>
            estates under the protection of the powerful duke of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy,2 affiancing his sister Margaret to the duke's son <lb/>
            Robert, with the reversion of his earldom of Maine, if he <lb/>
            himself should die without children. But Walter, count of <lb/>
            Pontoise, son of Count Drogo, who had undertaken the <lb/>
            journey to Jerusalem in company with Robert the elder, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, and died during his pilgrimage, had mar­ <lb/>
            ried Biota, daughter [sister] of Hugh, Count de Maine, who <lb/>
            was the aunt of the young Count Herbert. In right of her <lb/>
            he laid claim to the whole earldom, and had possession of <lb/>
            part of it; for Geoffrey de-Mayenne and Hubert de Sainte- <lb/>
            Susanne, and other powerful adherents of Walter, held the <lb/>
            city, which is the capital of the province, fearing to submit <lb/>
            to the yoke of the Normans, which is always grievous to <lb/>
            those who are subjected to it. While therefore the brave <lb/>
            duke attacked the rebels with vigour, inflicting and suffer­ <lb/>
            ing losses, according to the lot of war, Count Walter and <lb/>
            Biota his wife perished together, as the report is, by poison, <note type="footnote"> 1 Herbert I. was count du Maine from 1051 to 1062. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Herbert II. was son of Hugh and grandson of Herbert I., counts of <lb/>
            Maine. Duke William's invasion took place, not in 1064, but in 1063. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            treacherously administered by the contrivance of their ene­ <lb/>
            mies.1 On their death, the duke, now assured of success, <lb/>
            attacked the rebels in great force, and recovered the city of <lb/>
            Mans in triumph by the voluntary surrender of the in­ <lb/>
            habitants, the lord Arnold, the bishop, going out to meet <lb/>
            him in great pomp, with a procession of clergy and monks <lb/>
            carrying banners and crosses.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Geoffrey de Mayenne, envying the duke's <lb/>
            success, sought all the means in his power to injure him, by <lb/>
            encouraging his enemies, and contriving various ways of <lb/>
            inflicting evil. The duke bore his insolence for a while, that <lb/>
            be might have an opportunity of punishing him without <lb/>
            injury to others. But, as he persisted in his obstinacy, the <lb/>
            duke put in motion a large force, and took his town of <lb/>
            Ambrières, burning also Mayenne after a long siege. By <lb/>
            reducing these two fortresses, he humbled the pride of <lb/>
            Geoffrey, and thus compelled the most formidable of the <lb/>
            nobles of Maine to do him homage, although he had <lb/>
            persuaded other malcontents to join him in his resistance. <lb/>
            On his submission, almost all his accomplices and the sup­ <lb/>
            porters of his rebellion were struck with consternation, and <lb/>
            compelled to fear and obey William, a prince who was evi­ <lb/>
            dently protected by divine Providence. The duke entrusted <lb/>
            the beautiful Margaret to the care of Stigand, the powerful <lb/>
            baron of Mesidon, to be brought up in his family, but before <lb/>
            she became marriageable, she was snatched away from the <lb/>
            vanities of the world, and, dying happily, rests in peace, <lb/>
            being buried at Fécamp, in the noble and flourishing monas­ <lb/>
            tery founded in honour of the holy and undivided Trinity.</p>
          <p>At that time Robert de Gace, soil of Rodolph, son of <lb/>
            Robert the archbishop, died childless, whereupon Duke Wil­ <lb/>
            liam, his cousin, united his whole inheritance to his own <lb/>
            domains. He also gave the lands of Robert de Vitot, who <lb/>
            was banished for assassinating Count Gislebert [de Brionne], <lb/>
            to Geoffrey Mancel, brother of the viscount Hubert ; from <note type="footnote"> 1 This tragedy was performed at Falaise, where Duke William had <lb/>
            carried Walter and his wife prisoners, a circumstance which, notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing the reserve of Ordericus, sufficiently indicates by whose command the <lb/>
            poison was administered. The duke's contemporaries, especially those who <lb/>
            were opposed to him, spoke more plainly, and often told him the horror so <lb/>

            whom the lord Osbern, abbot of St. Evreux, bought the <lb/>
            vill called Douet-Artus, with Tronquet and Mesnil-Joscelin. <lb/>
            Duke William granted and confirmed it by a charter in pre­ <lb/>
            sence of the barons of Normandy, William Fitz-Osbern, <lb/>
            Richard d'Avranches, son of Turstin, Roger de Montgomery, <lb/>
            and many others mentioned in the charter.</p>
          <p>However, Robert de Vitot, after some time reconciled <lb/>
            himself with the duke, and, being restored to his lordship, <lb/>
            laid claim to the land just mentioned against the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, but not long afterwards the war with England, <lb/>
            in which he was wounded in the cheek, being ended, he fell <lb/>
            sick of a mortal disease. Finding his end approaching, he <lb/>
            freely gave all the land which lie claimed to the faithful <lb/>
            servants of God for the repose of his soul. This gift to <lb/>
            St. Evroult was made at Dover, before Odo, bishop of <lb/>
            Baieux, Hugh de Grant-mesnil, Hugh do Montfort, and <lb/>
            Hugh, son of Fulcold, and many other persons of high and <lb/>
            low condition.</p>
          <p>This knight had forty nephews, all proud of their rank of <lb/>
            knighthood, and engaged in such fierce contests with each <lb/>
            other, that his inheritance has scarcely ever been suffered to <lb/>
            rest undisturbed to the present day: for Matthiel and <lb/>
            Richard, his brother, Nigel, and Rualod the Breton, Nigel's <lb/>
            son-in-law, succeeded at different times, and by their evil <lb/>
            devices wrought much mischief. Every one of these claimed <lb/>
            the lands before named from the abbey of St. Evroult, but <lb/>
            the judgment of God who is everywhere the mighty pro­ <lb/>
            tector of his church, compelled them to desist from their <lb/>
            unjust attacks. It was Matthiel who, with great menaces, <lb/>
            made the attempt to rob the church of her possessions <lb/>
            during the reign of the great duke William ; and Richard <lb/>
            and other claimants during those of his brothers William <lb/>
            Rufus and Henry; but the King of kings, helping his <lb/>
            servants, they were unable to accomplish their wicked <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ARNOLD D'ECHOUFOUR, son of William Giroie, returning <lb/>
            successful from Apulia, presented himself at the court of <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            Duke William, and, offering him a magnificent mantle, <lb/>
            humbly entreated that his inheritance might be restored. <lb/>
            The duke, taking into consideration the high birth and dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished valour of this nobleman, and his own great want <lb/>
            of brave soldiers for his wars with the people of Maine, the <lb/>
            Bretons, and his other enemies, took a more lenient view of <lb/>
            his offences, and, making a truce with him, promised to <lb/>
            restore his patrimony; meanwhile giving him free liberty of <lb/>
            passing and repassing through his territories for a limited <lb/>
            time. The duke's empty promises caused Arnold great <lb/>
            satisfaction, but without just reason, as we shall presently <lb/>
            see. For Mabel, the daughter of Talvac, poisoned the <lb/>
            refreshments which she ordered to be set before him as he <lb/>
            was returning from the court of the duke to France; but a <lb/>
            friend of Arnold's gave him notice of the treachery <lb/>
            intended. While, therefore, he was conferring with some of <lb/>
            his friends at Echoufour, and was earnestly invited by <lb/>
            Mabel's attendants to partake of the entertainment, he would <lb/>
            on no account consent, remembering the friendly warning, <lb/>
            and utterly refusing all meat and drink which he suspected <lb/>
            to be poisoned. But Gislebert, the brother of Roger de <lb/>
            Montgomery, who had conducted him there, and was quite <lb/>
            unconscious of the treacherous design, took a cup, without <lb/>
            dismounting from his horse, and, drinking the poisoned <lb/>
            wine, died in consequence on the third day afterwards at <lb/>
            Remalord : so that this perfidious woman, attempting to <lb/>
            destroy her husband's rival, caused the death of his only <lb/>
            brother, who was in the flower of his youth, and much dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished for his chivalrous gallantry. Not long afterwards, <lb/>
            lamenting the failure of her first attempt, she made another <lb/>
            not less deadly effort to accomplish the object of her desires. <lb/>
            By means of prayers and promises she worked on Gulafre,l <lb/>
            Arnold's chamberlain, till she had bent the false retainer to <lb/>
            her nefarious wishes. She then prepared the poisoned drink, <lb/>
            which the chamberlain presented to his master, and to Gi­ <lb/>
            role de Courville,2 and William, surnamed Gouet de Mont­ <lb/>
            mirail. Thus the three nobles imbibed the venom of the <lb/>
            poison at Courville, at one and the same time; but Giroie <lb/>
            and William, who were carried to their own homes, where <note type="footnote"> 1 This worthy has been mentioned before, p. 436. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Courville, near Chartres. </note> <note type="footnote"> GG2 </note> <lb/>

            they could command all necessary care, by the mercy of God <lb/>
            aiding the skill of the physician, recovered, while Arnold, <lb/>
            who, as a banished man, had no means of securing proper <lb/>
            attentions in the house of a stranger, languished for some <lb/>
            days, and at length, the disorder increasing, breathed his <lb/>
            last on the calends [Ist] of January. The day before he <lb/>
            died, being alone in his chamber in bed, he saw clearly, and <lb/>
            not in a dream, an old man of a noble presence, whom he <lb/>
            took for St. Nicholas, who addressed him to this effect: <lb/>
            " Brother, trouble yourself not about your bodily health, for <lb/>
            it is' certain that you will die to-morrow, but direct your <lb/>
            utmost efforts towards saving your soul, at the scrutiny of <lb/>
            the just and eternal Judge." With these words the old <lb/>
            man suddenly vanished, whereupon the sufferer sent imme­ <lb/>
            diately to St. Evroult to request that some of the brethren <lb/>
            of the abbey would visit him. Without delay they sent <lb/>
            Fulk de Guernauville to Courville. It was there that the <lb/>
            knight of whom we are speaking spent three years during <lb/>
            his exile, with Giroie, the lord of that town, who was his <lb/>
            kinsman and friend, and from thence, with the aid of the <lb/>
            people of Corbon, Dreux, and Mortagne, and all others he <lb/>
            could summon to his assistance, he carried on a desperate <lb/>
            warfare to revenge his banishment. The sick man rejoiced <lb/>
            greatly at Fulk's speedy arrival, and, making known to him <lb/>
            the vision which he had seen the day before, he renounced <lb/>
            the world, and professed himself a monk with a tender <lb/>
            devotion of soul. Then, lamenting his sins, he died the <lb/>
            same day, and his body was carried to St. Evroult, and there <lb/>
            honourably interred by the lord abbot Osbern and the whole <lb/>
            community in the monks' cloister.</p>
          <p>On the death of Arnold, the noble family of Giroie fell <lb/>
            entirely to decay, and, to this day, no one of their posterity <lb/>
            has been able to recover the rank of his ancestors. Arnold <lb/>
            had married Emma, daughter of Turstin, surnamed Halduc, <lb/>
            by whom he had William and Reginald, Petronilla and Geva, <lb/>
            and other sons and daughters. Thus, losing their father in <lb/>
            their tender years, when he was in the flower of his youth, <lb/>
            and being settled in the houses of strangers, as we have <lb/>
            already noticed, they were exposed from infancy to poverty, <lb/>
            and all sorts of mortifications. Their mother found a refuge <lb/>
            with her brother Odo, steward of the duke of Normandy, <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            who dwelt in the Cotentin, and was distinguished for his <lb/>
            wealth and power among the Norman nobles. She lived <lb/>
            with him and her other friends almost thirty years in <lb/>
            honoured widowhood, being greatly respected for her <lb/>
            chastity, gentleness, and other good qualities; and towards <lb/>
            the close of her life, renounced the world, and took the veil <lb/>
            with much devotion at the hands of the lord Robert, abbot <lb/>
            of the Holy Trinity, at Lessai.1</p>
          <p>William d'Echaufour, the eldest of Arnold's sons, had <lb/>
            scarcely arrived at the age of puberty when he repaired to <lb/>
            the court of Philip, king of France, who appointed him his <lb/>
            squire, and afterwards knighted him for his good service. <lb/>
            He afterwards went into Apulia, where he had kinsmen of <lb/>
            high rank, and, being kindly entertained, advanced himself <lb/>
            greatly by his gallant actions. He took to wife a noble lady <lb/>
            of a Lombard family, and obtained possession of thirty <lb/>
            castles under Robert, count of Loritello, Guiscard's nephew.3 <lb/>
            The marriage was fruitful, and he had many children of both <lb/>
            sexes, and, forgetting Normandy, lived almost forty years <lb/>
            among the Lombards in great honour.</p>
          <p>Reginald, the youngest son of Arnold, had been entrusted <lb/>
            by his father, three months before his death, to Abbot <lb/>
            Osbern, and was carefully educated at St. Evroult under the <lb/>
            regular discipline of the abbey, receiving from the abbot the <lb/>
            surname of Benedict, on account of his sweetness of <lb/>
            disposition. His father, on offering him to God as a monk, <lb/>
            bad granted a plough-land at St. Germain's, in the parish of <lb/>
            Echaufour, to the abbey of St. Evroult, which it long since <lb/>
            lost, in the troubles to which Arnold and his heirs were <lb/>
            exposed, as already related. The youth was only five years <lb/>
            old when he submitted to the monastic yoke, which he has <lb/>
            steadfastly borne for fifty-two years,3 under four successive <lb/>
            abbots, both in prosperity and adversity. He fully learned <lb/>
            the arts of reading and singing, which he taught to others <lb/>
            without any mistakes, when he arrived himself at mature <lb/>
            years. His vigorous memory enabled him to relate with <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger, from whose hands Emma received the veil, was a monk of Bee, <lb/>

            great fulness whatever he had seen or heard, and his. <lb/>
            companions were frequently charmed with his recitals from <lb/>
            the sacred scriptures, and the statements of the learned. It <lb/>
            was his study to gain the affections of the gentle, and modest, <lb/>
            and teachable among the neophytes, by his affability and <lb/>
            condescension; but he stoutly contradicted the conceited, <lb/>
            and pretenders, and inventors of novelties. Twice he <lb/>
            undertook journeys, by permission of Abbot Roger, and for <lb/>
            the behests of the abbey of St. Evroult, as far as Apulia, and <lb/>
            in that foreign land found his brother William, and many <lb/>
            other relations possessed of great wealth. He remained <lb/>
            nearly three years in Calabria, with William, abbot of St. <lb/>
            Euphemia,1 son of Humfrey de Tilleul, and on his return <lb/>
            brought back a cope of purple and white, the gift of Abbot <lb/>
            Humfrey, who was his cousin, to the church of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            From his infancy, Reginald observed the monastic rules with <lb/>
            praiseworthy regularity, and zealously assisted at the offices <lb/>
            of divine worship, both in the day and the night. I have <lb/>
            often remarked him performing the chant with such <lb/>
            indefatigable zeal that scarcely a single versicle was sung in <lb/>
            the choir by others, in which he did not take a part. But as <lb/>
            it is written: " Many are the sorrows of the righteous,”2 he <lb/>
            suffered much tribulation, both from within and without. <lb/>
            For, being firm and severe to the froward, and disdaining to <lb/>
            flatter the hypocritical, he was frequently subject to their <lb/>
            attacks of various kinds. The eye of God seeth all things, <lb/>
            and condemns with discriminating judgment even those <lb/>
            which to men appear laudable, and he has afflicted our <lb/>
            brother Reginald with infirmity of body from his infancy, <lb/>
            and that the just may be further justified, continues to <lb/>
            this time, to increase the weakness of his limbs. While he <lb/>
            was yet a boy, as he never spared himself, and seemed <lb/>
            stronger for every kind of labour than the rest of the <lb/>
            brotherhood, be ruptured himself while carrying earth, and, <lb/>
            not allowing himself any rest, the hernia became incurable. <lb/>
            In short, he has now for seven years suffered such extreme <lb/>
            torture, that he is neither able to raise his hand to his <lb/>
            mouth, nor to do any office for himself without assistance. <lb/>
            Almighty God, who healest those who are broken in heart, <lb/>
            have mercy upon him! Purge him from all stain of sin, <note type="footnote"> 1 See before, b. iii, c. 5.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Psalm vii. 20. </note> <lb/>

          <p>The two daughters of Arnold, on the death of their father, <lb/>
            and their consequent destitution, chose rather to render <lb/>
            themselves acceptable to God by their modest conversation, <lb/>
            than to attain worldly prosperity by the perishing charms <lb/>
            of their personal beauty. Both, therefore, dedicated their <lb/>
            virginity to the Lord, and gave up the world to become nuns. <lb/>
            Petronilla took the veil in the convent of St: Mary, at <lb/>
            Angers, for a long time diligently observing the rules <lb/>
            submitted to by consecrated virgins ; and afterwards for ten <lb/>
            years within the enclosure, she became remarkable far and <lb/>
            wide by her character for her sanctity and her exemplary <lb/>
            virtues. Her sister Geva, taking the veil under the abbess <lb/>
            Beatrice, in the convent of the Holy Trinity at Caen, <lb/>
            founded by Queen Matilda, long practised and taught the <lb/>

            Beauvais prisoners, and, striking terror into the rest of the <lb/>
            enemy, restored tranquillity through all the country in that <lb/>
            quarter.</p>
          <p>Four canons were in possession of the church of St. Peter <lb/>
            the apostle at Neuf-Marché, but they were negligent in the <lb/>
            performance of divine worship, and led a very worldly life. <lb/>
            The noble Hugh, therefore, gave the moiety of the church <lb/>
            which belonged to him to the abbey of St. Evroult, upon the <lb/>
            terms that, upon the death of the canons, or their avoidance <lb/>
            from any other cause, they should be succeeded by monks: <lb/>
            which was carried into effect. For two of the canons who <lb/>
            had been instituted to the portion held by Hugh, taking <lb/>
            their departure, monks were appointed in their place, and <lb/>
            have continued in possession of a moiety of the preferment <lb/>
            to the present day ; Robert the Bald, Ralph de la Roussière, <lb/>
            and John de Beaunai, and other excellent men, resided <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>On a certain occasion there was a violent quarrel between <lb/>
            Count Hugh, so often named, and Ralph, count of Mantes, <lb/>
            father-in-law of Philip, king of France,' and Hugh, boldly <lb/>
            encountering the count of Mantes with inferior forces, was <lb/>
            compelled to retreat. In the flight Richard de Heudicourt, <lb/>
            of the Vexin, was wounded; for, urging his horse to full <lb/>
            speed at the ford of the river Epte, he received in his back a <lb/>
            sharp thrust, by the lance of a knight who pursued him. <lb/>
            Being carried by his comrades to Neuf-Marché, and fearing <lb/>
            he should die, by the advice of Count Hugh, to whose family <lb/>
            he was attached by military services, be vowed that in <lb/>
            future he would serve under the monastic rule in the <lb/>
            exercises of virtue. He therefore sent for the monks of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and put himself under the government of Abbot <lb/>
            Osbern. Afterwards, by the mercy of God, who, in <lb/>
            different ways snatches sinners from the pit of de­ <lb/>
            struction, be somewhat recovered his health, though it was <lb/>
            never entirely restored, living for seven years a zealous <lb/>
            member of the order, and benefiting the church in various <note type="footnote"> 1 Ralph, count de Cressi and Valois, married, in 1062, Agnes, wife of <lb/>

            ways. Having neither wife nor child, he, after his being <lb/>
            wounded, voluntarily ceded his patrimony in the Vexin to <lb/>
            the church of St. Evroult, and procured from his uncle <lb/>
            Fulk, and Herbert the butler (who was lord of the fief), as <lb/>
            well as from his other relations, the entire surrender of their <lb/>
            interest in the property. His wound was never entirely <lb/>
            closed, and there issued from it daily, so those who were <lb/>
            witnesses report, as much matter as would fill the egg of a <lb/>
            goose; he zealously observed the conventual rules, and <lb/>
            cheerfully performed the duties of his order. He went <lb/>
            either on foot or on horseback wherever he was ordered, on <lb/>
            the business of the convent, which he forwarded both by <lb/>
            word and deed to the utmost of his ability. In consequence, <lb/>
            Abbot Osbern esteemed him more than the other monks, <lb/>
            and placed entire confidence in him, so that when he planned <lb/>
            the new church, which he commenced building, he made him <lb/>
            the overseer of the works, with the charge of the expenditure, <lb/>
            and the superintendence of the stone-cutters.</p>
          <p>At the instance of this Richard, and by his advice, Abbot <lb/>
            Osbern undertook a journey to France, and made the <lb/>
            acquaintance, through his agreeable conversation, of the <lb/>
            eloquent Robert, and of Herbert de Serranz, and Fulk de <lb/>
            Chaudri, with other knights and persons of inferior rank in <lb/>
            the Vexin, and took possession of the domain of Heudicourt <lb/>
            for the abbey of St. Evroult, with the consent and <lb/>
            approbation of the aforesaid nobles and their neighbours. <lb/>
            On his return he took to his bed, and, his sickness <lb/>
            increasing, he caused himself to be carried into the chapter, <lb/>
            and ordered the letter, which, as before mentioned he <lb/>
            addressed to Pope Alexander, to be distinctly read. This <lb/>
            he did that all might clearly understand that he had not <lb/>
            usurped the rights of Abbot Robert, but had undertaken the <lb/>
            government of the abbey against his own wishes, but in <lb/>
            compulsory obedience to the will of others. He then <lb/>
            strengthened the brethren by his exhortations, entreating <lb/>
            them to regard his errors with indulgence, and to cherish his <lb/>
            memory. And so, having made his confession and partaken <lb/>
            of the holy communion of the body of our Lord, he expired, <lb/>
            surrounded by the monks devoutly chanting litanies for him, <lb/>
            on the sixth of the calends of June [27th May],1 having <note type="footnote"> 1 May 27, 1066. </note> <lb/>

            governed the abbey of St. Evroult five years and. three <lb/>
            months. On the morrow, Vitalis, abbot of Bernai, came to <lb/>
            bury his friend, and interred him in the cloister of the <lb/>
            monastery, near the church of St. Peter, prince of the <lb/>
            apostles, from whence, seventeen years afterwards, his <lb/>
            successor Mainer transferred his remains, with the bones of <lb/>
            Witmund, his companion, into the new chapter-house.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1066 [the fourth indiction], in the <lb/>
            month of April, there appeared in the zodiac, for fifteen days <lb/>
            together, a star called a comet,1 which, as clever astrologers, <lb/>
            who have keenly investigated the secrets of nature, assert, <lb/>
            portended a revolution. For Edward, king of England, the <lb/>
            son of ICing Ethelred by Emma, daughter of Richard the <lb/>
            elder, king of Normandy, had died just before,- and Harold, <lb/>
            Earl Godwin's son, had usurped the English throne. Guilty <lb/>
            as be was of perjury, cruelty, and other iniquities, he had <lb/>
            now held it three months, to the great injury of many <lb/>
            persons, inasmuch as his unjust usurpation had occasioned <lb/>
            violent animosities between different families, from which <lb/>
            mothers had to bewail the loss of their sons, and wives of <lb/>
            their husbands. There is no doubt that Edward had <lb/>
            bequeathed the realm of England to his kinsman William, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, announcing it, first by Robert, archbishop <lb/>
            of Canterbury,3 and afterwards by Harold himself, and, with <lb/>
            the consent of the English, making the duke heir to all his <lb/>
            rights.4 Moreover Harold had taken the oath of allegiance <note type="footnote"> 1 This celebrated comet was visible not only throughout the whole of <lb/>
            Europe, but even in China, where it was observed for sixty-seven days. <lb/>
            It appears that it was first seen in the west of Europe, on the evening <lb/>
            of the 24th of April. It is rudely figured on the Bayeux tapestry. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 On the 5th of January, 106G. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Robert Champart, abbot of Jumièges in 1037, was successively bishop <lb/>
            of London in 1044, and archbishop of Canterbury in 1050. Being expelled <lb/>
            from his see by Earl Godwin in 1052, he undertook a journey to Rome to <lb/>
            appeal to the pope, who decided in his favour; but he died at Jumièges on <lb/>
            his return, and was buried there on the gospel, or north, side of the choir. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 "Harold's visit to Normandy, which we are inclined to fix in the <lb/>

            author represents, its design being to obtain the release of his brother and </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            to duke William at Rouen, in the presence of the nobles of <lb/>
            Normandy, and doing him homage had sworn on the holy <lb/>
            relics to all that was required of him.1 After that, the duke <lb/>
            took Harold with him in an expedition against Conan, count <lb/>
            of Brittany,2 presenting him and his retinue with noble war <note type="footnote"> nephew, who had been detained as hostages at the duke's court from the <lb/>
            time of his father, Earl Godwin's, revolt. The assertion that Edward's <lb/>
            intentions were made known to his subjects, and received their concurrence, <lb/>
            is equally unfounded ; but, notwithstanding, we have no sort of doubt of <lb/>
            the reality of Edward's intentions, fomented, probably, by Archbishop <lb/>
            Robert, who became his confidant. It appears quite natural that <lb/>
            Edward, brought up in Normandy, a Norman in heart and manners, and <lb/>
            continually surrounded by Norman ecclesiastics, should prefer bequeathing <lb/>
            his crown to his cousin, with whom he had so many common sympathies, <lb/>
            than to an offset of a family with which he was ever at variance, and his <lb/>
            aversion to which he had never disguised. Our author has seriously erred <lb/>
            in blindly following the Norman traditions regarding the circumstances which <lb/>
            paved the way for the conquest of England. But those are not much <lb/>
            nearer the truth who adopt without discrimination all the counter state­ <lb/>
            ments of the Anglo-Saxon writeis, as is now the fashion." </note><note type="footnote"> The note of the French editors so well represents the state of the case, <lb/>
            that there is little to add from what they seem to suppose an opposite point <lb/>
            of view. There is little doubt of Edward's prepossessions in favour of the <lb/>
            Norman succession, but the assertion of his having given them effect by any <lb/>
            overt act, might have been more distinctly disclaimed. Edward's consti­ <lb/>
            tutional prudence and timidity would prevent its being wrung from him by <lb/>
            the Norman archbishop even in his last moments, nor whatever may have <lb/>
            been the value of either, does the supposed declaration in favour of Harold <lb/>
            rest on a better foundation. </note><note type="footnote"> On the whole, the English writers nearest the times, offer little in <lb/>
            opposition to the account given by the Norman historians. The Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxon Chronicle, Henry of Huntingdon, and Roger of Wendover, observe <lb/>
            a prudent silence, but Florence of Worcester and Roger of Hovenden say <lb/>
            that Edward before his death chose Harold for his successor. Of the three <lb/>
            competitors for the crown, probably Edgar Atheling was the popular <lb/>
            favourite, and Malmsbury states that Edward had actually “recommended <lb/>
            him to the nobility as the nearest to the sovereignty in point of birth." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The fact of William having wrung an oath of fealty from Harold on <lb/>
            the holy relics, is so well attested that it is impossible to dispute it. Harold <lb/>
            himself admitted it in a message to William, reported by Malmesbury, but <lb/>
            took the ground that an obligation contracted under duress was not binding. <lb/>
            Writers agree far less on the place where the ceremony was performed. <lb/>
            Wace makes it Baieux; our author Rouen; but William de Poitiers, a <lb/>
            contemporary historian, is probably right; he fixes it at Bonneville-sur- <lb/>
            Tonque, a palace where the duke often resided, and near the cathedral of <lb/>
            which William de Poitiers was archdeacon. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Conan II., duke of Brittany, 1040—1066. The Baieux tapestry <lb/>

            horses, splendid armour, and other gifts of value, in the <lb/>
            presence of the army. This Englishman was distinguished <lb/>
            by his great size and strength of body, his polished manners, <lb/>
            his firmness of mind and command of words, by a ready wit <lb/>
            and a variety of excellent qualities. But what availed so <lb/>
            many valuable gifts, when good faith, the foundation of all <lb/>
            virtues, was wanting? Returning to his country, his am­ <lb/>
            bition tempted him to aspire to the crown, and to forfeit <lb/>
            the fealty he had sworn to his lord. He imposed upon King <lb/>
            Edward, who was in the last stage of decay, approaching his <lb/>
            end, by the account he gave of his crossing the sea, his <lb/>
            journey to Normandy, and the result of his mission, falsely <lb/>
            adding that Duke William would give him his daughter in <lb/>
            marriage,1 and concede to him, as his son-in-law, all his right <lb/>
            to the throne of England. The feeble prince was much <lb/>
            surprised at this statement; however, he believed it, and <lb/>
            granted all the crafty tyrant asked.</p>
          <p>Some time afterwards, King Edward, of pious memory, <lb/>
            died at London on the nones [fifth] of January, in the <lb/>
            twenty-fourth year of his reign, and was interred in the new <lb/>
            monastery which he had just built on the western side of <lb/>
            the city, and at the consecration of which he had been pre­ <lb/>
            sent the week before. His body was laid near the altar <lb/>
            which St. Peter the apostle had blessed with the working of <lb/>
            miracles in the time of Mellitus, bishop of London. On the <lb/>
            very day of the funeral, when the people were bathed in <lb/>
            tears for the loss of their beloved king, Harold caused <lb/>
            himself to be crowned by Archbishop Stigand alone,2 <lb/>
            though the pope had suspended him from his functions for <lb/>
            certain crimes, without the concurrence of any other bishops <lb/>
            and the earls and barons of the realm. When the English <lb/>
            were apprized of the bold usurpation effected by Harold, <lb/>
            they were very indignant and some of the most powerful <lb/>
            lords, resolved on an obstinate resistance, refused to offer <note type="footnote"> 1 This part of Harold's statement which alleges his being affianced to <lb/>

            free themselves from the yoke imposed upon them, which <lb/>
            soon became firmly fixed, and, on the other hand, consider­ <lb/>
            ing that they could neither depose him, nor while he held <lb/>

            advantage of the realm, submitted to the usurpation, conso­ <lb/>
            lidating the power which he had already established. - In a <lb/>
            short time the throne which had been iniquitously seized <lb/>
            was stained by horrible crimes.</p>
          <p>The earls Edwin and Morcar, sons of Algar the first of <lb/>
            the English earls, were attached by the strictest ties to <lb/>
            Harold, and employed all their efforts to support his cause, <lb/>
            he having married their sister Edith, who had been the <lb/>
            queen of Griffith a powerful king of Wales, to whom she <lb/>
            bore Blethyn, his successor, and a daughter named Nesta.1 <lb/>
            Tostig, however, Earl Godwin's son, finding that his brother's <lb/>
            enterprise proved successful, and that the kingdom of <lb/>
            England was subject to great oppression, was much dis­ <lb/>
            tressed, and determined to oppose him and even to levy war <lb/>
            against him. Wherefore Harold violently deprived him of <lb/>
            his father's earldom, which as eldest son he had held for <lb/>
            sometime during the reign of Edward2 and drove him into <lb/>
            exile. Tostig, thus banished, took refuge in Flanders, <lb/>
            where be committed his wife Judith to the care of his <lb/>
            father-in-law Baldwin, earl of Flanders, and then hastening to <lb/>
            Normandy strongly remonstrated with Duke William for <note type="footnote"> 1 Edith was not married to Griffith-ap-Llewellyn, king of North Wales, <lb/>
            but he had a daughter named Nesta, who after running off with Fleance, <lb/>

            Stewart married Trahern-ap-Caradoc, who succeeded Griffith after the <lb/>
            death of that king's brothers, Blethyn and Rhywallon. Our author appears <lb/>
            to have mistaken Blethyn for a son of Griffith, because he was his imme­ <lb/>

            beauty. She is called in the Domesday Book Ecleva pulchra, Edeva <lb/>
            faira, while the name of Edded regina is reserved for the widow of Edward <lb/>
            the Confessor. Nesta had a daughter of her own name, who married Ber­ <lb/>

            which he was expelled in 1065 by the indignation of the inhabitants at his <lb/>
            murders and exactions. It was at Bruges that he placed his wife under her <lb/>

            suffering his perjured vassal to usurp the crown of England, <lb/>
            which he pledged himself the duke would secure if he <lb/>
            crossed the channel with a Norman army. These princes <lb/>
            had been long attached to each other, having married two <lb/>
            sisters, through whom their regard was frequently revived. <lb/>
            William therefore received his companion with open arms, <lb/>
            and thanking him for his friendly suggestions, and roused by <lb/>
            his exhortations, assembled the barons of Normandy to <lb/>
            consult with them publicly on what was to be done with <lb/>
            regard to an enterprise of such vast importance.</p>
          <p>At that time Normandy was favoured by possessing many <lb/>
            accomplished prelates and illustrious nobles. Maurilius, <lb/>
            who from a monk became a metropolitan, was archbishop of <lb/>
            Rouen; Odo, the duke's uterine brother, was bishop of <lb/>
            Baieux ; Hugh, brother of Robert Count d'Eu, was bishop of <lb/>
            Lisieux ; William of Evreux; Geoffrey of Coutances ; John, <lb/>
            son of Ralph, count of Bayeux, was bishop of Avranches ; <lb/>
            and Ivo, son of William de Belesme, of Seez.1 All these <lb/>
            prelates were distinguished by the splendour of their noble <lb/>
            extraction, their zeal for religion, and their many excellencies.</p>
          <p>Foremost in the ranks of the laity stood Richard, count <lb/>
            of Evreux, son of Archbishop Robert; Count Robert, son <lb/>

            distinction, and whose native sagacity and decision in coun­ <lb/>
            cil were not inferior to the matured virtues of the Roman <lb/>

            fatigable constancy, and the talent and courage they em­ <lb/>
            ployed in conquering their enemies.</p>
          <p>All these were summoned by the duke's command to a <lb/>
            general consultation; and upon an affair of so much import­ <lb/>
            ance being submitted to their consideration, opinions were <lb/>
            divided according to the differences in men's minds, The <lb/>
            more daring spirits, willing to flatter the duke's ambition, <lb/>
            encouraged their comrades to plunge into the contest, and <lb/>
            were for engaging in so great an enterprise without hesi­ <lb/>
            tation. Others were opposed to an undertaking of so <lb/>
            much difficulty, pointing out to those who were too venture­ <lb/>
            some, and were running headlong to destruction, its great <lb/>
            inconveniences and perils; they magnified the obstacles <lb/>
            presented by the want of a fleet and the dangers of the <lb/>
            voyage, and alleged that a handful of Normans were une­ <lb/>
            qual to the conquest of the numerous hosts of the English.1 <lb/>
            At length the duke sent Gislebert,2 archdeacon of Lisieux, <lb/>
            to Rome, to ask for advice from Pope Alexander on the <lb/>
            state of affairs. On hearing all the circumstances, the pope <lb/>
            favoured the legitimate rights of the duke, enjoined him to <lb/>
            take up arms against the perjurer, and sent him the stand­ <lb/>
            ard of St. Peter the apostle, by whose merits he would be <lb/>
            defended against all dangers.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Tostig received the duke's permission to <lb/>
            return to England, having firmly engaged to assist him, <lb/>
            both in his own person and with all his friends. But as it <lb/>

            turned out very differently from what he expected. For <lb/>
            embarking from the Cotentin,1 he was unable to reach <lb/>
            England. Harold held possession of the channel with a, <lb/>
            large fleet and the coasts with strong bodies of troops, in <lb/>
            order to prevent the enemy from landing in the kingdom be <lb/>
            had treacherously usurped without a severe conflict. Tostig <lb/>
            was therefore in great perplexity, it being out of his power <lb/>
            to make a hostile descent on England with his small force in <lb/>
            the face of innumerable enemies, nor could he direct his <lb/>
            course back to Normandy, the winds being contrary. <lb/>
            Driven to and fro alternately by winds from the west, the <lb/>
            south, and other quarters, he was exposed to great distress <lb/>
            and encountered many perils while wandering over the sea, <lb/>
            until at last, after severe sufferings, be landed in the domi­ <lb/>
            nions of Harold, king of Norway, surnamed Harfager.2 <lb/>
            Being well received by this prince, and perceiving that he <lb/>
            could not fulfil the promises he had made to Duke William, <lb/>
            he altered his plans, and thus addressed him: " Great king, <lb/>
            I come a suppliant to your highness, offering myself and <lb/>
            my faithful services to your majesty, in the hopes that, by <lb/>
            your aid, I may be restored to my hereditary rights. My <lb/>
            brother Harold, who in truth ought to submit to me as his <lb/>
            elder brother, has treacherously magnified himself against <lb/>
            me, and even presumed, at the price of perjury, to usurp <lb/>
            the English crown. Knowing therefore, your pre-eminence <lb/>
            in power, and in forces, and every excellence, I earnestly <lb/>
            entreat you, as one prepared to do you homage, to render <lb/>
            me your powerful assistance. Humble the pride of my <lb/>
            perfidious brother by a hostile invasion of England; and <lb/>
            reserving one half of it for yourself, confer the other on me, <lb/>
            who will thenceforth preserve my fealty to you unbroken as <lb/>
            long as I live." The ambitious king was highly pleased <lb/>
            at this proposal. He immediately ordered an army to be <lb/>
            assembled, warlike engines to be prepared, and the royal <lb/>
            fleet was, during the six months following, completely <lb/>
            equipped. The exiled wanderer encouraged the Norwegian <lb/>
            king to this great enterprise, and by this skilful change in <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably from Barfleur, about the time of the spring equinox. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Harold Harfager, or Hare-foot, was contemporary with Rollo, and <lb/>

            his plans, while it flattered the king and saved himself from <lb/>
            being treated as a spy, afforded him the opportunity of <lb/>
            obtaining revenge for his banishment by his faithless bro­ <lb/>
            ther.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the marquis of Normandy was making pre­ <lb/>
            parations for his own enterprise, uninformed of the disasters <lb/>
            which had befallen his precursor, and had driven him north­ <lb/>
            ward so far out of his intended course. A fleet of ships <lb/>
            was carefully fitted out in Normandy, supplied with all <lb/>
            necessaries, in building which both the clergy and laity <lb/>
            rivalled each other in contributing both funds and labour.1 <lb/>
            Large bodies of troops were raised by a general levy <lb/>
            throughout Normandy. Reports of the expedition drew <lb/>
            many valiant men from the neighbouring countries, who <lb/>
            prepared their arms for battle. Thus the French and Bre­ <lb/>
            tons, the Poitevins and Burgundians, and other people on <lb/>
            this side the Alps, flocked together for the war over the <lb/>
            sea, and scenting the booty which the conquest of Britain <lb/>
            offered, were prepared to undergo the various perils and <lb/>
            chances, both by sea and land, attending the enterprise. <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Poitiers tells us that the duke's fleet, assembling at Dive, <lb/>
            sailed from thence to St. Valeri-sur-Somme; and it is therefore probable <lb/>
            that his ships were built and fitted out at Dive and the neighbouring ports. <lb/>
            Taylor has published a curious MS. containing an account of the number <lb/>
            furnished by the duke's principal vassals, lay and ecclesiastic. In this <lb/>
            muster-roll, William Fitz-Osbern, and Hugh d'Avranches, and Roger de <lb/>
            Montgomery, each figure for sixty ships; Hugh de Montfort for fifty ships <lb/>
            and sixty knights; and the other barons for lesser numbers, varying pro­ <lb/>
            bably according to their means and zeal. Among the quota supplied by <lb/>
            ecclesiastics, we find Remi, afterwards made bishop of Lincoln, on the list, <lb/>
            with the modest contribution of one ship and twenty knights, while <lb/>
            Nicholas, abbot of St. Ouen, a cousin-german of the duke's, contributed <lb/>
            twenty ships and one hundred knights, and Odo, bishop of Baieux, the <lb/>
            duke's uterine brother, no less than one hundred ships, the largest number <lb/>
            furnished by any individual except Robert, earl of Mortagne, also the <lb/>
            duke's brother, whose quota was one hundred and twenty. The whole <lb/>
            number enumerated mounts up to 782. William of Jumieges says that <lb/>
            William's fleet consisted of 3000 vessels, which must be a great exaggera­ <lb/>
            tion, small as most of them probably were. Guy of Amiens reckons 400 <lb/>
            ships with large sails, and 1000 transports. The duchess Matilda furnished <lb/>
            the vessel in which the duke himself embarked. It was called the Mora, <lb/>
            and had for its figure-head the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its <lb/>
            right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory.. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> H H </note></p><pb n="466"/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XII. Mainier appointed abbot of St. Evroult, and Lanfranc of St. Ouen—A new church and other buildings erected at St. Evroult—The monks farm and reclaim a barren estate in the Vexi.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHILE these transactions were taking place, Osbern, abbot <lb/>
            of St. Evroult, departed this life, as already related, and the <lb/>
            chapter of the monks consulted the duke, before he crossed <lb/>
            the sea, about appointing a successor. He was then hold­ <lb/>
            ing a council of his nobles at Bonneville.1 In consequence, <lb/>
            by the advice of Bishop Hugh and other prudent counsellors, <lb/>
            he chose the prior Mainier, and invested him with the <lb/>
            temporalities of the abbey by the delivery of the pastoral <lb/>
            staff, commanding him to have the forms which should com- <lb/>
            Init to him the cure of souls duly complied with; all which <lb/>
            he willingly performed.</p>
          <p>On the same day,2 the duke commanded the lord Lan­ <lb/>
            franc, prior of Bee, to appear before him, and gave him the <lb/>
            abbey which he himself had just nobly founded at Caen in <lb/>
            honour of St. Stephen the proto-martyr. Lanfranc was <lb/>
            therefore the first abbot of Caen, but shortly afterwards he <lb/>
            was promoted to the archbishopric of Canterbury. He <lb/>
            was a native of Lombardy, deeply versed in the knowledge <lb/>
            of the liberal arts, gifted with benevolence, generosity, and <lb/>
            all the sacred virtues, and ceaselessly intent on almsgiving <lb/>
            and other good works. Indeed, from the day already men­ <lb/>
            tioned, when at Bonneville he was first raised to rule in <lb/>
            the church, for twenty-two years and nine months he was <lb/>
            nobly distinguished for the good to multitudes of the faith­ <lb/>
            ful in the house of God.</p>
          <p>By the duke's command, the venerable Bishop Hugh <lb/>
            conducted Mainier, the Lord's servant, to St. Evroult, and <lb/>
            there consecrated him according to the statutes of the <lb/>
            canons before the altar of St. Peter the apostle, on the <lb/>
            seventeenth of the calends of August [July 16th]. Mainier, <lb/>
            having thus taken on him the name and office of abbot, <note type="footnote"> 1 This place is mentioned in a note to ch. xi. as a favourite residence of <lb/>
            the duke. It was the most centrically situated of all his palaces, and was <lb/>
            very convenient at this time for superintending and hastening the equipment <lb/>
            of his fleet. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Probably at the end of June, or the beginning of July, 1066. </note> <lb/>

            lived worthily, administering the government twenty-two <lb/>
            years and seven months with great usefulness, for, by God's <lb/>
            help, he made great improvements in the monastery com­ <lb/>
            mitted to him, both within and without. He skilfully <lb/>
            succeeded, by his kindness of manner and reasonable argu­ <lb/>
            ments, in satisfying the brethren who were somewhat dis­ <lb/>
            turbed at his election. They had selected for their <lb/>
            governors two monks, eminent for their piety and their <lb/>
            erudition of both sorts, Reginald de la Roche and Fulk de <lb/>
            Guernauville, and were, therefore, at no little variance with <lb/>
            the abbot who was set over them, without their concur­ <lb/>
            rence, by the bishop and their neighbours. Often, on occa­ <lb/>
            sions of this sort, disturbances are made by the worst of <lb/>
            persons; for while the perverse strive earnestly to give the <lb/>
            preference to their own opinions, regular order and sounder <lb/>
            counsels are hindered. But Almighty Gael extends his <lb/>
            powerful protection to his church in all difficulties, cor­ <lb/>
            recting those who are in error, and mercifully lending the <lb/>
            aid which is needed, in the manner and by the persons he <lb/>
            seeth fit. His good providence it was, as will hereafter <lb/>
            plainly appear, which raised Mainier to the government of <lb/>
            the abbey of St. Evroult, standing as it did in a barren <lb/>
            territory and surrounded by most worthless neighbours. <lb/>
            Mainier was born in the adjoining town of Echalltour, he <lb/>
            was an accomplished scholar in grammar, dialectics, and <lb/>
            rhetoric; skilful and severe in eradicating vices, he was <lb/>
            zealous in inculcating virtue among the brethren. A dill­ <lb/>
            gent observer of the monastic rule, he pointed out the way <lb/>
            of life both by word and deed to those who were committed <lb/>
            to his charge, and encouraged many to work in the Lord's <lb/>
            vineyard, both by being their leader and their anxious COIn­ <lb/>
            panion.</p>
          <p>Maimer began building the new church dedicated to St. <lb/>
            Mary, mother of God, St. Peter the apostle, and St. Evroult <lb/>
            the confessor, in which are seven altars consecrated to the <lb/>
            divine majesty in honour of his saints. For the old church <lb/>
            which St. Evroult had founded in honour of the prince of <lb/>
            the apostles, when Chilperic and his nephew Hildebert were <lb/>
            kings of the Franks was much dilapidated by the great <note type="footnote"> 1 It has been remarked before, that St. Evroult retired to the vast <lb/>

            age, and was too small for the number of the monks, which <lb/>
            was continually increasing. A building of stone at Ouche <lb/>
            is a very laborious undertaking, because the quarry of <lb/>
            Merlerault from whence the hewn stones are brought, is six <lb/>
            miles distant. 1 The overseer of the work had therefore the <lb/>
            greatest difficulty to procure horses, oxen, and carts, for the <lb/>
            transport of the masses of stone and other materials re­ <lb/>
            quired for so large a work. This abbot had not a moment's <lb/>
            repose during the whole time of his rule ; but by his great <lb/>
            anxiety for numerous objects, rendered important services, <lb/>
            both to the community then governed by him and their <lb/>
            successors. By God's help and the contributions and <lb/>
            munificence of the brethren and his friends he completed <lb/>
            the building of a spacious and beautiful church, conveniently <lb/>
            adapted for celebrating divine service, a dormitory and re­ <lb/>
            fectory, kitchen, and cellar, with other necessary offices for <lb/>
            the use of the monks. Among others, Lanfranc, archbishop <lb/>
            of Canterbury, when he assisted at the consecration of the <lb/>
            church of Caen, in the twelfth year after the war with <lb/>
            England,2 remitted to abbot Mainier twenty-four pounds of <lb/>
            English money and two marks of gold, and he afterwards sent <lb/>
            over from Canterbury forty pounds sterling by the hands <lb/>
            of the lord Roger de Sap, who was known and esteemed by <lb/>
            him for his learning. With these donations the abbey <lb/>
            tower was carried up, and the dormitory for the monks <lb/>
            built. Queen Matilda gave a rich mitre and cope for divine <lb/>
            service, and one hundred pounds of Rouen currency to <lb/>
            build the refectory. William de Ros, clerk of Baieux, who <lb/>
            held three dignities in that church, being precentor, dean, <lb/>
            and archdeacon,3 gave forty pounds sterling to the monks <lb/>
            of St. Evroult. Not long afterwards he voluntarily relin­ <note type="footnote"> of December, 596. If he built his church during the reigns of Cliilderic <lb/>
            and his nephew Childebert, it must have been some time between the year <lb/>
            575, when Childeric succeeded his father, and the autumn of 534, in which <lb/>
            Childebert was assassinated. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The quarries of Merlerault here mentioned are about 9000 toises from <lb/>

            and alms were appointed for him as if he had been a brother <lb/>
            there professed. It was by the help of these and other <lb/>
            contributors that the fabric of the new church was raised, <lb/>
            and the work begun both in that and the abbey buildings <lb/>
            was nobly finished.</p>
          <p>During the government of abbot Mainier, ninety monks <lb/>
            of various ranks and conditions, whose names are inscribed <lb/>
            in the general register, put off the secular habit in the <lb/>
            school of St. Evroult, and inspired by the counsels and <lb/>
            example of excellent men, undertook to walk in the difficult <lb/>
            path which leads to salvation. Some of these obtained the <lb/>
            prize of their holy conversation during the lifetime of their <lb/>
            venerable father ; others remained longer in their religious <lb/>
            course steadfastly maintaining a protracted contest, and <lb/>
            striving to render themselves acceptable to God by their <lb/>
            prayers, and useful to men by their good works. Some who <lb/>
            were of noble families contributed largely to the support of <lb/>
            the monastery, and procured from their relations, acquaint­ <lb/>
            ance, and friends, donations of tithes and churches and <lb/>
            ecclesiastical ornaments for the use of the brethren. It is <lb/>
            quite out of my power to describe particularly the gifts <lb/>
            made by each individual to their cherished abbey, but I wish <lb/>
            with God's help, to record some of them faithfully, as far <lb/>
            as my opportunities of reference permit, for the general <lb/>
            good and the information of posterity.</p>
          <p>Roger de Hautrive, the senior monk, by order of abbot <lb/>
            Rainier, went into the Vexin to take possession of Heudi­ <lb/>
            court, the domain which the wounded knight gave to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, as I have before related, but he found the land <lb/>
            uncultivated, and almost a desert. In the first place he <lb/>
            erected an oratory with boughs of trees in honour of St. <lb/>
            Nicholas, bishop of Myrrha., from whence the village which <lb/>
            now stands on the spot is called by the inhabitants to this <lb/>
            day the chapel of St. Nicholas. It often happened in the <lb/>
            night that while Roger de Hautrive, as he himself used to <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            relate, was singing matins in his chapel of boughs a wolf <lb/>
            took his station without, and as it were, responded to the <lb/>
            chant by his bowlings. This venerable man, divinely sup­ <lb/>
            ported, attached to himself by ties of regard Herbert the <lb/>
            Butler, who after the death of his cousin Herbert, who was <lb/>
            brother of Richard the wounded knight, gave one moiety <lb/>
            of his fief to St. Evroult. There Roger de Hautrive <lb/>
            laboured, with the assistance of his generous friend, until <lb/>
            he had brought under cultivation the land which for a long <lb/>
            season had been deserted on account of the war and other <lb/>
            calamities; and there Roger de Sap, after some years suc­ <lb/>
            ceeding the former senior monk, began the building of a <lb/>
            church of stone. The before mentioned knight (Herbert <lb/>
            the Butler) had great power in the Vexin, and being pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of great wealth and surrounded by sons and valiant <lb/>
            relations and kinsman was exalted above almost all his <lb/>
            neighbours. His wife's name was Rolande, daughter of <lb/>
            Odo de Chaumont, who bore him Godfrey and Peter, John <lb/>
            and Walo, with several daughters, by whom he had a <lb/>
            numerous posterity. The father and brothers of whom we <lb/>
            are speaking were all knights of distinguished courage, and, <lb/>
            as far as outward appearances, of approved conduct both <lb/>
            towards God and man. The mother has been all her life of <lb/>
            exemplary virtue, being still living, though her husband and <lb/>
            children are numbered with the dead. By the kindness <lb/>
            and assistance of this family, the chapel of St. Nicholas, the <lb/>
            bishop, was erected, with a convenient house for the monks, <lb/>
            who live regularly and cultivate peace; and so it remains to <lb/>
            the present day.</p>
          <p>At the same time Fulk, SOIl of Ralph de Chaudrei, had <lb/>
            the greatest regard for the venerable Roger [de Hautrive] <lb/>
            on account of his many virtues, so that be begged him <lb/>
            kindly to be sponsor for his son at the holy font of baptism, <lb/>
            which he willingly undertook. Their acquaintance and <lb/>
            regard gradually increasing, he granted to his gossip the <lb/>
            church of St. Martin de Parnes, the parish church, at which <lb/>
            a congregation was assembled from seven neighbouring vil­ <lb/>
            lages on appointed days to offer prayers to God, and to hear <lb/>
            his praises and precepts in a becoming manner. The <lb/>
            worthy father coming to Parnes, Fulk, with the consent of <lb/>
            Wascelin his brother, gave to St. Evroult the church with <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            all the dues belonging to it, and one plough-land in the <lb/>
            same vill, and the tithes of his plough, with two houses and <lb/>
            one mill called Barre-chemin. He also gave to the monks <lb/>
            the archdeaconry which he held in fee of the archbishop of <lb/>
            Rouen by inheritance from his ancestors, and he also <lb/>
            granted to the monks the lordship of all the householders in <lb/>
            Parnes, on condition that if they made any defeasance to the <lb/>
            lords, they should not forfeit their houses, but be mulct in <lb/>
            some other way. The inhabitants of Parnes1 were delighted <lb/>
            at having the monks for their lords, hoping that under their <lb/>
            protection they should be safe from the inroads of the Nor­ <lb/>
            mans in the neighbourhood, from which they frequently <lb/>
            suffered. In the course of time, when Goisbert the phy­ <lb/>
            sician was prior, Fulk gave the ground for the cemetery to <lb/>
            promote the building of a new church. The foundations <lb/>
            were then laid, but the work proceeded slowly through many <lb/>
            hindrances for twenty-four years, and is not yet completed.2 <lb/>
            Fulk, the knight I am now speaking of, was brave and <lb/>
            high-spirited, ardent in all his enterprises, irascible and fierce <lb/>
            when roused to arms. He was very ready to lay violent hands <lb/>
            on the property of others, and imprudently scatter his own <lb/>
            in order to gain the empty honour of being accounted <lb/>
            liberal. He took to wife Ita, daughter of Heremar de Pon­ <lb/>
            toise, by whom he bad Walter and Maimer, Hugh and <lb/>
            Grervase, Hermar and Fulk, with a daughter named Luxovie. <lb/>
            Maimer and Fulk were devoted from their infancy to a mo­ <lb/>
            nastic life, but the other four sons followed the career of <lb/>
            arms.</p>
          <p>Fulk's character being, as I have observed, so unstable, <lb/>
            he sometimes honoured the monks, and stoutly defended <lb/>
            them against all adversaries, while at other times he griev­ <lb/>
            ously oppressed them. There lived at Parnes, serving God <lb/>
            under the monastic rule, the old Roger and Goisbert the <lb/>
            physician, Robert the Bald, John and Isemberd, with several <lb/>
            others, of whom Bernard, surnamed Michael, and Reginald, <note type="footnote"> 1 Pames, near St. Clair-sur-Epte. See note on the vassals of the <lb/>
            church, b. iii. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The date to be assigned to the erection of this remarkable church is a <lb/>
            question of some importance in the history of art, as the apse, like that of <lb/>
            St. Clair-sur-Epte, is polygonal, and not semicircular, a rare occurrence in <lb/>
            the churches of Normandy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            Theodoric, and Walter the Bald, with William of Caen, sur­ <lb/>
            named Alexander, after spending their lives devoted to pious <lb/>
            offices, ended them there, and were there interred with great <lb/>
            veneration. The grant of all that Fulk gave to the monks <lb/>
            was confirmed by Robert the Eloquent, of Chaumont, who <lb/>
            had the lordship in chief. Not long afterwards, while this <lb/>
            Robert was carrying off the booty which he had collected <lb/>
            with violence on the lands of St. Ouen, he fell from his <lb/>
            horse in full armour, and, his helmet fixing in the ground, <lb/>
            broke his neck and he perished miserably. His body was in­ <lb/>
            terred by abbot Maimer near L'Aillerie in the chapter-house <lb/>
            of the monks of Flavigni, residing there. His sons Osmond <lb/>
            do Chaumont, Guazon de Poix, and Robert de Beauvais, <lb/>
            confirmed to St. Evroult all that their ancestors had given <lb/>
            and granted to the abbey, as before related.</p>
          <p>In this manner the monks of St. Evroult obtained the <lb/>
            church of Fames, which was a very ancient structure dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to St. Martin, metropolitan [archbishop] of Tours, and <lb/>
            in which the remains of St. Judoc, confessor of Christ, are <lb/>
            reverently preserved to the present day. Who he was, and <lb/>
            whence he came, I shall briefly write in a short passage of <lb/>
            this history, faithfully making extracts from a book contain­ <lb/>
            ing an account of his holy life.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>[ABOUT A. D. 650.] The blessed Judoc,1 SOIl of Juthail <lb/>
            [Howel], king of the Bretons and brother of King Judicail,2 <lb/>
            being sought for to be elevated to the throne, relinquished <lb/>
            the pursuit of learning to which he had devoted himself at <lb/>
            Llanmelmon, and went in pilgrimage to Rome with four <lb/>
            others. However Haymon, duke of Ponthieu, recognising <lb/>
            his noble origin, detained him on the road, and having had <lb/>
            him ordained priest, made him his chaplain. After seven <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Judoc, or Josse, priest and confessor. His death is fixed on the <lb/>
            13th of December, about the year 668. There is an older and more <lb/>
            complete account of his life in the Acta SS. Ord. S. Benidicti, sæc. ii., <lb/>
            which seems to have furnished our author with the materials for his <lb/>
            abridged history of the saint. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Juthail, or Hoel III., who died in 602. Judicail, his son, abdicated <lb/>
            in 638, and died in the odour of sanctity the 7th of December, 658. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            years Judoc became a hermit at La Broie on the river Autio, <lb/>
            where he served God eight years, and fed with the hand <lb/>
            several sorts of birds and small fishes, like domestic animals. <lb/>
            At one time when he had only one loaf, and divided it <lb/>
            among four poor persons, in spite of the remonstrances of <lb/>
            his servant Vulmar, God sent him four small boats laden <lb/>
            with provisions on the river Autio. He afterwards built an <lb/>
            oratory in honour of St. Martin at Runiac on the river <lb/>
            Canche,1 where he lived fourteen years. One day an eagle <lb/>
            carried off eleven hens, and the cock last; the man of God <lb/>
            made the sign of the cross accompanied by a prayer, when <lb/>
            the eagle, shortly returning, brought back the cock and <lb/>
            presently expired. Once when Judoc, in company with Duke <lb/>
            Haimon, was searching for a suitable habitation in -a thick <lb/>
            wood, the duke was very thirsty, and weary with hunting he <lb/>
            fell asleep, during which the man of God planted his <lb/>
            walking staff in the ground and offering a prayer, a spring <lb/>
            burst forth on the spot. Sick folk resort there and vene­ <lb/>
            rating the saint, drink the water, and are quickly cured. The <lb/>
            servant of God constructed in the wood with his own hands <lb/>
            two oratories of timber; one he dedicated to St. Peter the <lb/>
            bearer of the keys of heaven, the other to the eloquent <lb/>
            St. Paul. He afterwards went to Rome, from whence he <lb/>
            brought back many relics of saints. Juliula, a young girl <lb/>
            who was blind from her infancy, was admonished by a vision <lb/>
            to bathe her eyes in the water wherewith Judoc had <lb/>
            washed his hands, and upon her so doing recovered her <lb/>
            sight. This happened while the man of God was returning <lb/>
            from Home, and a cross of wood being raised on the spot the <lb/>
            place was called La Croix.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in the absence of Judoc at Rome, Duke <lb/>
            Haimon caused a church of stone to be erected in the wil­ <lb/>
            derness where the hermit had dwelt, and on his return <lb/>
            caused it to be dedicated to the honour of St. Martin, and <lb/>
            gave for its endowment a certain vill in his domains, with all <lb/>
            its appurtenances. Judoc, the. faithful champion for God, <lb/>
            there maintained a long warfare, and after happily ending <lb/>
            the course of his holy life departed to Christ on the ides <lb/>
            [13th] of December. <note type="footnote"> 1 Near Montreuil, at a place now called St. Josse, from an abbey <lb/>
            dedicated to that saint which was built there in course of time. </note> <pb n="474"/>
             </p>
          <p>His two nephews, Winoch and Arnoch, succeeded him, <lb/>
            and were accustomed frequently to wash the body and clip <lb/>
            the hair of the holy man whose remains long continued to <lb/>
            show no tokens of decay. Drochtric, Duke Haimon's <lb/>
            successor, had often heard this, but be did not believe it. <lb/>
            Rashly determined, therefore, to investigate the matter, he <lb/>
            caused the sacred tomb to be burst open, and looking in, <lb/>
            started back in terror, exclaiming, "Ah! holy Judoc!" <lb/>
            He became instantly deaf and dumb, and his whole body <lb/>
            was paralyzed to the day of his death. His wife, struck <lb/>
            with alarm at her husband's calamity, poured forth lamenta­ <lb/>
            tions to God, and for the salvation of his soul gave the two <lb/>
            villages of Crespiniac and Netreville to St. Judoc. These <lb/>
            events took place in the time of Dagobert, son of Lothaire <lb/>
            the Great, king of the Franks.</p>
          <p>Isembard of Fleuri,1 at the command of Abbot Herbald, <lb/>
            wrote to Adelelm the monk, that the body of St. Judoc <lb/>
            was discovered in the year of our Lord 977, during the <lb/>
            reign of Lothaire, son of Lewis, king of France, in the <lb/>
            following manner. A certain peasant, named Stephen, who <lb/>
            gained his livelihood by being a miller, being admonished in <lb/>
            a dream by one clothed in bright robes left his wife and <lb/>
            children, and went to the place where St. Judoc was interred, <lb/>
            and there became a clerk. No man living then knew the <lb/>
            spot where the body of the saint lay, but Stephen, inspired <lb/>
            by the vision, began to search within the church, and at <lb/>
            the suggestion of Pridian Sigeman, he found the coffin on <lb/>
            the right side of the altar of St. Martin. Thereupon, <lb/>
            amidst general rejoicings, and while hymns of thanksgiving <lb/>
            were sung to God, the coffin containing the body of the <lb/>
            saint was disinterred, and lifted from the grave. The news <lb/>
            of the discovery was quickly spread, and multitudes of <lb/>
            people hastened to witness the disinterment of the holy <lb/>
            remains, and to make their prayers and offerings to the <lb/>
            saint. Many miracles were wrought on the spot, and <lb/>
            diseases of various descriptions were there cured. At last, <lb/>
            on the eighth of the calends of August [ July 25th,] the <note type="footnote">1 Isembard, a monk of Fleuri, flourished in the latter part of the tenth <lb/>
            and the beginning of the eleventh century. On the discovery and trans­ <lb/>
            lation of the body of St. Josse in 977, the monks of his abbey requested <lb/>
            this writer to compose a life of their patron saint. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            body of St. Judoc, was deposited with great reverence over <lb/>
            the altar of St. Martin.</p>
          <p>The very same year, the foundations of a monastery were <lb/>
            laid on that spot, means were taken for settling the order <lb/>
            of monks, and the venerable Sigebrand was appointed abbot. <lb/>
            One night, while the body of St. Judoc was deposited in the <lb/>
            church of St. Peter, there were seven tapers before the <lb/>
            remains, one of which only was lighted by the sacristan, but <lb/>
            while the guardians of the holy relics were asleep, the other <lb/>
            six candles were lighted by fire from heaven. So, on <lb/>
            another occasion, when the body of St. Judoc was in his <lb/>
            own church, a lamp which had been extinguished by the <lb/>
            violence of the wind and showers of rain, bad its light mira­ <lb/>
            culously restored in the presence of Sigeman.</p>
          <p>One Sunday, while Pridian was celebrating a solemn <lb/>
            mass, a certain vassal of Count Hilduin, whose name was <lb/>
            Garembert, was full of evil designs, wanting to plunder the <lb/>
            church at his will, and to substitute for Sigeman an abbot <lb/>
            more conformable to his purposes. When, however, it was <lb/>
            read in the gospel for the day: " Why think ye evil in your <lb/>
            hearts ?"1 the wretched man was smote by an invisible hand, <lb/>
            and began to vociferate loudly, and being struck the third <lb/>
            time by the power of God, he fell to the earth, vomiting <lb/>
            clotted blood from his mouth. After mass he was carried <lb/>
            out by order of Sigeman the sacristan,2 and on the morrow, <lb/>
            by the merits of St. Judoc, recovered his reason. This <lb/>
            happened in the time of Hugh the Great.</p>
          <p>The same day, a woman named Ostrehilde was intending <lb/>
            to leave the church after mass, but her feet were so firmly <lb/>
            fixed at the threshold, that no one could release them; she, <lb/>
            however, felt no inconvenience except extreme cold from <lb/>
            her knees to the soles of her feet. The next day she vowed <lb/>
            to become the handmaid of God and St. Judoc; and being <lb/>
            immediately relieved, she piously kept her vow.</p>
          <p>It is related by the monks Adelelm and Richer, faithful <lb/>
            reporters, that while Stephen translated the relics of St. <lb/>

            of the church, the illustrious Bertsende, the marriageable <lb/>

            her feet for two years, so that she could not walk nor even <lb/>
            move without the aid of a staff. Having prayed with faith, <lb/>
            as well as her mother, before the relics of the holy confessor, <lb/>
            she was cured of her infirmity, and her mother was so <lb/>
            rejoiced at her daughter's recovery that she made an offer­ <lb/>
            ing of a rich mantle to the physician who so quickly <lb/>
            answered her prayers.</p>
          <p>While a man named Robert was travelling alone at mid- <lb/>
            day, he saw the spirit of error in the shape of a man, and <lb/>
            was immediately struck blind. A long time afterwards, he <lb/>
            sought the tomb of St. Judoc, and professed himself his <lb/>
            servant before Abbot Guy. The same day blood flowed <lb/>
            freely from his eyes, and he recovered his sight, and at <lb/>
            vespers publicly declared that he could see the monks sitting <lb/>
            on their benches.</p>
          <p>Gunzo, a priest of Lorraine, suffered for seven years <lb/>
            extreme weakness in his hands and feet. Some one who saw <lb/>
            him recommended him to go and find the physician Judoc <lb/>
            in Ponthicu. He hastened to follow this advice. On a <lb/>
            Sunday, about the third hour, he entered the church, and <lb/>
            prayed prostrate on the pavement, which he bedewed with <lb/>
            his tears. Having finished his prayers, he rose up sound. <lb/>
            Then he joined in the mass with great joy, and gave a <lb/>
            faithful account of his recovery to the people, with thanks­ <lb/>
            giving to God.</p>
          <p>Waldemar of Lorraine, having lost his right eye through <lb/>
            sickness, determined, by the advice of his friends, on a <lb/>
            pilgrimage to St. Judoc. But, missing his way, he happened <lb/>
            to light in company with his friend on the fountain which <lb/>
            Judoc in his lifetime had caused by his merits to burst forth. <lb/>
            Waldemar, seeing a fountain of very clear water, called to <lb/>
            his companion to stop, and sat down to rest; presently, he <lb/>
            washed his hands and his face in the fountain, and <lb/>
            suddenly recovered sight in the eye which was blind. <lb/>
            Thus cured, he came joyfully to the monastery, and gave <lb/>
            thanks to God, surrounded by rejoicing friends.</p>
          <p>Two demoniacs, named Maginard, were set free at the <lb/>
            tomb of St. Judoc, and lived long afterwards in the world <lb/>
            with sound minds.</p>
          <p>Sieburg, wife of Bertrand, a man of distinction, having <lb/>
            been subject for ten months to a flow of blood from her <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            nostrils, was conducted by her friends to the shrine of St. <lb/>
            Judoc to obtain a cure. She offered her prayers, but no <lb/>
            relief immediately followed, and she left the church sorrow­ <lb/>
            ful and full of complaints. But when in bitterness of spirit <lb/>
            she had set forth to return home, as she passed a cross set <lb/>
            up by the way-side, the blood ceased to flow from her <lb/>
            nostrils. Immediately turning back, she retraced her steps <lb/>
            to the monastery of the holy man; and her thanksgivings <lb/>
            having been offered, she was entirely healed.</p>
          <p>Robert de Terouenne, going alone at mid-day to oversee <lb/>
            his work in the field, was suddenly seized by the devil, and <lb/>
            tormented to such a degree that he was tempted by the <lb/>
            adversary almost without intermission to destroy everything, <lb/>
            and even to devour men. His three brothers therefore, <lb/>
            having kept the fast of the four seasons in June, brought <lb/>
            , him bound to the tomb of St. Judoc, where they remained <lb/>
            from the fourth day of the week to Saturday. From that <lb/>
            time the afflicted man began to be more tranquil, and being <lb/>
            restored to a sound mind, devoted himself from thenceforth <lb/>
            to the service of St. Judoc. At his request abbot Guy <lb/>
            ascended the pulpit on the feast of St. John the Baptist, <lb/>
            and related the circumstances to the people, pointing out to <lb/>
            them Robert, who was present, and publicly testified his own <lb/>
            deliverance.</p>
          <p>A certain man of ripe years, was for seven years so deaf <lb/>
            that he could hear nothing. His wife brought him to the <lb/>
            tomb of the blessed saint, where he prayed for a while. <lb/>
            Then his wife, by Pridian's order, led him to the fountain of <lb/>
            St. Judoc, and three times sprinkled his head with the <lb/>
            waters of the fountain. Presently, returning to the church <lb/>
            he heard mass, which, for seven years previously he had been <lb/>
            unable to hear.</p>
          <p>Isembard de Fleuri at the request of Adelelm, wrote these <lb/>
            accounts of what happened in the time of Hugh the Great, <lb/>
            or King Robert; but since that time the blessed Judoc has <lb/>
            not ceased to work miracles in favour of those who offered <lb/>
            him their prayers, though from negligence they are not <lb/>
            recorded. The rulers of the kingdom being changed, and <lb/>
            the nobles engaged in mutual quarrels, the body of St. <lb/>
            Judoc was again covered with earth from fear of the enemy, <lb/>
            and lay so long in concealment that all those who were <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            concerned in it forgot where it was deposited. In the time <lb/>
            of Henry, king of France, when the monks often complained <lb/>
            of their not knowing where their patron saint, the blessed <lb/>
            Judoc, rested, the holy remains were divinely revealed to a <lb/>
            simple layman, who, pointing out the spot, they were <lb/>
            solemnly raised under the superintendence of the abbot and <lb/>
            brethren. The monks then admitted the discoverer of the <lb/>
            sacred relics into their order, and made him guardian of the <lb/>
            holy body, committing to his charge the offerings of the <lb/>
            faithful. On the death of the abbot, his successor did not <lb/>
            esteem the sacristan as he ought, nor treat him as <lb/>
            courteously as his predecessor had done. Whereupon the <lb/>
            sacristan, being much aggrieved, got possession of the holy <lb/>
            relics by night and carried them with him into France. <lb/>
            Geoffrey, lord of Gomerfontaine, honourably received him <lb/>
            with the treasure be bore, and appointed him master of the <lb/>
            castle church, in which there were four canons, for the term <lb/>
            of his life. Some time afterwards, wars breaking out, Henry, <lb/>
            king of France, besieged Gomerfontaine with the strength of <lb/>
            the French army, driving out Geoffrey, and setting the place <lb/>
            on fire. But while the devouring flames were consuming the <lb/>
            church and buildings of the castle, and horrible cries were <lb/>
            raised by the assailants and the besieged, as happens at such <lb/>
            times, one of the canons took the bones of St. Judoc from the <lb/>
            tomb, and fled in all haste from the burning edifices. One <lb/>
            of the king's soldiers met him on the bridge, and demanded <lb/>
            of him what was the burden he carried. Upon his answering <lb/>
            that it contained sacred vestments, and his own books, the <lb/>
            soldier violently stripped him of all he carried, and took his <lb/>
            prize with him to the territory of Parnes. The man's name <lb/>
            was Robert, surnamed Meslebren, that is, Mix-bran; he was <lb/>
            one of the retainers of Ralph de Chaudri, who was at that <lb/>
            time one of the best knights in the French army. The <lb/>
            soldier, greatly delighted with the prize he had made, caused <lb/>
            it to be carefully deposited in the church of St. Martin, by <lb/>
            the priest and parishioners, where, for more than seventy <lb/>
            years, it was reverently preserved. Innumerable miracles <lb/>
            were there wrought on the sick, and to this day are <lb/>
            frequently repeated, when the faith of the supplicants merit <lb/>
            relief, as the whole neighbourhood bears witness.</p>
          <p>William de Merlerault, a venerable monk and priest, has <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            composed an excellent work on the translation of the holy <lb/>
            body, of which we have only here given a brief account, <lb/>
            and of the many cures of the sick performed at Parnes. In <lb/>
            this book he truly and clearly relates all the wonderful <lb/>
            occurrences connected with the sacred relics. Philip, king <lb/>
            of France, was afflicted with fever two years, nor could all <lb/>
            the skill of his physicians afford him any relief. At the end <lb/>
            of the two years he came to Parnes, and, drinking water <lb/>
            made holy by touching the relics of St. Judoc, he spent two <lb/>
            nights in prayer before the holy body, and his pains ceased, <lb/>
            and he recovered his health on the spot. In consequence, <lb/>
            the king made an offering to St. Judoc of fifty sous of <lb/>
            Pontoise, and granted a fair, to be held annually at Parnes <lb/>
            in honour of St. Judoc, on the third day of the feast of <lb/>
            Whitsuntide, confirming the grant by a royal charter.1</p>
          <p>Besides these, many other miracles have been wrought, <lb/>
            and continue to be daily performed at Parnes through the <lb/>
            merits of St. Judoc, of which some are recorded, but the <lb/>
            greater part are buried in oblivion, from the negligence of <lb/>
            those who were privy to them, or from the ignorance of those <lb/>
            who saw or experienced them. For my part, though I must <lb/>
            hasten to other matters which claim our attention, I have <lb/>
            most willingly collected some few details relating to you, 0 <lb/>
            holy Judoc, inserting in this imperfect work notices of the <lb/>
            heavenly gifts conferred on you, and devoutly extolling them <lb/>
            so far as my limited powers permit. I beseech you there­ <lb/>
            fore, 0 glorious son of the king of the Bretons, and fellow <lb/>
            of the angels, that you commend me to God by the efficacy <lb/>
            of your merits, and obtain for me admission into the society <lb/>
            of the saints, with whom, contemplating in his glory the <lb/>
            Creator of all things, I may offer triumphant praises through <lb/>
            all ages. Amen. <note type="footnote"> 1 There are no traces in the French historians of this pilgrimage of <lb/>
            Philip I. to Parnes, nor of the grant which resulted from it. We shall, <lb/>
            indeed, find him in the sequel suffering from painful and disgusting disor­ <lb/>
            ders, which were considered as the punishment of his adulterous connexion <lb/>
            with Bertrade de Montfort, but which cannot be identified with the inter­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">On. XIV. Invasion of England by William, duke of Normandy—Battle of Stamford bridge-Battle of Hast­ ings—William marches to Dover—Thence to London, where he is crowned.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the month of August,1 Harold, king of Norway, and <lb/>
            Tostig, with a powerful fleet set sail over the wide sea, and, <lb/>
            steering for England with a favourable aparctic, or north <lb/>
            wind, landed in Yorkshire, which was the first object of their <lb/>
            invasion. Meanwhile, Harold of England, having intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of the descent of the Norwegians, withdrew his ships <lb/>
            and troops from Hastings and Pevensey, and the other sea­ <lb/>
            ports on the coast lying opposite to Neustria, which he had <lb/>
            carefully guarded with a powerful armament during the <lb/>
            whole of the year, and threw himself unexpectedly, with a <lb/>
            strong force by hasty marches on his enemies from the north. <lb/>
            A hard-fought battle ensued, in which there was great <lb/>
            effusion of blood on both sides, vast numbers being slain <lb/>
            with brutal rage. At last the furious attacks of the English <lb/>
            secured them the victory, and the king of Norway as well as <lb/>
            Tostig, with their whole army, were slain.2 The field of <lb/>
            battle may be easily discovered by travellers, as great heaps <lb/>
            of the bones of the slain lie there to this day, memorials of <lb/>
            the prodigious numbers which fell on both sides.</p>
          <p>While however the attention of the English was diverted <lb/>
            by the invasion of Yorkshire, and by God's permission they <lb/>
            neglected, as I have already mentioned, to guard the coast, <lb/>
            the Norman,fleet, which for a whole month had been waiting <lb/>
            for a south wind in the mouth of the river Dive and the <lb/>
            neighbouring harbours, took advantage of a favourable <lb/>
            breeze from the west to gain the roads of St. Valeri.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 This expedition did not sail till the month of September. Tostig <lb/>
            arrived first at the rendezvous in the mouth of the Humber with fifty ships, <lb/>
            but was driven off by Earl Edwin, and being afterwards joined by the king <lb/>
            of Norway on the coast of Scotland, the united fleets sailed up the Humber <lb/>
            to the neighbourhood of York. Huntingdon's History, p. 209. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The battle of Stamford Bridge, in which Harold of Norway and Tostig <lb/>
            fell, was fought on the eve of St. Matthew, 20th of September. The earls <lb/>
            Edwin and Morcar had engaged the enemy five days before at Fulford <lb/>
            Gate, and were defeated, the invaders retaining possession of the city of <lb/>
            York and the neighbouring country. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 St. Valeri-sur-Somme. According to Guy of Amiens, the fleet was </note> <lb/>

            While it lay there innumerable vows and prayers were <lb/>
            offered for the safety of themselves and their friends, and <lb/>
            floods of tears were shed. For the intimate friends and <lb/>
            relations of those who were to remain at home, witnessing <lb/>
            the embarkation of fifty thousand knights and men-at-arms, <lb/>
            with a large body of infantry, who had to brave the dangers <lb/>
            of the sea, and to attack an unknown people on their own <lb/>
            soil, were moved to tears and sighs, and full of anxiety both <lb/>
            for themselves and their countrymen, their minds fluctuating <lb/>
            between fear and hope. Duke William and the whole army <lb/>
            committed themselves to God's protection, with prayers, and <lb/>
            offerings, and vows, and accompanied a procession from the <lb/>
            church, carrying the relics of St. Valeri, confessor of Christ, <lb/>
            to obtain a favourable wind. At last when by God's grace <lb/>
            it suddenly came round to the quarter which was the object <lb/>
            of so many prayers, the duke, full of ardour, lost no time in <lb/>
            embarking the troops, and giving the signal for hastening <lb/>
            the departure of the fleet. The Norman expedition, there­ <lb/>
            fore, crossed the sea on the night of the third of the calends <lb/>
            of October [29th September], which the Catholic church <lb/>
            observes as the feast of St. Michael the archangel, and, <lb/>
            meeting with no resistance, and landing safely on the coast <lb/>
            of England, took possession of Pevensey and Hastings, the <lb/>
            defence of which was entrusted to a chosen body of soldiers, <lb/>
            to cover a retreat and guard the fleet.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the English usurper, after having put to the <lb/>
            sword his brother Tostig, and his royal enemy, and <lb/>
            slaughtered their immense army, returned in triumph to <lb/>
            London. As however worldly prosperity soon vanishes like <lb/>
            smoke before the wind, Harold's rejoicings for his bloody <lb/>
            victory were soon darkened by the threatening clouds of a <lb/>
            still heavier storm. Nor was he suffered long to enjoy the <lb/>
            security procured by his brother's death; for a hasty <lb/>
            messenger brought him the intelligence that the Normans <lb/>
            had embarked.1 Learning soon afterwards that they had <note type="footnote"> detained five days by contrary winds, and as it sailed on Michaelmas Day, <lb/>
            29th of September, it probably assembled at St. Valeri on the 23rd of <lb/>
            that month. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Henry of Huntingdon informs us that Harold received the news of <lb/>
            the disembarcation of the Norman expedition at Hastings on the same day <lb/>
            on which the battle of Stamford Bridge was fought, while he was at dinner </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <lb/>

            actually landed, he made preparations for a fresh conflict. <lb/>
            For his intrepidity was dauntless, and his conduct of affairs <lb/>
            admirable, while his personal strength was great, his <lb/>
            presence commanding, and he had the arts of a persuasive <lb/>
            eloquence, and of a courtesy which endeared him to his <lb/>
            supporters. Still his mother Githa, who was much afflicted <lb/>
            by the death of her son Tostig, and his other faithful <lb/>
            friends, dissuaded him from engaging in battle with the <lb/>
            Normans; his brother, Earl Gurth, thus addressing him: <lb/>
            "It is best, dearest brother and lord, that your courage <lb/>
            should be tempered by discretion. You are worn by the <lb/>
            conflict with the Norwegians from which you are only just <lb/>
            come, and you are in eager haste to give battle to the <lb/>
            Normans. Allow yourself, I pray you, some time for rest. <lb/>
            Reflect also, in your wisdom, on the oath you have taken to <lb/>
            the duke of Normandy. Beware of incurring the guilt of <lb/>
            perjury, lest by so great a crime you draw ruin on yourself <lb/>
            and the forces of this nation, and stain for ever the honour <lb/>
            of our own race. For myself, I am bound by no oaths, I <lb/>
            am under no obligations to Count William. I am therefore <lb/>
            in a position to fight with him undauntedly in defence of <lb/>
            our native soil. But do you, my brother, rest awhile in <lb/>
            peace, and wait the issue of the contest, that so the liberty <lb/>
            which is the glory of England, may not be ruined by your <lb/>
            fall. ”</p>
          <p>Harold was very indignant at this speech. Holding in <lb/>
            contempt the wholesome advice of his friends, he loaded his <lb/>
            brother with reproaches for his faithful counsel, and even <lb/>
            forgot himself so far as to kick his mother when she hung <lb/>
            about him in her too great anxiety to detain him with her. <lb/>
            For six days Harold sent forth the summons to call the <lb/>
            people to arms from all quarters, and, having assembled vast <lb/>
            numbers of the English, he led them by forced marches <lb/>
            against the enemy. It was his design to take them unawares, <lb/>

            sudden onset, and, that they might not escape by sea, he <lb/>
            caused a fleet of seventy ships, full of soldiers, to guard the <lb/>
            coast. Duke William, having intelligence of Harold's <lb/>
            . approach, ordered his troops to take to their arms on the <lb/>
            morning of Saturday.1 He then heard mass, strengthening <lb/>
            both body and soul by partaking of the consecrated host; <lb/>
            he also reverently suspended from his neck the holy relics on <lb/>
            which Harold had sworn. Many of the clergy had followed <lb/>
            the Norman army, among whom were two bishops, Odo, of <lb/>
            Bayeux, and Geoffrey, of Coutances, with attendant clerks <lb/>
            and monks, whose duty it was to aid the war with their <lb/>
            prayers and counsels. The battle commenced at the third' <lb/>
            hour of the ides [14th] of October, and was fought despe­ <lb/>
            rately the whole day, with the loss of many thousand men <lb/>
            on both sides. The Norman duke drew up his light troops, <lb/>
            consisting of archers and men armed with cross-bows, in the <lb/>
            first line; the infantry in armour formed the second rank; <lb/>
            and in the third were placed the cavalry, in the centre of <lb/>
            which the duke stationed himself with the flower of his <lb/>
            troops, so as to be able to issue his commands, and give <lb/>
            support to every part of the army.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the English troops, assembled from all <lb/>
            parts of the neighbourhood, took post at a place which was <lb/>
            anciently called Senlac,2 many of them personally devoted <lb/>
            to the cause of Harold, and all to that of their country, <lb/>
            which they were resolved to defend against the foreigners. <lb/>
            Dismounting from their horses, on which it was determined <lb/>
            not to rely, they formed a solid column of infantry, and thus <lb/>
            stood firm in the position they had taken.</p>
          <p>Turstin, son of Rollo, bore the standard of Normandy.3 <lb/>
            The sound of the trumpets in both armies was the terrible <lb/>
            signal for beginning the battle. The Normans made the <lb/>
            first attack with ardour and gallantry, their infantry rushing <lb/>
            forward to provoke the English, and spreading wounds and <lb/>
            death through their ranks by showers of arrows and bolts. <lb/>

            man straining his powers to the utmost. The battle raged <lb/>
            for some time with the utmost violence between both parties. <lb/>
            At length the indomitable bravery of the English threw the <lb/>
            Bretons, both horse and foot, and the other auxiliary troops <lb/>
            composing the left wing, into confusion, and, in their rout, <lb/>
            they drew with them almost all the rest of the duke's army, <lb/>
            who, in their panic, believed that he was slain. The duke, <lb/>
            perceiving that large bodies from the enemy had broken their <lb/>
            ranks in pursuit of his flying troops, rode up to the fugitives <lb/>
            and checked their retreat, loudly threatening them, and <lb/>
            striking with his lance. Taking off his helmet, and exposing <lb/>
            his naked head, he shouted: “ See, I am here; I am still <lb/>
            living, and, by God's help, shall yet have the victory." Sud­ <lb/>
            denly the courage of the fugitives was restored by these bold <lb/>
            words of the duke; and, intercepting some thousands of <lb/>
            their pursuers, they cut them down in a moment. In this <lb/>
            manner, the Normans, twice again pretending to retreat, <lb/>
            and when they were followed by the English, suddenly <lb/>
            wheeling their horses, cut their pursuers off from the main <lb/>
            body, surrounded and slew them. The ranks of the English <lb/>
            were much thinned by these dangerous feints, through which <lb/>
            they fell separated from each other; so that, when thousands <lb/>
            were thus slaughtered, the Normans attacked the survivors <lb/>
            with still greater vigour. They were charged home by the <lb/>
            troops of Maine, France, Brittany, and Aquitaine, and great <lb/>
            numbers of them miserably perished.</p>
          <p>Among others present at this battle, were Eustace, Count <lb/>
            de Boulogne, William, son of Richard, Count d'Evreux, <lb/>
            Geoffrey, son of Robert, Count de Mortagne, William Fitz- <lb/>
            Osbern, Robert, son of Robert de Beaumont, a novice in <lb/>

            Walter Giffard, and Ralph Toni,1 Hugh de Grant-mesnil, <lb/>
            and William de Warenne, with many other knights illustrious <lb/>
            for their military achievements, and whose names merit a <lb/>
            record in the annals of history amongst the most famous <lb/>
            warriors. Duke William surpassed them all in courage and <lb/>
            conduct; for he nobly performed the duties of a general, <note type="footnote"> 1 1 Hugh de Montfort, the constable; Walter Giffard, count de Longue- <lb/>

            staying the flight of his troops, re-animating their courage, <lb/>
            their comrade in the greatest dangers, and more frequently <lb/>
            calling on them to follow where he led, than commanding <lb/>
            them to advance before him. He had three horses killed <lb/>
            under him in the battle; thrice he re-mounted, and did not <lb/>
            suffer his steeds to be long unavenged. Shields, helmets, <lb/>
            and coats of mail were shivered by the furious and impatient <lb/>
            thrusts of his sword; some he dashed to the earth with his <lb/>
            shield, and was at all times as ready to cover and protect his <lb/>
            friends, as to deal death among his foes.</p>
          <p>Although the battle was fought with the greatest fury <lb/>
            from nine o'clock in the morning, King Harold was slain in <lb/>
            the first onset,1 and his brother Earl Leofwin fell some time <lb/>
            afterwards, with many thousands of the royal army. Towards <lb/>
            evening, the English finding that their king and the chief <lb/>
            nobles of the realm, with a great part of their army, had <lb/>
            fallen, while the Normans still showed a, bold front, and <lb/>
            made desperate attacks on all who made any resistance, <lb/>
            they had recourse to flight as expeditiously as they could. <lb/>
            Various were the fortunes which attended their retreat; <lb/>
            some recovering their horses, some on foot, attempted to <lb/>
            escape by the highways; more sought to save themselves by <lb/>
            striking across the country. The Normans, finding the <lb/>
            English completely routed, pursued them vigorously all <lb/>
            Sunday night, but not without suffering a great loss; for, <lb/>
            galloping onward in hot pursuit, they fell unawares, horses <lb/>
            and armour, into an ancient trench, overgrown and concealed <lb/>
            by rank grassy and men in their armour and horses rolling <lb/>
            over each other, were crushed and smothered. This acci­ <lb/>
            dent restored confidence to the routed English, for, perceiving <lb/>
            the advantage given them by the mouldering rampart and a <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Jumieges says that Harold made a night attack on the <lb/>
            enemy, having hastened by forced marches to take them by surprise. Our <lb/>
            author's statement, that Harold was slain at the first onset, is a gross <lb/>
            mistake, it being universally agreed that he fell pierced by an arrow <lb/>
            in the eye after sunset. On the whole, this account of the battle is very <lb/>
            unsatisfactory, and far inferior to the picture of it drawn by William of <lb/>
            Poitiers, as well as deficient in the circumstantial details given by other <lb/>
            historians. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to the History of Battle Abbey, it was a ravine or natural <lb/>

            succession of ditches, they rallied in a body, and, making a <lb/>
            sudden stand, caused the Normans severe loss. At this <lb/>
            place Eugenulf, lord of Laigle, and many others fell, the <lb/>
            number of the Normans who perished being, as reported by <lb/>
            some who were present, nearly fifteen thousand. Thus did <lb/>
            Almighty God, on the eye of the ides [14th] of October, <lb/>
            punish in various ways the innumerable sinners in both <lb/>
            armies. For, on this Saturday, the Normans butchered <lb/>
            with remorseless cruelty thousands of the English, who long <lb/>
            before had murdered the innocent prince Alfred and his <lb/>
            attendants ; 1 and, on the Saturday before the present battle,2 <lb/>
            had massacred without pity King Harold and Earl Tostig, <lb/>
            with multitudes of Norwegians. The righteous Judge <lb/>
            avenged the English on Sunday night, when the furious <lb/>
            Normans were precipitated into the concealed trench ; for <lb/>
            they had broken the divine law by their boundless covetous­ <lb/>
            ness; and, as the Psalmist says: " Their feet were swift to <lb/>
            shed blood," whereupon, " sorrow and unhappiness was in <lb/>
            their ways.” 3</p>
          <p>Duke William, perceiving the English troops suddenly <lb/>
            rally, did not halt; and when he found Count Eustace with <lb/>
            fifty men-at-arms retreating, and the count wished him to <lb/>
            have the signal sounded for recalling the pursuers, he com­ <lb/>
            manded him with a loud voice to stand firm. The count, <lb/>
            however, familiarly approaching the duke, whispered in his ear <lb/>
            that it would be safer to retreat, predicting his sudden death <lb/>
            if he persisted in the pursuit. While he was saying this, <lb/>
            Eustace received a blow between the shoulders, so violent <lb/>
            that the noise of the stroke was plainly heard, and it caused <lb/>
            blood to flow from his mouth and nostrils, and he was borne <lb/>
            off by his comrades in a dying state.</p>
          <p>The victory being secured, the duke returned to the field <lb/>
            of battle, where he viewed the dreadful carnage, which could <lb/>
            not be seen without commiseration. There the flower of <lb/>
            the youth and nobility of England covered the ground far <note type="footnote"> 1 This frightful massacre was made in 1036, during the reign of Harold <lb/>

            and near stained with blood. Harold could not be dis­ <lb/>
            covered by his features, but was recognized by other tokens, <lb/>
            and his corpse, being borne to the duke's camp, was, by <lb/>
            order of the conqueror, delivered to William Mallet for <lb/>
            interment near the sea-shore, which had long been guarded <lb/>
            by his arms.1</p>
          <p>Inconstant fortune frequently causes adverse and unex­ <lb/>
            pected changes in human affairs ; some persons being lifted <lb/>
            from the dust to the height of great power, while others, <lb/>
            suddenly falling from their high estate, groan in extreme dis­ <lb/>
            tress. Thus Edith, Earl Godwin's relict, who once enjoyed <lb/>
            wealth and influence, was now overwhelmed with grief and a <lb/>
            prey to the deepest misfortunes. She had borne seven sons <lb/>
            to her husband: Sweyn, Tostig, Harold, Gurth, Alfgar, and <lb/>
            Wulnoth. They were all earls, and distinguished for their <lb/>
            handsome persons, as well as what the world calls excellence; <lb/>
            but each of them underwent a different and disastrous fate. <lb/>
            Alfgar and Wulnoth, indeed, feared God and lived according <lb/>
            to his laws, and both died in the odour of sanctity confessing <lb/>
            the true faith, the one a pilgrim and monk at Rheims, the <lb/>
            other at Salisbury.2 For the other five, following the career <lb/>
            of arms, they met their death in a variety of ways, and on <lb/>
            different occasions. <note type="footnote"> 1 There are various accounts of the circumstances attending the finding <lb/>
            of the body of Harold, and the treatment of his remains. Guy of Amiens <lb/>
            says that it was mutilated, but the fragments were collected after the battle <lb/>
            by the duke's order, and conveyed to his camp, wrapped in a purple <lb/>
            winding-sheet. Some of these details are evidently inventions of a later <lb/>
            period, but the rest of his story agrees with that of Ordericus and William <lb/>
            de Poitiers, and the coincidence of two writers so near the time leaves little <lb/>
            reason to doubt that our author was right in adopting their account. It <lb/>
            appears from Guy's narrative, that William Mallet was half Norman, half <lb/>
            English," probably one of the Normans already settled in England, and <lb/>
            thus better qualified for his melancholy office. A legend entitled The Life <lb/>
            of Harold, represents that king as having been found on the field of battle <lb/>
            among the dead and dying by a Saracen woman, who concealed him at <lb/>
            Winchester for two years. It then sends him on a pilgrimage to Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem, and brings him back to England to spend a long life in retirement <lb/>
            and austere penitence. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has omitted to tell us that Wulnoth passed his whole life in <lb/>
            confinement, from the time he was sent to Normandy as a hostage by <lb/>
            Edward the Confessor, in 1502, except the short interval between his release <lb/>
            by the Conqueror, when on his death-bed, and his being again condemned <lb/>
            to imprisonment by one of the first acts of William Rufus. </note> <pb n="488"/>
             </p>
          <p>The sorrowing mother now offered to Duke William, for <lb/>
            the body of Harold, its weight in gold; but the great con­ <lb/>
            queror refused such a barter, thinking it was not right that <lb/>
            a mother should pay the last honours to one by whose <lb/>
            insatiable ambition, vast numbers lay unburied. He issued <lb/>
            orders that the bodies of his own soldiers should be buried <lb/>
            with the greatest care; and also-gave all the English who <lb/>
            applied for leave free liberty to bury those of their friends. <lb/>
            After providing for the decent interment of the dead the <lb/>
            duke marched to Romney, and taking it by assault, re­ <lb/>
            venged the slaughter of a party of his troops, who, having <lb/>
            landed there by mistake, were fiercely attacked by the in­ <lb/>
            habitants and cruelly butchered, after great loss on both <lb/>
            sides.</p>
          <p>The duke then continued his march to Dover, where <lb/>
            there was a large body of people collected, because they <lb/>
            thought the position impregnable, the castle standing on <lb/>
            the summit of a steep rock, overhanging the sea. The <lb/>
            garrison, however, struck with panic at the duke's ap­ <lb/>
            proach, were preparing to surrender, when some Norman <lb/>
            squires, greedy for spoil, set the place on fire, and the <lb/>
            devouring flames spreading around, many parts were ruined <lb/>
            and burnt. The duke, compassionating those who were <lb/>
            willing to render him their submission, ordered them to be <lb/>
            paid the cost of rebuilding their houses, and their other <lb/>
            losses. The castle being taken, eight days were spent in <lb/>
            strengthening the fortifications. While he lay there a great <lb/>
            number of soldiers, who devoured flesh-meat half raw and <lb/>
            drank too much water, died of dysentery, and many more <lb/>
            felt the effects to the end of their days. The duke, leaving <lb/>
            a garrison in the castle, with those who were suffering from <lb/>
            dysentery, marched onward to complete the subjugation of <lb/>
            those he had vanquished. The Kentish men, of their own <lb/>
            accord, met him not far from Dover and swore fealty to <lb/>
            him, delivering hostages for their allegiance.1</p>
          <p>After that Harold was slain, Stigand, archbishop of Can­ <lb/>

            their country and their nation against foreign enemies.2 <lb/>
            Meanwhile duke William, having intelligence that they <lb/>
            were assembling in increasing numbers, marched with a <lb/>
            strong force, and encamping near London, detached fifty <lb/>
            knights and men-at-arms in advance, who compelled the <lb/>
            troops which issued from the city to oppose them to retreat <lb/>
            within the walls, after losing many of their number, to the <lb/>
            great sorrow of the citizens, who lamented their sons and <lb/>
            friends. Fire also was added to the calamities inflicted on <lb/>
            them, all the buildings on that side of the river being burnt. <lb/>

            master of the horse, who had the command of London, although he was <lb/>
            afflicted with an infirmity in the loins which obliged him to use a litter. <lb/>
            He it was who conducted the negotiations, the duke having sent him a <lb/>
            secret message, endeavouring to deceive him by empty promises, and <lb/>
            Ansgard receiving his overtures with intentions quite as insincere. How­ <lb/>
            ever, the treaty was concluded, and the chiefs of the English party went in <lb/>
            procession to William, who embraced the young Edgar. Domesday book, <lb/>
            and a ills. of Waltham Abbey, show that Ansgard was a person of great <lb/>
            importance, and that the great number of manors which he held in right <lb/>
            of his office were conferred on Geoffrey de Mandeville, although William <lb/>
            Fitz-Osborn succeeded him as constable. These domains were in Berk­ <lb/>
            shire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Warwick­ <lb/>
            shire, and Essex. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It was not at Wallingford, but at Berkhampstead, that William <lb/>

            his person and his kingdom to William. This young prince <lb/>
            was of a mild and ingenuous disposition, and being a kins­ <lb/>
            man of king Edward the Great, as his nephew's son,1 the <lb/>
            duke affectionately embraced him, and treated him all his <lb/>
            life with the regard due to a son.2</p>
          <p>In the course of three months, by God's providence, tran­ <lb/>
            quillity was restored throughout England, and the bishops <lb/>
            and barons of the realm having made their peace with <lb/>
            William, entreated him to be crowned, according to the <lb/>
            custom of the English kings. This was the great aim of­ <lb/>
            the Normans, who had encountered great perils by land and <lb/>
            sea, to procure for their prince the ensigns of royalty; and <lb/>
            this, by divine influence, was the desire also of the native <lb/>
            inhabitants, who, up to that time, had only given their <lb/>
            allegiance to crowned kings.</p>
          <p>At that time Aldred was metropolitan and archbishop of <lb/>
            York.3 He was a great lover of justice, of mature age, <lb/>
            wise, eloquent, and good, and distinguished by many vir­ <lb/>
            tues, and following in the footsteps of the fathers, strove <lb/>
            earnestly to be received with favour by the King of kings. <lb/>
            But Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, was too much en­ <lb/>
            gaged in secular affairs, and had been suspended by Pope <lb/>
            Alexander for certain crimes.</p>
          <p>At length, in the year of our Lord 1067,4 the fifth indic­ <lb/>
            tion, on Christmas day, the English assembled at London <lb/>
            for William's coronation, and a guard of Norman troops <lb/>
            was posted round the abbey, mounted and fully armed, to <lb/>
            prevent any treasonable and seditious attempt. Then, in <lb/>
            the presence of the bishops, abbots, and nobles, of the <lb/>
            whole realm of Albion, Aldred the archbishop consecrated <note type="footnote"> 1 Edgar Atheling was great nephew to Edward the Confessor, as grandson <lb/>
            of his brother Edmond Ironsides. It would appear that he was very <lb/>
            young at this time; Guy of Amiens speaks of him as “ the boy raised to <lb/>
            the rank of king." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This was hardly the case, as we find Edgar frequently in arms against <lb/>
            William, and that he had often reason to complain of his parsimonious <lb/>
            conduct towards him. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aldred was appointed archbishop of York in 1060. This prelate had <lb/>
            not always been so irreproachable as our author represents, and it was with <lb/>

            the royal crown1 on his head in the church of St. Peter the <lb/>
            apostle, called Westminster Abbey, where the venerable <lb/>
            king Edward lies interred.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, at the instigation of the devil, the enemy of <lb/>
            all good, an unforeseen occurrence, pregnant with mischief <lb/>
            to both nations, and an omen of future calamities, suddenly <lb/>
            happened. For when Aldred the archbishop was demand­ <lb/>
            ing of the English, and Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, of <lb/>
            the Normans, whether they consented to have William for <lb/>
            their king, and the whole assembly loudly gave their willing <lb/>
            assent, with one voice though not in one language, the men- <lb/>
            at-arms, who formed the guard outside the abbey, upon <lb/>
            hearing the shouts of joyful acclamation raised by the <lb/>
            people in the church in a language they did not under­ <lb/>
            stand, suspected some treachery and imprudently set fire to <lb/>
            the neighbouring houses. The flames quickly spreading, <lb/>
            the people in the church were seized with panic in the <lb/>
            midst of their rejoicings, and crowds of men and women, of <lb/>
            all ranks and conditions, eagerly struggled to make their <lb/>
            escape from the church, as if they were threatened with <lb/>
            immediate danger. The bishops only, with some few of the <lb/>
            clergy and monks, maintained their post before the altar, <lb/>
            and trembling with fear completed the coronation office <lb/>
            with some difficulty, the king himself being much alarmed. <lb/>
            Almost all the rest hastened to the scene of conflagration, <lb/>
            some to make vigorous efforts to extinguish the flames, and <lb/>
            more in the prospect of committing robberies in the con­ <lb/>
            fusion that prevailed. The English were greatly enraged <lb/>
            when they understood the origin of this unfortunate affair, <lb/>
            which leading them to suspect the Normans and consider <lb/>
            them faithless, they waited for some future opportunity of <lb/>
            revenge. <note type="footnote"> 1 Guy of Amiens, who gives a minute description of William's crown, <lb/>

          <p>KING WILLIAM governed firmly and prudently, both in <lb/>
            prosperity and adversity, the kingdom he gained, reigning <lb/>
            over it with great honour twenty years, eight months, and <lb/>
            sixteen days.1 William of Poitiers, archdeacon of Lisieux, <lb/>
            has given a full account of his merits, his excellent institu­ <lb/>
            tioni, his great successes and brave and wonderful achieve­ <lb/>
            ments, in a valuable work distinguished for the elegance of <lb/>
            its style and its depth of thought. Having for a long pe­ <lb/>
            riod been chaplain to this king, he made it his business to <lb/>
            retrace at length, with unquestionable truth and ample details <lb/>
            all that he had himself witnessed or been party to; but <lb/>
            unfortunately he was prevented by adverse events from <lb/>
            continuing his narrative to the king's death.2</p>
          <p>Guy, bishop of Amiens,3 also wrote an epic poem, which, <lb/>
            in imitation of Virgil and Papinius, describes the battle of <note type="footnote"> 1 This calculation is right, reckoning as our author does, William's reign <lb/>
            from the day of his coronation, Christmas, 1066, to the day of his death, <lb/>

            norum et regis Anglorum. It is published in Duchesne's Receuil des His­ <lb/>

            Walter II., count of Amiens and the Vexin, and consequently brother or <lb/>
            nephew of Fulk I., his predecessor, to whom he succeeded before May <lb/>
            29th, 1059. He attended Queen Matilda to England as her almoner in <lb/>
            1068, and died about the year 1076. William de Jumieges refers to this <lb/>
            poem, which he says was written in hexameters, and he calls it a respect­ <lb/>
            able work, " opus non contemnendum." Dr. Pertz, the learned editor of <lb/>
            the Monumenta Germanica, discovered in the Royal Library at Brussels, <lb/>
            formerly that of the dukes of Burgundy, a manuscript (of the twelfth <lb/>
            century) of an anonymous poem, which from the initials W... L... in the <lb/>
            second line (Wuido or Guide to Lanfranc ?) and its general character, is <lb/>
            supposed to be the work of Guy, bishop of Amiens, referred to by <lb/>
            Ordericus. The narrative embraces a period of about four months, <lb/>
            and if written by Guy was composed before his journey to England in <lb/>
            1068. The authors official position and proximity to the events described, <lb/>
            and the highest personages engaged in them stamp the details with the <lb/>
            character of great authenticity; but unfortunately they are very scanty as <lb/>
            far as regards the duke's invasion of England. The poem in the Brussels' <lb/>
            MS. was published by M. Petrie in the Monumenta Historica Britannica, <lb/>

          <p>John of Worcester,1 a native of England and a monk from <lb/>
            his childhood, of venerable character and great learning, in <lb/>
            his continuation of the chronicles of Marianus Scotus, gives <lb/>
            a faithful account of King William and of the events which <lb/>
            took place during his reign, and those of his sons William <lb/>
            Rufus and King Henry to the present day. Marianus <lb/>
            was a monk of the abbey of St. Alban the martyr, near <lb/>
            Mayence, where, following to the best of his means, Eusebius <lb/>
            of Cæsarea, St. Jerome, and other historians, he kindly em­ <lb/>
            ployed himself in the charitable office of presenting to such <lb/>
            sons of the church as were unable themselves to develop <lb/>
            such important results, the happy fruits of his long studies <lb/>
            and of the vast labours he underwent in his foreign travels. <lb/>
            After carefully consulting both ancient and modern writers, <lb/>
            he published his Chronography, in which, beginning with <lb/>
            the creation, when God formed Adam out of the dust of <lb/>
            the earth, and pursuing his inquiries through the books of <lb/>
            the Old and New Testament, and the Greek and Roman <lb/>
            histories, he collected all that was important; and fixing the <lb/>
            chronology through the series of kings and consuls, which <lb/>
            he continued to the day of his death, his historical annals are <lb/>
            deservedly esteemed. John of Worcester who followed, re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Florence of Worcester, not John, continued the chronicle of Marianus <lb/>
            Scotus, not for almost a century, but from 1083 to 1117, as the French <lb/>
            editor of Ordericus justly observes. But our learned fellow labourer has <lb/>
            omitted to explain how Ordericus Vitalis, who tells us at the conclusion of <lb/>
            the present paragraph that he inspected the original MS. when he was at <lb/>
            Worcester, fell into this error. It appears, however, that the continuation <lb/>
            of Marianus was carried on contemporaneously by one or more monks of <lb/>
            Worcester, and that one of these continuators was named John; so that, <lb/>
            probably, Ordericus, finding this John employed on the work, or that his <lb/>
            portion of it followed on the labours of Marianus and Florence without <lb/>
            interruption in the MS. he examined, hence supposed that the whole of <lb/>
            the additions were made by him. In corroboration of this supposition it <lb/>
            maybe observed that a person named John appears in the MS. of C.C. <lb/>
            CoIl. Library at Oxford, at least as a contemporary interpolator, if not a <lb/>
            continuator, and this copy seems to have belonged to the church of <lb/>
            Worcester. The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester was first published <lb/>
            in London in 1592 from manuscripts then in the possession of Lord Wil­ <lb/>
            liam Howard, and afterwards reprinted at Frankfort very faultily in the <lb/>
            year 1 GO 1. See M. Petrie's Preface to the Monumenta Historica .Britan­ <lb/>

            corded the events of nearly a century, and by the order of the <lb/>
            venerable Wulstan, bishop and monk, appended his continua­ <lb/>
            tioni' to the Chronicle of Marianus ; succinctly relating many <lb/>
            things worthy of observation in the histories of the Romans, <lb/>
            Franks, Germans, and other nations. Accordingly these <lb/>
            chronicles include the whole series of the Hebrew judges, <lb/>
            kings, and high priests, from Moses to the destruction of <lb/>
            Jerusalem in the reigns of Titus and Vespasian, when the <lb/>
            kingdom of the Jews was justly overthrown on accouut <lb/>
            of the death and passion of our Lord. The Chronicles also <lb/>
            give the names of all the Romail consuls and dictators, <lb/>
            emperors and pontiffs, as well as of all the kings of England, <lb/>
            who reigned from the time that Hengist and Horsa made <lb/>
            war on Vortigern, king of Britain, to the great injury of <lb/>
            the Britons. To these the Chronicle adds the bishops who <lb/>
            governed the English church from the time when Pope <lb/>
            Gregory commissioned Augustine and Mellitus and other <lb/>
            monks to preach the word of God in England, by whom <lb/>
            Ethelbert, king of Kent, Edwin, king of the Northumbrians, <lb/>
            and other princes of the English nation, were converted to <lb/>
            the true faith. Sigebert, a monk of Gemblours,2 has extract­ <lb/>
            ed many important passages from these Chronicles, omitting <lb/>
            however several relating to the insular nations, and adding <lb/>
            much valuable information respecting the Goths, the Huns, <lb/>
            the Persians, and other barbarous races. I have been an­ <lb/>
            xious to direct attention to these works, in order that <lb/>
            inquiring readers may consult them for themselves, offering <lb/>
            as they do a rich harvest of instruction, though they are <lb/>
            difficult to meet with. For being written by modern authors, <lb/>
            they are not as yet got into general circulation. One of these <lb/>
