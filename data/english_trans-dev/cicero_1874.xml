          </head>
          <p>THE present volume comprises the most popular <lb/>
            moral treatises of Cicero. In preparing an edition <lb/>
            adapted to the wants of the student, the editor has <lb/>
            addressed himself to two principal objects. The first, <lb/>
            to produce a close and faithful translation, avoiding <lb/>
            on the one hand, the freedom of Melmoth's elegant <lb/>
            paraphrase, and on the other, the crudeness and inac- <lb/>
            curacy of the so called literal translation of Cockman; <lb/>
            the second, to present the opinions of modern mo- <lb/>
            ralists, chiefly of our own country, in juxtaposition <lb/>
            with those of Cicero, that the reader may be enabled <lb/>
            to estimate the changes which have passed over the <lb/>
            human mind in relation to these subjects, and per- <lb/>
            ceive how far these changes have been occasioned by <lb/>
            the promulgation of the Christian religion.</p>
          <p>A subsidiary design has been to show, by parallel pas- <lb/>
            sages, to what extent the writings of modern moralists <lb/>
            have been tinctured with the thoughts of the Roman <lb/>
            philosopher; and to point out particular instances in <lb/>
            which their arguments and illustrations are identical.</p>
          <p>IN briefly sketching the subjects of the following <lb/>
            treatises, we shall for the most part adopt the observa- <lb/>
            tions of Dunlop, in his " History of Roman Literature." <lb/>
            The first, and most important treatise, is</p>
          <p>THE OFFICES, or three books of 'Moral Duties.' <lb/>
            Of these the first two are supposed to be chiefly derived <lb/>
            from a lost work of Panætius, a Greek philosopher, who <lb/>
            resided at Rome in the second century before Christ. <lb/>
            In the first book he treats of what is virtuous in itself, <lb/>
            and shows in what manner our duties are founded in <lb/>
            morality and virtue, in the right perception of truth, <lb/>
            iustice, fortitude, and decorum, which four qualities are <lb/>
            referred to as the constituent parts of virtue, and the <lb/>
            sources from which all our duties are derived. In the <lb/>
            second book, the author enlarges on those duties which <lb/>
            relate to utility, the improvement of life, and the means <lb/>
            <pb n="iv"/>
             <lb/>
            of attaining wealth and power. This division of the <lb/>
            work relates principally to political advancement, and <lb/>
            the honourable means of gaining popularity, among <lb/>
            which are enumerated generosity, courtesy, and elo- <lb/>
            quence. Thus far Cicero had, in all probability, closely <lb/>
            followed the steps of Panætius. Garve, in his commen- <lb/>
            tary on Moral Duties, remarks that, when Cicero comes <lb/>
            to the more subtle and philosophic parts of his subject, <lb/>
            he evidently translates from the Greek, and that he has <lb/>
            not always found words in his own language to express <lb/>
            the nicer distinctions of the Greek schools. The work or <lb/>
            Panætius, however, was left imperfect, and did not com- <lb/>
            prise the third part of the subject, namely, the choice <lb/>
            and distinction to be made when virtue and utility were <lb/>
            opposed to each other. On this topic, accordingly, <lb/>
            Cicero, in the third book, was left to his own resources; <lb/>
            The discussion, of course, relates only to the subordinate <lb/>
            duties, as the true and undoubted honestum can never <lb/>
            be put in competition with private advantage, or be <lb/>
            violated for its sake. As to the minor duties the great <lb/>
            maxim inculcated is, that nothing should be accounted <lb/>
            useful or profitable but what is strictly virtuous; and <lb/>
            that, in fact, there ought to be no separation of the <lb/>
            principles of virtue and utility. Cicero enters into <lb/>
            some discussion however, and lays down certain rules <lb/>
            to enable us to form a just estimate of both in cases of <lb/>
            doubt, where seeming utility comes into competition <lb/>
            with virtue.</p>
          <p>The author has addressed the work to his son, and <lb/>
            has represented it as written for his instruction. "It <lb/>
            is," says Kelsall, " the noblest present ever made by <lb/>
            a parent to a child." Cicero declares that he intended <lb/>
            to treat in it of all the duties, but it is generally con- <lb/>
            sidered to have been chiefly drawn up as a manual <lb/>
            of political morality, and as a guide to young Romans <lb/>
            of his son's age and rank, which might enable them <lb/>
            to attain political eminence, and tread with innocence <lb/>
            and safety the slippery steeps of power."</p>
          <p>The DIALOGUE ON FRIENDSHIP is addressed with <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            peculiar propriety to Atticus, who, as Cicero tells him in <lb/>
            his dedication, cannot fail to discover his own portrait in <lb/>
            the delineation of a perfect friend. Here, as elsewhere, <lb/>
            Cicero has most judiciously selected the persons of the <lb/>
            dialogue. They were men of eminence in the state, <lb/>
            and, though deceased, the Romans had such veneration <lb/>
            for their ancestors, that they would listen with the <lb/>
            utmost interest even to the imaginary conversation of <lb/>
            a Scævola or a Lælius. The memorable and hereditary <lb/>
            friendship which subsisted between Lælius and the <lb/>
            younger Scipio Africanus, rendered the former a suit- <lb/>
            able example. To support a conversation on this de- <lb/>
            lightful topic, Fannius the historian, and Mucius Scæ- <lb/>
            vola the augur, both sons-in-law of Lælius, are supposed <lb/>
            to pay a visit to their father immediately after the sud- <lb/>
            den and suspicious death of Scipio Africanus. The re- <lb/>
            cent loss which Lælius had thus sustained, leads to an <lb/>
            eulogy on the inimitable virtues of the departed hero, <lb/>
            and to a discussion on the true nature of that tie by <lb/>
            which they had been so long connected. Cicero, in <lb/>
            early youth, had been introduced by his father to <lb/>
            Mucius Scævola, and, among other interesting conversa- <lb/>
            tions which he thus enjoyed an opportunity of hearing, <lb/>
            he was one day present while Scævola related the sub- <lb/>
            stance of the conference on Friendship, which he and <lb/>
            Fannius had held with Lælius a few days after the <lb/>
            death of Scipio. Many of the ideas and sentiments <lb/>
            which Lælius uttered are declared by Scævola to have <lb/>
            originally flowed from Scipio, with whom the nature <lb/>
            and laws of friendship formed a favourite topic. This, <lb/>
            perhaps, is not entirely a fiction, or merely asserted <lb/>
            to give the stamp of authenticity to the dialogue.</p>
          <p>The TREATISE ON OLD AGE is not properly a dia- <lb/>
            logue, but a continued discourse delivered by Cato the <lb/>
            censor at the request of Scipio and Lælius. It is un- <lb/>
            doubtedly one of the most interesting pieces of the <lb/>
            kind which have descended to us from antiquity; and <lb/>
            no reader can wonder that the pleasure experienced in <lb/>
            its composition, not only, as he says, made him forget <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            the infirmities of old age, but even rendered that por <lb/>
            tion of existence agreeable. In consequence of the <lb/>
            years to which Cicero had attained at the time of <lb/>
            its composition, and the circumstances in which he <lb/>
            was then placed, it must indeed have been composed <lb/>
            with peculiar interest and feeling. It was written by <lb/>
            him when he was sixty-three, and is addressed to his <lb/>
            friend Atticus (who had nearly reached the same age), <lb/>
            with a view of rendering their accumulating burdens <lb/>
            as light as possible. In order to give his precepts the <lb/>
            greater force, lie represents them as delivered by the <lb/>
            elder Cato, in the eighty-fourth year of a vigorous and <lb/>
            useful old age, on the occasion of Lælius and the younger <lb/>
            Scipio expressing their admiration at the wonderful ease <lb/>
            with which he still bore the weight of years. This <lb/>
            affords the author an opportunity of entering into a full <lb/>
            explanation of his ideas on the subject, his great object <lb/>
            being to show that by internal resources of happiness <lb/>
            the closing period may be rendered not only support- <lb/>
            able but comfortable. He enumerates those causes <lb/>
            which are commonly supposed to constitute the infeli- <lb/>
            city of advanced age under four general heads: that <lb/>
            it incapacitates from mingling in the affairs of the <lb/>
            world; that it produces infirmities of the body; that it <lb/>
            disqualifies for the enjoyment of sensual gratifications: <lb/>
            and that it brings us to the verge of death. Some of <lb/>
            these disadvantages he maintains are imaginary, and <lb/>
            for any real pleasures of which old men are deprived, <lb/>
            he shows that many others more refined and elevated <lb/>
            may be substituted. The whole work is agreeably <lb/>
            diversified, and illustrated by examples.</p>
          <p>The PARADOXES contain a defence of six peculiar <lb/>
            opinions or paradoxes of the Stoics, something in the <lb/>
            manner of those which Cato was wont to promulgate in <lb/>
            the senate. These are, that what is morally right <lb/>
            (honestum) is alone good; that the virtuous can want <lb/>
            nothing for complete happiness; that there are no de- <lb/>
            grees either in crimes or good actions; that every fool <lb/>
            is mad; that the wise alone are wealthy and free ; <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            and that every fool is a slave. The Paradoxes, indeed, <lb/>
            seem to have been written as an exercise of rhetorical <lb/>
            wit, rather than as a serious disquisition in philosophy, <lb/>
            and each is personally applied to some individual.</p>
          <p>The narrative, entitled SCIPIO'S DREAM is put into <lb/>
            the mouth of the younger Scipio Africanus, who relates <lb/>
            that, in his youth, when he first served in Africa, he <lb/>
            visited the court of Massinissa, the steady friend of the <lb/>
            Romans, and particularly of the Cornelian family. <lb/>
            During the feasts and entertainments of the day, the <lb/>
            conversation turned on the words and actions of the <lb/>
            first great Scipio. His adopted son having retired to <lb/>
            rest, the shade of the departed hero appeared to him in <lb/>
            a. vision, and darkly foretelling the future events of his <lb/>
            life, encouraged him to tread in the paths of patriotism <lb/>
            and true glory; announcing the reward provided in <lb/>
            heaven for those who have deserved well of their <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>The circumstances of time and place selected for this <lb/>
            dream, as well as the characters introduced, have been <lb/>
            most felicitously chosen; and Cicero has nowhere more <lb/>
            happily united sublimity of thought with brilliant ima- <lb/>
            gination.</p>
          <p>The letter, ON THE DUTIES OF A MAGISTRATE, <lb/>
            is one of the most remarkable of the kind that has <lb/>
            ever been penned. It was addressed by Cicero to his <lb/>
            brother Quintus, on the occasion of his government in <lb/>
            Asia being prolonged to a third year.. Availing himself <lb/>
            of the rights or an elder brother, as well as of the <lb/>
            authority derived from his superior dignity and talents, <lb/>
            Cicero counsels and exhorts him concerning the due <lb/>
            administration of his province, particularly with regard <lb/>
            to the choice of his subordinate officers, and the degree <lb/>
            of trust to be reposed in them. He earnestly reproves <lb/>
            him, but with much fraternal tenderness and affection, <lb/>
            for his irritability of temper; and concludes with a beau- <lb/>
            tiful exhortation to strive in all respects to merit the <lb/>
            praise of his contemporaries, and bequeath to posterity <lb/>
            an unsullied name</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>I. Although, as you have for a year been studying under <lb/>
            Cratippus, and that, too, at Athens, you ought to be well <lb/>
            furnished with the rules and principles of philosophy, on <lb/>
            account of the pre-eminent reputation both of the master <lb/>
            and the city, the one of which can improve you by his <lb/>
            learning, the other by its examples; yet as I, for my own <lb/>
            advantage, have always combined the Latin with the Greek, <lb/>
            not only in philosophy but even in the practice of speak- <lb/>
            ing, I recommend to you the same method, that you may <lb/>
            excel equally in both kinds of composition. In this respect, <lb/>
            indeed, if I mistake not, I was of great service to our <lb/>
            countrymen; so that not only such of them as are ignorant of <lb/>
            Greek learning, but even men of letters, think they have pro- <lb/>
            fited somewhat by me both in speaking and reasoning.</p>
          <p>Wherefore you shall study, nay, study as long as you <lb/>
            desire, under the best philosopher of this age — and you <lb/>
            ought to desire it, as long as you are not dissatisfied with <lb/>
            the degree of your improvement; but in reading my works, <lb/>
            which are not very different from the Peripatetic—because <lb/>
            we profess in common to be followers both of Socrates and <lb/>
            Plato—as to the subject matter itself, use your own judg- <lb/>
            ment; but be assured you will, by reading my writings, <lb/>
            render your Latin style more copious. I would not have it <lb/>
            supposed that this is said in ostentation; for, while I yield <lb/>
            the superiority in philosophy to many, if I claim to myself <lb/>
            the province peculiar to an orator-that of speaking with pro- <note type="footnote">13 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="2"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            priety, perspicuity, and elegance—I seem, since I have spent <lb/>
            my life in that pursuit, to lay claim to it with a certain <lb/>
            degree of right.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, my dear Cicero, I most earnestly recommend <lb/>
            that you carefully peruse not only my Orations, but even my <lb/>
            philosophical works, which have now nearly equalled them <lb/>
            in extent; for there is in the former the greater force of <lb/>
            language, but you ought to cultivate, at the same time, the <lb/>
            equable and sober style of the latter. And, indeed, I find <lb/>
            that it has not happened in the case of any of the Greeks, <lb/>
            that the same man has laboured in both departments, and <lb/>
            pursued both the former-that of forensic speaking- and <lb/>
            the latter quiet mode of argumentation; unless, perhaps, <lb/>
            Demetrius Phalereus may be reckoned in that number- <lb/>
            a refined reasoner, a not very animated speaker, yet of so <lb/>
            much sweetness that you might recognize the pupil of <lb/>
            Theophrastus. How far I have succeeded in both, others <lb/>
            must determine; certain it is that I have attempted both. <lb/>
            Indeed, I am of opinion that Plato, had he attempted forensic <lb/>
            oratory, would have spoken with copiousness and power; and <lb/>
            that had Demosthenes retained and repeated the lessons of <lb/>
            Plato, he would have delivered them with gracefulness and <lb/>
            beauty. I form the same judgment of Aristotle and Iso- <lb/>
            crates, each of whom was so pleased with his own pursuit <lb/>
            that he neglected that of the other.</p>
          <p>II. But having resolved at this time to write to you some- <lb/>
            what, and a great deal in time to come, I have thought proper <lb/>
            to set out with that subject which is best adapted to your <lb/>
            years and to my authority. For, while many subjects in phi- <lb/>
            losopby, of great weight and utility, have been accurately and <lb/>
            copiously discussed by philosophers, the most extensive seems <lb/>
            to be what they have delivered and enjoined concerning the <lb/>
            duties of mankind; for there can be no state of life, amidst <lb/>
            public or private affairs, abroad or at home-whether you <lb/>
            transact anything with yourself or contract anything with <lb/>
            another-that is without its obligations. In the due discharge <lb/>
            of that consists all the dignity, and in its neglect all the <lb/>
            disgrace, of life.</p>
          <p>This is an inquiry common to all philosophers; for where <lb/>
            is the man who will presume to style himself a philosopher, <lb/>
            and lay down no rules of duty? But there are certain <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP II.]</note> <lb/>
            schools which pervert all duty by the ultimate objects of <lb/>
            good and evil which they propose. For if a man should <lb/>
            lay down as the chief good, that which has no connexion <lb/>
            with virtue, and measure it by his own interests, and not <lb/>
            according to its moral merit; if such a man shall act con- <lb/>
            sistently with his own principles, and is not sometimes influ- <lb/>
            enced by the goodness of his heart, he can cultivate neither <lb/>
            friendship, justice, nor generosity. In truth, it is impossible <lb/>
            for the man to be brave who shall pronounce pain to be the <lb/>
            greatest evil, or temperate who shall propose pleasure as the <lb/>
            highest good.* <note type="footnote"> * Cicero thus enters briefly but definitely into the most vexed, and yet <lb/>
            the most fundamental, question of ethics : What is that which constitutes <lb/>
            human conduct morally right or wrong ? In doing so, he plainly avows <lb/>
            his own conviction that this great distinction is not dependent upon the <lb/>
            mere expediency or inexpediency of the supposed conduct. The many <lb/>
            eminent moral philosophers of modern times, and especially of our own <lb/>
            country, may be comprehensively divided into the two classes of those who <lb/>
            maintain, and those who oppose, the principle thus enunciated by Cicero. <lb/>
            A very condensed view of the leading philosophers of these schools will not <lb/>
            be uninstructive. </note><note type="footnote"> The most celebrated of the earlier opponents of the principle laid down <lb/>
            by Cicero was Hobbes, of Malmesbury, who flourished in the 17th century. <lb/>
            His system takes no account of moral emotions whatever. He makes pure <lb/>
            selfishness the motive and end of all moral actions, and makes religion and <lb/>
            morals alike to consist in passive conformity to the dogmas and laws of the <lb/>
            reigning sovereign. </note><note type="footnote"> Perhaps the best reply to this latter notion was given by Cicero himself, <lb/>
            in his treatise, " De Legibus:"—"The impulse," he says, " which directs to <lb/>
            right conduct, and deters from crime, is not only older than the ages of <lb/>
            nations and cities, but coeval with that Divine Being who sees and rules <lb/>
            both heaven and earth. Nor did Tarquin less violate that eternal law, <lb/>
            though in his reign there might have been no written law at Rome against <lb/>
            such violence ; for the principle that impels us to right conduct, and warns <lb/>
            us against guilt, springs out of the nature of things. It did not begin to be <lb/>
            law when it was first written but when it originated, and it is coeval with <lb/>
            the Divine Mind itself." </note><note type="footnote"> The most noted contemporary opponents of these views were Cudworth <lb/>
            and Dr. Clarke; the sum of whose moral doctrine is thus stated in Mac- <lb/>
            kintosh's " Progress of Ethical Philosophy:"—" Man can conceive nothing <lb/>
            without, at the same time, conceiving its relations to other things. He <lb/>
            must ascribe the same law of perception to every being to whom he ascribes <lb/>
            thought. He cannot, therefore, doubt that all the relations of all things to <lb/>
            all must have always been present to the Eternal Mind. The relations in <lb/>
            this sense are eternal, however recent the things may be between whom they <lb/>
            subsist. The whole of these relations constitute truth; the knowledge of <lb/>
            them is omniscience. These eternal different relations of things involve a <lb/>
            consequent eternal fitness or unfitness in the application of things ore to </note><note type="footnote">B 2 </note> <note type="margin">[BOOK.I</note><pb n="4"/>
            </p>
          <p>Though these truths are so self-evident that they require <lb/>
            no philosophical discussion, yet they have been treated by <lb/>
            me elsewhere. I say, therefore, that if these schools are <note type="footnote">another, with a regard to which the will of God always chooses, and which <lb/>
            ought likewise to determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings. <lb/>
            These eternal differences make it fit and reasonable for the creatures so to <lb/>
            act; they cause it to be their duty, or lay an obligation on them so to do, <lb/>
            separate from the will of God, and antecedent to any prospect of advantage <lb/>
            or reward." </note><note type="footnote"> This system professes to base all morals upon pure reason, as applied to <lb/>
            the fitness of things. A single passage from the work of Sir James Mac- <lb/>
            kintosh points out the fallacy it involves. " The murderer who poisons by <lb/>
            arsenic acts agreeably to his knowledge of the power of that substance to <lb/>
            kill, which is a relation between two things ; as much as the physician who <lb/>
            employs an emetic after the poison, acts upon his belief of the tendency of <lb/>
            that remedy to preserve life, which is another relation between two things. <lb/>
            All men who seek a good or bad end by good or bad means, must alike <lb/>
            conform their conduct to some relation between their actions as means, and <lb/>
            their object as an end. All the relations of inanimate things to each other <lb/>
            are undoubtedly observed as much by the criminal as by the man of <lb/>
            virtue." </note><note type="footnote"> Lord Shaftesbury, a little later, made a considerable advance in ethical <lb/>
            philosophy, by placing virtue in the prevalence of love for the system of <lb/>
            which we are a part, over the passions pointing to our individual welfare; <lb/>
            and still further, by admitting an intrinsic power in all, of judging of moral <lb/>
            actions by a moral sense. In his general principles Leibnitz, to a great <lb/>
            extent, concurs; though the latter appears to have lost himself in a refine- <lb/>
            ment of the selfish system, by considering the pleasure connected with the <lb/>
            exercise of this virtuous benevolence as the object in the view of the bene- <lb/>
            volent man. </note><note type="footnote"> Malebranche places all virtue in "the love" of the universal order, as it <lb/>
            eternally existed in the Divine reason, where every created reason contem- <lb/>
            plates it. </note><note type="footnote"> The metaphysician of America, designated by Robert Hall, "that pro- <lb/>
            digy of metaphysical acumen," Jonathan Edwards, places moral excellence <lb/>
            in the love to being (that is, sentient being) in general. This good will <lb/>
            should be felt towards a particular being-first, in proportion to his degree <lb/>
            of existence ("for," says he, " that which is great has more existence, and is <lb/>
            farther from nothing, than that which is little''); and, secondly, in pro- <lb/>
            portion to the degree in which that particular being feels benevolence to <lb/>
            others. </note><note type="footnote"> With the 18th century arose a far higher system of morals, under the <lb/>
            auspices of the celebrated Dr. Butler. He makes CONSCIENCE the ruling <lb/>
            moral power in the complex constitution of man, and makes its dictates the <lb/>
            grand criterion of moral rightness and wrongness. A few of his own words <lb/>
            will explain the essence of his system. " Man," says he, " from his make, <lb/>
            constitution, or nature, is, in the strictest and most proper sense, a law to <lb/>
            himself; he hath the rule of right within, and what is wanting is that he <lb/>
            honestly attend to it. Conscience does not only offer itself to show us the <lb/>
            way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it, that </note> <pb n="5"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP II.]</note><lb/>
            self-consistent, they can say nothing of the moral duties. <lb/>
            Neither can any firm, permanent, or natural rules of duty <lb/>
            be laid down, but by those who esteem virtue to be solely, <note type="footnote"> it is our natural guide-the guide assigned us by the Author of our nature. <lb/>
            It, therefore, belongs to our condition of being. It is our duty to walk in <lb/>
            that path, and to follow this guide, without looking about to see whether-we <lb/>
            may not possibly forsake them with impunity." — "Butler's Sermons," <lb/>
            Serm. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> With David Hume, who was contemporary with Butler, the principle <lb/>
            against which Cicero protests assumes a systematic character. The doc- <lb/>
            trine of the utility of actions, as that which constitutes them virtuous, was set <lb/>
            forth with the whole force of his genius and eloquence. How far Dr. Paley <lb/>
            acquiesces in the principles of Hume, and how far, on the other hand, he <lb/>
            may seem to have been a disciple of Butler, will be seen by two brief pass- <lb/>
            ages in his "Moral and Political Philosophy." A comparison of the two, <lb/>
            and especially a consideration of his attribution of an abstract moral cha- <lb/>
            racter to actions, will reveal the grand defects of Paley's ethical system. <lb/>
            The most masterly refutation of that system that ever appeared is to be found <lb/>
            in the ethical work of Jonathan Dymond, in which an irrefragable superstruc- <lb/>
            ture of practical morals is built, chiefly on the foundation of Dr. Butle . <lb/>
            The former of the passages referred to is as follows:—" We conclude that <lb/>
            God wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures; and this conclusion <lb/>
            being once established, we are at liberty to go on with the rule built upon <lb/>
            it, namely, ' that the method of coming at the will of God, concerning any <lb/>
            action, by the light of nature, is to inquire into the tendency of that action <lb/>
            to promote or diminish the general happiness.' So, then, actions are to <lb/>
            be estimated by their tendency. Whatever is expedient is right. It is the <lb/>
            utility of any moral rule alone which constitutes the obligation of it." The <lb/>
            second is as follows:-" Actions, in the abstract, are right or wrong accord- <lb/>
            ing to their tendency; the agent is virtuous or vicious according to his <lb/>
            design."—" Paley's Moral Philosophy," book 1, chaps. 5 and 6. </note><note type="footnote"> A still later philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, however, is the great <lb/>
            apostle of the principle of expediency as the foundation of ethics. His <lb/>
            theory, also, as to the basis of moral obligation, may be learned by two <lb/>
            characteristic passages:-" Nature has placed mankind under the govern- <lb/>
            ance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to <lb/>
            point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. <lb/>
            On the one hand, the standard of right and wrong; on the other, the chain <lb/>
            of causes and effects are fastened to their throne."—" Bentham's Introd. <lb/>
            of Morals," vol. 1, c. 1. And again:—" But is it never, then, from any <lb/>
            other consideration than that of utility that we derive our notions of right <lb/>
            and wrong? I do not know; I do not care. Whether moral sentiment <lb/>
            can be originally conceived from any other sense than a view of utility, is <lb/>
            one question: Whether, upon examination and reflection, it can, in point <lb/>
            of fact, be persisted in and justified on any other ground, by a person re- <lb/>
            flecting within, is another. Both are questions of speculation; it matters <lb/>
            not, comparatively, how they are decided."—Id. vol. 1, c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> In conclusion, the two most enlightened philosophers of modern times. <lb/>
            Dugald Stewart and Dr. Thomas Brown, have returned to the principle </note> <pb n="6"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            or by those who deem it to be chiefly, desirable for its own <lb/>
            sake. The teaching of duties, therefore, is the peculiar study <lb/>
            of the Stoics, of the Academics, and the Peripatetics; because <lb/>
            the sentiments of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Herillus, have been <lb/>
            long exploded. Yet even those professors would have been <lb/>
            entitled to have treated upon the duties of men, had they left <lb/>
            us any distinction of things, so that there might have been <lb/>
            a path open to the discovery of duty. We shall, therefore, <lb/>
            upon this occasion, and in this inquiry, chiefly follow the <lb/>
            Stoics, not as their expositors, but by drawing, as usual, <lb/>
            from their sources, at our own option and judgment, so much <lb/>
            and in such manner as we please.* I therefore think proper, <lb/>
            as my entire argument is on moral obligation, to define what <lb/>
            a duty is, a definition which I am surprised has been omitted <note type="footnote"> thus simply laid down by Cicero, in repudiation of the Epicurean theory, <lb/>
            that expediency, or its tendency to produce happiness, is the moral cri- <lb/>
            terion of actions, and have supported it by an unexam.pled array of pro- <lb/>
            found and ingenious argument and eloquent illustration. A single re- <lb/>
            conciling principle may be given in the words of Dugald Stewart :—" An <lb/>
            action may be said to be absolutely right, when it is in every respect <lb/>
            suitable to the circumstances in which the agent is placed ; or, in other <lb/>
            words, when it is such as, with perfectly good intentions, under the guid- <lb/>
            ance of an enlightened and well-informed understanding, he would have <lb/>
            performed. An action may be said to be relatively right, when the inten- <lb/>
            tions of the agent are sincerely good, whether his conduct be suitable to his <lb/>
            circumstances or not. According to these definitions, an action may be <lb/>
            right in one sense and wrong in another-an ambiguity in language, which, <lb/>
            how obvious soever, has not always been attended to by the writers on <lb/>
            morals. It is the relative rectitude of an action which determines the <lb/>
            moral desert of the agent; but it is its absolute rectitude which determines <lb/>
            its utility to his worldly interests and to the welfare of society. And it is <lb/>
            only so far as relative and absolute rectitude coincide, that utility can be <lb/>
            affirmed to be a quality of virtue."—" Outlines of Moral Philosophy," <lb/>
            part 2, see. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> ; A similar truth is enunciated by Sir Thomas Brown, in his " Christian <lb/>
            Morals," first published in 1716:—" Make not the consequence of virtue <lb/>
            the ends thereof. Be not beneficent for a name or cymbal of applause, <lb/>
            nor exact and just in commerce for the advantages of trust and credit., <lb/>
            which attend the reputation of true and punctual dealing ; for these re- <lb/>
            wards, though unsought for, plain virtue will bring with her. To have <lb/>
            other by-ends in good actions sours laudable performances, which must <lb/>
            have deeper roots, motives, and instigations, to give them the stamp of <lb/>
            virtues."—" Christian Morals," part 1, sec. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero, though generally adopting the principles of the Stoics, still <lb/>

            by Panætius, because every investigation which is rationally <lb/>
            undertaken, concerning any subject, ought to set out with a <lb/>
            definition, that it may be understood what is the subject of <lb/>
            discussion.</p>
          <p>III. All questions concerning duty are of two sorts. The <lb/>
            first relates to the final good; the second consists of those <lb/>
            rules which arc to regulate the practice of life in all its rela- <lb/>
            tions.* Examples of the former are as follow:-Whether <lb/>
            all duties are perfect in themselves ? Whether one duty is <lb/>
            of more importance than another ? together with other ques- <lb/>
            tions of the same nature. Now the rules for moral duties <lb/>
            relate, indeed, to the final good; but it is not so perceptible <lb/>
            that they do, because they seem chiefly to refer to the regu- <lb/>
            lation of ordinary life, and of them we are to treat in this <lb/>
            book.</p>
          <p>But there is another division of duty: for one is called <lb/>
            a mean duty, the other a perfect duty. If I mistake not, the <lb/>
            complete or perfect duty is the same with what we call a <lb/>
            direct one, and by the Greeks is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατόρθωμα</foreign>. As to <lb/>
            that duty which is mean they call it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθήϰον</foreign>, and they thus <lb/>
            define those terms. Whatever duty is absolute, that they <lb/>
            call a perfect duty; and they call that duty, for the per- <lb/>
            to the authority of any. Horace makes a similar profession respecting <lb/>
            himself- <lb/>
            " Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri, <lb/>
            Quo me cumque rapit tempestas deferor hospes." <lb/>

            ethics, or morality, as the ars vivendi, or doctrina bene vivendi; that <lb/>
            is, the art of living wisely. The term ethies is derived from the Greek <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠϑική</foreign>, which, in signification, is equivalent with the Latin mos, mores, <lb/>
            whence the adjective moralis, and the English word morals. Aristotle, in <lb/>
            the second book of his " Ethics," addressed to his son, Nichomachus, says <lb/>
            that moral science received the name of ethics from the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϑος</foreign>, <lb/>
            "habit, use, or custom," since it is from habitual experience, and the <lb/>
            routine of customary conduct, that moral dispositions and principles are <lb/>
            gradually formed and changed. Perhaps the definition of Dr. Thomas <lb/>
            Brown cannot be Improved : " Ethics is the science which relates to our <lb/>
            mutual affections, not simply as phenomena, but as they are virtuous or <lb/>
            vicious, right or wrong." </note> <pb n="8"/>

            formance of which a probable reason can be assigned, a <lb/>
            mean duty.*</p>
          <p>In the opinion, therefore, of Panætius, there is a threefold <lb/>
            consideration for determining our resolution; for men doubt <lb/>
            whether the thing which falls under their consideration be <lb/>
            of itself virtuous or disgraceful, and in this deliberation <lb/>
            minds are often distracted into opposite sentiments. They <lb/>
            then examine and deliberate whether or not the subject o <lb/>
            their consideration conduces to the convenience or enjoyment <lb/>
            of life, to the improvement of their estate and wealth, to their <lb/>
            interest and power, by which they may profit themselves <lb/>
            or their relations ; all which deliberation falls under the <lb/>
            category of utility. The third kind of doubtful deliberation <lb/>
            Is, when an apparent utility seems to clash with moral recti- <lb/>
            tude ; for when utility hurries us to itself, and virtue, on the <lb/>
            other hand, seems to call us back, it happens that the mind <lb/>
            is distracted in the choice, and these occasion a double <lb/>
            anxiety in deliberation. In this division (although an omission <lb/>
            is of the worst consequence in divisions of this kind), two <lb/>
            things are omitted; for we are accustomed to deliberate not <lb/>
            only whether a thing be virtuous or shameful in itself, but, <lb/>
            of two things that are virtuous, which is the more excellent ? <lb/>
            And, in like manner, of two things which are profitable <lb/>
            which is the more profitable ? Thus, it is found that the <lb/>
            deliberation, which he considered to be threefold, ought to <lb/>
            be distributed into five divisions. We must, therefore, first <lb/>
            treat of what is virtuous in itself, and that under two heads ; <lb/>
            in like manner, of what is profitable; and we shall next <lb/>
            treat of them comparatively.</p>
          <p>IV. In the first place, a disposition has been planted by <lb/>
            nature in every species of living creatures to cherish them- <lb/>
            selves, their life, and body; to avoid those things that appear <lb/>
            hurtful to them; and to look out for and procure whatever <note type="footnote"> * " It was thus that they (the Stoics) were obliged to invent a double <lb/>
            morality: one for mankind at large, from whom was expected no more <lb/>
            than the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθήκον</foreign>, which seems principally to have denoted acts of duty, <lb/>
            done from inferior or mixed motives; and the other, which they appear to <lb/>
            have hoped from their ideal wise man, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατόρθωμα</foreign>, or perfect observance <lb/>
            of rectitude, which consisted only in moral acts, done for mere reverence <lb/>
            for morality, unaided by any feelings; all which (without the exception of <lb/>
            pity) they classed among the enemies of reason and the disturbers of the <lb/>
            human soul."—Sir J. Mackintosh's " Progress of Ethical Philosophy." </note> <pb n="9"/>

            is necessary for their living, such as food, shelter, and the <lb/>
            like. Now the desire of union for the purpose of procreating <lb/>
            their own species is common to all animals, as well as a <lb/>
            certain degree of concern about what is procreated. But <lb/>
            the greatest distinction between a man and a brute lies in <lb/>
            this, that the latter is impelled only by instinct, and applies <lb/>
            itself solely to that object which is present and before it, <lb/>
            with very little sensibility to what is past or to come ;* but <note type="footnote"> * " It seems evident that animals, as well as men, learn many things from <lb/>
            experience, and infer that the same events will always follow from the <lb/>
            same causes. By this principle they become acquainted with the more <lb/>
            obvious properties of external objects, and gradually, from their birth, <lb/>
            treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire, water, earth, stones, heights, <lb/>
            depths, &amp;c., and of the effects which result from their operation. The <lb/>
            ignorance and inexperience of the young are here plainly distinguishable <lb/>
            from the cunning and sagacity of the old, who have learned by long obser- <lb/>
            vation to avoid what hurt them, and to pursue what gave ease or pleasure. <lb/>
            This is still more evident from the effects of discipline and education on <lb/>
            animals, who, by the proper application of rewards and punishments, may <lb/>
            be taught any course of action, the most contrary to their natural instincts <lb/>
            and propensities. Is it not experience which renders a dog apprehensive <lb/>
            of pain when you menace him, or lift up the whip to beat him ? Is it not <lb/>
            even experience which makes him answer to his name, and infer from such <lb/>
            an arbitrary sound that you mean him rather than any of his fellows, and <lb/>
            intend to call him when you pronounce it in a certain manner, and with a <lb/>
            certain tone and accent ? </note><note type="footnote"> " In all these cases we may observe,' that the animal infers some fact <lb/>
            beyond what immediately strikes his senses ; and that this inference is <lb/>
            altogether founded on past experience, while the creature expects from the <lb/>
            present object the same consequences which it has always found in its <lb/>
            observation to result from similar objects. </note><note type="footnote"> " But though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from obser- <lb/>
            vation, there are also many parts of it which they derive from the original <lb/>
            hand of Nature, which much exceed the share of capacity they possess, <lb/>
            on ordinary occasions, and in which they improve little or nothing by the <lb/>
            longest practice and experience. These we denominate INSTINCTS, and are <lb/>
            so apt to admire as something very extraordinary and inexplicable by all <lb/>
            the disquisitions of human understanding. But our wonder will perhaps <lb/>
            cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reasoning itself, <lb/>
            which we possess in common with beasts, and on which the whole conduct <lb/>
            of life depends, is nothing but a species of instinct, or mechanical power, <lb/>
            that acts in us unknown to ourselves, and in its chief operations is not <lb/>
            directed by any such relations or comparison of ideas as are the proper <lb/>
            objects of our intellectual faculties. Though the instinct be different, yet <lb/>
            still it is an instinct which teaches a man to avoid the fire, as much as that <lb/>
            which teaches a bird, with such exactness, the art of incubation, and the <lb/>
            whole economy and order of its nursery."—Hume's " Enquiry concerning <lb/>
            the Human Understanding," sec. 9. </note> <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            man, because endowed with reason, by which he discerns <lb/>
            consequences, looks into the causes of things and their <lb/>
            progress, and being acquainted, as it were, with precedents, <lb/>
            he compares their analogies, and adapts and connects the <lb/>
            present with what is to come. It is easy for him to foresee <lb/>
            the future direction of all his life, and therefore he prepares <lb/>
            whatever is necessary for passing through it.</p>
          <p>Nature, likewise, by the same force of reason, conciliates <lb/>
            man to man, in order to a community both of language and <lb/>
            of life: above all, it implants in them a strong love for their <lb/>
            offspring ; it impels them to desire that companies and <lb/>
            societies should be formed, and that they should mingle in <lb/>
            them ; and that for those reasons, man should take care to <lb/>
            provide for the supply of clothing and of food; and that not <lb/>
            only for himself, but for his wife, his children, and for all <lb/>
            whom he ought to hold dear and to protect. This is an <lb/>
            affection which arouses the spirit and makes it more strenuous <lb/>
            for action.</p>
          <p>The distinguishing property of man is to seareh for and <lb/>
            to follow after truth. Therefore, when relaxed from our <lb/>
            necessary cares and concerns, we then covet to see, to hear, <lb/>
            and to learn somewhat; and we esteem knowledge of things <lb/>
            either obscure or wonderful to be the indispensable means <lb/>
            of living happily.* From this we understand that truth, <lb/>
            simplicity, and candour, are most agreeable to the nature <lb/>
            of mankind. To this passion for discovering truth, is. <lb/>
            added a desire to direct; for a mind, well formed by na- <lb/>
            ture, is unwilling to obey any man but him who lays down <lb/>
            rules and instructions to it, or who, for the general advan- <lb/>
            tage, exercises equitable and lawful government. From this <note type="footnote"> * " Nature has made it delightful to man to know, disquieting to him <lb/>
            to know only imperfectly, while anything remains in his power that can <lb/>
            make his knowledge more accurate or comprehensive; and she has done <lb/>
            more than all this: she has not waited till we reflect on the pleasure which <lb/>
            we are to enjoy, or the pain which we are to suffer. It is sufficient that <lb/>
            there is something unknown which has a relation to something that is <lb/>
            known to us. We feel instantly the desire of knowing this too. We have <lb/>
            a desire of knowledge which nothing can abate; a desire that in some <lb/>
            greater or less degree extends itself to everything which we are capable of <lb/>
            knowing, and not to realities merely but to all the extravagancies of <lb/>
            fiction."—Dr. Thomas Brown's "Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human <lb/>

            rests.*</p>
          <p>Neither is it a mean privilege of nature and reason, that <lb/>
            man is the only animal who is sensible of order, of decency, <lb/>
            and of propriety, both in acting and speaking. In like manner, <lb/>
            no other creature perceives the beauty, the gracefulness, and <lb/>
            the harmony of parts, in those objects which are discerned <lb/>
            by the sight. An analogous perception to which nature and <lb/>
            reason convey from the sight to the mind; and consider that <lb/>
            beauty, regularity, and order in counsels and actions should <lb/>
            be still more preserved. She is cautious not to do aught <lb/>
            that is indecent or effeminate, or to act or think wantonly <lb/>
            in any of our deliberations or deeds. The effect and result <lb/>
            of all this produces that honestum which we are now in search <lb/>
            of; that virtue which is honourable even without being <lb/>
            ennobled; and of which we may truly say, that even were <lb/>
            it praised by none it would be commendable in itself.</p>
          <p>V. My Son Marcus, you here perceive at least a sketch, <lb/>
            and, as it were, the outline of virtue; which, could we perceive <lb/>
            her with our eyes,† would, as Plato says, kindle a wonderful <lb/>
            love of wisdom. But whatever is virtuous arises from some <lb/>
            one of those four divisions: for it consists either in sagacity <lb/>
            and the perception of truth; or in the preservation of human <lb/>
            society, by giving to every man his due, and by observing <lb/>
            the faith of contracts; or in the greatness and firmness of <lb/>
            an elevated and unsubdued mind; or in observing order and <lb/>
            regularity in all our words and in all our actions, in which <lb/>
            consists moderation and temperance. <note type="footnote"> * The same sentiment, with reference to the love of knowledge, is more <lb/>
            beautifully expressed by Virgil :— <lb/>
            "Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas; <lb/>
            Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum <lb/>
            Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari." <lb/>

              discern wisdom; if it did, what a glow of love would she kindle within us.' <lb/>
              The reader may, perhaps, observe with what propriety Cicero applies to <lb/>
              virtue what Plato says of wisdom."—Guthrie. </note> <note type="margin">CHAP V.]</note><pb n="12"/>
              </p>
          <p>Though these four divisions are connected and interwoven <lb/>
            with one another, yet certain kinds of duties arise from each <lb/>
            of them. As, for instance, in that part which I first de- <lb/>
            scribed, and under which I comprehend sagacity or wisdom, <lb/>
            consists the search after and discovery of truth; and this is <lb/>
            the characteristic function of that virtue: for the man who <lb/>
            is most sagacious in discovering the real truth in any subject, <lb/>
            and who can, with the greatest perspicacity and quickness, <lb/>
            both see and explain the grounds of it, is justly esteemed <lb/>
            a man of the greatest understanding and discernment. From <lb/>
            hence it follows that truth is, as it were, the subject matter <lb/>
            which this faculty handles, and on which it employs itself. <lb/>
            As to the other three virtues, they necessarily consist in <lb/>
            acquiring and preserving those things with which the conduct <lb/>
            of life is connected, in order to preserve the community and <lb/>
            relations of mankind, and to display that excellence and <lb/>
            greatness of soul, which exhibits itself as well in acquiring <lb/>
            resources and advantages both for ourselves and for our <lb/>
            friends, as, still more conspicuously, in prop rly disregarding <lb/>
            them. As to order, resolution, moderation, and the like, <lb/>
            they come into that rank of virtues which require not only <lb/>
            an operation of the mind, but a certain degree of personal <lb/>
            activity; for it is in observing order end moderation in those <lb/>
            things which constitute the objects of active life, that we <lb/>
            shall preserve virtue and decency.</p>
          <p>VI. Now, of the four divisions under which I have ranged <lb/>
            the nature and essence of virtue, that which consists in the <lb/>
            knowledge of truth principally affects the nature of man. <lb/>
            For all of us are impelled and carried along to the love of <lb/>
            knowledge and learning, in which we account it glorious to <lb/>
            excel, but consider every slip, mistake, ignorance, and de- <lb/>
            ception in it, to be hurtful and shameful. In this pursuit, <lb/>
            which is both natural and virtuous, two faults are to be <lb/>
            avoided. The first is, the regarding things which we do not <lb/>
            know as if they were understood by us, and thence rashly <lb/>
            giving them our assent.* And he that wishes, as every <lb/>
            man ought to wish, to avoid this error, must devote both <lb/>
            his time and nis industry to the study of things. The other <lb/>
            fault is, that some people bestow too much study and pains <note type="footnote"> * " The highest perfection of human reason is to know that there is an <lb/>
            infinity of truth beyond its reach."—Pascal. </note> <pb n="13"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP VII.]</note><lb/>
            upon things that are obscure,* difficult, and even immaterial <lb/>
            in themselves. When those faults are avoided, all the pains <lb/>
            and care a man bestows upon studies that are virtuous in <lb/>
            themselves, and worthy of his knowledge, will be deservedly <lb/>
            commended. Thus we have heard how Caius Sulpiciust ex- <lb/>
            celled in astronomy, and Sextus Pompeius, to my own know- <lb/>
            ledge, in mathematics; many also in logic, and more in the <lb/>
            civil law, all which are arts that serve to investigate truth, <lb/>
            in the pursuit of which our duty forbids us to be diverted <lb/>
            from transacting our business, because the whole glory of <lb/>
            virtue consists in activity. Yet this is often intermitted, <lb/>
            and frequent are our returns to our studies. Then there is <lb/>
            an incessant working of the mind, which, without our taking <lb/>
            pains, is sufficient to keep us in the practice of thinking. <lb/>
            Now, all our thoughts, and every motion of the mind, should <lb/>
            be devoted either to the forming of plans for virtuous <lb/>
            actions, and such as belong to a good and a happy life, or <lb/>
            else to the pursuits of science and knowledge. I have now <lb/>
            treated of at least the first source of duty.</p>
          <p>VII. Now, as to the other three, the most extensive system <lb/>
            is that by which the mutual society of mankind, and, as it <lb/>
            were, the intercourse of life, is preserved. Of this there are <lb/>
            two parts: justice, in which virtue displays itself with the <lb/>
            most distinguished lustre, and from which men are termed <lb/>
            good; and allied to this, beneficence, which may likewise be <lb/>
            termed benevolence, or liberality. Now, the chief province <lb/>
            of justice is, that no person injure another, unless he is pro- <note type="footnote"> * " The emperor Antoninus very finely thanks the gods, that when he <lb/>

            matters of private property. Thus, as every man holds his <lb/>
            own, each should possess that portion which fell to his share <lb/>
            of those things that by nature were common ; and it follows, <lb/>
            that no man can covet another's property without violating <lb/>
            the laws of humau society.†</p>
          <p>But (as has been strikingly said by Plato) we are not <lb/>
            born for ourselves alone, and our country claims her share, <lb/>
            and our friends their share of us ; and, as the Stoics hold, <note type="footnote"> * "Dictat autem ratio homini (says Grotius, de Jure Belli ac Paris, lib. 2, <lb/>
            cap. 20, § 5) nihil agendum quod nocėatur homini alteri, nisi id bonum <lb/>
            habeat aliquid propositum. In solo autem inimici dolore, ita nudè spectato, <lb/>
            nullum est bonum nisi falsum et imaginarium : Now, reason tells men <lb/>
            that we should do no hurt to another man, unless it is to serve some good <lb/>
            end, for, from the mere pain of another person, there can result no good <lb/>
            but what is mistaken and imaginary."—Vid plura in loco cit. <lb/>
            t This subject has been extensively investigated by modern moralists <lb/>
            and jurists. Paley, in one of his chapters on property, adduces and <lb/>
            comments upon the principal theories that have been advanced. Those of' <lb/>
            Mr. Locke. and of Paley himself, may be briefly given in the words of the <lb/>
            latter. " Each man's limbs and labour are his own exclusively ; by occu- <lb/>
            pying a piece of ground a man inseparably mixes his labour with it, by <lb/>
            which means the piece of ground becomes thenceforward his own, as you <lb/>
            cannot take it from him without depriving him at the same time of some- <lb/>
            thing which is indisputably his." This is Mr. Locke's solution. Dr. Paley <lb/>
            adds :—" The real foundation of our right (i. e. to private property) is <lb/>
            THE LAW OF THE LAND. It is the intention of God that the produce of <lb/>
            the earth be applied to the use of man ; this intention cannot be fulfilled <lb/>
            without establishing property ; it is consistent, therefore, with his will that <lb/>
            property be established. The land cannot be divided into separate pro- <lb/>
            perty without leaving it to the law of the country to regulate that division; <lb/>
            it is consistent therefore with the same will, that the law should regulate <lb/>
            the division ; and consequently, ' consistent with the will of God,' or 'right,' <lb/>
            that I should possess that share which these regulations assign me. By <lb/>
            whatever circuitous train of reasoning you attempt to derive this right, <lb/>
            it must terminate at last in the will of God ; the straightest, therefore, <lb/>
            and shortest way of arriving at this will, is the best.—Paley's " Moral and <lb/>
            Political Philosophy," book 3, chap. 4. </note> <pb n="15"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP VIII.]</note><lb/>
            all that the earth produces is created for the use of mau, so <lb/>
            men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutually <lb/>
            do good to one another; in this we ought to take nature for <lb/>
            our guide, to throw into the public stock the offices of general <lb/>
            utility by a reciprocation of duties ; sometimes by receiving, <lb/>
            sometimes by giving, and sometimes to cement human society <lb/>
            by arts, by industry, and by our resources.</p>
          <p>Now the foundation of justice is faithfulness, which is a <lb/>
            perseverance and truth in all our declarations and in all our <lb/>
            promises. Let us therefore (though some people may think it <lb/>
            over nice) imitate the Stoics, who curiously examine whence <lb/>
            terms are derived, and consider that the wordfides, or faith- <lb/>
            fulness, is no other than a performance of what we have <lb/>
            promised.* But there are two kinds of injustice; the first <lb/>
            is of those who offer an injury, the second of those who have <lb/>
            it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it <lb/>
            is offered, and yet do it not. For if a man, prompted either <lb/>
            by anger or any sudden perturbation, unjustly assaults another <lb/>
            man, such a one seems as it were to lay violent hands on <lb/>
            one's ally ; and the man who does not repel or withstand the <lb/>
            injury, if he can, is as much to blame as if he deserted the <lb/>
            cause of his parents, his friends, or his country.</p>
          <p>Those wrongs, however, which are inflicted for the very <lb/>
            purpose of doing an injury, often proceed from fear ; as for <lb/>
            instance, when a man who is contriving to injure another is <lb/>
            afraid, unless he executes what he is meditating, that he may <lb/>
            himself sustain some disadvantage ; but the great incentive <lb/>
            to doing wrong is to obtain what one desires, and in this <lb/>
            crime avarice is the most pervading motive.</p>
          <p>VIH. Now riches are sought after, both for the necessary <lb/>
            purposes of life and for the enjoyment of pleasure. But in <lb/>
            men of greater minds the coveting of money is with a view <lb/>
            to power and to the means of giving gratification. As M. <lb/>
            Crassus lately used to declare, that no man who wanted to <lb/>
            have a direction in the government had money enough, unless <lb/>
            by the interest of it he could maintain an army. Mag- <lb/>
            nificent equipages, likewise, and a style of living made up <lb/>
            of elegance and abundance give delight, and hence the <lb/>
            desire for money becomes boundless. Nor indeed is the <note type="footnote"> * Fides, quia fiat quod dictum est. </note> <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            mere desire to improve one's private fortune, without injury <lb/>
            to another, deserving of blame ; but injustice must ever be <lb/>
            avoided.</p>
          <p>But the main cause why most men are led to a forgetful- <lb/>
            ness of justice is their falling into a violent ambition after <lb/>
            empire, honours, and glory. For what Ennius observes, that <lb/>
            " No social bonds, no public faith remains <lb/>
            Inviolate ;"— <lb/>
            has a still more extensive application ; for where the object <lb/>
            of ambition is of such a nature as that several cannot ob- <lb/>
            tain pre-eminence, the contest for it is generally so violent, <lb/>
            that nothing can be more difficult than to preserve the sacred <lb/>
            ties of society. This was shown lately in the presumption <lb/>
            of C. Coesar, who, in order to obtain that direction in the <lb/>
            government which the wildness of his imagination had <lb/>
            planned out, violated all laws, divine and human. But what <lb/>
            is deplorable in this matter is, that the desire after honour, <lb/>
            empire, power, and glory, is generally most prevalent in the <lb/>
            greatest soul and the most exalted genius ;* for which <lb/>
            reason every crime of that sort is the more carefully to be <lb/>
            guarded against. But in every species of injustice it is a <lb/>
            very material question, whether it is committed through some <lb/>
            agitation of passion, which commonly is short-lived and tem- <lb/>
            porary, or from deliberate, prepense, malice; for those things <lb/>
            which proceed from a short, sudden fit, are of slighter moment <lb/>
            than those which are inflicted by forethought and prepara- <lb/>
            tion. But enough has been said concerning inflicting injury.</p>
          <p>IX. Various are the causes of men omitting the defence <lb/>
            of others, or neglecting their duty towards them. They are <lb/>
            either unwilling to encounter enmity, toil, or expense ; or, <lb/>
            perhaps, they do it through negligence, listlessness, or lazi- <lb/>
            ness ; or they are so embarrassed in certain studies and <lb/>
            pursuits, that they suffer those they ought to protect to be <lb/>
            neglected. Hence we must take care lest Plato's observa- <lb/>
            tion with respect to philosophers should be falsified : " That <note type="footnote"> * Milton thus expresses a similar idea,- <lb/>
            " Fame is the spur which the clear spirit doth raise <lb/>
            (That last infirmity of noble mind) <lb/>
            To scorn delights and live laborious days."—Lycidas </note> <pb n="17"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP IX.]</note><lb/>
            they are men of integrity, because they are solely engaged in <lb/>
            the pursuit of truth, and despise and neglect those con- <lb/>
            siderations which others value, and which mankind are wont <lb/>
            to contend for amongst themselves." For, while they abstain <lb/>
            from hurting any by the infliction of injury, they indeed <lb/>
            assert one species of honesty or justice, but they fail in <lb/>
            another; because, being entangled in the pursuits of learn- <lb/>
            in-, they abandon those they ought to protect. Some, <lb/>
            therefore, think that they would have no concern with the <lb/>
            government unless they were forced to it; but still, it would <lb/>
            be more just that it should be done voluntarily; for an <lb/>
            action which is intrinsically right is only morally good in <lb/>
            so far as it is voluntary.* There are others who, either from <lb/>
            a desire to improve their private fortune, or from some per- <lb/>
            sonal resentments, pretend that they mind their own affairs <lb/>
            only that they may'appear not to do wrong to another. Now <lb/>
            such persons are free from one kind of injustice, but fall <lb/>
            into another ; because they abandon the fellowship of life by <lb/>
            employing in it none of their zeal, none of their labour, none <lb/>
            of their abilities. Having thus stated the two kinds of dis- <lb/>
            honesty or injustice, and assigned the motives for each kind, <lb/>
            and settled previously the considerations by which justice is <lb/>
            limited, we shall easily (unless we are extremely selfish) be <lb/>
            able to form a judgment of our duty on every occasion.</p>
          <p>For, to concern ourselves in other people's affairs is a <lb/>
            delicate matter. Yet Chremes, a character in Terence, <lb/>
            thinks, that there is nothing which has a relation to mankind <lb/>
            in which he has not a concern.† Meanwhile, because we <lb/>
            have the quicker perception and sensation of whatever <lb/>
            happens favourably or untowardly to ourselves than to <lb/>
            others, which we see as it were at a greater distance, the <note type="footnote"> * The principle of the spontaneousness and intelligence of all actions <lb/>
            being essential to their moral character, seems, if it be admitted, at once <lb/>
            fatal to those numerous schemes of ethics, which make the moral character <lb/>
            of conduct to depend on its essential utility ;-inasmuch as on the latt r <lb/>
            showing a morally good action may not only be performed under com- <lb/>
            pulsion, but oven with the deliberate and sole intention of producing the <lb/>
            opposite results, namely, those which are in every aspect the mest <lb/>
            mischievous. </note><note type="footnote"> t Heautontimorumenos, Act I., Scene 1 : Homo sum : humari nibil <lb/>

            judgment we form of them is very different from what we <lb/>
            form of ourselves. Those therefore are wise monitors who <lb/>
            teach us to do nothing of which we are doubtful, whether it <lb/>
            is honest or unjust ; for whatever is honest manifests itself <lb/>
            by its own lustre, but doubt implies the entertainment of <lb/>
            injustice.</p>
          <p>X. But occasions frequently happen in which those duties <lb/>
            which are most worthy of an honest, and of such as we call <lb/>
            a worthy man, are altered and changed to their contraries. <lb/>
            For example, to return a deposit, to perform a promise, and <lb/>
            other matters that are relative to truth and honesty, some- <lb/>
            times alter so, that it is just they should not be observed ; for <lb/>
            it is proper to have recourse to those fundamentals of honesty <lb/>
            which I laid down in the commencement: in the first place, <lb/>
            that of injuring no person ; and, secondly, that of being sub- <lb/>
            servient to the public good. When these conditions are <lb/>
            altered by circumstances, the moral obligation, not being in- <lb/>
            variably identical, is similarly altered.</p>
          <p>A promise, as a paction, may happen to be made, the <lb/>
            performance of which may be prejudicial either to the party <lb/>
            promising, or to the party to whom the promise is made. <lb/>
            For (as we see in the play) had not Neptune performed his <lb/>
            promise to Theseus, the latter would not have been bereaved <lb/>
            of his son, Hippolytus ; for it is recorded, that of three wishes <lb/>
            to be granted him, the third, which he made in a passion, <lb/>
            was the death of Hippolytus, which, having been granted, <lb/>
            he sunk into the most dreadful distress. Therefore, you <lb/>
            are not to perform those promises which may be prejudicial <lb/>
            to the party to whom you promise, nor if they may be more <lb/>
            hurtful to you than they can be serviceable to him. It is <lb/>
            inconsistent with our duty that the greater obligation should <lb/>
            be postponed to the less. For instance, suppose you should <lb/>
            promise to appear as the advocate of another person while <lb/>
            his cause is depending: now, if your son was to be seized <lb/>
            violently ill in the meantime, it would be no breach of duty <note type="footnote">received in the theatre. He himself has left us an expansion of the same <lb/>
            idea in the following words :— </note><note type="footnote"> " Omnis homo est omni homini proximus, nec ulla cogitanda est longin- <lb/>
            quitas generis ubi est natura communis." </note><note type="footnote"> " Every man is most closely connected with his every fellow man, nor <lb/>
            should any distance of relationship enter into consideration where there is a <lb/>
            common nature." </note> <pb n="19"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP X.]</note><lb/>
            in you not to perform what you promise ; the other person <lb/>
            would rather depart from his duty if he should complain that <lb/>
            he had been abandoned. Who, then, does not see that a man <lb/>
            is not bound by those promises which he makes either when <lb/>
            coerced by fear,* or seduced by deceit ? Many such promises <lb/>
            are cancelled by the edict of the prætor's court, some by the <lb/>
            laws; for very often wrongs arise through a quirk, and through <lb/>
            a too artful but fraudulent construction of the law. Hence, <lb/>
            " the rigour of law is the rigour of injustice," is a saying that <lb/>
            has now passed into a proverb. Many injuries of this kind <lb/>
            happen even in state affairs: thus, when a general had con- <lb/>
            cluded a truce with his enemy for thirty days, yet ravaged <lb/>
            that enemy's territories every night, because the truce was <lb/>
            only for so many days, not for the nights. Nor, indeed, if <lb/>
            it is true, is the conduct of our countryman, Quintus Fabius <lb/>
            Labeo, to be approved of, or whoever he was (for I have <lb/>
            the story only by report), who, being appointed an arbiter <lb/>
            by the senate to settle a boundary between the people of <lb/>
            Nola and those of Naples, counselled each of those people <lb/>
            separately to do nothing covetously, and that each ought <lb/>
            rather to draw back than advance. Both of them taking <lb/>
            this advice, a space of unoccupied ground was left in the <lb/>
            middle. He, therefore, adjudged to each people the boundary <lb/>
            to which they had confined themselves, and all that was in <lb/>
            the middle to the people of Rome. This was not to give <lb/>
            judgment but to cheat; wherefore we ought to avoid all <lb/>
            chicane of that kind in every transaction. † <note type="footnote"> * See conclusion of Note, pp. 19, 20. </note><note type="footnote"> † With these imperfect, and in some respects most faulty, notions touch- <lb/>
            ing the obligations of promises, it will be instructive to compare the prin- <lb/>
            ciples of modern moralists. The following is a brief digest of these principles <lb/>
            as given by Paley (" Moral and Political Philosophy," book 3, chap. 5):— <lb/>
            " They who argue from innate moral principles, suppose a sense of the <lb/>
            obligation of promises to be one of them; but without assuming this, or any- <lb/>
            thing else, without proof, the obligation to perform promises may be deduced <lb/>
            from the necessity of such a conduct to the well-being, or the existence, <lb/>
            indeed, of human society. </note><note type="footnote"> " Men act from expectation. Expectation is, in most cases, determined <lb/>
            by the assurances and engagements which are received from others. If no <lb/>
            dependence could be placed upon these assurances, it would be impossible <lb/>
            to know what judgment to form of many future events, or how to regulate <lb/>
            our conduct with respect to them. Confidence, therefore, in promises is <lb/>
            essential to the intercourse of human life; because without it the greatest </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <note type="margin">CHAP X.]</note><pb n="20"/>
             </p>
          <p>XI. Certain duties are also to be observed, even towards <lb/>
            those who have wronged you; for there is a mean even in <lb/>
            revenge and punishments. Nay, I am not certain whether <note type="footnote"> part of our conduct would proceed upon chance. But there could be no <lb/>
            confidence in promises, if men were not obliged to perform them; the obli- <lb/>
            gation, therefore, to perform promises is essential to the same ends, and in <lb/>
            the same degree. Where the terms of promise admit of more senses than <lb/>
            one, the promise is to be performed ‘ in that sense in which the promiser <lb/>
            apprehended at the time that the promisee received it.'" Dr. Paley sums <lb/>
            up his argument in the following words:—" From the account we have <lb/>
            given of the obligation of promises, it is evident that this obligation depends <lb/>
            upon the expectations which we knowingly and voluntarily excite. Conse- <lb/>
            quently, any action or conduct towards another, which we are sensible excites <lb/>
            expectations in that other, is as much a promise, and creates as strict an <lb/>
            obligation, as the most express assurances." The exceptions which Paley <lb/>
            admits to the obligation of promises are the following:—" 1. Promises are <lb/>
            not binding where the performance is impossible. 2. Promises are not <lb/>
            binding where the performance is unlawful. 3. Promises are not binding <lb/>
            where they contradict a former promise. 4. Promises are not binding <lb/>
            before acceptance; that is, before notice given to the promisee. 5. Pro- <lb/>
            mises are not binding which are released by the promisee. And, 6. Erro- <lb/>
            neous promises are not binding in certain cases; as where the error proceeds <lb/>
            from the mistake or misrepresentation of the promisee; or, secondly, When <lb/>
            the promise is understood by the promisee to proceed upon a certain sup- <lb/>
            position, or when the promiser apprehended it to be so understood, and that <lb/>
            supposition turns out to be false; then the promise is not binding." It is <lb/>
            only necessary to cite another passage with reference to extorted promises. <lb/>
            It seems obvious here to remark, that in the case of promises, or even de- <lb/>
            clarations, unjustly extorted-as by the highwayman or the inquisitor-a <lb/>
            doubt may very naturally arise, whether the absence of all right on the <lb/>
            part of the extorting party, does not involve a correlative freedom on the <lb/>
            part of the victim, to declare the truth, or to fulfil the promise. This point <lb/>
            Dr. Paley leaves (unnecessarily, as I think) undecided. " It has," he says, <lb/>
            " long been controverted amongst moralists, whether promises be binding <lb/>
            which are extorted by violence or fear. The obligation of all promises re- <lb/>
            sults, we have seen, from the necessity or the use of that confidence which <lb/>
            mankind repose in them. The question, therefore, whether these promises <lb/>
            are binding, will depend upon this : whether mankind, upon the whole, are <lb/>
            benefited by the confidence placed on such promises? A highwayman <lb/>
            attacks you, and being disappointed of his booty, threatens or prepares to <lb/>
            murder you. You promise, with many solemn asseverations, that if he will <unclear/> <lb/>
            spare your life he shall find a purse of money left for him at a place ap- <lb/>
            pointed. Upon the faith of this promise he forbears from further violence. <lb/>
            Now, your life was saved by the confidence reposed in a promise extorted <lb/>
            by fear; and the lives of many others may be saved by the same. This is <lb/>
            a good consequence. On the other hand, confidence in promises like these <lb/>
            greatly facilitates the perpetration of robberies; they may be made the in- <lb/>
            struments of almost unlimited extortion. This is a bad consequence; and <lb/>
            in the question between the importance of these opposite consequence <lb/>
            resides the doubt concerning the obligations of such promises." </note> <pb n="21"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note><lb/>
            it is not sufficient for the person who has injured you to <lb/>
            repent of the wrong done, so that he may never be guilty of <lb/>
            the like in future, and that others may not be so forward to <lb/>
            offend in the same manner.* Now, in government the laws <lb/>
            of war are to be most especially observed; for since there are <lb/>
            two manners of disputing, one by debating, the other by <lb/>
            fighting, though the former characterises men, the latter, <lb/>
            brutes, if the former cannot be adopted, recourse must be had <lb/>
            to the latter. Wars, therefore, are to be undertaken for this <lb/>
            end, that we may live in peace without being injured; but <lb/>
            when we obtain the victory, we must preserve those enemies <lb/>
            who behaved without cruelty or inhumanity during the war: <lb/>
            for example, our forefathers received, even as members of <lb/>
            their state, the Tuscans, the .AEqui, the Volscians, the Sabines, <lb/>
            and the Hernici, but utterly destroyed Carthage and Nu- <lb/>
            mantia. I am unwilling to mention Corinth; but I believe <lb/>
            they had some object in it, and particularly they were induced <lb/>
            to destroy it, lest the advantages of its situation should invite <lb/>
            the inhabitants to make war in future times. In my opinion, <lb/>
            we ought always to consult for peace, which should have in <lb/>
            it nothing of perfidy. Had my voice been followed on this <lb/>
            head, we might still have had some form of government (if <lb/>
            not the best), whereas now we have none. And, while we <lb/>
            are bound to exercise consideration toward those whom we <lb/>
            have conquered by force, so those should be received into our <lb/>
            protection who throw themselves upon the honour of our <note type="footnote">* "The insolence and brutality of anger, when we indulge its fury <lb/>
            without check or restraint is, of all objects, the most detestable. But we <lb/>
            admire that noble and generous resentment which governs its pursuit of the <lb/>
            greatest injuries, not by the rage which they are apt to excite in the breast <lb/>
            of the sufferer, but by the indignation which they naturally call forth in <lb/>
            that of the impartial spectator ; which allows no word, no gesture, to <lb/>
            escape it beyond what this more equitable sentiment would dictate ; which <lb/>
            never, even in thought, attempts any greater vengeance, nor desires to <lb/>
            inflict any greater punishment, than what every indifferent person would <lb/>
            rejoice to see executed."—Smith's " Moral Sentiments," part 1, chap. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> " The nobleness of pardoning appears, upon many occasions, superior even <lb/>

            general, and lay down their arms, even though the battering <lb/>
            rams should have struck their walls. In which matter justice <lb/>
            was cultivated with so much care among our countrymen, <lb/>
            that it was a custom among our ancestors that they who <lb/>
            received under their protection cities, or nations conquered <lb/>
            in war, became their patrons.</p>
          <p>Now, the justice of war was most religiously pointed out <lb/>
            by the fecial law of the Romans. From this it may be <lb/>
            understood that no war is just unless it is undertaken to <lb/>
            reclaim property,* or unless it is solemnly denounced and <lb/>
            proclaimed beforehand. Popilius, as general, held a province <lb/>
            where Cato's son served in his army. It happened that <lb/>
            Popilius thought proper to disband one legion ; he dismissed, <lb/>
            at the same time, Cato's son, who was serving in that legion. <lb/>
            When, however, through love of a military life, he remained <lb/>
            in the army, his father wrote to Popilius, that if he suffered <lb/>
            him to continue in the service he should, for a second time <lb/>
            bind him by the military oath ; because the obligation of the <lb/>
            former having been annulled, he could not lawfully fight with <lb/>
            the enemy.</p>
          <p>So very strict was their observance of laws in making <lb/>
            war. There is extant a letter of old Cato to his soil on <lb/>
            this occasion, in which he writes, " That he heard he had got <lb/>
            his discharge from the consul, while he was serving as a <lb/>
            soldier in Macedonia, during the war with Perseus. He, <lb/>
            therefore, enjoins him to take care not to enter upon action ; <lb/>
            for he declares that it is not lawful for a man who is not <lb/>
            a soldier to fight with an enemy.</p>
          <p>XII. And, indeed, there is another thing that I should <lb/>
            observe, that he who ought properly be termed perduellis, <lb/>
            that is, a stubborn foe, is called a hostis, and thereby the <lb/>
            softness of the appellation lessens the horror of the thing ; for <lb/>
            by our ancestors he was called hostis whom we now call a <lb/>
            stranger. This the twelve tables demonstrate: as in the <note type="footnote"> * To reclaim property, ℱc.] " The formal and public declaration of war <lb/>
            was an indispensable preliminary to it among the Romans. This decla- <lb/>
            ration was either conditional or simple. The conditional was when it was <lb/>
            made cum rerum repetitione, which sometimes not only implied satisfaction <lb/>
            for property but punishment upon the offender. A simple declaration was <lb/>
            without any condition, as when an injury could not be repaired ; or when <lb/>
            war was first declared by the other party."—See Grotius, lib. 3. chap. 3. <lb/>
            De Jure Belli, ℱc.—Guthrie. </note> <pb n="23"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XIII.]</note><lb/>
            words, "a day appointed for the hostis to plead;" and again, <lb/>
            "a Roman's right of property, as against a hostis, never <lb/>
            terminates." What can exceed the gentleness of this, to call <lb/>
            those with whom you were at war by so soft an appellation ? <lb/>
            It is true that length of time has affixed a harsher significa- <lb/>
            tion to this word, which has now ceased to be applied to the <lb/>
            stranger, and remains peculiar to him who carries arms <lb/>
            against us.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, when we fight for empire, and when we <lb/>
            seek glory in arms, all those grounds of war which I have <lb/>
            already enumerated to be just ones, must absolutely be in <lb/>
            force. But wars that are founded upon the glory of con- <lb/>
            quest alone, are to be carried on with less rancour; for, as <lb/>
            we treat a fellow citizen in a different manner as a foe, than <lb/>
            we do as an antagonist;-as with the latter the struggle is <lb/>
            for glory and power, as the former for life and reputation;- <lb/>
            thus we fought against the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians <lb/>
            as against enemies, the question being not who should com- <lb/>
            mand but who should exist; but we fought for empire <lb/>
            against the Latines, the Sabines, the Samnites, the Cartha- <lb/>
            ginians, and Pyrrhus. The Carthaginians, 'tis true, were <lb/>
            faithless, and Hannibal was cruel, but the others were better <lb/>
            principled. The speech of Pyrrhus about ransoming the <lb/>
            captives is a noble one:-</p>
          <p>In war not crafty, but in battle bold, <lb/>
            No wealth I value, and I spurn at gold. <lb/>
            Be steel the only metal shall decree <lb/>
            The fate of empire, or to you or me. <lb/>
            The gen'rous conquest be by courage tried, <lb/>
            And all the captives on the Roman side, <lb/>
            I swear, by all the gods of open war, <lb/>
            As fate their lives, their freedom I will spare.</p>
          <p>This sentiment is truly noble, and worthy the descendant of <lb/>
            the Æacidæ.</p>
          <p>XIII. Nay, if even private persons should, induced by <lb/>
            circumstances, make a promise to the enemy, even in this <lb/>
            fidelity should be observed. Thus Regulus, when be was <lb/>
            made a prisoner by the Carthaginians in the first Punic war, <lb/>
            being sent to Rome to treat of an exchange of prisoners, <lb/>
            he swore that he would return. The first thing he did when <lb/>
            he came to Rome was to deliver his opinion in the senate <pb n="24"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            that the prisoners should not be restored; and after that, <lb/>
            when he was detained by his relations and friends, he chose <lb/>
            to deliver himself up to a cruel death rather than to falsify <lb/>
            his word to the enemy.</p>
          <p>But in the second Punic war, after the battle of Cannæ, <lb/>
            Hannibal sent ten Romans to Rome, under an oath that they <lb/>
            would return to him unless they procured the prisoners to <lb/>
            be ransomed ; but the censors disfranchised, as long as they <lb/>
            lived, all of them that were perjured, as well as him who <lb/>
            had devised a fraudulent evasion of his oath. For when, by <lb/>
            the leave of Hannibal, he had left the camp, he returned <lb/>
            soon after, to say that he had forgotten something; and then <lb/>
            again leaving the camp he considered himself free from the <lb/>
            obligations of his oath, which he was with regard to the <lb/>
            words but not the meaning of them; for in a promise, what <lb/>
            you thought, and not what you said, is always to be consi- <lb/>
            dered.* But our forefathers set us a most eminent example <lb/>
            of justice towards an enemy; for when a deserter from <lb/>
            Pyrrhus offered to the senate to despatch that prince by <lb/>
            poison, the senate and C. Fabricius delivered the traitor up <lb/>
            to Pyrrhus. Thus they disapproved of taking off by treachery <lb/>
            an enemy who was powerful, and was carrying on against <lb/>
            them an aggressive war.</p>
          <p>Enough has now been said respecting the duties connected <lb/>
            with warfare ; but we must bear in mind, that justice is due <note type="footnote"> * As oaths are designed for the security of the imposer, it is manifest <lb/>
            that they must be interpreted and performed in the sense in which the <lb/>
            imposer intends them ; otherwise they afford no security to him. And this <lb/>
            is the meaning and reason of the rule, "jurare in animum imponentis."— <lb/>
            Paley's "Moral and Political Philosophy," book 3, chap. 16, </note><note type="footnote"> Against the practice of administering oaths as demoralizing, we may instance <lb/>
            two authorities. " The effect," says Dymond, " of instituting oaths is to <lb/>
            diminish the practical obligation of simple affirmation. The law says you <lb/>
            must speak the truth when you are upon your oath, which is the same <lb/>
            thing as to say that it is less harm to violate truth when you are not on <lb/>
            your oath. The court sometimes reminds a witness that he is upon oath, <lb/>
            which is equivalent to saying, If you were not we should think less of your <lb/>
            mendacity. The same lesson is inculcated by the assignation of penalties <lb/>
            to perjury and not to falsehood." " There is," says Godwin, in his <lb/>
            " Political Justice," book 6, c. 5, " no cause of insincerity, prevarication, <lb/>
            and falsehood more powerful than the practice of administering oaths in a <lb/>
            court of justice. All attempts to strengthen the obligations of morality, <lb/>
            by fictitious and spurious motives, will, in the sequel, be found to have no <lb/>
            tendency but to relax them." </note> <pb n="25"/>

            even to the lowest of mankind ; and nothing can be lower <lb/>
            than the condition and fortune of a slave. And yet those <lb/>
            prescribe wisely who enjoin us to put them upon the same <lb/>
            footing as hired labourers, obliging them to do their work, <lb/>
            but giving them their dues. Now, as injustice may be done <lb/>
            two ways, by force or fraud ; fraud being the property of a <lb/>
            fox, force that of a lion ; both are utterly repugnant to <lb/>
            society, but fraud is the more detestable. But in the whole <lb/>
            system of villainy, none is more capital than that of the men, <lb/>
            who, when they most deceive, so manage as that they may <lb/>
            seem to be virtuous men. Thus much, then, on the subject <lb/>
            of justice.</p>
          <p>XIV. Let me now, as I proposed, speak of beneficence <lb/>
            and liberality, virtues that are the most agreeable to the <lb/>
            nature of man, but which involve many precautionary con- <lb/>
            siderations. For, in the first place, we are to take care lest <lb/>
            our kindness should hurt both those whom it is meant to <lb/>
            assist, and others. In the next place, it ought not to exceed <lb/>
            our abilities; and it ought to be rendered to each in <lb/>
            proportion to his worth. This is the fundamental standard <lb/>
            of justice to which all these things should be referred. And <lb/>
            they who do kindnesses which prove of disservice to the <lb/>
            person they pretend to oblige, should not be esteemed <lb/>
            beneficent nor generous, but injurious sycophants. And they <lb/>
            who injure one party in order to be liberal to another, are <lb/>
            guilty of the same dishonesty as if they should appropriate <lb/>
            to themselves what belongs to another.*</p>
          <p>Now many, and they especially who are the most <lb/>
            ambitious after grandeur and glory, rob one party to enrich <lb/>
            another ; and account themselves generous to their friends if <lb/>
            they enrich them by whatever means. This is so far from <lb/>
            being consistent with, that nothing can be more contrary to, <lb/>
            our duty. We should therefore take care to practise that <lb/>
            kind of generosity that is serviceable to our friends, but <note type="footnote"> * " Liberality in princes is regarded as a mark of beneficence. But when <lb/>
            it occurs that the homely bread of the honest and industrious is often <lb/>
            thereby converted into delicious cates for the idle and the prodigal, we soon <lb/>
            retract our heedless praises. The regrets of a prince for having lost a day <lb/>
            were noble and generous, but had he intended to have spent it in acts <unclear>of</unclear> <lb/>
            generosity to his greedy courtiers, it was better lost than misemployed after <lb/>
            that manner."—Hume's " Dissertation on the Passions," section 2. </note> <pb n="26"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            hurtful to none. Upon this principle, when Lucius Sylla <lb/>
            and Caius Cæsar took property from its just owners and <lb/>
            transferred it to strangers, in so doing they ought not to be <lb/>
            accounted generous ; for nothing can be generous that is not <lb/>
            at the same time just.</p>
          <p>Our next part of circumspection is, that our generosity <lb/>
            never should exceed our abilities. For they who are more <lb/>
            generous than their circumstances admit of are, first, guilty <lb/>
            in this, that they wrong their relations; because they <lb/>
            bestow upon strangers those means which they might, with <lb/>
            greater justice, give or leave to those who are nearest to <lb/>
            them. Now a generosity of this kind is generally attended <lb/>
            with a lust to ravish and to plunder, in order to be furnished <lb/>
            with the means to give away. For it is easy to observe, that <lb/>
            most of them are not so much by nature generous, as they <lb/>
            are misled by a kind of pride to do a great many things in <lb/>
            order that they may seem to be generous ; which things <lb/>
            seem to spring not so much from good will as from osten- <lb/>
            tation. Now such a simulation is more nearly allied to <lb/>
            duplicity than to generosity or virtue.</p>
          <p>The third head proposed was, that in our generosity we <lb/>
            should have regard to merit; and, consequently, examine <lb/>
            both the morals of the party to whom we are generous, and <lb/>
            his disposition towards us, together with the general good of <lb/>
            society, and how far he may have already contributed to our <lb/>
            own interest. Could all those considerations be united, it <lb/>
            were the more desirable ; but the object in whom is united <lb/>
            the most numerous and the most important of them, ought <lb/>
            to have the greatest weight with us.</p>
          <p>XV. But as we live not with men who are absolutely <lb/>
            perfect and completely wise, but with men who have great <lb/>
            merit if they possess the outlines of worth, we are, I think, <lb/>
            from thence to infer, that no man is to be neglected in whom <lb/>
            there appears any indication of virtue ; and that each should <lb/>
            be regarded in proportion as he is adorned with the milder <lb/>
            virtues of modesty, temperance, and that very justice of <lb/>
            which I have so largely treated. For fortitude and greatness <lb/>
            of spirit is commonly too violent in a man who is not com- <lb/>
            pletely wise and perfect; but the aforesaid virtues seem to <lb/>
            belong more to a good man.</p>
          <p>Having said thus much of morals ; with regard to the <pb n="27"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XIV.]</note><lb/>
            kindness which a person expresses for us, our first duty is, <lb/>
            to perform the most for him by whom we are most beloved. <lb/>
            Now we are to judge of kindness, not like children, by a sort of <lb/>
            ardour of affection, but by its stability and constancy. But if <lb/>
            its merits are such, that we are not to court but to requite <lb/>
            the kindness, the greater ought our care to be; for there is <lb/>
            no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kind- <lb/>
            ness. Now if, as Hesiod enjoins, we ought, if it is in our <lb/>
            power, to repay what we have received for mere use with <lb/>
            interest, how ought we to act when called upon by kindness ? <lb/>
            Are we not to imitate those fertile fields which yield far more <lb/>
            than they have received ? For, if we readily oblige those <lb/>
            who we are in hopes will serve us, how ought we to behave <lb/>
            towards those who have served us already ? For as <lb/>
            generosity is of two kinds, the one conferring a favour, the <lb/>
            other repaying it, whether we confer it or not is at our own <lb/>
            option, but the not repaying it is not allowable in a good <lb/>
            man, provided he can do so without injury to any. Now <lb/>
            there are distinctions to be made as to the benefits received ; <lb/>
            and it is clear that the greatest return is due in each case to <lb/>
            the greatest obligation. Meanwhile, we are above all things <lb/>
            to consider the spirit, the zeal, and the meaning with which <lb/>
            a favour is conferred. For many confer numerous favours <lb/>
            with a sort of recklessness, without any judgment or prin- <lb/>
            ciple, upon all mankind promiscuously, or influenced by sudden <lb/>
            perturbation of mind, as if by a hurricane : such favours are <lb/>
            not to be esteemed so highly as those which result from <lb/>
            judgment, consideration, and consistency. But in conferring <lb/>
            or requiting kindness, the chief rule of our duty ought to be, <lb/>
            if all other circumstances are equal, to confer most upon the <lb/>
            man who stands in greatest need of assistance. The reverse <lb/>
            of this is practised by the generality, who direct their greatest <lb/>
            services to the man from whom they hope the most, though <lb/>
            he may stand in no need of them.</p>
          <p>XVI. Now society and alliances amongst men would be <lb/>
            best preserved if the greatest kindness should be manifested <lb/>
            where there is the nearest relation. But we ought to go <lb/>
            higher, if we are to investigate the natural principles of <lb/>
            intercourse and community amongst men. The first is, that <lb/>
            which is perceived in the society of the whole human race. <lb/>
            and of this the bond is speech and reason, which by <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            teaching, learning, communicating, debating, and judging, <lb/>
            conciliate men together, and bind them into a kind of <lb/>
            natural society. There is nothing in which we differ more <lb/>
            from the nature of brutes than in tills ; for we very often <lb/>
            allow them to have courage, as for instance, horses and <lb/>
            lions; but we never admit that they possess justice, equity, <lb/>
            and goodness ; because they are void of reason and speech. <lb/>
            Now this is the kind of society that is most extensive with <lb/>
            mankind amongst themselves, and it goes through all; for <lb/>
            here a community of all things that nature has produced for <lb/>
            the common use of mankind is preserved, so as that they <lb/>
            may be possessed in the manner prescribed by laws and civil <lb/>
            statutes: of which laws themselves some are to be observed in <lb/>
            accordance with the Greek proverb, "that all things amongst <lb/>
            friends are to be in common." Now this community consists <lb/>
            of things which are of that nature which, though placed <lb/>
            by Ennius under one head, may be applied to many. " He <lb/>
            (says that author) who kindly shows the bewildered traveller <lb/>
            the right road. does as it were light his lamp by his own ; <lb/>
            which affords none the less light to himself after it has lighted <lb/>
            the other."</p>
          <p>By this single example he sufficiently enjoins on us to <lb/>
            perform, even to a stranger, all the service we can do <lb/>
            without detriment to ourselves. Of which service the <lb/>
            following are common illustrations : "That we are to debar <lb/>
            no man from the running stream;" " That we are to suffer <lb/>
            any who desire it to kindle fire at our fire " That we are to <lb/>
            give faithful counsel to a person who is in doubt:" all which <lb/>
            are particulars that are serviceable to the receiver without <lb/>
            being detrimental to the bestower. We are therefore to <lb/>
            practise them, and be constantly contributing somewhat to <lb/>
            the common good. As the means, however, of each par- <lb/>
            ticular person are very confined and the numbers of the <lb/>
            indigent are boundless, our distributive generosity ought still <lb/>
            to be bounded by the principle of Ennius,—"it nevertheless <lb/>
            gives light to one's self,"—that we may still be possessed of <lb/>
            the means to be generous to our friends.</p>
          <p>XVII. Now the degrees of human society are many. <lb/>
            For, to quit the foregoing unbounded kind, there is one more <lb/>
            confined, which consists of men of the same race, nation, <lb/>
            and language, by which people are more intimately connected <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note><lb/>
            among themselves. A more contracted society than that <lb/>
            consists of men inhabiting the same city; for many things <lb/>
            are in common among fellow citizens, such as their forum, <lb/>
            their temples, their porticoes, their streets, their laws, their <lb/>
            rites, their courts of justice, their trials, not to mention their <lb/>
            customs, and intimacies, with a great number of particular <lb/>
            dealings and intercourses of numbers with numbers. There <lb/>
            is a still more contracted degree of society, which is that <lb/>
            of relatives; and this closes, in a narrow point, the unbounded <lb/>
            general association of the human race.</p>
          <p>For, as it is a common natural principle among all animated <lb/>
            beings that they have a desire to propagate their own species, <lb/>
            the first principle of society consists in the marriage tie, the <lb/>
            next in children, the next in a family within one roof, where <lb/>
            everything is in common. This society gives rise to the <lb/>
            city, and Is, as it were, the nursery of the commonwealth. <lb/>
            Next follows the connexion of brotherhood, next that of <lb/>
            cousins, in their different degrees; and, when they grow too <lb/>
            numerous to be contained under one roof, they are trans- <lb/>
            planted to different dwellings, as it were to so many colonies. <lb/>
            Then follow marriages and alliances, whence spring more <lb/>
            numerous relationships. The descendants, by this propa- <lb/>
            gation, form the origin of commonwealths; but the ties and <lb/>
            affections of blood bind mankind by affection.*</p>
          <p>For there is something very powerful in having the monu- <note type="footnote"> * " Families are so many centres of attraction, which preserve mankind <lb/>
            from being scattered and dissipated by the repulsive powers of selfishness. <lb/>
            The order of nature is evermore from particulars to generals. As in the <lb/>
            operations of intellect we proceed from the contemplation of individuals to <lb/>
            the formation of general abstractions, so in the development of the <lb/>
            passions, in like manner we advance from private to public affections ; from <lb/>
            the love of parents, brothers, and sisters, to those more expanded regards <lb/>
            which embrace the immense society of human kind."—Robert Hall's <lb/>
            Sermon on Modern Infidelity." In apparent opposition to this view <lb/>
            stands the theory of President Edwards, which was afterwards extensively <lb/>
            adopted in an aggravated form. " True virtue, according to him, (says <lb/>
            Sir James Mackintosh, " Progress of Ethical Philosophy,") consists it <lb/>
            benevolence, or love to being ' in general,' which he afterwards limits to <lb/>
            ' intelligent being,' though sentient would have involved a more reasonable <lb/>
            limitation. This good will is felt towards a particular being, first in <lb/>
            proportion to his degree of existence, (' for,' says he, that which is great <lb/>
            has more existence, and is farther from nothing than that which is little,') <lb/>
            and secondly, in proportion to the degree in which that particular being <lb/>
            feels benevolence to others." Perhaps the ablest refutation of these </note> <pb n="30"/>

            merits of our ancestors the same, in practising the same <lb/>
            religious rites, and in having the same places of interment. <lb/>
            But amongst all the degrees of society, none is more excel- <note type="footnote">principles in a brief compass is found in the following note by the Rev. <lb/>
            Robert Hall in the Sermon above quoted. </note><note type="footnote"> "It is somewhat singular that many of the fashionable infidels have <lb/>
            hit upon a definition of virtue which perfectly coincides with that of certain <lb/>
            metaphysical divines in America, first invented and defended by that most <lb/>
            acute reasoner, JONATHAN EDWARDS. They both place virtue exclusively <lb/>
            in a passion for the general good ; or, as Mr. Edwards expresses it, love to <lb/>
            being in general; so that our love-is always to be proportioned to the <lb/>
            magnitude of its object in the scale of being : which is liable to the <lb/>
            objections I have already stated, as well as to many others which the limits <lb/>
            of this note will not permit me to enumerate. Let it suffice to remark, <lb/>
            (1.) That virtue, on these principles, is an utter impossibility : for the <lb/>
            system of being, comprehending the great Supreme, is infinite: and, <lb/>
            therefore, to maintain the proper proportion, the force of particular attach- <lb/>
            ment must be infinitely less than the passion for the general good ; but the <lb/>
            limits of the human mind are not capable of any emotion so infinitely <lb/>
            different in degree. (2.) Since our views of the extent of the universe <lb/>
            are capable of perpetual enlargement, admitting the sum of existence is <lb/>
            ever the same, we must return back at each step to diminish the strength of <lb/>
            particular affections, or they will become disproportionate, and conse- <lb/>
            quently, on these principles, vicious ; so that the balance must be con- <lb/>
            tinually fluctuating, by the weights being taken out of one scale and put <lb/>
            into the other. (3.) If virtue consist exclusively in love to being in <lb/>
            general, or attachment to the general good, the particular affections are, to <lb/>
            every purpose of virtue, useless, and even pernicious ; for their immediate, <lb/>
            nay, their necessary tendency is to attract to their objects a proportion of <lb/>
            attention which far exceeds their comparative value in the general scale. <lb/>
            To allege that the general good is promoted by them, will be of no <lb/>
            advantage to the defence of this system, but the contrary, by confessing <lb/>
            that a greater sum of happiness is attained by a deviation from, than an <lb/>
            adherence to, its principles ; unless its advocates mean by the love of <lb/>
            being in general the same thing as the private affections, which is to <lb/>
            confound all the distinctions of language, as well as all the operations of <lb/>
            mind. Let it he remembered, we have no dispute respecting what is the <lb/>
            ultimate end of virtue, which is allowed on both sides to be the greatest <lb/>
            sum of happiness in the universe. The question is merely, what is virtue <lb/>
            itself? or, in other words, what are the means appointed for the attainment <lb/>
            of that end ? </note><note type="footnote"> " There is little doubt, from some parts of Mr. Godwin's work, entitled, <lb/>
            ' Political Justice,' as well as from his early habits of reading, that he was <lb/>
            indebted to Mr. Edwards for his principal arguments against the private <lb/>
            affections ; though, with a daring consistency, he has pursued his principles <lb/>
            to an extreme from which that most excellent man would have revolted <lb/>
            with horror. The fundamental error of the whole system arose, as I <lb/>
            conceive, from a mistaken pursuit of simplicity : from a wish to construct <lb/>
            a moral system, without leaving sufficient scope for the infinite variety of <lb/>
            moral phenomena and mental combination ; in consequence'of which its </note> <pb n="31"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note><lb/>
            lent, none more stable, than when worthy <unclear>meu</unclear>, through a <lb/>
            similarity of manners, are intimately connected together; for, <lb/>
            as I have often said, even when we discern the honestum in <lb/>
            another it touches us, and makes us friends to the man in <lb/>
            whom it resides.</p>
          <p>Now, though virtue of every kind attracts and charms us <lb/>
            to the love of those who possess it, yet that love is strongest <lb/>
            that is effected by justice and generosity. For nothing is <lb/>
            more lovely, nothing is more binding, than a similarity of <lb/>
            good dispositions;* because amongst those whose pursuits <lb/>
            and pleasures are the same, every man is pleased as much <lb/>
            with another as he is with himself, and that is effected which <lb/>
            Pythagoras chiefly contemplates in friendship, "that many <lb/>
            become one." A strong community is likewise effected by <lb/>
            good offices mutually conferred and received; and, provided <lb/>
            these be reciprocal and agreeable, those amongst whom they <lb/>
            happen are bound together in close association. <note type="footnote"> advocates were induced to place virtue exclusively in some one disposition <lb/>
            of mind : and, since the passion for the general good is undeniably the <lb/>
            noblest and most extensive of all others, when it was once resolved to place <lb/>
            virtue in any one thing, there remained little room to hesitate which should <lb/>
            be preferred. It might have been worth while to reflect, that in the natural <lb/>
            world there are two kinds of attraction ; one, which holds the several parts <lb/>
            of individual bodies in contact ; another, which maintains the union of <lb/>
            bodies themselves with the general system : and that, though the union in <lb/>
            the former case is much more intimate than in the latter, each is equally <lb/>
            essential to the order of the world. Similar to this is the relation which <lb/>
            the public and private affections bear to each other, and their use in the <lb/>
            moral system. </note><note type="footnote"> * " Friendship, founded on the principles of worldly morality, recognised <lb/>
            by virtuous heathens, such as that which subsisted between Atticus and <lb/>
            Cicero-which the last of these illustrious men has rendered immortal—is <lb/>
            fitted to survive through all the vicissitudes of life; but it belongs only to <lb/>
            a union founded on religion, to continue through an endless duration. The <lb/>
            former of these stood the shock of conflicting opinions, and of a revolution <lb/>
            that shook the world; the latter is destined to survive when the heavens <lb/>
            are no more, and to spring fresh from the ashes of the universe. The <lb/>
            former possessed all the stability which is possible to sublunary things ; the <lb/>
            latter partakes of the eternity of God. Friendship, founded on worldly <lb/>
            principles, is natural, and, though composed of the best elements of nature. <lb/>
            is not exempt from its mutability and frailty; the latter is spiritual, and, <lb/>
            therefore, unchanging and imperishable. The friendship which is founded <lb/>
            on kindred tastes and congenial habits, apart from piety, is permitted by <lb/>
            the benignity of Providence to embellish a world, which, with all its magni- <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>But when you view everything with reason and reflection, <lb/>
            of all connections none is more weighty, none is more dear, <lb/>
            than that between every individual and his country. Our <lb/>
            parents are dear to us; our children, our kinsmen, our <lb/>
            friends, are dear to us; but our country comprehends alone <lb/>
            all the endearments of us all. For which what good man <lb/>
            would hesitate to die if he could do her service ? The more <lb/>
            execrably unnatural, therefore, are they who wound their <lb/>
            country by every species of guilt, and who are now, and <lb/>
            have been, employed in her utter destruction. But were a <lb/>
            computation or comparison set up, of those objects to which <lb/>
            our chief duty should be paid, the principal are our country <lb/>
            and our parents, by whose services we are laid under the <lb/>
            strongest obligations; the next are our children and entire <lb/>
            family, who depend upon us alone, without having any other <lb/>
            refuge; the next our agreeable kinsmen, who generally share <lb/>
            our fortuue in common. The necessary supports of life, <lb/>
            therefore, are due chiefly to those I have already mentioned ; <lb/>
            but the mutual intercourses of life, counsels, discourses, ex- <lb/>
            hortations, consultations, and even sometimes reproofs, flourish <lb/>
            chiefly in friendships, and those friendships are the most <lb/>
            agreeable that are cemented by a similarity of manners.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But in performing all those duties we are care- <lb/>
            fully to consider what is most necessary to each, and what <lb/>
            every one of them could or could not attain even without us. <lb/>
            Thus the relative claims of relationship and of circumstances <lb/>
            will not always be identical. Some duties are owing to some <lb/>
            more than to others. For instance, you are sooner to help <lb/>
            your neighbour to house his corn, than your brother or your <lb/>
            friend; but if a cause be on trial, you are to take part with <lb/>
            your kinsman, or your friend, rather than with your neigh- <lb/>
            bour. These considerations, therefore, and the like, ought <lb/>
            to be carefully observed in every duty; and custom and <lb/>
            practice should be attained, that we may be able to be correct <lb/>
            assessors of our duties, and, by adding or subtracting, to strike <lb/>
            the balance, by which we may see the proportion to which <lb/>
            every party is entitled.</p>
          <p>But as neither physicians, nor generals, nor orators, how- <lb/>
            ever perfect they may be in the theory of their art, can ever <lb/>
            perform anything that is highly praiseworthy, without expe- <lb/>
            rience and practice, so rules have indeed been laid down for the <pb n="33"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XIX.]</note><lb/>
            observation of duties, as I myself am doing; but the import- <lb/>
            ance of the matter demands experience and practice. I have <lb/>
            now, I think, sufficiently treated of the manner in which the <lb/>
            honestum, which gives the fitness to our duties, arises from <lb/>
            those matters that come within the rights of human society.</p>
          <p>It must be understood, however, at the same time, that <lb/>
            when the four springs from which virtue and honesty, arise <lb/>
            are laid open, that which is done with a lofty spirit, and one <lb/>
            which scorns ordinary interests, appears the most noble. <lb/>
            Therefore the most natural of all reproaches is somewhat of <lb/>
            the following kind:- <lb/>
            Young men, ye carry but the souls of women; <lb/>
            That woman of a man.</p>
          <p>Or somewhat of the following kind:- <lb/>
            Salmacis, give me spoils without toil or danger.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in our praises, I know not how it is, but <lb/>
            actions performed with magnanimity, with fortitude, and <lb/>
            virtue, we eulogize in a loftier style. From hence Marathon, <lb/>
            Salamis, Platæa, Thermopylae, Leuctra, have become the field <lb/>
            of rhetoricians; and amongst ourselves, Cocles, the Decii, the <lb/>
            two Scipios, Cneius and Publius, Marcus Marcellus, and a <lb/>
            great many others. Indeed, the Roman people in general <lb/>
            are distinguished above all by elevation of spirit; and their <lb/>
            fondness for military glory is shown by the fact that we <lb/>
            generally see their statues dressed in warlike habits.</p>
          <p>XIX. But that magnanimity which is discovered in toils <lb/>
            and dangers, if it be devoid of justice, and contend not for <lb/>
            the public good, but for selfish interest, is blameable ; for, <lb/>
            so far from being a mark of virtue, it is rather that of a <lb/>
            barbarity which is repulsive to all humanity. By the Stoics, <lb/>
            therefore, fortitude is rightly defined, when they call it <lb/>
            valour fighting on the side of justice." No man, there- <lb/>
            fore, who has acquired the reputation of fortitude, attained <lb/>
            his glory by deceit and malice; for nothing that is devoid <lb/>
            of justice can be a virtue.</p>
          <p>It is, therefore, finely said by Plato, that not only the <lb/>
            knowledge that is apart from justice deserves the appellation <lb/>
            of cunning rather than wisdom, but also a mind that is ready <lb/>
            to encounter danger, if it is animated by private interest, and <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            not public utility, deserves the character of audaciousness <lb/>
            rather than of fortitude. We, therefore, require that all men <lb/>
            of courage and magnanimity should be at the same time <lb/>
            men of virtue and of simplicity, lovers of truth, and by <lb/>
            no means deceitful; for these qualities are the main glory of <lb/>
            justice.</p>
          <p>But there is one painful consideration, that obstinacy, and <lb/>
            an undue ambition for power, naturally spring up from this <lb/>
            elevation and greatness of spirit; for, as Plato tells us, the <lb/>
            entire character of the Lacedemonians was inflamed with <lb/>
            the desire of conquest. Thus the man who is most distin- <lb/>
            guished by his magnanimity, is most desirous of being the <lb/>
            leading, or rather the only potentate of all. Now, it is a <lb/>
            difficult matter, when you desire to be superior to all others, <lb/>
            to preserve that equability which is the characteristic or <lb/>
            justice. Hence it is that such men will not suffer themselves <lb/>
            to be thwarted in a debate, nor by any public and lawful <lb/>
            authority; and in public matters they are commonly guilty <lb/>
            of corruption and faction, in order to grasp at as great <lb/>
            power as possible; and they choose to be superior by means <lb/>
            of force, rather than equals by justice. But the more diffi- <lb/>
            cult the matter is, it is the more glorious; for there is no <lb/>
            conjuncture which ought to be unconnected with justice.</p>
          <p>They, therefore, who oppose, not they who commit, in- <lb/>
            justice are to be deemed brave and magnanimous. Now, <lb/>
            genuine and well-considered magnanimity judges that the <lb/>
            honestum, which is nature's chief aim, consists in realities <lb/>
            and not in mere glory, and rather chooses to be than to <lb/>
            seem pre-eminent: for the man who is swayed by the pre- <lb/>
            judices of an ignorant rabble is not to be reckoned among <lb/>
            the great; but the man of a spirit the most elevated, through <lb/>
            the desire of glory, is the most easily impelled into acts of <lb/>
            injustice. This is, indeed, a slippery situation; for scarcely <lb/>
            can there be found a man who, after enduring trials and <lb/>
            encountering dangers, does not pant for popularity as the <lb/>
            reward of his exploits.* <note type="footnote"> * " It must be strongly impressed upon our minds," says Dr. Johnson, <lb/>
            " that virtue is not to be pursued as one of the means to fame, but fame to <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XX. A spirit altogether brave and elevated is chiefly dis- <lb/>
            cernible by two characters. The first consists in a low estimate <lb/>
            of mere outward circumstances, since it is convinced that a <lb/>
            man ought to admire, desire, or court nothing but what is <lb/>
            virtuous and becoming; and that he ought to succumb to no <lb/>
            man, nor to any perturbation either of spirit or fortune.* <lb/>
            The other thing is, that possessed of such a spirit as I have <lb/>
            just mentioned, you should perform actions which are great <lb/>
            and of the greatest utility, but extremely arduous, full of <lb/>
            difficulties and danger both to life and the many things <lb/>
            which pertain to life.</p>
          <p>In the latter of those two characters consist all the glory, <lb/>
            the majesty, and, I add, the utility; but the causes and the <lb/>
            efficient means that form great men is in the former, which <lb/>
            contains the principles that elevate the soul, and gives it a <lb/>
            contempt for temporary considerations. Now, this very excel- <lb/>
            lence consists in two particulars: you are to deem that only to <lb/>
            be good that is virtuous; and that you be free from all mental <lb/>
            irregularity. For we are to look upon it as the character of <lb/>
            a noble and an elevated soul, to slight all those considerations <lb/>
            that the generality of mankind account great and glorious, <lb/>
            and to despise them, upon firm and durable principles; while <lb/>
            strength of mind, and greatness of resolution, are discerned in <lb/>
            bearing those calamities which, in the course of man's life, <lb/>
            are many and various, so as not to be driven from your na- <lb/>
            tural disposition, nor from the dignity of a wise man: for <lb/>
            it is not consistent that he who is not subdued by fear should <lb/>
            be subjugated by passion ; nor that he who has shown him- <lb/>
            self invincible by toil, should be conquered by pleasure.t <lb/>
            Wherefore, we ought to watch and avoid the love of money: <note type="footnote"> the attention of future times, must arise from the hope that with our name <lb/>
            our virtues will be propagated, and that those whom we cannot benefit in <lb/>
            our lives may receive instruction from our examples, and incitement from <lb/>
            our renown."—Rambler. </note><note type="footnote"> * " It is the business of moralists to detect the frauds of fortune, and to <lb/>
            show that she imposes upon the careless eye by a quick succession of <lb/>
            shadows, which will sink to nothing in the gripe; that she disguises life in <lb/>
            extrinsic ornaments, which serve only for show, and are laid aside in the <lb/>
            hoursofsolitude and of pleasure; and that when greatness aspires either to <lb/>
            felicity or to wisdom, it shakes off those distinctions which dazzle the gazer <lb/>
            and awe the suppliant."—Dr. Johnson. </note><note type="footnote"> t " Be not a Hercules furens abroad, and a poltroon within thyself. To <lb/>

            for nothing so truly characterizes a narrow, grovelling dispo- <lb/>
            sition as to love riches;* and nothing is more noble and more <lb/>
            exalted than to despise riches if you have them not, and if <lb/>
            you have them, to employ them in beneficence and libe- <lb/>
            rality.†</p>
          <p>An inordinate passion for glory, as I have already ob- <lb/>
            served, is likewise to be guarded against; for it deprives us <lb/>
            of liberty, the only prize for which men of elevated senti- <lb/>
            ments ought to contend. Power is so far from being desirable <lb/>
            in itself, that it sometimes ought to be refused, and some- <lb/>
            times to be resigned. We should likewise be free from all <lb/>
            disorders of the mind, from all violent passion and fear, as <lb/>
            well as languor, voluptuousness, and anger, that we may <lb/>
            possess that tranquillity and security which confer alike <lb/>
            consistency and dignity. Now, many there are, and have <lb/>
            been, who, courting that tranquillity which I have mentioned <lb/>
            here, have withdrawn themselves from public affairs and taken <lb/>
            refuge in retirement. Amongst these, some of the noblest <lb/>
            and most leading of our philosophers;‡ and some persons, <lb/>
            of strict and grave dispositions, were unable to bear with <lb/>
            the manners either of the people or their rulers; and some <lb/>
            have lived in the country, amusing themselves with the <lb/>
            management of their private affairs. Their aim was the <lb/>
            same as that of the powerful, that they might enjoy their <lb/>
            liberty, without wanting anything or obeying any person; <lb/>
            for the essence of liberty is to live just as you please. <note type="footnote"> down our foes, and fall down to our concupiscences, are solecisms in moral <lb/>

            this. The opinions of theory, and positions of men, are not so void of <lb/>
            reason as their practised conclusions. Some have held that snow is black, <lb/>

          <p>XXI. Therefore, as the object of those who are ambitious <lb/>
            for power, and of those who court retirement, and whom I <lb/>
            have just now described, is the same, the former imagine <lb/>
            they can attain it if they are possessed of great resources, <lb/>
            and the latter, if they can be contented with their own, <lb/>
            and with little. In this matter, the sentiments of neither are <lb/>
            to be absolutely rejected. But a life of retirement is more <lb/>
            easy, more safe, less tiresome, and less troublesome than any <lb/>
            other; while the life of those who apply themselves to the <lb/>
            affairs of government, and to the management of a state, <lb/>
            is more beneficial to mankind, and more conducive to glory <lb/>
            and renown.</p>
          <p>Allowances, therefore, are to be made for those who having <lb/>
            no management in public matters, with an excellent genius, <lb/>
            give themselves up to learning; and to those who being <lb/>
            hindered by feebleness of health, or for some very weighty <lb/>
            reason, retire from affairs of government, and leave to others <lb/>
            the power and the honour of the administration: but when <lb/>
            men, who have no such excuses, say that they despise that <lb/>
            power and those offices which most admire, such men are <lb/>
            so far from deserving praise that they incur censure. It is <lb/>
            difficult to condemn their judgment in despising and under- <lb/>
            valuing popularity; but then they seem to dread the toils <lb/>
            and troubles of affronts and repulses as involving ignominy <lb/>
            and infamy. For some there are who, in opposite matters, <lb/>
            are very inconsistent with themselves; they spurn most <lb/>
            rigidly at pleasure, but they droop in pain; they despise <lb/>
            glory, but sink under unpopularity; and that, too, with no <lb/>
            little inconsistency.</p>
          <p>But the men who inherit from nature appliances for <lb/>
            government ought, laying aside all excuses, to undertake the <lb/>
            discharge of all public offices and the management of state <lb/>
            affairs; for neither can a state be governed, nor can magna- <lb/>
            nimity display itself, by any other means. I am not, however, <lb/>
            sure whether those who undertake the management of public <lb/>
            affairs ought not to be equally distinguished by magnanimity <unclear/> <lb/>
            us philosophers, if not more so, and impressed with a con- <lb/>
            tempt of common affairs and to possess that tranquillity, <lb/>
            that calm of mind, I have so much recommended; I mean, <lb/>
            if they wish to live without anxiety, with dignity and <lb/>
            consistency.</p><pb n="38"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note> </p>
          <p>This may be the more easily practised by philosophers, <lb/>
            because in their lives there is less exposed for fortune to <lb/>
            strike at; because their necessities are more contracted; and <lb/>
            because, if anything adverse should happen, they cannot fall <lb/>
            so heavily. It is not, therefore, without reason, that in the <lb/>
            mind of those who undertake the management of public <lb/>
            affairs, more violent passions are excited, and mightier mat- <lb/>
            ters are to be attempted, than by those who are retired; <lb/>
            they, therefore, ought to possess greater elevation of spirit, <lb/>
            and freedom from disquiets. But, whoever enters upon public <lb/>
            life ought to take care that the question, how far the measure <lb/>
            is virtuous, be not his sole consideration, but also how far <lb/>
            he may have the means of carrying it into execution. In <lb/>
            this he is chiefly to take care that through indolence he do <lb/>
            not meanly despond, nor through eagerness too much pre- <lb/>
            sume. Thus, in all affairs, before you undertake them, a <lb/>
            diligent preparation should be entered into.</p>
          <p>XXII. But, since most persons are of opinion that the <lb/>
            achievements of war are more glorious than civil affairs, <lb/>
            this judgment needs to be restricted: for many, as generally <lb/>
            is the case with high minds and enterprising spirits, espe- <lb/>
            cially if they are adapted to military life and are fond of <lb/>
            warlike achievements, have often sought opportunities of <lb/>
            war from their fondness for glory; but if we are willing to <lb/>
            judge truly, many are the civil employments of greater im- <lb/>
            portance, and of more renown, than the military.</p>
          <p>For though Themistocles is justly praised-his name is <lb/>
            now more illustrious than that of Solon, and his glorious <lb/>
            victory at Salamis is mentioned preferably to the policy of <lb/>
            Solon, by which he first confirmed the power of the Areopagus <lb/>
            -the one should not be considered more illustrious than <lb/>
            the other; for the one availed his country only for once-the <lb/>
            other is lastingly advantageous; because by it the laws of <lb/>
            the Athenians, and the institutions of their ancestors, are <lb/>
            preserved. Now, Themistocles could not have stated any <lb/>
            respect in which he benefited the Areopagus, but the former <lb/>
            might with truth declare that Themistocles had been advan- <lb/>
            taged by him; for the war was carried on by the counsels of <lb/>
            that senate which was constituted by Solon.</p>
          <p>We may make the same observation with regard to <lb/>
            Pausanias and Lysander amongst the Lacedemonians ; for all <pb n="39"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXII.]</note><lb/>
            the addition of empire which their conquests are supposed to <lb/>
            have brought to their country is not to be compared to the <lb/>
            laws and economy of Lycurgus ; for indeed, owing to these <lb/>
            very causes they had armies more subordinate and courageous. <lb/>
            In my eyes, Marcus Scaurus (who flourished when I was but <lb/>
            a boy) was not inferior to Caius Marius; nor, after I came <lb/>
            to have a concern in the government, Quintus Catulus to <lb/>
            Cneius Pompey. An army abroad is but of small service <lb/>
            unless there be a wise administration at home. Nor did <lb/>
            that good man and great general, Africanus, perform a more <lb/>
            important service to his country when he razed Numantia, <lb/>
            than did that private citizen, P. Nasica, when at the same <lb/>
            period he killed Tiberius Gracchus. An action which it <lb/>
            is true was not merely of a civil nature ; for it approaches <lb/>
            to a military character, as being the result of force and <lb/>
            courage ; but it was an action performed without an army, <lb/>
            and from political considerations.</p>
          <p>That state described by the following line is best for a <lb/>
            country, for which I understand that I am abused by the <lb/>
            wicked and malicious:</p>
          <p>Arms to the gown, and laurels yield to lore.*</p>
          <p>For, not to mention other persons, when I was at the <lb/>
            helm of government did not "arms yield to the gown?" <lb/>
            For never did our country know a time of more threatening <lb/>
            danger or more profound tranquillity; so quickly, through <lb/>
            my counsel and my diligence, did the arms of our most pro- <lb/>
            fligate fellow citizens drop of themselves out of their hands. <lb/>
            What so great exploit as this was ever performed in wai, <lb/>
            or what triumph can be compared with it ?</p>
          <p>The inheritance of my glory and the imitation of my <lb/>
            actions are to descend to you, my son Marcus, therefore it <lb/>
            is allowable for me to boast in writing to you. It is, how- <lb/>
            ever, certain that Pompey, who was possessed of much <lb/>
            military glory, paid this tribute to me, in the hearing of <lb/>
            many, that in vain would he have returned to his third <note type="footnote"> <unclear>•</unclear> Orig. Ccdant arma togœ, concedat laurea linguœ. The author is <lb/>

            triumph, had not my public services preserved the place <lb/>
            in which he was to celebrate it. The examples of civil <lb/>
            courage are therefore no less meritorious than those of mili- <lb/>

          <p>XXIII. Now all that excellence which springs from a <lb/>
            lofty and noble nature is altogether produced by the mental <lb/>
            and not by the corporeal powers.* Meanwhile, the body <lb/>
            ought to be kept in such action and order, as that it may be <lb/>
            always ready to obey the dictates of reason and wisdom, in <lb/>
            carrying them into execution, and in persevering under <lb/>
            hardships. But with regard to that honestum we are treating <lb/>
            of, it consists wholly in the thoughtful application of the <lb/>
            mind ; by which the civilians who preside over public affairs <lb/>
            are equally serviceable to their country as they who wage <lb/>
            wars. For it often happens that by such counsels wars are <lb/>
            either not entered into, or they are brought to a termination ; <lb/>
            sometimes they are even undertaken, as the third Punic wale <lb/>
            was by the advice of Marcus Cato, whose authority was <lb/>
            powerful, even after he was dead. <note type="footnote"> * " As a previous observation, it is beyond all doubt that very much <lb/>
            depends on the constitution of the body. It would be for physiologists <lb/>
            to explain, if it were explicable, the manner in which corporeal organization <lb/>
            affects the mind. I only assume it as a fact, that there is in the material <lb/>
            construction of some persons, much more than of others, some quality <lb/>
            which augments, if it do not create, both the stability of their resolution <lb/>
            and the energy of their active tendencies. There is something that, like <lb/>
            the ligatures which one class of the Olympic combatants bound on their <lb/>
            hands and wrists, braces round, if I may so describe it, and compresses <lb/>
            the powers of the mind, giving them a steady forcible spring and reaction, <lb/>
            which they would presently lose if they could be transferred into a consti- <lb/>
            tution of soft, yielding, treacherous debility. The action of strong character <lb/>
            seems to demand something firm in its material basis, as massive engines <lb/>
            require, for their weight and for their working, to be fixed on a solid foun- <lb/>
            dation. Accordingly, I believe it would be found that a majority of the <lb/>
            persons most remarkable for decisive character have possessed great consti- <lb/>
            tutional physical firmness. I do not mean an exemption from disease and <lb/>
            pain, nor any certain measure of mechanical strength, but a tone of vigour, <lb/>
            the opposite to lassitude, and adapted to great exertion and endurance. <lb/>
            This is clearly evinced in respect to many of them, by the prodigious labours <lb/>
            and deprivations which they have borne in prosecuting their designs. The <lb/>
            physical nature has seemed a proud ally of the moral one, and, with a <lb/>
            hardness that would never shrink, has sustained the energy that could never <unclear/> <lb/>
            remit."—Foster's Essays " On Decision of Character," Letter 2. </note> <pb n="41"/>

          <p>Wisdom in determining is therefore preferable tc <lb/>
            courage in fighting ; but in this we are to take care that we <lb/>
            are not swayed by an aversion to fighting rather than by a <lb/>
            consideration of expediency.* Now in engaging in war <lb/>
            we ought to make it appear that we have no other view but <lb/>
            peace. But the character of a brave and resolute man is <lb/>
            not to be ruffled with adversity, and not to be in such <lb/>
            confusion as to quit his post, as we say, but to preserve a <lb/>
            presence of mind, and the exercise of reason, without <lb/>
            departing from his purpose. And while this is the charac- <lb/>
            teristic of a lofty spirit, so this also is that of a powerful <lb/>
            intellect, namely, to anticipate futurity in thought, and to <lb/>
            conclude beforehand what may happen on either side, and, <lb/>
            upon that, what measures to pursue, and never be surprised <lb/>
            so as to say, "I had not thought of that." Such are the <lb/>
            operations of a genius, capacious and elevated ; of such a <lb/>
            one as relies on its own prudence and counsel ;† but to rush <note type="footnote"> * See Paley's broad statement, that expediency is the fundamental test <lb/>
            of all morality.-Book 2, chap. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t The rarity of self-reliance, notwithstanding the commonness of the <lb/>
            weakness that simulates it, is thus strikingly shown by the great essayist above <lb/>
            quoted:—" The first prominent mental characteristic of the person whom I <lb/>
            describe, is a complete confidence in his own judgment. It will, perhaps, be <lb/>
            said that this is not so uncommon a qualification. I however think it is <lb/>
            uncommon. It is, indeed, obvious enough that almost all men have a <lb/>
            flattering estimate of their own understanding, and that as long as this un- <lb/>
            derstanding has no harder task than to form opinions which are not to be <lb/>
            tried in action, they have a most self-complacent assurance of being right. <lb/>
            This assurance extends to the judgments which they pass on the proceed- <lb/>
            ings of others. But let them be brought into the necessity of adopting <lb/>
            actual measures in an untried situation, where, unassisted by any previous <lb/>
            example or practice, they are reduced to depend on the bare resources of <lb/>
            judgment alone, and you will see in many cases this confidence of opinion <lb/>
            vanish away. The mind seems all at once placed in a misty vacuity, where <lb/>
            it reaches round on all sides, but can find nothing to take hold of. Or if <lb/>
            not lost in vacuity, it is overwhelmed in confusion ; and feels as if its <lb/>
            faculties were annihilated in the attempt to think of schemes and calcu- <lb/>
            lations among the possibilities, chances, and hazards which overspread a <lb/>
            wide untrodden field ; and this conscious imbecility becomes severe distress, <lb/>
            when it is believed that consequences, of serious or unknown good or evil, <lb/>
            are depending on the decisions which are to be formed amidst so much <lb/>
            uncertainty. The thought painfully recurs at each step and turn, I may by <lb/>
            chance be right, but it is fully as probable I am wrong. It is like the case <lb/>
            of a rustic walking in London, who, having no certain direction through the <lb/>
            vast confusion of streets to the place where he wishes to be, advances, and <lb/>
            hesitates, and turns, and inquires, and becomes, at each corner, still more </note> <pb n="42"/>

            precipitately into the field, and to encounter an enemy with <lb/>
            mere physical force has somewhat in it that is barbarous and <lb/>
            brutal. When the occasion, however, and its necessity <lb/>
            compel it, we should resist with force, and prefer death to <lb/>
            slavery or dishonour.</p>
          <p>XXIV. But with regard to overthrowing and plundering <lb/>
            of cities, great consideration is required that nothing be done <lb/>
            rashly, nothing cruelly.* And this is the part of a great <lb/>
            man, after he has maturely weighed all circumstances, to <lb/>
            punish the guilty, to spare the many ; and in every state of <lb/>
            fortune not to depart from an upright, virtuous conduct. <lb/>
            For, as you find (as I have already observed) men who prefer <lb/>
            military to civil duties, so will you find many of that cast wile <lb/>
            look upon dangerous and violent resolutions to be more <lb/>
            splendid and more dignified than calm and digested measures. <lb/>
            We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear <lb/>
            irresolute and cowardly ; but, at the same time, we should <note type="footnote"> inextricably perplexed. A man in this situation feels lie shall be very <lb/>
            unfortunate if he cannot accomplish more than he can understand. Is not <lb/>
            this frequently, when brought to the practical test, the state of a mind not <lb/>
            disposed in general to undervalue its own judgment ?"—Foster's Essay " On <lb/>
            Decision of Character," Letter 2. </note><note type="footnote"> * "If," says Paley, "the cause and end of war be justifiable, all the <lb/>
            means that appear necessary to the end are justifiable also. This is the <lb/>
            principle which defends those extremities to which the violence of war <lb/>
            usually proceeds; for, since war is a contest by force between parties who <lb/>
            acknowledge no common superior, and since it includes not in its idea the <lb/>
            supposition of any convention which should place limits to the operations or <lb/>
            force, it has naturally no boundary but that in which force terminates-the <lb/>
            destruction of the life against which the force is directed. Let it be ob- <lb/>
            served, however, that the licence of war authorizes no acts of hostility but <lb/>
            what are necessary or conducive to the end and object of the war. Gra- <lb/>
            tuitous barbarities borrow no excuse from this plea : of which kind is every <lb/>
            cruelty and every insult that serves only to exasperate the sufferings, or to <lb/>
            incense the hatred, of an enemy, without weakening his strength, or in any <lb/>
            manner tending to procure his submission; such as the slaughter of captives, <lb/>
            the subjecting of them to indignities or torture, the violation of women, the <lb/>
            profanation of temples, the demolition of public buildings, libraries, statues, <lb/>
            and in general the destruction or defacing of works that conduce nothing <lb/>
            to annoyance or defence. These enormities are prohibited not only by the <lb/>
            practice of civilized nations, but by the law of nature itself, as having no <lb/>
            proper tendency to accelerate the termination, or accomplish the object of <lb/>
            the war, and as containing that which in peace and war is equally unjus- <lb/>
            tifiable—ultimate and gratuitous mischief."—"Moral and Political Phi. <lb/>

            avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than which <lb/>
            nothing can be more foolish.</p>
          <p>In encountering dangers, therefore, we are to imitate the <lb/>
            practice of the physicians who apply to gentle illnesses <lb/>
            gentle medicines, but are forced to apply more desperate and <lb/>
            more doubtful cures to more dangerous diseases. It is the <lb/>
            part of a madman to wish for an adverse tempest in a calm, <lb/>
            but of a wise man to find relief against the tempest by what- <lb/>
            ever means ; and the rather if one incurs more advantage by <lb/>
            accomplishing the matter than disadvantage by keeping it in <lb/>
            suspense. Now the conducting of enterprises is dangerous <lb/>
            sometimes to the undertakers, and sometimes to the state; <lb/>
            and hence some are in danger of losing their lives, some their <lb/>
            reputation, and some their popularity. But we ought to be <lb/>
            more forward to expose our own persons than the general <lb/>
            interests to danger, and to be more ready to fight for honour <lb/>
            and reputation than for other advantages.</p>
          <p>Though many have been known cheerfully to venture not <lb/>
            only their money but their lives for the public; yet those <lb/>
            very men have refused to suffer the smallest loss of glory <lb/>
            even at the request of their country. For instance, Calli- <lb/>
            cratidas, who, after performing many gallant actions at the <lb/>
            head of the Lacedemonian armies, during the Peloponesian <lb/>
            war, at last threw everything into confusion by refusing to <lb/>
            obey the directions of those who were for removing the fleet <lb/>
            from Arginusæ, and not for fighting the Athenians ; to <lb/>
            whom his answer was, that if the Lacedemonians lost that <lb/>
            fleet they could fit out another, but that he could not turn his <lb/>
            back without dishonour to himself. 'Tis true, the blow that <lb/>
            followed upon this was not very severe to the Lacedemonians ; <lb/>
            but it was a deadly one, when, from a fear of public odium, <lb/>
            Cleombrotus fought with Epamonidas, and the power of the <lb/>
            Lacedemonians perished. How preferable was the conduct <lb/>
            of Quintus Maximus, of whom Ennius says :— <lb/>
            “ The man* who saved his country by delay, <lb/>
            No tales could move him, and no envy sway; <lb/>
            And thus the laurels on his honoured brow, <lb/>
            In age shall flourish, and with time shall grow." <note type="footnote"> * The verses quoted here by Ennius seem to have been in high repu- <lb/>
            tation with the Romans; for Virgil has borrowed the first of them, and <lb/>
            applied it, as our author does, to the conduct of Fabius Maximus against <lb/>
            Hannibal. </note> <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note> <lb/>
            This is a species of fault which ought also to be avoided <lb/>
            in civil matters; for there are some men who, from a dread <lb/>
            of unpopularity, dare not express their opinions however <lb/>
            excellent they may be.</p>
          <p>XXV. All who hope to rise in a state ought strictly to <lb/>
            observe two rules of Plato. The first is, that they so keep <lb/>
            in view the advantage of their fellow citizens as to have <lb/>
            reference to it in whatever they do, regardless of their indi- <lb/>
            vidual interest.* The second is, that their cares be applied <lb/>
            to the whole of the state, lest while they are cherishing one <lb/>
            part they abandon the others. For the administration of <lb/>
            government, like a guardianship, ought to be directed to the <lb/>
            good of those who confer, and not of those who receive the <lb/>
            trust. † Now, they who consult the interests of one part of <note type="footnote"> " “ Political power is rightly exercised only when it subserves the welfare <lb/>
            of the community. The community, which has the right to withhold <lb/>
            power, delegates it of course for its own advantage. If in any case its <lb/>
            advantage is not consulted, then the object for which it was delegated is <lb/>
            frustrated ; or, in simple words, the measure which does not promote the <lb/>
            public welfare is not right. It matters nothing whether the community have <lb/>
            delegated specifically so much power for such and such purposes ; the <lb/>
            power, being possessed, entails the obligation. Whether a sovereign derives <lb/>
            absolute authority by inheritance, or whether a president is entrusted with <lb/>
            limited authority for a year, the principles of their duty are the same. <lb/>
            The obligation to employ it only for the public good, is just as real and <lb/>
            lUSt as great in one case as in the other. The Russian and the Turk have <lb/>
            the same right to require that the power of their rulers shall be so employed <lb/>
            as the Englishman or American. They may not be able to assert this <lb/>
            right, but that does not affect its existence, nor the ruler's duty, nor his <lb/>
            responsibility to that Almighty Being before whom he must give an account <lb/>
            of his stewardship. These reasonings, if they needed confirmation, derive <lb/>
            it from the fact that the Deity imperatively requires us, according to our <lb/>
            opportunities to do good to man.”—Dymond's Essay 3, cap. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t “ Political power (says Dymond) is rightly possessed only when it is <lb/>
            possessed by the consent of the community.”—Ibid. </note><note type="footnote"> The doctrine of the essential sovereignty of the people, and the delegated <lb/>
            power of all governors is thus laid down by Milton. " It is thus manifest <lb/>
            that the power of kings and magistrates is nothing else but what is only <lb/>
            derivative, transferred, and committed to them in trust from the people to <lb/>
            the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains funda- <lb/>
            mentally, and cannot be taken from them without a violation of their natural <lb/>
            birthright; and from hence Aristotle, and the best of political writers, have <lb/>
            defined a king, him who governs to the good and profit of his people, and <lb/>
            not for his own ends.”’-Milton's " Tenure of Kings and Magistrates.” <lb/>
            And again : " It follows that since the king or magistrate holds his authority <lb/>
            of the people, both originally and naturally, for their good in the first place, <lb/>
            and not his own, then may the people, as oft as they shall judge it for the </note> <pb n="45"/>

            a community and neglect another, introduce into the state <lb/>
            the greatest of all evils, sedition and discord. From this <lb/>
            partiality some seem to court the people, some each great <lb/>
            man, but few the whole. Hence the great discords amongst <lb/>
            the Athenians, and in our government not only seditions <lb/>
            but the most destructive wars, which every worthy and brave <lb/>
            citizen who deserves to rise in the state will avoid and de- <lb/>
            test : he will give himself entirely up to the service of <lb/>
            his country, without regard to riches or to power, and he <lb/>
            will watch over the whole so as to consult the good of all, <lb/>
            He will even be far from bringing any man into hatred or <lb/>
            disgrace, by ill-grounded charges, and he will so closely <lb/>
            attach himself to the rules of justice and virtue, that how- <lb/>
            ever lie may give offence he will preserve them, and incur <lb/>
            death itself rather than swerve from the principles I have <lb/>
            laid down.</p>
          <p>Of all evils, ambition and the disputes for public posts are <lb/>
            the most deplorable. Plato, likewise, on this subject, says <lb/>
            very admirably, " that they who dispute for the management <lb/>
            of a state resemble mariners wrangling about who should <lb/>
            direct the helm." He then lays down as a rule that we <lb/>
            ought to look upon those as our enemies who take arms <lb/>
            against the public, and not those who want to have public <lb/>
            affairs directed by their judgment. For instance, Publius <lb/>
            Africanus and Quintus Metellus differed in opinion, but <lb/>
            without animosity.</p>
          <p>Nor, indeed, are those to be listened to who consider that <lb/>
            we ought to cherish a bitter resentment against our enemies, <lb/>
            and that this is characteristic of a high-minded and brave <lb/>
            man; for nothing is more noble, nothing more worthy of a <lb/>
            great and a good man, than placability and moderation.*' <note type="footnote"> best, either choose him or reject him, retain him or depose him, though <lb/>
            nor tyrant, merely by the liberty and right of free-born men to be governed <lb/>
            as seems to them best. This, though it cannot but stand with plain reason, <lb/>
            shall be made good also by scripture : ‛ When thon art come into the land <lb/>
            which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt say, I will set a king over <lb/>
            me, like as all the nations about me.’—Deut. xvii. 14. These words confirm <lb/>
            us that the right of choosing, yea of changing their own government, is by <lb/>
            the grant of God himself in the people.”-Ibid. </note><note type="footnote"> * It is impossible not to remark how far the popular standard of duty, <lb/>
            and the modern laws of honour, fall below this high and almost Christian <lb/>

            Nay, amidst free nations and equality of rights, an equability <lb/>
            and loftiness of temper is necessary, to prevent our falling <lb/>
            into an idle, disagreeable peevishness, when we are irritated <lb/>
            by persons approaching us unseasonably, or preferring to us <lb/>
            unreasonable requests. Yet this politeness and moderation <lb/>
            ought to be so tempered, that for the sake of the interests of <lb/>
            the state severity should be employed, otherwise public <lb/>
            business could not be carried on. Meanwhile, all reprimands <lb/>
            and punishments ought to be inflicted without abuse, without <lb/>
            regard to the party so punishing or reprimanding, but to the <lb/>
            good of the state.</p>
          <p>We ought, likewise, to take care that the punishment be <lb/>

            guard against passion; for the man who is to pronounce a <lb/>
            sentence of punishment in a passion, never can preserve that <lb/>
            mean between what is too much and too little, which is so <lb/>
            justly recommended by the Peripatetics, did they not too <lb/>
            much commend the passion of anger, by asserting it to be a <lb/>
            useful property of our nature. For my part, I think that it <lb/>
            ought to be checked under all circumstances ;† and it were <lb/>
            to be wished that they who preside in government were like <note type="footnote"> * “ A slight perusal of the laws by which the measures of vindictive and <lb/>

          <p>XXVI. Now, during our prosperity, and while things <lb/>
            flow agreeably to our desire, we ought with great care to <lb/>
            avoid pride and arrogance; for, as it discovers weakness not <lb/>
            to bear adversity with equanimity, so also with prosperity. <lb/>
            That equanimity in every condition of life is a noble attri- <lb/>
            bute, and that uniform expression of countenance and appear- <lb/>
            anc3 which we find recorded of Socrates, and also of Cams <lb/>
            Lælius. Though Philip of Macedon was excelled by his soil <lb/>
            in his achievements and his renown, yet I find him superior <lb/>
            to him in politeness and goodness of nature; the one, there- <lb/>
            fore, always appeared great, while the other often became <lb/>
            detestable. So that they appear to teach rightly, who admo- <lb/>
            nish us that the more advanced we are in our fortune the <lb/>
            more affable ought we to be in our behaviour. Panætius <lb/>
            tells us his scholar and friend, Africanus, used to say, that <lb/>
            as horses, grown unruly by being in frequent engagements, <lb/>
            are delivered over to be tamed by horse-breakers, thus men, <lb/>
            who grow riotous and self-sufficient by prosperity, ought, as <lb/>
            it were, to be exercised in the traverse of reason and phi- <lb/>
            losophy, that they may learn the inconstancy of human affairs <lb/>
            and the uncertainty of fortune.</p>
          <p>In the time of our greatest prosperity we should also have <lb/>
            the greatest recourse to the advice of our friends, and greater <lb/>
            authority should be conceded to them than before. At such <lb/>
            a time we are to take care not to lend our ears to flatterers, <lb/>
            or to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by adulation, by <lb/>
            which it is easy to be misled: for we then think ourselves <lb/>
            such as may be justly praised, an opinion that gives rise <lb/>
            to a thousand errors in conduct; because, when men are <lb/>
            once blown up with idle conceits, they are exposed to igno- <lb/>
            minious ridicule and led into the greatest mistakes. So much <lb/>
            for this subject.</p>
          <p>One thing you are to understand, that they who regulate <lb/>
            public affairs perform the greatest exploits, and such as <lb/>
            require the highest style of mind, because their business is <lb/>
            most extensive and concerns the greatest number. Yet there <lb/>
            are, and have been, many men of great capacities, who in <lb/>
            private life have planned out or attempted mighty matters, <lb/>
            and yet have confined themselves to the limits of their own <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            affairs; or, being thrown into a middle state, between phi <lb/>
            losophers and those who govern the state, have amused <lb/>
            themselves with the management of their private fortune, <lb/>
            without swelling it by all manner of means, not debarring <lb/>
            their friends from the benefit of it, but rather, when occasion <lb/>
            calls upon them, sharing it both with their friends and their <lb/>
            country. This should be originally acquired with honesty, <lb/>
            without any scandalous or oppressive practices; it should <lb/>
            then be made serviceable to as many as possible, provided <lb/>
            they be worthy; it should next be augmented by prudence, <lb/>
            by industry, and frugality, without serving the purposes of <lb/>
            pleasure and luxury rather than of generosity and humanity. <lb/>
            The man who observes those rules may live with magni- <lb/>
            ficence, with dignity, and with spirit, yet with simplicity <lb/>
            and honour, and agreeably to (the economy of) human life.</p>
          <p>XXVII. The next thing is, to treat of that remaining part <lb/>
            of virtue in which consist chastity and those (as we may <lb/>
            term them) ornaments of life, temperance, moderation, and all <lb/>
            that allays the perturbations of the mind. Under this head <lb/>
            is comprehended what in Latin we may call decorum (or the <lb/>
            graceful), for the Greeks term it the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱεπον</foreign>. Now, its quality <lb/>
            is such that it is indiscernible from the honestum ; for what- <lb/>
            ever is graceful is virtuous, and whatever is virtuous is <lb/>
            graceful.</p>
          <p>But it is more easy to conceive than to express the differ- <lb/>
            ence between what is virtuous and what is graceful (or <lb/>
            between the honestum and the decorum;) for whatever is <lb/>
            graceful appears such, when virtue is its antecedent. What <lb/>
            is graceful, therefore, appears not only in that division of <lb/>
            virtue which is here treated of, but in the three foregoing <lb/>
            ones ; for it is graceful in a man to think and to speak with <lb/>
            propriety, to act with deliberation, and in every occurrence <lb/>
            of life to find out and persevere in the truth. On the other <lb/>
            hand, to be imposed upon, to mistake, to faulter, and to be <lb/>
            deceived, is as ungraceful as to rave or to be insane. Thus, <lb/>
            whatever is just is graceful; whatever is unjust is as un- <lb/>
            graceful as it is criminal. The same principle applies to <lb/>
            courage; for every manly and magnanimous action is worthy <lb/>
            of a man and graceful; the reverse, as being unworthy, <lb/>
            is ungraceful.</p>
          <p>This, therefore, which I call gracefulness, is a universal <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXVIII.]</note> <lb/>
            property of virtue, and a property that is self-evident, and <lb/>
            not discerned by any profundity of reasoning; for there is a <lb/>
            certain gracefulness that is implied in every virtue, and <lb/>
            which may exist distinctly from virtue, rather in thought <lb/>
            than in fact: as grace and beauty of person, for example, <lb/>
            cannot be separated from health, so the whole of that grace- <lb/>
            fulness which I here speak of is blended with virtue, but <lb/>
            may exist separately in the mind and in idea.</p>
          <p>Now, the definition of this is twofold : for there is a general <lb/>
            gracefulness that is the property of all virtue, and that in- <lb/>
            eludes another, which is fitted to the particular divisions of <lb/>
            virtue. The former is commonly defined to be that grace- <lb/>
            fulness that is conformable to that excellence of man, in <lb/>
            which he differs from other sentient beings; but the special, <lb/>
            which is comprised under the general, is defined to be a <lb/>
            gracefulness so adapted to nature as to exhibit propriety <lb/>
            and sweetness under a certain elegant appearance.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. We may perceive that these things are so <lb/>
            understood from that gracefulness which is aimed at by the <lb/>
            poets, and of which elsewhere more is wont to be said ; for <lb/>
            we say that the poets observe that gracefulness to be when <lb/>
            a person speaks and acts in that manner which is most <lb/>
            becoming his character. Thus if Æacus or Minos should <lb/>
            say:-</p>
          <p>Let them hate me, so they fear me ;</p>
          <p>Or-</p>
          <p>The father's belly is his children's grave,</p>
          <p>it would seem unsuitable, because we know them to have <lb/>
            been just persons; but when said by an Atreus, they are <lb/>
            received with applause, because the speech is worthy of the <lb/>
            character. Now, poets will form their judgment of what <lb/>
            is becoming in each individual according to his character; <lb/>
            but nature herself has stamped on us a character in excellence <lb/>
            greatly surpassing the rest of the animal creation.</p>
          <p>Poets, therefore, in their vast variety of characters, con- <lb/>
            sider what is proper and what is becoming, even in the vicious: <lb/>
            but as nature herself has cast to us our parts in constancy <lb/>
            moderation, temperance, and modesty; as she, at the same <lb/>
            time, instructs us not to be unmindful, how we should <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            behave to mankind, the effect is, that the extent both of that <lb/>
            gracefulness which is the general property of all virtue, and <lb/>
            of that particular gracefulness that is adapted to every species <lb/>
            of it, is discovered. For as personal beauty, by the sym- <lb/>
            metrical disposition of the limbs, attracts our attention and <lb/>
            pleases the eye, by the harmony and elegance with which <lb/>
            each part corresponds to another, so that gracefulness which <lb/>
            manifests itself in life, attracts the approbation of those <lb/>
            among whom we live, by the order, consistency, and modesty <lb/>
            of all our words and deeds.</p>
          <p>There is, therefore, a degree of respect due from us, suited <lb/>
            to every man's character, from the best to the worst: for it <lb/>
            it is not only arrogant, but it is profligate, for a man to disre- <lb/>
            gard the world's opinion of himself; but, in our estimate of <lb/>
            human life, we are to make a difference between justice and <lb/>
            moral susceptibility.* The dictate of justice is to do no <note type="footnote"> * Justice and moral susceptibility.] Orig. Justiciam et verecundiam. <lb/>
            This is a very fine passage, and deserves to be explained. Verecundia is com- <lb/>
            monly translated bashfulness or modesty ; but in the sense of our author here, <lb/>
            neither of those two words will do ; nor am I sure that the word decency, <lb/>
            or any word in the English tongue, comes fully up to his meaning, which <lb/>
            is, an inborn reverence for what is right, and which supplies the place of, <lb/>
            and sometimes controls, the law. Many actions may be agreeable to law, <lb/>
            and yet disagreeable to this inborn principle. The tragedian Seneca has <lb/>
            distinguished them very finely. He brings in Pyrrhus, saying, <lb/>
            Pyr. Lex nulla capto parcit aut pœnam impedit. <lb/>
            To this Agamemnon replies, <lb/>
            Ag. Quod non vetat lex, hoc vetat fieri pudor. <lb/>
            Pyr. "No law exempts a captive from the sword." <lb/>
            Ag. “ Where the law does not, moral duties bind." <lb/>
            Our author inculcates the same principle in many other parts of his works; <lb/>
            and it was afterwards admitted by Justinian into his Institutes. " Fide com- <lb/>
            missa appellata sunt, quia nullo vinculo juris, sed tantum pudore eorum qui <lb/>
            rogabantur,continebantur.” " Deeds of trust were so called, because the party <lb/>
            entrusted was not obligated by law, but by conscience or morality." Ovid <lb/>
            has a very noble sentiment, which he seems to have taken from our author <lb/>
            and from Plato. <lb/>
            Nondum justiciam facinus mortale fugarat, <lb/>
            Ultima de superis illa reliquit humum ; <lb/>
            Proquc metu, populuin, sine vi, pudor ipse regebat. <lb/>
            “ Nor justice yet had fled from human crimes, <lb/>
            Of all their godheads she the last remained ; <lb/>
            For awful conscience, in those happy times, <lb/>
            Ruled without fear, and without force restrained." </note> <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXVIII.]</note><lb/>
            wrong; that of moral susceptibility is to give no offence to <lb/>
            mankind, and in this the force of the graceful is most per- <lb/>
            ceptible. By these explanations I conceive that what we <lb/>
            mean by the graceful and becoming may be understood.</p>
          <p>Now the duty resulting from this has a primary tendency <lb/>
            to an agreement with and conservation of our nature ; and <lb/>
            if we follow it as a guide we never shall err, but shall attain <note type="footnote"> Verecundia or pudor, therefore, is properly an inward abhorrence of <lb/>
            moral turpitude, through which the conscience is awed, and may be said to <lb/>
            blush. Plato, and from him Plutarch, makes justice and this verecundia <lb/>
            to be inseparable companions. “ God (says the former) being afraid lest <lb/>
            the human race should entirely perish upon earth, gave to mankind jus- <lb/>
            tice and moral susceptibility, those ornaments of states and the bonds of <lb/>
            society." </note><note type="footnote"> It is on the possession of this moral susceptibility, anterior to and inde- <lb/>
            pendent of human laws, that Bishop Butler founds his ethical system. <lb/>
            Thus he says of man, that “ from his make, constitution, or nature, he is, <lb/>
            in the strictest and most proper sense, a law to himself;” that “ he bath <lb/>
            the rule of right within," and that what is wanting is only that he <lb/>
            honestly attend to it;" and, in enforcing the authority of this natural <lb/>
            monitor, " your obligation to obey this law is its being the law of your <lb/>
            nature. That your conscience approves of and attests to such a course of <lb/>
            action is itself alone an obligation. Conscience does not only offer itself to <lb/>
            show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority <lb/>
            with it, that it is our natural guide-the guide assigned us by the Author of <lb/>
            our nature. It, therefore, belongs to our condition of being; it is our duty <lb/>
            to walk in that path, and to follow this guide, without looking about to see <lb/>
            whether we may not possibly forsake them with impunity." It is with a <lb/>
            like reference that Lord Bacon says “The light of nature not only <lb/>
            shines upon the human mind through the medium of a rational faculty, <lb/>
            but by an internal instinct, according to the law of conscience, which is a <lb/>
            sparkle of the purity of man's first estate.” But a parallel passage from <lb/>
            the pen of Cicero himself, affords a still fuller and loftier enunciation of <lb/>
            this principle:—“ There is, indeed, one true and original law, conformable <lb/>
            to reason and to nature, diffused over all, invariable, eternal, which calls to <lb/>
            the fulfilment of duty and to abstinence from injustice, and which calls <lb/>
            with that irresistible voice which is felt in all its authority wherever it is <lb/>
            heard. This law cannot be abolished or curtailed, nor affected in its sanc- <lb/>
            tions by any law of man. A whole senate, a whole people, cannot dispense <lb/>
            from its paramount obligation. It requires no commentator to render it <lb/>
            distinctly intelligible, nor is it different at Rome, and at Athens, at the pre- <lb/>
            sent, and in ages to come; but in all times and in all nations, it is, and has <lb/>
            been, and will be, one and everlasting-one as that God, its great Author <lb/>
            and promulgator, who is the common sovereign of all mankind, is himself <lb/>
            one. No man can disobey it without flying, as it were, from his own bosom <lb/>
            and repudiating his nature, and in this very act will inflict on himself the <lb/>
            severest of retributions, even though he escape what is commonly regarded <lb/>
            as punishment.” </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            to that natural excellence which consists in acuteness and <lb/>
            sagacity, to that which is best adapted to human society, and <lb/>
            to that which is energetic and manly.* But the chief force <lb/>
            of the graceful lies in that suitableness of which I am now <lb/>
            treating. For not only those emotions of a physical kind, <lb/>
            but still more those of the mind are to be approved as they <lb/>
            are conformable to nature. For the nature and powers of <lb/>
            the mind are two-fold ; one consists in appetite, by the <lb/>
            Greeks called (i. e. impulse) which hurries man hither <lb/>
            and thither ; the other in reason, which teaches and explains <lb/>
            what we are to do, and what we are to avoid. The result is, <lb/>
            that reason should direct and appetite obey.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Now every human action ought to be free from <lb/>
            precipitancy and negligence, nor indeed ought we to do <lb/>
            anything for which we cannot give a justifiable reason. This <lb/>
            indeed almost amounts to a definition of duty. Now we <lb/>
            must manage so as to keep the appetites subservient to <lb/>
            reason, that they may neither outstrip it, nor fall behind <lb/>
            through sloth and cowardice. Let them be ever composed <lb/>
            and free from all perturbation of spirit; and thus entire <lb/>
            consistency and moderation will display themselves. For <lb/>
            those appetites that are too vagrant and rampant as it were, <lb/>
            either through desire or aversion, are not sufficiently under <lb/>
            the command of reason ; such, 1 say, undoubtedly transgress <lb/>
            bounds and moderation. For they abandon and disclaim <lb/>
            that subordination to reason, to which by the law of nature <lb/>
            they are subjected, and thereby not only the mind but the <lb/>
            body is thrown into disturbance. Let any one observe the <lb/>
            very looks of men who are in a rage, of those who are. <lb/>
            agitated by desire or fear, or who exult in an excess of joy ; <lb/>
            all whose countenances, voices, motions, and attitudes, are <lb/>
            changed.</p>
          <p>But to return to my description of duty. From these par- <lb/>
            ticulars we learn that all our appetites ought to be contracted <lb/>
            and mitigated ; that all our attention and diligence ought to <lb/>
            be awake, so that we do nothing in a rash, random, thought- <lb/>
            less, and inconsiderate manner. For nature has not formed <lb/>
            us to sport and merriment, but rather to seriousness, and <lb/>
            studies that are important and sublime. Sport and merriment <note type="footnote"> * In other words, to wisdom, justice, and fortitude. </note> <pb n="53"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXX.]</note><lb/>
            are not always disallowable : but we are to use them as we <lb/>
            do sleep and other kinds of repose, when we have despatched <lb/>
            our weighty and important affairs. Nay, our very manner <lb/>
            of joking should be neither wanton nor indecent, but genteel <lb/>
            and good-humoured. For as we indulge boys not in an <lb/>
            unlimited licence of sport, but only in that which is not <lb/>
            inconsistent with virtuous conduct, so in our very jokes there <lb/>
            should appear some gleam of a virtuous nature.</p>
          <p>The manner of joking is reduceable under two denomina- <lb/>
            tions ;-one that is ill-bred, insolent, profligate, and obscene ; <lb/>
            another that is elegant, polite, witty, and good-humoured. <lb/>
            We have abundance of this last, not only in our Plautus, <lb/>
            and the authors of the old Greek comedy, but in the writings <lb/>
            of the Socratic philosophers. Many collections have likewise <lb/>
            been made by various writers, of humorous sayings, such as <lb/>
            that made by Cato, and called his Apopthegms. The dis- <lb/>
            tinction, therefore, between a genteel and an ill-mannered <lb/>
            joke is a very ready one. The former, if seasonably <lb/>
            made, and when the attention is relaxed, is worthy of a <lb/>
            virtuous man ; the other, if it exhibit immorality in its <lb/>
            subject, or obscenity in the expression, is unworthy even of a <lb/>
            man. There is likewise a certain limit to be observed, even <lb/>
            in our amusements, that we do not give up everything to <lb/>
            amusement, and that, after being elevated by pleasure, we <lb/>
            do not sink into some immorality. Our Campus Martins, <lb/>
            and the sport of hunting, supply creditable examples of <lb/>
            amusement.</p>
          <p>XXX. But in all our disquisitions concerning the nature <lb/>
            of a duty, it is material that we keep in our eye the great <lb/>
            excellence of man's nature above that of the brutes and all <lb/>
            other creatures. They are insensible to everything but <lb/>
            pleasure, and are hurried to it by every impulse. Whereas <lb/>
            the mind of man is nourished by study and reflection, and, <lb/>
            being charmed by the pleasure of seeing and hearing, it is <lb/>
            ever either inquiring or acting. But if there is a man who <lb/>
            has a small bias to pleasure, provided he is not of the brute <lb/>
            kind (for there are some who are men only in name) ; but, I <lb/>
            say, if he is more high-minded even in a small degree, though <lb/>
            he may be smitten with pleasure, he yet, through a principle <lb/>
            of shame, hides and disguises his inclination for it.</p>
          <p>From this we are to conclude that mere corporeal pleasure <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            is unworthy the excellency of man's nature ; and that it ought <lb/>
            therefore to be despised and rejected ; but that if a man <lb/>
            shall have any delight in pleasure, he ought to be extremely <lb/>
            observant of limits in its indulgence. Therefore, the nourish- <lb/>
            ment and dress of our bodies should be with a view not to <lb/>
            our pleasure, but to our health and our strength ; and should <lb/>
            we examine the excellency and dignity of our nature, we <lb/>
            should then be made sensible how shameful it is to melt <lb/>
            away in pleasure, and to live in voluptuousness and effemi- <lb/>
            nacy ; and how noble it is to live with abstinence, with <lb/>
            modesty, with strictness, and sobriety.</p>
          <p>We are likewise to observe, that nature has, as it were, <lb/>
            endowed us with two characters. The first is in common to all <lb/>
            mankind, because all of its partake in that excellency of <lb/>
            reason, which places us above the brutes ; from which is <lb/>
            derived all that is virtuous, all that is graceful, and by which <lb/>
            we trace our connections with our several duties. The other <lb/>
            character is peculiar to individuals. For, as there are great <lb/>
            dissimilarities in our persons-some for instance are swift in <lb/>
            running, others strong in wrestling ; and in style of beauty <lb/>
            some have a dignity, and others a sweetness of aspect-so <lb/>
            are there still greater varieties in our minds.</p>
          <p>Lucius Crassus and Lucius Philippus had a great deal of <lb/>
            wit; but in Caius Cæsar, the son of Lucius, it was greater <lb/>
            in degree, and more elaborate. In their contemporaries, <lb/>
            Marcus Scaurus, and young Mareus Drusus, there was a <lb/>
            remarkable seriousness ; in Caius Lælius great hilarity ; but <lb/>
            in his friend Scipio greater ambition, and a graver style of <lb/>
            life. As to the Greeks, we are told of Socrates that he was <lb/>
            agreeable and witty ; his conversation jocose, and in all his <lb/>
            discourse a feigner of opinions whom the Greeks called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίϱων</foreign>. On the other hand, Pythagoras and Pericles, without <lb/>
            any gaiety, attained the highest authority. Amongst the <lb/>
            Carthaginian generals, Hannibal, we learn, was crafty, and <lb/>
            Quintus Maximus amongst our own generals was apt at con- <lb/>
            cealment, secrecy, dissimulation, plotting, and anticipating the <lb/>
            designs of enemies. In this class the Greeks rank Themis- <lb/>
            tocles, and lason of Pheræ, above all others ; and place among <lb/>
            the very first, that cunning and artful device of Solon, when, <lb/>
            to secure his own life, and that he might be of greater service <lb/>
            to his country, he counterfeited madness. In opposition to <pb n="55"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXXI.]</note><lb/>
            those characters, the tempers of many others are plain and <lb/>
            open. Lovers of truth and haters of deceit, they think that <lb/>
            nothing should be done by stealth, nothing by stratagem ; <lb/>
            while others care not what they suffer themselves, or whom <lb/>
            they stoop to, provided they accomplish their ends; as we <lb/>
            have seen Sylla and Marcus Crassus. In which class Lysander <lb/>
            the Lacedemonian, we are told, had the greatest art and per- <lb/>
            severance, and that Callicratides, who succeeded to Lysander in <lb/>
            the command of the fleet, was the reverse. We have known <lb/>
            some others, who though very powerful in conversation, <lb/>
            always make themselves appear undistinguished individuals <lb/>
            among many ; such were the Catuli, father and son, and <lb/>
            Quintus Mucius Mancia. I have heard from men older than <lb/>
            myself, that Publius Scipio Nasica was of the same cast, but <lb/>
            that his father, the same who punished the pernicious designs <lb/>
            of Tiberius Gracchus, was void of all politeness in conver- <lb/>
            sation : and the same of Xenocrates, the most austere of <lb/>
            philosophers, and from that very circumstance a distinguished <lb/>
            and celebrated man. Innumerable, but far from being blame- <lb/>
            able, are the other differences in the natures and manners of <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Every man, however, ought carefully to follow <lb/>
            out his peculiar character, provided it is only peculiar, and <lb/>
            not vicious, that he may the more easily attain that grace- <lb/>
            fulness of which we are inquiring. For we ought to manage <lb/>
            so as never to counteract the general system of nature; but <lb/>
            having taken care of that, we are to follow our natural <lb/>
            bias; insomuch, that though other studies may be of greater <lb/>
            weight and excellence, yet we are to regulate our pursuits <lb/>
            by the disposition of our nature. It is to no purpose to thwart <lb/>
            nature, or to aim at what you cannot attain. We therefore <lb/>
            may have a still clearer conception of the graceful I am <lb/>
            recommending, from this consideration, that nothing is grace- <lb/>
            ful that goes (as the saying is) against the grain, that is, in <lb/>
            contradiction and opposition to nature.</p>
          <p>If anything at all is graceful, nothing surely is more so <lb/>
            than a uniformity through the course of all your life, as <lb/>
            well as through every particular action of it ; and you <lb/>
            never can preserve this uniformity, if, aping another man's <lb/>
            nature, you forsake your own. For as we ought to converse <lb/>
            in the language we are best acquainted with, for fear of <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            making ourselves justly ridiculous, as those do who cram in <lb/>
            Greek expressions ; so there ought to be no incongruity in <lb/>
            our actions, and none in all the tenor of our lives.*</p>
          <p>Now so powerful is this difference of natures, that it may <lb/>
            be the duty of one man to put himself to death, and yet not <lb/>
            of another, though in the same predicament. For was the <lb/>
            predicament of Marcus Cato different from that of those <lb/>
            who surrendered themselves to Cæsar in Africa? Yet it <lb/>
            had been perhaps blameable in the latter, had they put them- <lb/>
            selves to death, because their lives were less severe, and their <lb/>
            moral natures more pliable. But it became Cato, who had <lb/>
            by perpetual perseverance strengthened that inflexibility <lb/>
            which nature had given him, and had never departed from <lb/>
            the purpose and resolution lie had once formed, to die rather <lb/>
            than to look upon the face of a tyrant.† <note type="footnote"> * “ Decency, or a proper regard to age, sex, character, and station in the <lb/>
            world, may be ranked among the qualities which are immediately agreeable <lb/>
            to others, and which by that means acquire praise and approbation. An <lb/>
            effeminate behaviour in a man, a rough manner in a woman, these are ugly <lb/>
            because unsuitable to each character, and different from the qualities which <lb/>
            we expect in the sexes. It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic beauties, <lb/>
            or a comedy in tragic. The disproportions hurt the eye, and convey a dis- <lb/>
            agreeable sentiment to the spectators, the source of blame and disappro- <lb/>
            bation. This is that indecorum which is explained so much at large by <lb/>
            Cicero in his Offices.”—Hume's “ Principles of Morals,” see. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> t The guilt of suicide has been palliated by Godwin, and utterly denied <lb/>
            by Hume. The following remarks emanated from a sounder moralist than <lb/>
            either :— <lb/>
            "The lesson which the self-destroyer teaches to his connections, of sinking <lb/>
            in despair under the evils of life, is one of the most pernicious which a man <lb/>
            can bequeath. The power of the example is also great. Every act of <lb/>
            suicide tacitly conveys the sanction of one more judgment in its favour ; <lb/>
            frequency of repetition diminishes the sensation of abhorrence, and makes <lb/>
            succeeding sufferers resort to it with less reluctance." " Besides which <lb/>
            general reasons, says Dr. Paley, (' Moral and Political Philosophy,' b. 4, <lb/>
            c. 3,) each case will be aggravated by its own proper and particular conse- <lb/>
            quences ; by the duties that are deserted ; by the claims that are defrauded ; <lb/>
            by the loss, affliction, or disgrace, which our death, or the manner of it, <lb/>
            causes our family, kindred, or friends, by the occasion we give to many to <lb/>
            suspect the sincerity of our moral and religious professions, and together with <lb/>
            ours those of all others :” and lastly by the scandal which we bring upon <lb/>
            religion itself, by declaring practically that it is not able to support man <lb/>
            under the calamities of life. Some men say that the New Testament <lb/>
            contains no prohibition of suicide. If this were true it would avail nothing, <lb/>
            because tnere are many things which it does riot forbid, but which every one <lb/>
            knows to be wicked. But in reality it does forbid it. Every exhortation </note> <pb n="57"/>

            How various were those sufferings of Ulysses, in his long <lb/>
            continued wanderings, when he became the slave of women <lb/>
            (if you consider Circe and Calypso as such): and in all he <lb/>
            said he sought to be complaisant and agreeable to every <lb/>
            body, nay, put up with abuses from slaves and handmaidens <lb/>
            at home, that he might at length compass what he desired; <lb/>
            but with the spirit with which he is represented, Ajax would <lb/>
            have preferred a thousand deaths to suffering such indig- <lb/>
            nities.</p>
          <p>In the contemplation of which each ought to consider <lb/>
            what is peculiar to himself, and to regulate those peculiari- <lb/>
            ties, without making any experiments how another man's <lb/>
            become them; for that manner which is most peculiarly a <lb/>
            man's own always becomes him best.</p>
          <p>Every man ought, therefore, to study his own genius, so <lb/>
            as to become an impartial judge of his own good and bad <lb/>
            qualities, otherwise the players will discover better sense <lb/>
            than we; for they don't choose for themselves those parts <lb/>
            that are the most excellent, but those which are best adapted <lb/>
            to them. Those who rely on their voices choose the part of <lb/>
            Epigonas or Medus ; the best actors that of Menalippa or <lb/>
            Clytemnestra. Rupilius, who I remember, always selected <lb/>
            that of Antiopa; Esopus seldom chose that of Ajax. Shall <lb/>
            a player, then, observe this upon the stage, and shall a wise <lb/>
            man not observe it in the conduct of life ? Let us, there- <lb/>
            fore, most earnestly apply to those parts for which we are <lb/>
            best fitted; but should necessity degrade us into characters <lb/>
            unsuitable to our genius, let us employ all our care, attention, <note type="footnote"> which it gives to be patient, every encouragement to trust in God, every <lb/>
            consideration which it urges as a support under affliction and distress, is a <lb/>
            virtual prohibition of suicide ; because if a man commits suicide he rejects <lb/>
            every such advice and encouragement, and disregards every such motive. </note><note type="footnote"> " To him who believes either in revealed or natural religion, there is a <lb/>
            certain folly in the commission of suicide; for from what does he fly ? from <lb/>
            his present sufferings, whilst death, for aught that he has reason to expect, <lb/>
            or at any rate for aught that he knows, may only be the portal to sufferings <lb/>
            more intense. Natural religion, I think, gives no countenance to the suppo- <lb/>
            sition that suicide can be approved by the Deity, because it proceeds upon <lb/>
            the belief that, in another state of existence, he will compensate good men <lb/>
            for the sufferings of the present. At the best, and under either religion, it <lb/>
            is a desperate stake. He that commits murder may repent, and, we hope <lb/>
            be forgiven ; but he that destroys himself, whilst he incurs a load of guilt, <lb/>
            cuts off by the act the power of repentance.”—Dymond's Essays, Essay ii. <lb/>

            and industry, in endeavouring to perform them, if not with <lb/>
            propriety, with as little impropriety as possible: nor should <lb/>
            we strive so much to attain excellencies which have not been <lb/>
            conferred on us, as to avoid defects.</p>
          <p>XXXII. To the two characters above described is added <lb/>
            a third, which either accident or occasion imposes on us; and <lb/>
            even a fourth, which we accommodate to ourselves by our <lb/>
            own judgment and choice. Now kingdoms, governments, <lb/>
            honours, dignities, riches, interest, and whatever are the <lb/>
            qualities contrary to them, happen through accident, and are <lb/>
            directed by occasions; but what part we ourselves should <lb/>
            wish to act, originates from our own will. Some, therefore, <lb/>
            apply to philosophy, some to the civil law, and some to elo- <lb/>
            quence ; and of the virtues themselves some endeavour to <lb/>
            shine in one, and some in another.</p>
          <p>Men generally are ambitious of distinguishing themselves <lb/>
            in that kind of excellence in which their fathers or their an- <lb/>
            cestors were most famous: for instance, Quintus, the son of <lb/>
            Publius Mucius, in the civil law; Africanus, the son of <lb/>
            Paulus, in the art of war. Some, however, increase, by <lb/>
            merits of their own, that glory which they have received from <lb/>
            their fathers; for the same Africanus crowned his military <lb/>
            glory with the practice of eloquence. In like manner, Timo- <lb/>
            theus, the son of Conon, who equalled his father in the duties <lb/>
            of the field, but added to them the glory of genius and <lb/>
            learning. Sometimes, however, it happens that men, laying <lb/>
            aside the imitation of their ancestors, follow a purpose of their <lb/>
            own; and this is most commonly the case with such men who, <lb/>
            though descended from obscure ancestors, purpose to them- <lb/>
            selves great aims.</p>
          <p>In our search, then, after what is graceful, all those parti- <lb/>
            culars ought to be embraced in our contemplation and study. <lb/>
            In the first place, we are to determine who and what manner <lb/>
            of men we are to be, and what mode of life we are to adopt- <lb/>
            a consideration which is the most difficult of all; for, in <lb/>
            our early youth, when there is the greatest weakness of <lb/>
            judgment, every one chooses to himself that kind of life <lb/>
            which he has most fancied. He, therefore, is trepanned into <lb/>
            some fixed and settled course of living before lie is capable <lb/>
            to judge what is the most proper.*</p>

            <note type="margin">CHAP XXXIII.]</note> For the Hercules of Prodicus, as we learn from Xenophon, <lb/>
            in his early puberty (an age appointed by nature for every <lb/>
            man's choosing his scheme of life) is said to have gone into a <lb/>
            solitude, and there sitting down, to have deliberated within <lb/>
            himself much, and for a long time, whether of two paths that <lb/>
            he saw before him it was better to enter on, the one of pleasure, <lb/>
            the other of virtue. This might, indeed, happen to a Jove- <lb/>
            begotten Hercules; but not so with us, who imitate those <lb/>
            whom we have an opinion of, and are thereby drawn into <lb/>
            their pursuits and purposes: for generally, prepossessed by <lb/>
            the principles of our parents, we are drawn away to their <lb/>
            customs and habits. Others, swayed by the judgment of <lb/>
            the multitude, are passionately fond of those things which <lb/>
            seem best to the majority. A few, however, either through <lb/>
            some good fortune, or a certain excellency of nature, or <lb/>
            through the training of their parents, pursue the right path <lb/>
            of life.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The rarest class is composed of those who, <lb/>
            endowed with an exalted genius, or with excellent educa- <lb/>
            tion and learning, or possessing both, have had scope enough <lb/>
            for deliberating as to what course of life they would be <lb/>
            most willing to adopt. Every design, in such a delibera- <lb/>
            tion, ought to be referred to the natural powers of the indi- <lb/>
            vidual; for since, as I said before, we discover this propriety <lb/>
            in every act which is performed, by reference to the qualities <lb/>
            with which a man is born, so, in fixing the plan of our future <lb/>
            life, we ought to be still much more careful in that respect, <lb/>
            that we may be consistent throughout the duration of life <lb/>
            with ourselves, and not deficient in any one duty.</p>
          <p>But because nature in this possesses the chief power, and <note type="footnote"> dawn of thought, in a determination to some state of life, by the choice of <lb/>
            one whose authority may preclude caprice, and whose influence may pre- <lb/>
            judice them in favour of his opinion. The general precept of consulting <lb/>
            the genius is of little use, unless we are told how the genius can be known. <lb/>
            If it is to be discovered only by experiment, life will be lost before the re- <lb/>
            solution can be fixed ; if any other indications are to be found, they may, <lb/>
            perhaps, be very early discerned. At least, if to miscarry in an attempt be <lb/>
            a proof of having mistaken the direction of the genius, men appear not less <lb/>
            frequently deceived with regard to themselves than to others ; and there- <lb/>
            fore no one has much reason to complain that his life was planned out by <lb/>
            his friends, or to be confident that he should have had either more honour <lb/>
            or happiness, by being abandoned to the chance of his own fancy.”—Dr <lb/>
            Johnson's “ Rambler,” No. 19. </note> <pb n="60"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note> <lb/>
            fortune the next, we ought to pay regard to both in fixing <lb/>
            our scheme of life; but chiefly to nature, as she is much <lb/>
            more firm and constant, insomuch that the struggle, some- <lb/>
            times between nature and fortune, seems to be between <lb/>
            a mortal and an immortal being. The mail, therefore, <lb/>
            who adapts his whole system of living to his undepraved <lb/>
            nature, let him maintain his constancy; for that, above all <lb/>
            things, becomes a man, provided he come not to learn that he <lb/>
            has been mistaken in his choice of a mode of life. Should <lb/>
            that occur, as it possibly may, a change must be made in <lb/>
            all his habits and purposes which, if circumstances shall be <lb/>
            favourable, we shall more easily and readily effect; but, should <lb/>
            it happen otherwise, it must be done slowly and gradually. <lb/>
            Thus, men of sense think it more suitable that friendships <lb/>
            which are disagreeable or not approved should be gradually <lb/>
            detached, rather than suddenly cut off. Still, upon altering <lb/>
            our scheme of life, we ought to take the utmost care to make <lb/>
            it appear that we have done it upon good grounds.</p>
          <p>But if, as I said above, we are to imitate our ancestors, <lb/>
            this should be first excepted that their bad qualities must not <lb/>
            be imitated. In the next place, if nature does not qualify <lb/>
            us to imitate them in some things, we are not to attempt it: <lb/>
            for instance, the son of the elder African us, who adopted the <lb/>
            younger son of Paulus, could not, from infirmity of health, <lb/>
            resemble his father so much as his father did his grand- <lb/>
            father. If, therefore, a man is unable to defend causes, to <lb/>
            entertain the people by haranguing, or to wage war, yet still <lb/>
            he ought to do what is in his power; he ought to practise <lb/>
            justice, honour, generosity, modesty, and temperance, that <lb/>
            what is wanting may be the less required of him. Now, the <lb/>
            best inheritance a parent can leave a child--more excellent <lb/>
            than any patrimony-is the glory of his virtue and his deeds; <lb/>
            to bring disgrace on which ought to be regarded as wicked <lb/>
            and monstrous.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. And as the same moral duties are not suited to the <lb/>
            different periods of life, some belonging to the young, others <lb/>
            to the old, we must likewise say somewhat on this distinc- <lb/>
            tion. It is the duty of a young man to reverence his elders, <lb/>
            and amongst them to select the best and the worthiest, on <lb/>
            whose advice and authority to rely. For the inexperience <lb/>
            of youth ought to be instructed and conducted by the wisdom <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXXIV.]</note> <lb/>
            of the aged. Above all things, the young man ought to be <lb/>
            restrained from lawless desires, and exercised in endurance <lb/>
            and labour both of body and mind, that by persevering in <lb/>
            them, he may be efficient in the duties both of war and peace. <lb/>
            Nay, when they even unbend their minds and give them- <lb/>
            selves up to mirth, they ought to avoide intemperance, and <lb/>
            never lose sight of morality ; and this will be the more easy <lb/>
            if even upon such occasions they desire that their elders <lb/>
            should be associated with them.*</p>
          <p>As to old men, their bodily labours seem to require diminu- <lb/>
            tion, but the exercises of their mind ought even to be increased. <lb/>
            Their care should be to assist their friends, the youth, and <lb/>
            above all their country, to the utmost of their ability by their <lb/>
            advice and experience. Now there is nothing that old age <lb/>
            ought more carefully to guard against, than giving itself up <lb/>
            to listlessness and indolence. As to luxury, though it is <lb/>
            shameful in every stage of life, in old age it is detestable ; <lb/>
            but if to that is added intemperance in lawless desires, the <lb/>
            evil is doubled; because old age itself thereby incurs dis- <lb/>
            grace ; and makes the excesses of the young more shameless. †</p>
          <p>Neither is it foreign to my purpose to touch upon the <lb/>
            duties of magistrates, of private citizens, and of strangers. <lb/>
            It is then the peculiar duty of a magistrate to bear in mind <lb/>
            that he represents the state, and that he ought, therefore, to <lb/>
            maintain its dignity and glory, to preserve its constitution, <lb/>
            to act by its laws, and to remember that these things are <note type="footnote"> * So Dr. South describes joy as exhibited by Adam in the state of inno- <lb/>

            posed, like the gaiety of youth tempered with the gravity of age, or the <lb/>

            life, than enlist themselves under guides who have lost their way ?”- <lb/>

            committed to his fidelity.* As to a private man and citi- <lb/>
            zen, his duty is to live upon a just and equal footing with <lb/>
            his fellow citizens, neither subordinate and subservient nor <lb/>
            domineering. In his sentiments of the public to be always <lb/>
            for peaceful and virtuous measures; for such we are ac- <lb/>
            customed to imagine and describe a virtuous citizen.</p>
          <p>Now the duty of a stranger and an alien is, to mind no- <lb/>
            thing but his own business, not to intermeddle with another, <lb/>
            and least of all to be curious about the affairs of a foreign <lb/>
            government. Thus we shall generally succeed in the prac- <lb/>
            tice of the moral duties, when we inquire after what is most <lb/>
            becoming and best fitted to persons, occasions, and ages; and <lb/>
            nothing is more becoming than in all our actions and in all <lb/>
            our deliberations to preserve consistency.</p>
          <p>XXXV. But, because the graceful or becoming character <lb/>
            we treat of appears in all our words and actions, nay, in <lb/>
            every motion and disposition of our person, and consists of <lb/>
            three particulars, beauty, regularity, and appointment suited <lb/>
            to action (ideas which indeed are difficult to be expressed, <lb/>
            but it is sufficient if they are understood); and as in these three <lb/>
            heads is comprehended our care to be approved by those <lb/>
            amongst whom and with whom we live, on them also a few <lb/>
            observations must be made. In the first place nature seems <lb/>
            to have paid a great regard to the form of our bodies, by ex- <lb/>
            posing to the sight all that part of our figure that has a beauti- <lb/>
            ful appearance, while she has covered and concealed those parts <lb/>
            which were given for the necessities of nature, and which <lb/>
            would have been offensive and disagreeable to the sight.</p>
          <p>This careful contrivance of nature has been imitated by <lb/>
            the modesty of mankind ; for all men in their senses conceal <lb/>
            from the eye the parts which nature has hid; and they take <note type="footnote"> It Respecting the ultimate possession of political power by the governed, <lb/>
            and the consequently delegated power of rulers, we have the following <lb/>
            striking passage in Hall's Liberty of the Press. " With the enemies ol' <lb/>
            freedom it is a usual artifice to represent the sovereignty of the people as a <lb/>
            licence to anarchy and disorder. But the tracing of civil power to that <lb/>
            source will not diminish our obligation to obey; it only explains its reasons, <lb/>
            and settles it on clear determinate principles. It turns blind submission <lb/>
            into rational obedience, tempers the passion for liberty with the love of <lb/>
            order, and places mankind in a happy medium, between the extremes of <lb/>
            anarchy on the one side, and oppression on the other. It is the polar star <lb/>
            that will conduct us safe over the ocean of political debate and specu <lb/>
            lation, the law of laws, the legislator of legislators." </note> <pb n="63"/>
             <note type="margin">XXXVI.]</note><lb/>
            care that they should discharge as privately as possible even <lb/>
            the necessities of nature. And those parts which serve those <lb/>
            necessities, aud the necessities themselves, are not called by <lb/>
            their real names; because that which is not shameful if <lb/>
            privately performed, it is still obscene to describe. There- <lb/>
            fore neither the public commission of those things, nor the <lb/>
            obscene expression of them, is free from immodesty.</p>
          <p>Neither are we to regard the Cynics or the Stoics, who <lb/>
            are next to Cynics, who abuse and ridicule us for deeming <lb/>
            things that are not shameful in their own nature, to become <lb/>
            vicious through names and expressions. Now, we give <lb/>
            everything that is disgraceful in its own nature its proper <lb/>
            term. Theft, fraud, adultery, are disgraceful in their own <lb/>
            nature, but not obscene in the expression. The act of be- <lb/>
            getting children is virtuous, but the expression obscene. <lb/>
            Thus, a great many arguments to the same purpose are <lb/>
            maintained by these philosophers in subversion of delicacy. <lb/>
            Let us, for our parts, follow nature, and avoid whatever is <lb/>
            offensive to the eyes or ears ; let us aim at the graceful or <lb/>
            becoming, whether we stand or walk, whether we sit or lie <lb/>
            down, in every motion of our features, our eyes, or our <lb/>
            hands.</p>
          <p>In those matters two things are chiefly to be avoided ; <lb/>
            that there be nothing effeminate and foppish, nor any thing <lb/>
            coarse and clownish. Neither are we to admit, that those <lb/>
            considerations are proper for actors and orators, but not <lb/>
            binding upon us. The manners at least of the actors, <lb/>
            from the morality of our ancestors, are so decent that none <lb/>
            of them appear upon the stage without an under-covering ; <lb/>
            being afraid lest if by any accident certain parts of the body <lb/>
            should be exposed, they should make an indecent appearance. <lb/>
            According to our customs, sons grown up to manhood do not <lb/>
            bathe along with their fathers, nor sons-in-law with their <lb/>
            fathers-in-law. Modesty of this kind, therefore, is to be <lb/>
            cherished, especially as nature herself is our instructor and <lb/>
            guide.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Now as beauty is of two kinds, one that consists <lb/>
            in loveliness, and the other in dignity; loveliness we should <lb/>
            regard as the characteristic of women, dignity of men : <lb/>
            therefore, let a man remove from his person every ornament <lb/>
            that is unbecoming a man, and let him take the same care of <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            every similar fault with regard to his gesture or motion. For <lb/>
            very often the movements learned in the Palæstra are offen- <lb/>
            sive, and not a few impercinent gestures among the players <lb/>
            are productive of disgust, while in both whatever is unaffected <lb/>
            and simple is received with applause. Now, comeliness in the <lb/>
            person is preserved by the freshness of the complexion, and <lb/>
            that freshness by the exercises of the body. To this we are <lb/>
            to add, a neatness that is neither troublesome nor too much <lb/>
            studied, but which just avoids all clownish, ill-bred sloven- <lb/>
            ness. The same rules are to be observed with regard to <lb/>
            ornaments of dress, in which, as in all other matters, a mean <lb/>
            is preferable.</p>
          <p>We must likewise avoid a drawling solemn pace in walk- <lb/>
            ing, so as to seem like bearers in a procession ; and likewise <lb/>
            in matters that require despatch, quick, hurried motions ; <lb/>
            which, when they occur, occasion a shortness of breathing, <lb/>
            an alteration in the looks, and a convulsion in the features, <lb/>
            all which strongly indicate an inconstant character. But <lb/>
            still greater should be our care that the movements of our <lb/>
            mind never depart from nature ; in which we shall succeed <lb/>
            if we guard against falling into any flurry and disorder or <lb/>
            spirit, and keep our faculties intent on the preservation of <lb/>
            propriety. Now the motions of the mind are of two kinds, <lb/>
            the one of reflection and the other of appetite. Reflection <lb/>
            chiefly applies itself in the search of truth. Appetite prompts <lb/>
            us to action. We are therefore to take care to employ our <lb/>
            reflection upon the best subjects, and to render our appetite <lb/>
            obedient to our reason.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. And since the influence of speech is very great <lb/>
            and that of two kinds,—one proper for disputing, the other <lb/>
            for discoursing,-the former should be employed in plead- <lb/>
            ings at trials, in assemblies of the people, and meetings of the <lb/>
            senate; the latter in social circles, disquisitions, the meetings of <lb/>
            our friends, and should likewise attend upon entertainments. <lb/>
            Rhetoricians lay down rules for disputing, but none for dis- <lb/>
            coursing, though I am not sure but that likewise may be <lb/>
            done. Masters are to be found in all pursuits in which there <lb/>
            are learners, and all places are filled with crowds of rhetori- <lb/>
            cians ; but there are none who study this, and yet all the rules <lb/>
            that are laid down for words and sentiments (in debate) <lb/>
            are likewise applicable to conversation.</p><pb n="65"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">CHAP XXXVII.]</note></p>
          <p>But, as we have a voice as the organ of speech, we ought <lb/>
            to aim at two properties in it: first that it be clear, and <lb/>
            secondly that it be agreeable ; both are unquestionably to be <lb/>
            sought from nature; and yet practice may improve the one, <lb/>
            and imitating those who speak nervously and distinctly, the <lb/>
            other. There was, in the Catuli, nothing by which you <lb/>
            could conclude them possessed of any exquisite judgment in <lb/>
            language, though learned to be sure they were ; and so have <lb/>
            others been. But the Catuli were thought to excel in the <lb/>
            Latin tongue ; their pronunciation was harmonious, their <lb/>
            words were neither mouthed nor minced ; so that their ex- <lb/>
            pression was distinct, without being unpleasant; while their <lb/>
            voice, without strain, was neither faint nor shrill. The <lb/>
            manner of Lucius Crassus was more flowing, and equally <lb/>
            elegant; though the opinion concerning the Catuli, as good <lb/>
            speakers, was not less. But Cæsar, brother to the elder <lb/>
            Catulus, exceeded all in wit and humour; insomuch that even <lb/>
            in the forensic style of speaking, he with his conversational <lb/>
            manner surpassed the energetic eloquence of others. There- <lb/>
            fore, in all those matters, we must labour diligently if we <lb/>
            would discover what is the point of propriety in every <lb/>
            instance.</p>
          <p>Let our common discourse therefore (and this is the great <lb/>
            excellence of the followers of Socrates) be smooth and good- <lb/>
            humoured, without the least arrogance. Let there be plea- <lb/>
            santry in it. Nor let any one speaker exclude all others as <lb/>
            if he were entering on a province of his own, but consider <lb/>
            that in conversation, as in other things, alternate participa- <lb/>
            tion is but fair.* But more especially let him consider Oil <lb/>
            what subjects he should speak. If serious, let him use gra- <lb/>
            vity ; if merry, good-humour. But a man ought to take the <note type="footnote"> * " As the mutual shocks in society and the oppositions of interest and <lb/>

            manner, the eternal contrarieties in company of men's pride and self-con- <lb/>
            ceit, have introduced the rules of good manners or politeness, in order to <lb/>

            abstracted from any consideration of utility or beneficial tendencies ; they </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>

            greatest care that his discourse betray no defect in his mo- <lb/>
            rals ; and this generally is the case when for the sake of de- <lb/>
            traction we eagerly speak of the absent in a malicious, ridi- <lb/>
            culous, harsh, bitter, and contemptuous manner.</p>
          <p>Now conversation generally turns upon private concerns, <lb/>
            or politics, or the pursuits of art and learning. We arc, <lb/>
            therefore, to study, whenever our conversation begins to <lb/>
            ramble to other subjects, to recall it: and whatever subjects <lb/>
            may present themselves (for we are not all pleased with the <lb/>
            same subjects and that similarly and at all times) we should <lb/>
            observe how far our conversation maintains its interest; and <lb/>
            as there was a reason for beginning so there should be a limit <lb/>
            at which to conclude.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. But as we are very propely enjoined, in all <lb/>
            the course of our life, to avoid all fits of passion, that is, ex- <lb/>
            cessive emotions of the mind uncontrolled by reason ; in like <lb/>
            manner, our conversation ought to be free from all such emo- <lb/>
            tions ; so that neither resentment manifest itself, nor undue <lb/>
            desire, nor slovenness, nor indolence, nor any thing of that <lb/>
            kind ; and, above all things, we should endeavour to indicate <lb/>
            both esteem and love for those we converse with. Re- <lb/>
            proaches may sometimes be necessary, in which we may per- <lb/>
            haps be obliged to employ a higher strain of voice and a <lb/>
            harsher turn of language. Even in that case, we ought only <lb/>
            to seem to do these things in anger ; but as, in the cases of <lb/>
            cautery and amputations, so with this kind of correction we <lb/>
            should have recourse to it seldom and unwillingly; and in- <lb/>
            deed, never but when no other remedy can be discovered ; <lb/>
            but still, let all passion be avoided ; for with that nothing <lb/>
            can be done with rectitude, nothing with discretion.</p>
          <p>In general it is allowable to adopt a mild style of rebuke, <lb/>
            combining it with seriousness, so that severity may be indi- <lb/>
            cated but abusive language avoided. Nay, even what of <lb/>
            bitterness there is in the reproach should be shown to have <note type="footnote"> conciliate affection, promote esteem, and extremely enhance the merit of <lb/>
            the person who regulates his behaviour by them. </note><note type="footnote"> “ In conversation, the lively spirit of dialogue is agreeable even to those <lb/>
            who desire not to have any share in the discourse. Hence the relater of <lb/>
            long stories, or the pompous declaimer is very little approved of. But most <lb/>
            men desire likewise their time in the conversation, and regard with a very <lb/>
            evil eye that loquacity which deprives them of a right they are naturally so <lb/>
            zealous of.”—Hume's " Principles of Morals,” section viii. </note> <pb n="67"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXXIX.]</note><lb/>
            been adopted for the sake of the party reproved. Now, it is <lb/>
            advisable, even in those disputes which take place with our <lb/>
            bitterest enemies, if we hear any that is insulting to ourselves <lb/>
            to maintain our equanimity, and repress passion; for what- <lb/>
            ever is done under such excitement can never be either con- <lb/>
            sistently performed, or approved of by those who are present.* <lb/>
            It is likewise indecent for a man to be loud in his own praise <lb/>
            (and the more so if it be false), and so to imitate the swagger- <lb/>
            ing soldier (in the play) amidst the derision of the auditors.</p>
          <p>xXXIX. Now, as I touch, at least wish to touch, upon <lb/>
            every matter of duty, I shall likewise treat of the kind of <lb/>
            house which I think suited to a man of high rank and office; <lb/>
            the end of this being utility, to it the design of the building <lb/>
            must be adapted, but still regard must be paid to magni- <lb/>
            ficence and elegance. We learn that it was to the honour of <lb/>
            Cneius Octavius, the first of that family who was raised to <lb/>
            the consulship, that he built upon the Palatine, a house of a <lb/>
            noble and majestic appearance, which, as it was visited as a <lb/>
            spectacle by the common people, was supposed to have voted <lb/>
            its proprietor, though but a new man, into the consulship. <lb/>
            Scaurus demolished this house, and took the ground into his <lb/>
            own palace. But though the one first brought a consulship <lb/>
            into his family, yet the other, though the son of a man of the <lb/>
            greatest rank and distinction, carried into this, his enlarged <lb/>
            palace, not only repulse but disgrace, nay ruin. <note type="footnote"> * ,; The command of anger appears, upon many occasions, not less ge- <lb/>
            nerous and noble than that of fear. The proper expression of just indig- <lb/>
            nation composes many of the most splendid and admired passages both of <lb/>
            ancient and modem eloquence. The Phillippics of Demosthenes, the <lb/>
            catilinnarians of Cicero derive their whole beauty from the noble propriety <lb/>
            with which this passion is expressed. But this just indignation is nothing <lb/>
            but anger restrained and properly attempered to what the impatient spec- <lb/>
            tator can enter into. The blustering and noisy passion which goes beyond <lb/>
            this is always odious and offensive, and interests us, not for the angry man <lb/>
            but the man with whom he is angry. The nobleness of pardoning appears, <lb/>
            upon many occasions, superior even to the most perfect propriety of resent- <lb/>
            in,-,, when either proper acknowledgements have been made by the offending <lb/>
            party, or, even without any such acknowledgments, when the public in- <lb/>
            terest requires that the most mortal enemies should unite for the discharge <lb/>
            of some important duty. The man who can cast away all animosity, and act <lb/>
            with confidence and cordiality towards the person who had most grievously <lb/>
            offended him, seems justly to merit our highest admiration.—Smith's “Moral <lb/>
            Sentiments," part vi. section iii. </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <pb n="68"/>

          <p>For dignity should be adorned by a palace, but not be wholly <lb/>
            sought from it :-the house ought to be ennobled by thie. <lb/>
            master, and not the master by the house. And, as in other <lb/>
            matters a man should have regard to others and not to his <lb/>
            own concerns alone, so in the house of a man of rank, who <lb/>
            is to entertain a great many guests and to admit a multitude <lb/>
            of all denominations, attention should be paid to spaciousness; <lb/>
            but a great house often reflects discredit upon its master, if <lb/>
            there is solitude in it, especially if, under a former proprietor, <lb/>
            it has been accustomed to be well filled. It is a mortifying <lb/>
            thing when passengers exclaim, "Ah! ancient dwelling! by <lb/>
            how degenerate a master art thou occupied!” which may <lb/>
            well be said at the present time of a great many houses.</p>
          <p>But you are to take care, especially if you build for yourself, <lb/>
            not to go beyond bounds in grandeur and costliness. Even <lb/>
            the example of an excess of this kind does much mischief. For <lb/>
            most people, particularly in this respect, studiously imitate <lb/>
            the example of their leaders. For instance, who imitates <lb/>
            the virtue of the excellent Lucius Lucullus ? But how many <lb/>
            there are who have imitated the magnificence of his villas. <lb/>
            To which certainly a bound ought to be set, and it reduced to <lb/>
            moderation, and the same spirit of moderation ought to be <lb/>
            extended to all the practice and economy of life. But of this <lb/>
            enough.</p>
          <p>Now in undertaking every action we are to regard three <lb/>
            things. First, that appetite be subservient to reason, than <lb/>
            which there is no condition better fitted for preserving the <lb/>
            moral duties. We are, secondly, to examine how important <lb/>
            the object in which we desire to accomplish, that our atten- <lb/>
            tion or labour may be neither more nor less than the occasion <lb/>
            requires. Thirdly, we are to take care that every thing <lb/>
            that comes under the head of magnificence and dignity should <lb/>
            be well regulated. Now, the best regulation is, to observe <lb/>
            that same graceful propriety which I have recommended, and <lb/>
            to go no further. But of those three heads, the most excellent <lb/>
            is, that of making our appetites subservient to our reason.</p>
          <p>XL. I am now to speak concerning the order and the <lb/>
            timing of things. In this science is comprehended what the <lb/>
            Greek call <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐταξία</foreign>, not that which we Romans call mode- <lb/>
            ration, an expression that implies keeping within bounds ; <lb/>
            whereas that is <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐταξία</foreign>, in which the preservation of order is <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XL.]</note> <lb/>
            involved. This duty, which we will denominate moderation, <lb/>
            is defined by the Stoics as those things which are either said <lb/>
            or done in their appropriate places of ranging. Therefore, <lb/>
            the signification of order and of arrangement seems to be <lb/>
            the same. For they define order to be the disposing of <lb/>
            things into fitting and convenient places. Now they tell <lb/>
            us that the appropriate place of an action is the oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of doing it. The proper opportunity for action <lb/>
            being called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐϰαρία</foreign>, and by the Latins, <lb/>
            occasio, or occasion. Thus, as I have already observed, that <lb/>
            modestia which we have thus explained, is the knowledge of <lb/>
            acting according to the fitness of a conjecture.</p>
          <p>But prudence, of which we have treated in the beginning <lb/>
            of this book, may admit of the same definition. Under this <lb/>
            head, however, I speak of moderation and temperance, and <lb/>
            the like virtues. Therefore, the considerations which belong <lb/>
            to prudence have been treated in their proper place. But at <lb/>
            present I am to treat of those virtues I have been so long <lb/>
            speaking of, which relate to morality, and the approbation of <lb/>
            those with whom we -live.</p>
          <p>Such then should be the regularity of all our actions, that <lb/>
            in the economy of life, as in a connected discourse, all things <lb/>
            may agree and correspond. For it would be unbecoming <lb/>
            and highly blameable, should we, when upon a serious <lb/>
            subject, introduce the language of the jovial or the effemi- <lb/>
            nate. When Pericles had for his colleague in the prætor- <lb/>
            ship Sophocles the poet, and as they were discoursing upon <lb/>
            their joint official duty, a beautiful boy by chance passed by, <lb/>
            Sophocles exclaimed, "What a charming boy, Pericles !" but <lb/>
            Pericles very properly told him, " A magistrate ought to <lb/>
            keep not only his hands, but his eyes under restraint." Now <lb/>
            Sophocles, had he said the same thing at a trial of athletic <lb/>
            performers would not have been liable to this just reprimand, <lb/>
            such importance there is in the time and place. So too, a <lb/>
            man, who is going to plead a cause, if on a journey or in a <lb/>
            walk he should muse or appear to himself more thonghtful <lb/>
            than ordinary, he is not blamed: but should he do this <lb/>
            at an entertainment, he would seem ill-bred for not dis- <lb/>
            tinguishing times.</p>
          <p>But those actions that are in wide discrepancy with good- <lb/>
            breeding, such, for instance, as singing in the forum, or <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            any such absurdity, are so easily discernible, that they re- <lb/>
            quire no great degree of reprehension or advice. But faults <lb/>
            that seem to be inconsiderable, and such as are descernible <lb/>
            only by a few, are to be more carefully avoided. As in <lb/>
            lutes or pipes, however little they be out of tune, it is per- <lb/>
            ceived by a practised ear ; so in life we are to guard against <lb/>
            all discrepancy, and the rather as the harmony of morals is <lb/>
            greater and much more valuable than that of sounds.</p>
          <p>XLI. Thus, as the ear is sensible of the smallest discord <lb/>
            in musical instruments, so we, if we desire to be accurate <lb/>
            and attentive observers of faults, may make great discoveries <lb/>
            from very trifling circumstances. The cast of the eye, the <lb/>
            bending or unbending of the brow, an air of dejection or <lb/>
            cheerfulness, laughter, the tone of words, silence, the raising <lb/>
            or falling of the voice, and the like circumstances, we may <lb/>
            easily form a judgment which of them are in their pro- <lb/>
            per state, and which of them are in discord with duty <lb/>
            and nature. Now in this case, it is advisable to judge <lb/>
            from others, of the condition and properties of every one of <lb/>
            those, so that we ourselves may avoid those things that are <lb/>
            unbecoming in others. For it happens, I know not how, that <lb/>
            we perceive what is defective more readily in others than we <lb/>
            do in ourselves. Therefore, when masters mimic the faults <lb/>
            of boys that they may amend them, those boys are most <lb/>
            easily corrected.</p>
          <p>Neither is it improper, in order to fix our choice in matters <lb/>
            which involve a doubt, if we apply to men of learning and <lb/>
            also of experience, and learn what they think of the several <lb/>
            kinds of duty; for the greatest part of such men are usually <lb/>
            led to that conclusion to which nature herself directs; and in <lb/>
            these cases, we are to examine not only what a man says, <lb/>
            but what he thinks, and upon what grounds he thinks it. <lb/>
            For as painters, statuaries, and even poets, want to have <lb/>
            their works canvassed by the public in order to correct any <lb/>
            thing that is generally condemned, and examine both by <lb/>
            themselves and with others where the defect lies ; thus we <lb/>
            ought to make use of the judgment of others to do, and not <lb/>
            to do, to alter and correct, a great many things.</p>
          <p>As to actions resulting from the customs or civil institu- <lb/>
            tions of a people, no precepts can be laid down ; for those <lb/>
            very institutions are precepts in themselves. Nor ought men <pb n="71"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XLI.]</note><lb/>
            to be under the mistake to imagine that if Socrates or <lb/>
            Aristippus acted or spoke in opposition to the manners and <lb/>
            civil constitutions of their country, they themselves have a <lb/>
            similar licence.* For this was a right they acquired by their <note type="footnote"> * There are two things in this passage which must excite surprise; the <lb/>
            first, that Cicero should regard those actions as immoral in the generality of <lb/>
            society which he justifies in the case of two individuals on the sole ground <lb/>
            of their intellectual pre-eminence. For this must be the sole ground of the <lb/>
            distinction ; inasmuch as, if a moral superiority be admitted as a justifying <lb/>
            consideration in the case of Socrates, it can scarcely be denied to any other <lb/>
            individual who might be led to the adoption of a similar course. The second <lb/>
            is, that the customs and institutions of a country should be invested by <lb/>
            Cicero with the powers of moral obligation ; nor, considering the general tenor <lb/>
            of Cicero's ethics, is this the less surprising, from the fact that in modern <lb/>
            times the same principle was carried by Hobbes to a far greater extent. </note><note type="footnote"> “ According to him," says Sir James Mackintosh, " the perfect state of a <lb/>
            community is where law prescribes the religion and morality of the people, <lb/>
            and where the will of an absolute sovereign is the sole fountain of law." <lb/>
            The insufficiency both of the law of the land, and of that conventional in- <lb/>
            fluence which in modern times has been designated the law of honour as a <lb/>
            code of morality is admirably shown by Paley in the following passage :— </note><note type="footnote"> " The Law of Honour is a system of rules constructed by people of <lb/>
            fashion, and calculated to facilitate their intercourse with one another ; and <lb/>
            for no other purpose. Consequently, nothing is adverted to by the law of <lb/>
            honour, but what tends to incommode this intercourse. Hence this law <lb/>
            only prescribes and regulates the duties betwixt equals ; omitting such as <lb/>
            relate to the Supreme Being, as well as those which we owe to our inferiors. <lb/>
            For which reason, profaneness, neglect of public worship or private devo- <lb/>
            tion, cruelty to servants, rigorous treatment of tenants or other dependents, <lb/>
            want of charity to the poor, injuries done to tradesmen by insolvency or <lb/>
            delay of payment, with numberless examples of the same kind, are ac- <lb/>
            counted no breaches of honour ; because a man is not a less agreeable com- <lb/>
            panion for these vices, nor the worse to deal with in those concerns which <lb/>
            are usually transacted between one gentleman and another. Again ; the <lb/>
            law of honour, being constituted by men occupied in the pursuit of plea- <lb/>
            sure, and for the mutual conveniency of such men, will be found, as might <lb/>
            be expected from the character and design of the law-makers, to be, in most <lb/>
            instances, favourable to the licentious indulgence of the natural passions. <lb/>
            Thus it allows of fornication, adultery, drunkenness, prodigality, duelling, <lb/>
            and of revenge in the extreme; and lays no stress upon the virtues opposite <lb/>
            to these. </note><note type="footnote"> " That part of mankind, who are beneath the law of honour, often make <lb/>
            the Law of the Land their rule of life; that is, they are satisfied with them- <lb/>
            selves, so long as they do or omit nothing, for the doing or omitting of which <lb/>
            the law can punish them. Whereas every system of human laws, considered <lb/>
            as a rule of life, labours under the two following defects :—1. Human laws <lb/>
            omit many duties, as not objects of compulsion; such as piety to God, bounty <lb/>
            to the poor, forgiveness of injuries, education of children, gratitude to bene- <lb/>
            factors. The law never speaks but to command, nor commands but where </note> <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note> <lb/>
            great and superhuman endowments. But as to the whole <lb/>
            system of the Cynics; we are absolutely to reject it, because <lb/>
            it is inconsistent with moral susceptibility without which <lb/>
            nothing can be honest, nothing can be virtuous.</p>
          <p>Now it is our duty to esteem and to honour, in the same <lb/>
            manner as if they were dignified with titles or vested with <lb/>
            command, those men whose lives have been conspicuous for <lb/>
            great and glorious actions, who feel rightly towards the state <lb/>
            and deserve well or have deserved well of their country. <lb/>
            We are likewise to have a great regard for old age, to pay a <lb/>
            deference to magistrates ; to distinguish between (what we <lb/>
            owe to) a fellow citizen and a foreigner, and to consider whether <lb/>
            that foreigner comes in a public or a private capacity. In <lb/>
            short, not to dwell on particulars, we ought to regard, to <lb/>
            cultivate, and to promote the good will and the social welfare <lb/>
            of all mankind.</p>
          <p>XLII. Now with regard to what arts and means of ac- <lb/>
            quiring wealth are to be regarded as worthy and what dis- <lb/>
            reputable, we have been taught as follows. In the first place, <lb/>
            those sources of emolument are condemned that incur the <lb/>
            public hatred ; such as those of tax-gatherers and usurers. <lb/>
            We are likewise to account as ungenteel and mean the gains <lb/>
            of all hired workmen, whose source of profit is not their art <lb/>
            but their labour; for their very wages are the consideration of <lb/>
            their servitude. We are likewise to despise all who retail <lb/>
            from merchants goods for prompt sale; for they never can suc- <lb/>
            ceed unless they lie most abominably. Now nothing is <lb/>
            more disgraceful than insincerity. All mechanical labourers <lb/>
            are by their profession mean. For a workshop can contain <lb/>
            nothing befitting a gentleman. Least of all are those trades <lb/>
            to be approved that serve the purposes of sensuality, such <lb/>
            as (to speak after Terence) fishmongers, butchers, cooks, <lb/>
            pastry-cooks, and fishermen ; to whom we shall add, if you <note type="footnote">it can compel; consequently those duties, which by their nature must be <lb/>
            voluntary, are left out of the statute-book, as lying beyond the reach of its <lb/>
            operation and authority. 2. Human laws permit, or, which is the same <lb/>
            thing, suffer to go unpunished, many crimes, because they are incapable of <lb/>
            being defined by any previous description. Of which nature are luxury, <lb/>
            prodigality, partiality in voting at those elections in which the qualifications <lb/>
            of the candidate-ought to determine the success, caprice- in the disposition <lb/>
            of men's fortunes at their death, disrespect to parents, and a multitude <unclear>I</unclear>" <lb/>
            similar examples.”-“ Moral and Political Philosophy," book i. caps. 2 &amp; 3. </note> <pb n="73"/>

            please, perfumers, dancers, and the whole tribe of games- <lb/>
            ters.*</p>
          <p>But those professions that involve a higher degree of in- <lb/>
            telligence or a greater amount of utility, such as medicine, <lb/>
            architecture, the teaching the liberal arts, are honourable <lb/>
            in those to whose rank in life they are suited. As to <lb/>
            merchandizing, if on a small scale it is mean ; but if it is <lb/>
            extensive and rich, bring numerous commodities from all <lb/>
            parts of the world, and giving bread to numbers without <lb/>
            fraud, it is not so despicable. But if a merchant, satiated, <lb/>
            or rather satisfied with his profits, as he sometimes used <lb/>
            to leave the open sea and make the harbour, shall from <lb/>
            the harbour step into an estate and lands ; such a man seems <lb/>
            most justly deserving of praise. For of all gainful profes- <lb/>
            sions, nothing is better, nothing more pleasing, nothing <lb/>
            more delightful, nothing better becomes a well-bred man <lb/>
            than agriculture. But as I have handled that subject at <lb/>
            large in my Cato Major, you can draw from thence all that <lb/>
            falls under this head.</p>
          <p>XLIII. I have I think sufficiently explained in what <lb/>
            manner the duties arc derived from the consituent parts of <lb/>
            virtue. Now it often may happen that an emulation and <lb/>
            a contest may arise amongst things that are in themselves <lb/>
            virtuous ;-of two virtuous actions which is preferable. A <lb/>
            division that Panætius has overlooked. For as all virtue is <lb/>
            the result of four qualities, prudence, justice, magnanimity <lb/>
            and moderation; so in the choice of a duty, those qualities <lb/>
            must necessarily come in competition with one another.</p>
          <p>I am therefore of opinion that the duties arising from the <lb/>
            social relations are more agreeable to nature than those that <note type="footnote"> * There is perhaps no passage in this work more short-sighted and ridi- <lb/>
            culous than the above, and none which more clearly indicates the practical <lb/>
            fallaciousness of all systems of morals framed in ignorance of those views of <lb/>
            human nature which are derived from Christianity alone. To stigmatize as <lb/>
            morally base those occupations which are necessary to the comfort of society, <lb/>
            is to maintain the very opposite of his own fundamental principle, by affirm- <lb/>
            ing that immorality and not morality is necessary to the happiness of man- <lb/>
            kind. Indeed the attribution of any moral character to mere industrial <lb/>
            pursuits, is an absurdity which Cicero would probably not have incurred had <lb/>
            he lived but a few years later, and become acquainted as lie might, without <lb/>
            leaving Rome, with those fishermen and that tent-maker "of whom the <lb/>
            world was not worthy," and through them with that Being in whose sight, <lb/>
            amidst all the irregularities of time, " the rich and the poor meet together.” </note> <pb n="74"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            are merely notional. This may be confirmed from the fol- <lb/>
            lowing argument. Supposing that this kind of life should <lb/>
            befall a wise man, that in an affluence of all things he might <lb/>
            be able with great leisure to contemplate and attend to every <lb/>
            object that is worthy his knowledge; yet if his condition <lb/>
            be so solitary as to have no company with mankind, he would <lb/>
            prefer death to it. Of all virtues, the most leading is that <lb/>
            wisdom which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοϕια</foreign>, for by that sagacity <lb/>
            which they term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕρονησις</foreign> we understand quite another thing, <lb/>
            as it implies the knowledge of what things are to be de- <lb/>
            sired, and what to be avoided. But that wisdom which I <lb/>
            have stated to be the chief, is the knowledge of things divine <lb/>
            and human, which comprehends the fellowship of gods and <lb/>
            men, and their society within themselves. If that be, as <lb/>
            it certainly is, the highest of all objects, it follows of <lb/>
            course that the duty resulting from this fellowship is the <lb/>
            highest of all duties. For the knowledge and contem- <lb/>
            plation of nature is in a manner lame and unfinished, if it <lb/>
            is followed by no activity ; now activity is most perspi- <lb/>
            cuous when it is exerted in protecting the rights of mankind.</p>
          <p>It therefore has reference to the social interests of the <lb/>
            human race, and is for that reason preferable to knowledge; <lb/>
            and this every virtuous man maintains and exhibits in prac- <lb/>
            tice. For who is so eager in pursuing and examining the <lb/>
            nature of things, that if, while lie is handling and con- <lb/>
            templating the noblest objects of knowledge, the peril and <lb/>
            crisis of his country is made known to him, and that it is in <lb/>
            his power to assist and relieve her, would not instantly aban- <lb/>
            don and fling from him all those studies, even though he <lb/>
            thought he would be enabled to number the stars, or measure <lb/>
            the dimensions of the world ? And he would do the same <lb/>
            were the safety of a friend or a parent concerned or endan- <lb/>
            gered. From this consideration I infer, that the duties of <lb/>
            justice are perferable to the studies and duties of knowledge, <lb/>
            relating as they do to the interests of the human race, to <lb/>
            which no anterior consideration ought to exist in the mind <lb/>
            of man.</p>
          <p>XLIV. But some have employed their whole lives in the <lb/>
            pursuits of knowledge, and yet have not declined to contri- <lb/>
            bute to the utility and advantage of men. For they have <lb/>
            even instructed many how they ought be better citizens and <pb n="75"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XLIV.]</note><lb/>
            more useful to their country. Thus Lysis the Pythagorean <lb/>
            educated Epaminondas of Thebes, as did Plato Dion of <lb/>
            Syracuse, and so of many others ; and as to whatever ser- <lb/>
            vices I have performed, if I have performed any to the state, <lb/>
            I came to it after being furnished and adorned with know- <lb/>
            ledge by teachers and learning.</p>
          <p>Nor do those philosophers only instruct and educate those <lb/>
            who are desirous of learning while alive and present amongst <lb/>
            us; but they continue to do the same after death, by the <lb/>
            monuments of their learning; for they neglect no point that <lb/>
            relates to the constitution, the manners and the morals of <lb/>
            their country; so that it appears as if they had dedicated all <lb/>
            their leisure to our advantage. Thus while they are them- <lb/>
            selves devoted to the studies of learning and wisdom, they <lb/>
            make their understanding and their skill chiefly available to <lb/>
            the service of mankind. It is therefore more serviceable to <lb/>
            the public for a man to discourse copiously, provided it is <lb/>
            to the purpose, than for a man to think ever so accurately <lb/>
            without the power of expression ; the reason is, because <lb/>
            thought terminates in itself alone, but discourse affects those <lb/>
            with whom we are connected in a community.</p>
          <p>Now as the swarms of bees do not assemble in order to <lb/>
            form the honey-comb, but form the honey-comb because they <lb/>
            are by nature gregarious ; so, and in a far greater degree, <lb/>
            men being associated by nature, manifest their skill in think- <lb/>
            in- and acting. Therefore, unless knowledge is connected <lb/>
            with that virtue which consists in doing service to mankind, <lb/>
            that is, in improving human society, it would seem to be but <lb/>
            solitary and barren.</p>
          <p>In like manner greatness of soul, when utterly disunited <lb/>
            from the company and society of men, becomes a kind of un- <lb/>
            couth ferocity. Hence it follows, that the company and the <lb/>
            community of men are preferable to mere speculative know- <lb/>
            ledge.</p>
          <p>Neither is that maxim true which is affirmed by some, that <lb/>
            human communities and societies were instituted from the <lb/>
            necessity of our condition, because we cannot without the <lb/>
            help of others supply what our nature requires; and that if we <lb/>
            could be furnished, as by a kind of magic wand, with every <lb/>
            thing that relates to food and raiment, that then every man <lb/>
            of excelling genius, laying aside all other occupations, would <pb n="76"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            apply himself to knowledge and learning. The fact is not <lb/>
            so; for he would fly from solitude and look out for a com- <lb/>
            panion in his pursuits; and would desire sometimes to teach <lb/>
            and sometimes to learn, sometimes to listen and sometimes to <lb/>
            speak. Every duty therefore that operates for the good of <lb/>
            human community and society, is preferable to that duty <lb/>
            which is limited to speculation and knowledge.</p>
          <p>XLV. Here perhaps it should be inquired, whether the <lb/>
            duties of that society which is most suitable to nature are <lb/>
            preferable to moderation and decency ? By no means. For <lb/>
            some things are partly so disgraceful, and partly so criminal <lb/>
            in their nature, that a wise man would not commit them, <lb/>
            even to save his country. Posidonius has collected very <lb/>
            many such; but they are so obscene and so shocking that it <lb/>
            would be scandalous even to name them. A wise man would <lb/>
            not undertake such things, even to serve his country, nor <lb/>
            would his country undertake them to serve herself. But <lb/>
            it fortunately happens, that there never can be a conjunc- <lb/>
            ture, when the public interest shall require from a wise man <lb/>
            the performance of such actions.</p>
          <p>Hence it follows, that in the choice of our duties we are <lb/>
            to prefer that kind of duty that contributes to the good of <lb/>
            society. For well-directed action is always the result of <lb/>
            knowledge and prudence. And therefore it is of more con- <lb/>
            sequence to act properly, than to deliberate justly. Thus <lb/>
            much then may suffice on this subject; for this topic has <lb/>
            now been so fully laid open, that it is easy for every man in <lb/>
            the study of his duties, to see which is preferable. Now <lb/>
            in society there are degrees of duties by which every man <lb/>
            may understand what belongs to himself. The first is owing <lb/>
            to the immortal gods, the second to our country, the third <lb/>
            to our parents, and lastly to others through different grada- <lb/>
            tions.</p>
          <p>From these arguments thus briefly stated we perceive <lb/>
            that men are sometimes not only in doubt, whether a thing <lb/>
            is virtuous or disgraceful; but likewise when two virtuous <lb/>
            things are proposed, which is more so. This head, as I said <lb/>
            before, was omitted by Panætius. Let us now proceed to <lb/>
            what remains of our subject.</p><pb n="77"/>

          </ab>
          <p>I THINK I have in the former Book sufficiently explained <lb/>
            in what manner our duties are derived from morality, and <lb/>
            every kind of virtue. It now remains that I treat of those <lb/>
            kinds of duties that relate to the improvement of life, and <lb/>
            to the acquirement of those means which men employ for <lb/>
            the attainment of wealth and interest. In this inquiry, as I <lb/>
            have already observed, I will treat of what is useful, and <lb/>
            what is not so. Of several utilities I shall speak of that <lb/>
            which is more useful, or most so. Of all this I shall treat, <lb/>
            after premising a few words concerning my own plan of life <lb/>
            and choice of pursuits.</p>
          <p>Although my works have prompted a great many to the <lb/>
            exercise not only of reading but of writing, yet I sometimes <lb/>
            am apprehensive, that the name of philosophy is offensive to <lb/>
            some worthy men, and that they are surprized at my having <lb/>
            employed so much of my pains and time in that study. For <lb/>
            my part, as long as the state was under the management ofthose <lb/>
            into whose hands she had committed herself, I applied to it all <lb/>
            my attention and thought. But when the government was <lb/>
            engrossed by one person, when there was an end of all public <lb/>
            deliberation and authority ; when I in short had lost these <lb/>
            excellent patriots who were my assciates in the protection of <lb/>
            my country, I neither abandoned myself to that anguish of <lb/>
            spirit which, had I given way to it, must have consumed me, <lb/>
            nor did I indulge those pleasures that are disgraceful to a <lb/>
            man of learning.</p>
          <p>Would that the constitution had remained in its original <lb/>
            state; and that it had not fallen into the hands of men whose <lb/>
            aim was not to alter but to destroy it! For then I would first. <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            as I was wont to do when our government existed, have em- <lb/>
            ployed my labours in action rather than in writing; and in <lb/>
            the next place, in my writings I should have recorded my <lb/>
            own pleadings as I had frequently done, and not such subjects <lb/>
            as the present. But when the constitution, to which all my <lb/>
            care, thoughts, and labour used to be devoted, ceased to <lb/>
            exist, then those public and senatorial studies were silenced.</p>
          <p>But as my mind could not be inactive, and as my early life <lb/>
            had been employed in these studies, I thought that they <lb/>
            might most honourably be laid aside by betaking myself <lb/>
            anew to philosophy, having, when young, spent a great deal <lb/>
            of my time in its study, with a view to improvement. When <lb/>
            I afterwards began to court public offices and devoted <lb/>
            myself entirely to the service of my country, I had so much <lb/>
            room for philosophy as the time that remained over from the <lb/>
            business of my friends and the public. But I spent it all <lb/>
            in reading, having no leisure for writing.</p>
          <p>II. In the midst of the greatest calamities, therefore, I seem <lb/>
            to have realized the advantage that I have reduced into writ- <lb/>
            ing, matters in which my countrymen were not sufficiently <lb/>
            instructed, and which were most worthy their attention. <lb/>
            For in the name of the gods, what is more desirable, what is <lb/>
            more excellent, than wisdom ? What is better for man ? what <lb/>
            more worthy of him ? They therefore who court her are <lb/>
            termed philosophers ; for philosophy, if it is to be interpreted, <lb/>
            implies nothing but the love of wisdom.</p>
          <p>Now the ancient philosophers defined wisdom to be the <lb/>
            knowledge of things divine and human, and of the causes by <lb/>
            which these things are regulated ; a study that if any man <lb/>
            despises, I know not what he can think deserving of <lb/>
            esteem.</p>
          <p>For if we seek the entertainment of the mind, or a respite <lb/>
            'from cares, what is comparable to those pursuits that are <lb/>
            always searching out somewhat that relates to and secures the <lb/>
            welfare and happiness of life ? Or if we regard the principles <lb/>
            of self-consistency and virtue, either this is the art, or there is <lb/>
            absolutely no art by which we can attain them. And to say <lb/>
            that there is no art for the attainment of the highest objects, <lb/>
            when we see that none of the most inconsiderable are without it, <lb/>
            is the language of men who speak without consideration, and <lb/>
            w1 o mistake in the most important matters. Now if there is any <pb n="79"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP III.]</note><lb/>
            school of virtue, where can it be found, if you abandon this <lb/>
            method of study? But it is usual to treat these subjects more <lb/>
            particularly when we exhort to philosophy, which I have done <lb/>
            in another book. At this time my intention was only to <lb/>
            explain the reasons why, being divested of all offices of <lb/>
            state, I choose to apply myself to this study preferably to <lb/>
            all others.</p>
          <p>Now an objection is brought against me, and indeed by some <lb/>
            men of learning and knowledge, who inquire whether I act con- <lb/>
            sistently with myself, when, though I affirm that nothing can <lb/>
            be certainly known, I treat upon different subjects, and when, as <lb/>
            now, I am investigating the principles of moral duty. I could <lb/>
            wish such persons were thoroughly acquainted with my way <lb/>
            of thinking. I am not one of those whose reason is always <lb/>
            wandering in the midst of uncertainty and never has any- <lb/>
            thing to pursue. For if we abolish all the rules, not only of <lb/>
            reasoning but of living, what must become of reason, nay of <lb/>
            life itself? For my own part, while others maintain some <lb/>
            things to be certain, and others uncertain, I say, on the other <lb/>
            side, that some things are probable, and others not so.</p>
          <p>What, therefore, hinders me from following whatever <lb/>
            appears to me to be most probable, and from rejecting what <lb/>
            is otherwise ; and, while I avoid the arrogance of dogmatizing, <lb/>
            from escaping that recklessness which is most inconsistent with <lb/>
            wisdom ? Now all subjects are disputed by our sect, because <lb/>
            this very probability cannot appear, unless there be a com- <lb/>
            parison of the arguments on both sides. But, if I mistake <lb/>
            not, I have with sufficient accuracy explained these points in <lb/>
            my Academic;;;. As to you, my dear Cicero, though you are <lb/>
            now employed in the study of the oldest and noblest philo- <lb/>
            sophy under Cratippus, who greatly resembles those who <lb/>
            have propounded these noble principles, yet I was unwilling <lb/>
            that these my sentiments, which are so corresponding with <lb/>
            your system, should be unknown to you. But to proceed <lb/>
            in what I propose.</p>
          <p>III. Having laid down the five principles upon which we <lb/>
            pursue our duty, two of which relate to propriety and virtue, <lb/>
            two to the enjoyments of life, such as wealth, interest, and <lb/>
            power, the fifth to the forming of a right judgment in any case, <lb/>
            if there should appear to be any clashing between the princi- <lb/>
            ples I have mentioned, the part assigned to virtue is con- <pb n="80"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            eluded, and with that I desire you should be thoroughly ac- <lb/>
            quainted. Now the subject I am now to treat of is neither more <lb/>
            nor less than what we call expediency; in which matter custom <lb/>
            has so declined and gradually deviated from the right path, <lb/>
            that, separating virtue from expediency, it has determined that <lb/>
            some things may be virtuous which are not expedient, and some <lb/>
            expedient which are not virtuous; than which doctrine <lb/>
            nothing more pernicious can be introduced into human life.</p>
          <p>It is indeed with strictness and honesty that philosophers, <lb/>
            and those of the highest reputation, distinguish in idea those <lb/>
            three principles which really are blended together. For they <lb/>
            give it as their opinion that whatever is just is expedient ; <lb/>
            and in like manner whatever is virtuous is just ; from <lb/>
            whence it follows that whatever is virtuous is also expedient. <lb/>
            Those who do not perceive this distinction often admire <lb/>
            crafty and cunning men, and mistake knavery for wisdom. <lb/>
            The error of such ought to be eradicated ; and every notion <lb/>
            ought to be reduced to this hope, that men may attain the <lb/>
            ends they propose, by virtuous designs and just actions, and <lb/>
            not by dishonesty and wickedness.</p>
          <p>The things then that pertain to the preservation of human <lb/>
            life are partly inanimate, such as gold, silver, the fruits of the <lb/>
            earth, and the like ; and partly animal, which have their <lb/>
            peculiar instincts and affections. Now of these some are <lb/>
            void of, and some are endowed with, reason. The animals <lb/>
            void of reason are horses, oxen, with other brute creatures, <lb/>
            and bees, who by their labours contribute somewhat to the <lb/>
            service and existence of mankind. As to the animals endowed <lb/>
            with reason, they are of two kinds, one the gods, the other <lb/>
            men. Piety and sanctity will render the gods propitious ; <lb/>
            and next to the gods mankind are most useful to men. <lb/>
            (The same division holds as to things that are hurtful and <lb/>
            prejudicial. But as we are not to suppose the gods to be <lb/>
            injurious to mankind, excluding them, man appears to be <lb/>
            most hurtful to man.) For even the very inanimate things <lb/>
            I have mentioned, are generally procured through man's <lb/>
            labour ; nor should we have had them but by his art and <lb/>
            industry, nor can we apply them but by his management. <lb/>
            For there could neither be the preservation of health, navi- <lb/>
            gation, nor the gathering and preserving the corn and other <lb/>
            fruits, without the industry of mankind. And certainly <pb n="81"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP V.]</note><lb/>
            there could have been no exportation of things in which we <lb/>
            abound, and importation of those which we want, had not <lb/>
            mankind applied themselves to those employments. In like <lb/>
            manner, neither could stones be hewn for our use, nor iron, <lb/>
            nor brass, nor gold, nor silver, be dug from the earth, but by <lb/>
            the toil and art of man.</p>
          <p>IV. As to buildings, by which either the violence of the <lb/>
            cold is repelled, or the inconveniences of the heat mitigated, <lb/>
            how could they have originally been given to the human <lb/>
            race, or afterwards repaired when ruined by tempests, earth- <lb/>
            quakes, or time, bad not community of life taught us to <lb/>
            seek the aid of man against such influences ? Moreover, <lb/>
            from whence but from the labour of man could we have bad <lb/>
            aqueducts, the cuts of rivers, the irrigation of the land, <lb/>
            dams opposed to streams, and artificial harbours ? From <lb/>
            those and a great many other instances, it is plain that we <lb/>
            could by no manner of means have, without the hand and <lb/>
            industry of man, reaped the benefits and advantages arising <lb/>
            from such things as are inanimate. In short, what advantage <lb/>
            and convenience could have been realized from the brute <lb/>
            creation, had not men assisted ? Men, undoubtedly, <lb/>
            were the first who discovered what useful result we <lb/>
            might realize from every animal ; nor could we even at <lb/>
            this time either feed, tame, preserve, or derive from them <lb/>
            advantages suited to the occasion, without the help of man. <lb/>
            And it is by the same that such as are hurtful are destroyed, <lb/>
            and such as may be useful are taken. Why should I enume- <lb/>
            rate the variety of arts without which life could by no means <lb/>
            be sustained ? For did not so many arts minister to us, what <lb/>
            could succour the sick, or constitute the pleasure of the <lb/>
            healthy, or supply food and clothing ?</p>
          <p>Polished by those arts, the life of man is so different from <lb/>
            the mode of life and habits of brutes. Cities, too, neither <lb/>
            could have been built nor peopled but by the associa- <lb/>
            tion of men : hence were established laws and customs, the <lb/>
            equitable definition of rights, and the regulated order of life. <lb/>
            Then followed gentleness of disposition and love of morality ; <lb/>
            and the result was that life was more protected, and that by <lb/>
            giving and receiving, and by the exchange of resources and <lb/>
            articles of wealth, we wanted for nothing.</p>
          <p>V. We are more prolix than is necessary on this head <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            For to whom is not that self-evident for which Panaetius <lb/>
            employs a great many words, that no man, whether he be a <lb/>
            commander of an army, or a leader in the state, has ever been <lb/>
            able to perform great and salutary achievements without the <lb/>
            zealous co-operation of men ? As instances of this, he mentions <lb/>
            Themistocles, Pericles, Cyrus, Alexander, and Agesilaus, who, <lb/>
            he says, without the aid of men never could have achieved <lb/>
            such great exploits. Thus in a matter that is undoubted <lb/>
            he brings evidences that are unnecessary. But as the assem- <lb/>
            blage or agreement of men amongst themselves is productive <lb/>
            of the greatest benefits, so is there no plague so direful that <lb/>
            it may not arise to man from man. We have a treatise <lb/>
            of Dicæarchus,* an eminent and eloquent Peripatetic, con- <lb/>
            cerning the destruction of mankind ; and after collecting <lb/>
            together all the different causes, such as those of inundations, <lb/>
            pestilence, devastation, and those sudden attacks of swarms <lb/>
            of creatures, by which he tells us some tribes of men have been <lb/>
            destroyed ; he then calculates how many more men have been <lb/>
            destroyed by men, that is by wars and seditions, than by <lb/>
            every other species of calamity.</p>
          <p>As this point therefore admits of no doubt, that man can <lb/>
            do the greatest good and the greatest injury to man, I <lb/>
            lay it down as the peculiar property of virtue, that it recon- <lb/>
            ciles the affections of mankind, and employs them for her <lb/>
            own purposes. So that all the application and management <lb/>
            of inanimate things, and of brutes for the use of mankind, <lb/>
            is effected by the industrial arts. But the quick and ready <lb/>
            zeal of mankind for advancing and enlarging our conditions, <lb/>
            is excited through the wisdom and virtue of the best of <lb/>
            mankind.</p>
          <p>For virtue in general consists of three properties. First, <lb/>
            in discerning in every subject what is true and genuine ; <lb/>
            what is consistent in every one ; what will be the con- <lb/>
            sequence of such or such a thing ; how one thing arises from <lb/>
            another, and what is the cause of each. The next <lb/>
            property of virtue is to calm those violent disorders of the <lb/>
            mind which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθη</foreign>, and to render obedient to <lb/>
            reason those appetites which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̒ϱμαι</foreign>. The third <lb/>
            property is to treat with moderation and prudence those with <note type="footnote"> * Dicæarchus, born in Sicily, and a disciple of Aristotle. </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP VI.]</note> <lb/>
            whom we are joined in society, that by their means we may <lb/>
            have the complete and full enjoyment of all that nature <lb/>
            stands in need of; and likewise by them repel every thing <lb/>
            adverse that may befall us, and avenge ourselves of those who <lb/>
            have endeavoured to injure is, by inflicting on them as much <lb/>
            punishment as equity and humanity permit.</p>
          <p>VI. I shall soon treat of the means to acquire this art of <lb/>
            winning and retaining the affections of mankind, but first a <lb/>
            few things must be premised. Who is insensible what great <lb/>
            influence fortune has in both ways, either upon our prosperity <lb/>
            or adversity ?* When we sail with her favouring breeze, we <lb/>
            are carried to the most -desirable landing places : when she <lb/>
            opposes us, we are reduced to distress. Some, however, of <lb/>
            the accidents of fortune herself are more unfrequent; for <note type="footnote"> * " All cannot be happy at once ; for because the glory of one state <lb/>
            depends upon the ruin of another, there is a revolution and vicissitude of <lb/>
            their greatness, which must obey the spring of that wheel not proved by <lb/>
            intelligencies, but by the hand of God, whereby all estates rise to their <lb/>
            zenith and vertical points, according to their predestinated periods. For <lb/>
            the lives not only of men but of commonweals, and the whole world, run <lb/>
            not upon an helix that still enlargeth, but on a circle, where arising to their <lb/>
            meridian, they decline in obscurity, and fall under the horizon again. </note><note type="footnote"> " These must not therefore be named the effects of fortune, but in a <lb/>
            relative way, and as we term the works of nature. It was the ignorance of <lb/>
            man's reason that begat this very name, and by a careless term miscalled <lb/>
            the providence of God ; for there is no liberty for causes to operate in a <lb/>
            loose and straggling way, nor any effect whatsoever but bath its warrant from <lb/>
            some universal or superior cause. 'Tis not a ridiculous devotion to say a <lb/>
            prayer before a game at tables ; for even in sortileges and matters of <lb/>
            greatest uncertainty, there is a settled and pre-ordered course of effects. It <lb/>
            is we that are blind, not fortune ; because our eye is too dim to discover the <lb/>
            mystery of her effects, we foolishly paint her blind, and hoodwink the provi- <lb/>
            dence of the Almighty. I cannot justify that contemptible proverb, that <lb/>
            fools only are fortunate ; or that insolent paradox, that a wise man is out <lb/>
            of the reach of fortune ; much less those opprobrious epithets of poets, <lb/>
            whore, bawd, and strumpet. 'Tis I confess the common fate of men of <lb/>
            singular gifts of mind to be destitute of those of fortune ; which doth not <lb/>
            any way deject the spirit of wiser judgments, who thoroughly understand <lb/>
            the justice of this proceeding, and being enriched with higher donatives, <lb/>
            cast a more careless eye on these vulgar parts of felicity. It is a most <lb/>
            unjust ambition to desire to engross the mercies of the Almighty, nor to be <lb/>
            content with the goods of mind without a possession of those of body or <lb/>
            fortune : and is an error worse than heresy to adore these complemental and <lb/>
            circumstantial pieces of felicity, and undervalue those perfections and <lb/>
            essential points of happiness wherein we resemble our Maker.”-Sir Thomas <lb/>
            Browne's " Religio Medici," cap. 17, 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            instance, in the first place storms, tempests, shipwrecks, <lb/>
            ruins, or burnings, which spring from inanimate things ; in <lb/>
            the next place, causes blows, bites, or attacks of brutes. <lb/>
            Those accidents I say happen more seldom.</p>
          <p>But of the destruction of armies, we have just now seen <lb/>
            three different instances,* and often we see more ; the de- <lb/>
            struetion of generals, as was lately the case of a great and <lb/>
            an eminent personage ;† together with unpopularity, whence <lb/>
            frequently arises the expulsion, the fall, or the flight of the <lb/>
            worthiest citizens ; and on the other hand, prosperous events, <lb/>
            honours, commands and victories; though all those are <lb/>
            influenced by chance, yet they could not be brought about on <lb/>
            either side without the concurring assistance and inclinations <lb/>
            of mankind. This being premised, I am now to point out <lb/>
            the manner in which we may invite and direct the incli- <lb/>
            nations of mankind, so as to serve our interests ; and should <lb/>
            what I say on this head appear too long, let it be compared <lb/>
            with the importance of the subject, and then, perhaps, it may <lb/>
            even seem too short.</p>
          <p>Whatever, therefore, people perform for any man, either to <lb/>
            raise or to dignify him, is done either through kindness, when <lb/>
            they have a motive of affection for him ; or to do him honour <lb/>
            in admiration of his virtue, and when they think him worthy <lb/>
            of the most exalted fortune; or when they place confidence <lb/>
            in him, and think that they are doing the best for their own <lb/>
            interests ; or when they are afraid of his power ; or when <lb/>
            they hope somewhat from him; as when princes, or those <lb/>
            who court the people, propose certain largesses; or, lastly, <lb/>
            when they are engaged by money and bribery ; a motive that <lb/>
            of all other is the vilest and most sordid, both with regard to <lb/>
            those who are influenced by it, and those who are com- <lb/>
            pelled to resort to it.</p>
          <p>For it is a bad state of things, when that is attempted by <lb/>
            money which ought to be effected by virtue; but as this re- <lb/>
            source is sometimes necessary, I will show in what manner <lb/>
            it is to be employed, after I have treated of some things that <lb/>
            are more connected with virtue. Now, mankind submit to the <lb/>
            command and power of another for several reasons. For they <note type="footnote"> Meaning the defeat of Pompey at Pharsalia, of his sons at Munda in <lb/>
            Spain, and of Scipio in Africa ; all by Julius Cæsar. <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP VII.]</note><lb/>
            are induced by benevolence or by the greatness of his bene- <lb/>
            fits ; or by his transcendent worth, or by the hopes that their <lb/>
            submission will turn to their own account, or from the fear <lb/>
            of their being forced to submit, or from the hopes of reward, <lb/>
            or the power of promises, or, lastly (which is often the case <lb/>
            in our government), they are hired by a bribe.</p>
          <p>VII. Now, of all things there is none more adapted for <lb/>
            supporting and retaining our influence than to be loved, nor <lb/>
            more prejudicial than to be feared. Ennius says very truly, <lb/>
            “ People hate the man they fear, and to each the destruction <lb/>
            of him whom he hates is expedient." It has been lately <lb/>
            shown,* if it was not well known before, that no power can <lb/>
            resist the hatred of the many. Nor indeed is the destruction <lb/>
            of that tyrant, who by arms forced his country to endure him, <lb/>
            and whom it obeys still more after his death, the only proof <lb/>
            how mighty to destroy is the hatred of mankind, but the <lb/>
            similar deaths of other tyrants; few of whom have escaped a. <lb/>
            similar fate. For fear is but a bad guardian to permanency, <lb/>
            whereas affection is faithful even to perpetuity.</p>
          <p>But the truth is, cruelty must be employed by those who <lb/>
            keep others in subjection by force ; as by a master to his <lb/>
            slaves, if they cannot otherwise be managed. But of all mad- <lb/>
            men, they are the maddest who in a free state so conduct them- <lb/>
            selves as to be feared. However, under the power of a private <lb/>
            man the laws may be depressed and the spirit of liberty in- <lb/>
            timidated, yet they occasionally emerge, either by the silent <lb/>
            determinations of the people, or by their secret suffrages with <lb/>
            relation to posts of honour. For the inflictions of liberty, <lb/>
            when it has been suspended, are more severe than if it had <lb/>
            been retained. We ought therefore to follow this most ob- <lb/>
            vious principle, that dread should be removed and affection <lb/>
            reconciled, which has the greatest influence not only on our <lb/>
            security, but also on our interest and power; and thus we <lb/>
            shall most easily attain to the object of our wishes, both in <lb/>
            private and political affairs. For it is a necessary conse- <lb/>
            quence, that men fear those very persons by whom they wish <lb/>
            to be feared.</p>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            With what pangs of dread was he tortured, when, being <lb/>
            fearful even of his barber's razor, he singed his beard with <lb/>
            burning coals ? In what a state of mind may it not be sup- <lb/>
            posed Alexander the Pherean to have lived ? Who (as we <lb/>
            read), though he loved his wife Thebe excessively, yet when- <lb/>
            ever he came into her bed-chamber from the banquet, ordered <lb/>
            a barbarian, nay, one who we are told was scarred with the <lb/>
            Thracian brands, to go before him with a drawn sword ; and <lb/>
            sent certain of his attendants to search the chests of the <lb/>
            ladies, and discover whether they had daggers concealed <lb/>
            among their clothes. Miserable man! to think a barbarous <lb/>
            and branded slave could be more faithful to him than his <lb/>
            wife ! Yet was he not deceived, for he was murdered by her <lb/>
            on the suspicion of an illicit connexion; nor, indeed, can any <lb/>
            power be so great as that, under the pressure of fear, it can <lb/>
            be lasting.</p>
          <p>Phalaris is another instance, whose cruelty was notorious <lb/>
            above all other tyrants; who did not, like the Alexander I <lb/>
            have just mentioned, perish by secret treachery, nor by the <lb/>
            hands of a few conspirators, like our own late tyrant, but <lb/>
            was attacked by the collective body of the Agrigentines. <lb/>
            Nay, did not the Macedonians abandon Demetrius, and with <lb/>
            one consent betake themselves to Pyrrhus ? And did not the <lb/>
            allies of the Lacedæmonians abandon them almost univer- <lb/>
            sally when they governed tyrannically, and show themselves <lb/>
            unconcerned spectators of the disaster at Leuctra ?</p>
          <p>VIII. Upon such a subject I more willingly record foreign <lb/>
            than domestic examples; as long, however, as the empire of <lb/>
            the Roman people was supported by beneficence, and not in- <lb/>
            justice, their wars were undertaken either to defend their <lb/>
            allies or to protect their empire, the issues of their wars were <lb/>
            either merciful or unavoidable; and the senate was the <lb/>
            harbour and the refuge of kings, people, and nations.</p>
          <p>Moreover, our magistrates and generals sought to derive <lb/>
            their highest glory from this single fact, that they had upon <lb/>
            the principles of equity and honour defended their provinces <lb/>
            and their allies. This therefore might more justly be desig- <lb/>
            nated the patronage than the empire of the world ; for some <lb/>
            time we have been gradually declining from this practice <lb/>
            and these principles; but after the victory of Sylla, we <lb/>
            entirely lost them: for when such cruelties were exer- <pb n="87"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP VIII.]</note><lb/>
            cised upon our fellow citizens, we ceased to think anything <lb/>
            unjust towards our allies. In his case, therefore, a disgrace- <lb/>
            ful conquest crowned a glorious cause; * for lie had the pre- <lb/>
            sumption to declare, when the goods of worthy men, of men <lb/>
            of fortune, and, to say the least, of citizens, were selling at <lb/>
            public auction, that he was disposing of his own booty. He <lb/>
            was followed by a man who, with an impious cause and a <lb/>
            still more detestable victory, did not indeed sell the effects of <lb/>
            private citizens, but involved in one state of calamity whole <lb/>
            provinces and countries. Thus foreign nations being ha- <lb/>
            rassed and ruined, we saw Marseilles,† the type of our <lb/>
            perished constitution, carried in triumph, without whose aid <lb/>
            our generals who returned from Transalpine wars had never <lb/>
            triumphed. Were not this the most flagrant indignity the <lb/>
            sun ever beheld, I might recount a great many other atro- <lb/>
            cities against our allies. Deservedly, therefore, were we <lb/>
            punished ; for had we not suffered the crimes of many to <lb/>
            pass unpunished, never could so much licentiousness have <lb/>
            been concentrated in one, the inheritance of whose private <lb/>
            estate descended indeed to but a few, but that of his ambition <lb/>
            devolved upon many profligates.</p>
          <p>Nor, indeed, will there ever be wanting a source and motive <lb/>
            for civil war, while men of abandoned principles call to mind <lb/>
            that bloody sale, and hope for it again. For when the speari <lb/>
            under which it was made was set up for his kinsman the dic- <lb/>
            tator, by Publius Sylla, the same Sylla, thirty-six years after, <lb/>
            was present at a still more detestable sale; while another <lb/>
            who in that dictatorship was only a clerk, in the latter one <lb/>
            was city-quæstor. From all which we ought to learn, that <lb/>
            while such rewards are presented, there never can be an end <lb/>
            of our civil wars. Thus the walls of our city alone are <lb/>
            standing, and even these awaiting the crimes that must de- <note type="footnote"> * Sylla's pretence for taking up arms was to defend the nobility against <lb/>

            stroy them; but already we have utterly lost our constitution; <lb/>
            and, to return to ray subject, we have incurred all those <lb/>
            miseries, because we chose rather to he feared than to en- <lb/>
            dear ourselves and be beloved. If this was the case with <lb/>
            the people of Rome when exercising their dominion unjustly, <lb/>
            what consequences must private persons expect ? Now, as it <lb/>
            is plain that the force of kindness is so strong, and that of <lb/>
            fear so weak, it remains for me to descant upon the means by <lb/>
            which we may most readily attain to that endearment which <lb/>
            we desire, consistently with fidelity and honour.</p>
          <p>But of this we do not all stand in the same need; for it <lb/>
            depends on the different purpose of life which each individual <lb/>
            pursues, whether it be necessary for him to be beloved by the <lb/>
            many, or whether the affections of the few be sufficient. One <lb/>
            thing, however, may be considered as certain ; that it is <lb/>
            chiefly and indispensably necessary, that we should possess <lb/>
            the faithful affections of those friends who love our persons <lb/>
            and admire our qualities; for this is the only particular in <lb/>
            which men of the highest and middle stations of life agree, <lb/>
            and is attainable by both in much the same manner. All, <lb/>
            perhaps, are not equally desirous of honours and of the good- <lb/>
            will of their fellow citizens ; but the man who is possessed of <lb/>
            them is greatly assisted by them in acquiring other advan- <lb/>
            tages as well as those of friendship.</p>
          <p>IX. But I have in another book, which is entitled Lælius, <lb/>
            treated of friendship. I am now to speak of fame, though I <lb/>
            have already published two books upon that subject :* let me, <lb/>
            however, touch upon it, as it greatly conduces to the right <lb/>
            management of the more important affairs. The highest and <lb/>
            the most perfect popularity lies in three requisites ; first, <lb/>
            when the public loves us; secondly, when it regards us as <lb/>
            trustworthy; thirdly, when with a certain degree of admi- <lb/>
            ration, it judges us to be worthy of preferment. Now, if I <lb/>
            am to speak plainly and briefly, almost the same means by <lb/>
            which those advantages are acquired from private persons, <lb/>
            procure them from the public. But there is another passage <lb/>
            by which we may, as it were, glide into the affections of the <lb/>
            many.</p>
          <p>And first, let me touch upon those three maxims by which <lb/>
            (as 1 have already said) goodwill may be acquired. This <note type="footnote"> * This treatise is now lost. </note> <pb n="89"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP X.]</note><lb/>
            is chiefly acquired by benefits : but next to that, good-will is <lb/>
            won by a beneficent disposition, though we may be desti- <lb/>
            tute of means. Thirdly, the affections of the public are <lb/>
            wonderfully excited by the mere reputation of generosity, <lb/>
            beneficence, justice, honour, and of all those virtues that re- <lb/>
            gard politeness and affability of manners. For the very <lb/>
            honestum and the graceful, as it is called, because it charms <lb/>
            us by its own properties, and touches the hearts of all by its <lb/>
            qualities and its beauties, is chiefly resplendent through the <lb/>
            medium of those virtues I have mentioned. We are there- <lb/>
            fore drawn, as it were, by nature herself to the love of those <lb/>
            in whom we think those virtues reside. Now these are the <lb/>
            strongest causes of affection, though some there may be which <lb/>
            are less material.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of public confidence or trust may be <lb/>
            effected by two considerations; by being supposed to be pos- <lb/>
            sessed of wisdom and of justice combined. For we have <lb/>
            confidence in those who we think understand more than our- <lb/>
            selves, and who we believe see further into the future, and, <lb/>
            when business is actually in hand and matters come to trial, <lb/>
            know how to pursue the wisest measures and act in the most <lb/>
            expedient manner, as the exigency may require; all mankind <lb/>
            agreeing that this is real and useful wisdom. Such confidence, <lb/>
            also, is placed in honest and honourable men, that is, in good <lb/>
            men, as to exclude all suspicion of fraud or injury. We <lb/>
            therefore think we act safely and properly in entrusting <lb/>
            them with our persons, our fortunes, and our families.</p>
          <p>But of the two virtues, honesty and wisdom, the former <lb/>
            is the most powerful in winning the confidence of mankind. <lb/>
            For honesty without wisdom, has influence sufficient of it- <lb/>
            self ; but wisdom without honesty is of no effect in inspiring <lb/>
            confidence; because, when we have no opinion of a man's <lb/>
            probity, the greater his craft and cunning, the more hated <lb/>
            and suspected he becomes; honesty, therefore, joined to un- <lb/>
            derstanding, will have unbounded power in acquiring con- <lb/>
            fidence ; honesty without understanding can do a great deal; <lb/>
            but understanding without honesty can do nothing.</p>
          <p>X. But lest any one should wonder why, as all philosophers <lb/>
            are agreed in one maxim, which I myself have often main- <lb/>
            tained, that the man who possesses one of the virtues is in <lb/>
            possession of them all, I here make a distinction which im- <pb n="90"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            plies that a man may be just but not at the same time pru- <lb/>
            dent, there is one kind of accuracy which in disputation <lb/>
            refines even upon truth, and another kind, when our whole <lb/>
            discourse is accommodated to the understanding of the public. <lb/>
            Therefore I here make use of the common terms of discourse, <lb/>
            by calling some men brave, some good, others prudent. For <lb/>
            when we treat of popular opinions, we should make use of <lb/>
            popular terms, and Panætius did the same. But to return to <lb/>
            our subject.</p>
          <p>Of the three requisites of perfect popularity, the third I <lb/>
            mentioned was, " when the public with a certain degree of <lb/>
            admiration judges us to be worthy of preferment." Now <lb/>
            everything that men observe to be great and above their <lb/>
            comprehension they commonly admire ; and with regard to <lb/>
            individuals, those in whom they can see any unexpected <lb/>
            excellences. They therefore behold with reverence and <lb/>
            extol with the greatest praise, those men in whom they <lb/>
            think they can perceive some distinguished or singular vir- <lb/>
            tues ; whereas they despise those whom they think to possess <lb/>
            no virtue, spirit, or manliness. Now, men do not despise all <lb/>
            those of whom they think ill. For they by no means con- <lb/>
            temn rogues, slanderers, cheats, and those who are prepared <lb/>
            to commit an injury, though they have a bad opinion of <lb/>
            them. Therefore, as I have already said, those are despised <lb/>
            who can neither serve themselves nor any one else, who have <lb/>
            no assiduity, no industry, and no concern about them; but <lb/>
            those men are the objects of admiration who are thought to <lb/>
            surpass others in virtue, and to be free as well from every <lb/>
            disgrace, as especially from those vices which others cannot <lb/>
            easily resist. For pleasures, those most charming mistresses, <lb/>
            turn aside the greater number of minds from virtue, and most <lb/>
            men, when the fires of affliction are applied to them, are un- <lb/>
            measurably terrified. Life and death, poverty and riches, <lb/>
            make the deepest impressions upon all men. But as to those <lb/>
            who, with a great and elevated mind, look down on these in- <lb/>
            differently;-men whom a lofty and noble object, when it is <lb/>
            presented to them, draws and absorbs to itself;-in such <lb/>
            cases, who does not admire the splendour and the beauty of <lb/>
            virtue ?</p>
          <p>XI. This sublimity of soul, therefore, produces the highest <lb/>
            admiration ; and above all justice, from which single virtue <pb n="91"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note><lb/>
            men are called good, appears to the multitude as something <lb/>
            marvellous. And with good reason ; for no man can be just <lb/>
            if he is afraid of death, pain, exile, or poverty, or prefers <lb/>
            their contraries to justice. Men especially admire him who <lb/>
            is incorruptible by money, and they consider every man in <lb/>
            whom that quality is seen as ore purified by the fire. <lb/>
            Justice, therefore, comprehends all the three means of acquir- <lb/>
            in- glory which have been laid down. The love of the pub- <lb/>
            lie, on account of its being a general benefit; its confidence, <lb/>
            for the same reason ; and its admiration, because it neglects <lb/>
            and despises those objects to which most men are hurried on <lb/>
            inflamed with avidity.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, however, every scheme and purpose of life <lb/>
            requires the assistance of men, especially that one should <lb/>
            have some with whom he can familiarly unbosom himself, <lb/>
            which is hard for one to do, unless he maintain the appear- <lb/>
            ance of a good man. For this reason, were a man to live <lb/>
            ever so lonely or ever so retired in the country, a reputation <lb/>
            for justice would be indispensable to him, and so much the <lb/>
            more, as those who do not possess it will be esteemed dis- <lb/>
            honest, and thus surrounded by no protection will be ex- <lb/>
            posed to numerous injuries.</p>
          <p>And with those likewise who buy or sell, who hire or let <lb/>
            out, or who are engaged in the transaction of business, justice <lb/>
            is necessary to the carrying of their pursuits, for its influ- <lb/>
            ence is so great, that without some grains of it, even they <lb/>
            who live by malpractices and villiany could not subsist. <lb/>
            For amongst those who thieve in company, if any one of <lb/>
            them cheat or rob another he is turned out of the gang; and <lb/>
            the captain of the band himself, unless he should distribute <lb/>
            the spoils impartially, would either be murdered or deserted <lb/>
            by his fellows. Indeed, robbers are even said to have their <lb/>
            laws, which they obey and observe. By this impartiality in <lb/>
            sharing the booty, Bardyllis, the Illyrian robber, mentioned <lb/>
            by Theopompus, obtained great wealth; and Viriathus, the <lb/>
            Lusitanian, much greater; to whom our armies and our gene- <lb/>
            rals yielded ; but whom the prætor Caius Lælius, surnamed <lb/>
            the wise, crushed and subdued, and so repressed his ferocity <lb/>
            that he left an easy victory to his successors. If, therefore, <lb/>
            the influence of justice is so forcible as to strengthen and <lb/>
            enlarge the power of robbers, how great must we suppose <pb n="92"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            it to be amidst the laws and administration of a well-consti- <lb/>
            tuted government ?</p>
          <p>XII. It appears to me, that not only among the Medes, <lb/>
            as we are told by Herodotus, but by our own ancestors, men <lb/>
            of the best principles were constituted kings, for the benefit <lb/>
            of their just government. For when the helpless people <lb/>
            were oppressed by those who had greater power, they betook <lb/>
            themselves to some one man who was distinguished by his <lb/>
            virtue, who not only protected the weakest from oppression, <lb/>
            but by setting up an equitable system of government, united <lb/>
            highest and lowest in equal rights. The cause of the institu- <lb/>
            tion of laws was the same as that of kings; for equality of <lb/>
            rights has ever been the object of desire; nor otherwise can <lb/>
            there be any rights at all.</p>
          <p>When mankind could enjoy it under one just and good <lb/>
            man, they were satisfied with that; but when that was not <lb/>
            the case, laws were invented, which perpetually spoke to all <lb/>
            men with one and the same voice. It is therefore undeniable <lb/>
            that the men whose reputation among the people was the <lb/>
            highest for their justice, were commonly chosen to bear rule. <lb/>
            But when the same were likewise regarded as wise men, <lb/>
            there was nothing the people did not think themselves capa- <lb/>
            ble of attaining under such authority. Justice, therefore, <lb/>
            is by all manner of means to be reverenced and practised ; <lb/>
            both for its own sake (for otherwise it would not be justice), <lb/>
            and for the enlargement of our own dignity and popularity. <lb/>
            But as there is a system not only for the acquisition of <lb/>
            money but also for its investment, so that it may supply ever- <lb/>
            recurring expenses, not only the needful but the liberal; so <lb/>
            popularity must be both acquired and maintained by system.</p>
          <p>It was finely said by Socrates that the shortest and most <lb/>
            direct road to popularity, is "for a man to be the same that <lb/>
            he wishes to be taken for." People are egregiously mistaken <lb/>
            if they think they ever can attain to permanent popularity <lb/>
            by hypocrisy, by mere outside appearances, and by disguising <lb/>
            not only their language but their looks. True popularity <lb/>
            takes deep root and spreads itself wide; but the false falls <lb/>
            away like blossoms; for nothing that is false can be lasting. <lb/>
            I could bring many instances of both kinds; but for the sake <lb/>
            of liberty, I will confine myself to one family. While there <lb/>

          <p>XIII. Let the man therefore who aspires after true popula- <lb/>
            rity, perform the duties of justice. What these are has been laid <lb/>
            down in the former book. But although we may most easily <lb/>
            seem to be just what we are (though in this of itself there is <lb/>
            very great importance), yet some precepts require to be given <lb/>
            as to how we may be such men as we desire to be considered. <lb/>
            For if any one from early youth has the elements of celebrity <lb/>
            and reputation, either derived from his father (which I <lb/>
            fancy, my dear Cicero, has happened to you), or by some <lb/>
            other cause or accident; the eyes of all mankind are turned <lb/>
            towards him, and they make it their business to inquire what <lb/>
            he does and how he lives; and, as if he were set up in the <lb/>
            strongest point of light, no word or deed of his can be <lb/>
            private.</p>
          <p>Now those whose early life, through their mean and ob- <lb/>
            scure rank, is passed unnoticed by the public, when they <lb/>
            come to be young men, ought to contemplate important pur- <lb/>
            poses. and pursue them by the most direct means, which they <lb/>
            will do with a firmer resolution, because not only is no envy <lb/>
            felt. but favour rather is shown towards that period of life. <lb/>
            The chief recommendation then of a young man to fame is <lb/>
            derived from military exploits.* Of this we have many ex- <note type="footnote"> * “ Perhaps it will afford to some men new ideas, if we inquire what the <lb/>
            real nature of the military virtues is. They receive more of applause than <lb/>
            virtues of any other kind. How does this happen ? We must seek a solu- <lb/>
            tion in the seeming paradox, that their pretensions to the characters of vir- <lb/>
            tues are few and small. They receive much applause because they merit <lb/>
            little. They could not subsist without it; and if men resolve, to practise <lb/>
            war, and consequently to require the conduct which gives success to war, <lb/>
            they must decorate that conduct with glittering fictions, and extol the mili- <lb/>
            tary virtues, though they be neither good nor great. Of every species of <lb/>
            real excellence it is the general characteristic that it is not anxious for ap- <lb/>
            plause. The more elevated the virtue the less the desire, and the less is <lb/>
            the public voice a motive to action. What should we say of that man's <lb/>
            benevolence who would not relieve a neighbour in distress, unless the dona- <lb/>
            tion would be praised in a newspaper? What should we say of that man's <lb/>
            piety, who prayed only when he was ‘seen of men?' But the military <lb/>
            virtues live upon applause; it is their vital element and their food, their <lb/>
            great pervading motive and reward. Are there, then, amongst the respec- <lb/>
            tive virtues such discordances of character, such total contrariety of nature </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            amples amongst our ancestors, for they were almost always <lb/>
            waging wars. Your youth however has fallen upon the time <lb/>
            cf a war, in which one party incurred too much guilt and to- <lb/>
            other too little success. But when in that war Pompey gave <lb/>
            you the command of a squadron, you gained the praise of <lb/>
            that great man and of his army by your horsemanship, your <lb/>
            darting the javelin, and your tolerance of all military labour. <lb/>
            But this honour of yours ceased with the constitution of our <lb/>
            country. My discourse however has not been undertaken <lb/>
            with reference to you singly, but to the general subject. <lb/>
            Let me therefore proceed to what remains.</p>
          <p>As in other matters the powers of the mind are far more <lb/>
            important than those of the body, so the objects we pursue <lb/>
            by intelligence and reason are more important than those we <lb/>
            effeet by bodily strength. The most early recommendation, <lb/>
            therefore, is modesty, obedience to parents, and affection for <lb/>
            relations. Young men are likewise most easily and best <lb/>
            known, who attach themselves to wise and illustrious men <lb/>
            who benefit their country by their counsels. Their frequent- <lb/>
            ing such company gives mankind a notion of their one day <lb/>
            resembling those whom they choose for imitation.</p>
          <p>The frequenting of the house of Publius Marcus com- <lb/>
            mended the early life of Publius Rutilius to a reputation for <lb/>
            integrity and knowledge of the law. Lueius Crassus indeed, <lb/>
            when very young, was indebted to no extrinsic source, but by <lb/>
            himself acquired the highest honour from that noble and <lb/>
            celebrated prosecution he undertook; and at an age when <lb/>
            even those who exercise themselves are highly applauded (as <lb/>
            we are told in the case of Demosthenes), Crassus, I say, at <lb/>
            that age showed that he could already do that most success- <lb/>
            fully in the forum, which at that time he would have gained <lb/>
            praise had he attempted at home.</p>
          <p>XIV. But as there are two methods of speaking; the one <lb/>
            proper for conversation, the other for debate; there can be <lb/>
            no doubt but the disputative style of speech is of the greatest <lb/>
            efficacy with regard to fame ; for that is what we properly <lb/>
            term eloquence. Yet it is difficult to describe how great <note type="footnote"> and essence ? No, no. But how then do you account for the fact, that <lb/>
            whilst all other great virtues arc independent of public praise and stand <lb/>
            aloof from it, the military virtues can scarcely exist without it ?”—Dy- <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP XIV.]</note><lb/>
            power, affability and politeness in conversation have to win <lb/>
            the affections of mankind. There are extant letters from <lb/>
            Philip, from Antipater, and from Anti-onus, three of the wisest <lb/>
            men we meet with in history, to their sons Alexander, Cas- <lb/>
            sander, and Philip, recommending to them to draw the minds <lb/>
            of the people to kindly sentiments by a generous style of <lb/>
            discourse, and to engage their soldiers by a winning address. <lb/>
            But the speech which is pronounced in debate before a mul- <lb/>
            titude often carries away a whole assembly. For great is <lb/>
            their admiration of an eloquent and sensible speaker, that <lb/>
            when they hear him, they are convinced he has both greater <lb/>
            abilities and more wisdom than the rest of mankind. But <lb/>
            should this eloquence have in it dignity combined with mo- <lb/>
            desty, nothing can be more admirable, especially should <lb/>
            those properties meet in a young man.</p>
          <p>Various are the causes that require the practice of elo- <lb/>
            quence ; and many young men in our state have attained <lb/>
            distinction before the judges and in the senate ; but there is <lb/>
            the greatest admiration for judicial harangues, the nature of <lb/>
            which is two-fold, for it consists of accusation and defence. <lb/>
            Of those, though the latter is preferable in point of honour ; <lb/>
            yet the other has often been approved. I have spoken a <lb/>
            little before of Crassus ; Marcus Antonius when a youth did <lb/>
            the same. An accusation also displayed the eloquence of <lb/>
            Publius Sulpicius, when he brought to trial Caius Norba- <lb/>
            nus, a seditious and worthless citizen.</p>
          <p>But in truth, we ought not to do this frequently nor ever, <lb/>
            except for the sake of our country, as in the cases I have <lb/>
            mentioned; or for the purpose of revenge,* as the two Lu- <note type="footnote"> * The direct approbation and inculcation of revenge on the part of an- <lb/>
            cient moralists constitutes the point at which the authorities on Christian <lb/>
            ethics most widely diverge from them. Paley lays down the following <lb/>
            principles on this subject. " It is highly probable, from the light of nature, <lb/>
            that a passion, which seeks its gratification immediately and expressly in <lb/>
            giving pain, is disagreeable to the benevolent will and counsels of the <lb/>
            Creator. Other passions and pleasures may, and often do, produce pain <lb/>
            to some one: but then pain is not, as it is here, the object of <lb/>
            the passion, and the direct cause of the pleasure. This probability <lb/>
            is converted into certainty, if we give credit to the authority which <lb/>
            dictated the several passages of the Christian scriptures that condemn <lb/>
            revenge, or, what is the same thing, which enjoin forgiveness. The for- <lb/>
            giveness of an enemy is not inconsistent with the proceedings against him <lb/>
            as a public offender; and that the discipline established in religious or civil </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            culli did; or by way of patronage, as I did on behalf of the <lb/>
            Sicilians, or as Julius did in the case of Albucius on behalf <lb/>
            of the Sardians. The diligence of Lucius Fufius was dis- <lb/>
            played in the impeachment of Manius Aquillius. For once <lb/>
            therefore it may be done; or at all events not often. But if a <lb/>
            man should be under a necessity of doing it oftener, let him <lb/>
            perform it as a duty to his country, for it is by no means <lb/>
            blameworthy to carry on repeated prosecutions against her <lb/>
            enemies. But still let moderation be observed. For it seems <note type="footnote">societies, for the restraint or punishment of criminals, ought to be upholden. <lb/>
            If the magistrate be not tied down with these prohibitions from the execu- <lb/>
            tion of his office, neither is the prosecutor; for the office of the prosecutor <lb/>
            is as necessary as that of the magistrate. Nor, by parity of reason, are <lb/>
            private persons withholden from the correction of vice, when it is in their <lb/>
            power to exercise it, provided they be assured that it is the guilt which <lb/>
            provokes them, and not the injury ; and that their motives are pure from <lb/>
            all mixture and every particle of that spirit which delights and triumphs in <lb/>
            the humiliation of an adversary.”—Paley’s Moral and Political Phi- <lb/>
            losophy, book iii. ch. viii. </note><note type="footnote"> SirThomas Browne, in his " Christian Morals,” has the following striking <lb/>
            reflections on revenge. “ Too many there be to whom a dead enemy <lb/>
            smells well, and who find musk and amber in revenge. The ferity of such <lb/>
            minds holds no rule in retaliations, requiring too often a head for a tooth, <lb/>
            and the supreme revenge for trespasses which a night's rest should oblite- <lb/>
            rate But patient meekness takes injuries like pills, not chewing but swal- <lb/>
            lowing them down, laconically suffering, and silently passing them over; <lb/>
            while angered pride makes a noise, like Homerican Mars, at every scratch <lb/>
            of offences. Since women do most delight in revenge, it may seem but <lb/>
            feminine manhood to be vindictive. If thou must needs have thy revenge <lb/>
            of thine enemy, with a soft tongue break his bones, heap coals of fire on his <lb/>
            head, forgive him and enjoy it. To forgive our enemies is a charming way <lb/>
            of revenge, and a short Caesarian conquest, overcoming without a blow ; <lb/>
            laying our enemies at our feet, under sorrow, shame, and repentance; <lb/>
            leaving our foes our friends, and solicitously inclined to grateful retalia- <lb/>
            tions. Thus to return upon our adversaries is a healing way of revenge ; <lb/>
            and to do good for evil a soft and melting ultion, a method taught from <lb/>
            heaven to keep all smooth on earth. Common forcible ways make not an <lb/>
            end of evil, but leave hatred and malice behind them. An enemy thus <lb/>
            reconciled is little to be trusted, as wanting the foundation of love and cha- <lb/>
            rity, and but for a time restrained by disadvantage or inability. If thou <lb/>
            hast not mercy for others, yet be not cruel unto thyself. To ruminate upon <lb/>
            evils, to make critical notes upon injuries, and be too acute in their appre- <lb/>
            hensions, is to add unto our own tortures, to feather the arrows of our <lb/>
            enemies, to lash ourselves with the scorpions of our foes, and to resolve to <lb/>
            sleep no more. For injuries long dreamt on take away at last all rest, and <lb/>
            he sleeps but like Regulus who busieth his head about them.”—Christian <lb/>

            to be the part of a cruel man, or rather scar rely of man at <lb/>
            all, to endanger the lives of many. It is both dangerous to <lb/>
            your person, and disgraceful to your character, so to act as <lb/>
            to get the name of an accuser, as happened in the case of <lb/>
            Marcus Brutus, a man sprung from a most noble family, and <lb/>
            son to the eminent adept in civil law.</p>
          <p>Moreover, this precept of duty also must be carefully ob- <lb/>
            served, that you never arraign an innocent man on trial for <lb/>
            his life, for this can by no means be done without heinous <lb/>
            guilt. For what can be so unnatural as to prostitute to the <lb/>
            persecution and the ruin of the good, that eloquence which <lb/>
            nature has given us for the safety and preservation of man- <lb/>
            kind. Although, however, this is to be avoided, yet we are <lb/>
            not to consider it a religious duty never to defend a guilty <lb/>
            party, so that he be not abominable and impious. The people <lb/>
            desire this, custom tolerates it, and humanity suffers it. The <lb/>
            duty of a judge in all trials is to follow truth; that of a <lb/>
            pleader, sometimes to maintain the plausible though it may <lb/>
            not be the truth,* which I should not, especially as I am now <lb/>
            treating of philosophy, venture to write, were it not likewise <lb/>
            the opinion of a man of the greatest weight among the Stoics. <note type="footnote"> * Two of the most eminent moralists of modern times have thus re- <lb/>
            corded their respective judgments on this point of casuistry. Archdeacon <lb/>
            Paley says, " There are falsehoods which are not lies; that is, which are <lb/>
            not criminal: as, where no one is deceived; which is the case in parables, <lb/>
            fables, novels, jests, tales to create mirth, ludicrous embellishments of a <lb/>
            story, where the declared design of the speaker is not to inform, but to <lb/>
            divert; compliments in the subscription of a letter, a servant's denying his <lb/>
            master, a prisoner's pleading not guilty, an advocate asserting the justice, or <lb/>
            his belief of the justice, of his client's cause. In such instances, no con- <lb/>
            fidence is destroyed, because none was reposed; no promise to speak the <lb/>
            truth is violated, because none was given, or understood to be given."- <lb/>
            Paley's Moral and Political Philosophy, book iii. chapter xv. </note><note type="footnote"> In refutation of this view, Dymond suggests the following considerations: <lb/>
            —" This defence is not very credible, even if it were valid; it defends men <lb/>
            from the imputation of falsehood, because their falsehoods are so habitual <lb/>
            that no one gives them credit! </note><note type="footnote"> " But the defence is not valid. Of this the reader may satisfy himself by <lb/>
            considering why, if no one ever believes what advocates say, they continue <lb/>
            to speak. They would not, year after year, persist in uttering untruths in <lb/>
            our courts, without attaining an object, and knowing that they would not <lb/>
            attain it. If no one ever in fact believed them, they would cease to asse- <lb/>
            verate. They do not love falsehood for its own sake, and utter it gratu- <lb/>
            itously and for nothing. The custom itself, therefore, disproves the argu- <lb/>
            ment that is brought to defend it. Whenever that defence becomes valid </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            Panætius. But it is by defences that glory and favour also <lb/>
            are acquired in the greatest degree ; and so much the greater, <lb/>
            if at any time it happens that we come to the help of one who <lb/>
            seems to be circumvented and oppressed by the influence of <lb/>
            some powerful man, as I myself have done both in other cases <lb/>
            frequently, and when a youth in defence of Sextus Roscitis <lb/>
            Amerinus, against the influence of Lucius Sylla, then in <lb/>
            power, which speech, as you know, is extant.</p>
          <p>XV. But having explained the duties of young men, <lb/>
            which avail to the attainment of glory, we have next to <lb/>
            speak about beneficence and liberality, the nature of which is <lb/>
            twofold; for a kindness is done to those who need it, by <lb/>
            giving either our labour or our money. The latter is easier, <lb/>
            especially to a wealthy person ; but the former is the more <lb/>
            noble and splendid, and more worthy of a brave and illus- <note type="footnote"> whenever it is really true that ' no confidence is reposed'in advocates, <lb/>
            they will cease to use falsehood, for it will have lost its motive. But the <lb/>
            real practice is to mingle falsehood and truth together, and so to involve <lb/>
            the one with the other that the jury cannot easily separate them. The jury <lb/>
            know that some of the pleader's statements are true, and these they believe. <lb/>
            Now he makes other statements with the same deliberate emphasis; and <lb/>
            how shall the jury know whether these are false or true ? How shall they <lb/>
            discover the point at which they shall begin to ' repose no confidence ?' <lb/>
            Knowing that a part is true, they cannot always know that another part is <lb/>
            not true. That it is the pleader's design to persuade them of the truth of <lb/>
            all he affirms, is manifest. Suppose an advocate, when he rose should say, <lb/>
            'Gentlemen, I am now going to speak the truth;' and after narrating the <lb/>
            facts of the case, should say,' Gentlemen, I am now going to address you <lb/>
            with fictions.' Why should not an advocate do this ? Because then no <lb/>
            confidence would be reposed, which is the same thing as to say that he <lb/>
            pursues his present plan because some confidence is reposed, and this de- <lb/>
            cides the question. The decision should not be con ealed—that the advo- <lb/>
            cate who employs untruths in his pleadings, does really and most strictly <lb/>
            lie. </note><note type="footnote"> "And even if no one ever did believe an advocate, his false declarations <lb/>
            would still be lies, because he always ' professes to speak the truth.' This <lb/>
            indeed is true upon the Archdeacon's own showing; for he says, ' Whoever <lb/>
            seriously addresses his discourse to another, tacitly promises to speak the <lb/>
            truth.' The case is very different from others which he proposes as pa- <lb/>
            rallel—' parables, fables, jests.' In these, the speaker does not profess to <lb/>
            state facts. But the pleader does profess to state facts. He intends and <lb/>
            endeavours to mislead. His untruths, therefore, are lies to him, whether they <lb/>
            are believed or not; just as, in vulgar life, a man whose falsehoods are so <lb/>
            notorious that no one gives him credit, is not the less a liar than if he were <lb/>

            trious man ; for although there exists in both a liberal incli- <lb/>
            nation to oblige, yet the one is a draft on our purse, the other <lb/>
            on our virtue, and bounty which is given out of our income <lb/>
            exhausts the very source of the munificence. Thus benignity <lb/>
            is done away by benignity, and the greater the number you <lb/>
            have exercised it upon, so much the less able are you to <lb/>
            exercise it oil many. But they who will be beneficent <lb/>
            and liberal of their labour, that is, of their virtue and <lb/>
            industry, in the first place, will have by how much greater <lb/>
            the number of persons they shall have served, so much <lb/>
            the more coadjutors in their beneficence. And in the <lb/>
            next place, by the habit of beneficence they will be the <lb/>
            better prepared, and, as it were, better exercised to de- <lb/>
            serve well of many. Philip, in a certain letter, admirably <lb/>
            reproves his son Alexander, because he sought to gain the <lb/>
            goodwill of the Macedonians by largesses—"Pest!" he <lb/>
            says, "what consideration led you into the hope that you <lb/>
            could imagine that they whom you have corrupted with <lb/>
            money would be faithful to you ? Are you aiming at this, <lb/>
            that the Macedonians should expect you will be, not their <lb/>
            king, but their agent and purveyor." He says well, "agent <lb/>
            and purveyor," because that is undignified in a king; and <lb/>
            still better, because he designates a largess a corrupt bribe; <lb/>
            for he who receives becomes the worse for it, and more ready <lb/>
            always to expect the same. He enjoined this on his son, but <lb/>
            we may consider it a precept for all men. Wherefore, this <lb/>
            indeed is not doubtful, that such beneficence as consists of <lb/>
            labour and industry is both the more honourable, and ex- <lb/>
            tends more widely, and can serve a greater number. Some- <lb/>
            times, however, we must make presents-nor is this sort of <lb/>
            beneficence to be altogether repudiated; and oftentimes we <lb/>
            ought to communicate from our fortune to suitable persons, <lb/>
            who are in need, but carefully and moderately. For many <lb/>
            persons have squandered their patrimonies by unadvised ge- <lb/>
            nerosity. Now, what is more absurd than to bring it to pass <lb/>
            that you can no longer do that which you would willingly do ? <lb/>
            And moreover, rapine follows profuseness. For when, by <lb/>
            giving, they begin to be in want, they are forced to lay their <lb/>
            hands upon other men's property. Thus, when, for the sako <lb/>
            of procuring goodwill, they mean to be beneficent, they ac- <lb/>
            quire not so much the affection of those to whom they give <note type="footnote"> 11 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note> <lb/>
            as the hatred of those from whom they take. Wherefore, <lb/>
            our purse should neither be so closed up that our generosity <lb/>
            cannot open it, nor so unfastened that it lies open to all-a <lb/>
            bound should be set, and it should bear reference to our <lb/>
            means. We ought altogether to remember that saying which, <lb/>
            from being very often used by our countrymen, has come <lb/>
            into the usage of a proverb, that bounty has no bottom. <lb/>
            For what bounds can there be, when both they who have <lb/>
            been accustomed to receive, and other persons, are desiring <lb/>
            the same thing ?</p>
          <p>XVI. There are two kinds of men who give largely, of <lb/>
            whom one kind are prodigal, the other liberal. The prodigal <lb/>
            are those who with entertainments, and distributions of meat <lb/>
            to the populace, and gladiatorial exhibitions, and the appa- <lb/>
            ratus of the stage and the chase, lavish their money upon <lb/>
            those things of which they will leave behind either a tran- <lb/>
            sient memory, or none at all. But the liberal are they who, <lb/>
            with their fortunes, either redeem those captured by robbers, <lb/>
            or take up the debts of their friends, or aid in the establish- <lb/>
            ing of their daughters, or assist them either in seeking or <lb/>
            increasing their fortunes. Therefore, I am astonished what <lb/>
            could come into the mind of Theophrastus, in that book <lb/>
            which he wrote about riches, in which he has said many <lb/>
            things well, but this most absurdly. For lie is lavish in <lb/>
            praise of magnificence, and of the furnishing of popular <lb/>
            exhibitions, and he considers the means of supplying such <lb/>
            expenses to be the grand advantage of wealth. Now, to <lb/>
            me that enjoyment of liberality of which I have given a few <lb/>
            examples, seems much greater and surer. With how much <lb/>
            more weight and truth does Aristotle censure such of us as feel <lb/>
            no astonishment at that profusion of wealth which is wasted <lb/>
            in courting the people; "if," says he, "they who are besieged <lb/>
            by an enemy should be compelled to purchase a pint of water <lb/>
            at a mina,* this, on first hearing, would seem to us incredible, <lb/>
            and all would be astonished, but when we reflect upon it, we <lb/>
            excuse it for its necessity; while in these pieces of immense <lb/>
            extravagance and unbounded expense, we do not feel greatly <lb/>
            astonished." And he censures us, especially, "because we are <lb/>
            neither relieving necessity, nor is our dignity increased, and <note type="footnote"> * About three pounds sterling. </note> <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note> <lb/>
            the very delight of the multitude is for a brief and little <lb/>
            space, and only felt by the most giddy, even in whom, how- <lb/>
            ever, at the same time with the satiety, the memory of the <lb/>
            pleasure likewise dies." He sums up well, too, that " these <lb/>
            things are agreeable to boys, and silly women, and slaves, <lb/>
            and freemen very like slaves; but that by a man of sense, <lb/>
            and one who ponders with sound judgment on such exhibi- <lb/>
            tions, they can in no way be approved." Though I know <lb/>
            that in our state it is established by ancient usage, and even <lb/>
            now in the good times, that the splendour of ædileships* is <lb/>
            expected even from the most excellent men. Therefore, both <lb/>
            Publius Crassus, wealthy as well in name as in fortune, dis- <lb/>
            charged the office of ædile with the most magnificent enter- <lb/>
            tainment; and, a little while after, Lucius Crassus, with <lb/>
            Quintus Mucius, the most moderate of all men. served a most <lb/>
            magnificent ædileship; and next, Caius Claudius, son of <lb/>
            Appius; many subsequently-the Luculli, Hortensius, Sila- <lb/>
            nus; but Publius Lentulus, in my consulship, surpasssd all <lb/>
            his predecessors. Scaurus imitated him; but the shows of <lb/>
            my friend Pompey, in his second consulship, were the most <lb/>
            magnificent of all-concerning all of whom, you see what is <lb/>
            my opinion.</p>
          <p>XVII. Nevertheless, the suspicion of avarice should be <lb/>
            avoided. The omitting of the ædileship caused the rejection <lb/>
            of Mamercus, a very wealthy man, from the consulship. <lb/>
            Wherefore it must be done if it be required by the people, <lb/>
            and good men, if not desiring, at least approve it, but in <lb/>
            proportion to our means, as I myself did it; and again, if <lb/>
            some object of greater magnitude and utility is acquired by <lb/>
            popular largess, as lately the dinners in the streets, under <lb/>
            pretext of a vow of a tenth,† brought great honour to <lb/>
            Orestes. Nor was ever any fault found with Marcus Seius, <lb/>
            because in the scarcity he gave corn to the people at an as <lb/>
            the bushel. For he delivered himself from a great and in- <lb/>
            veterate dislike by an expense neither disgraceful, since he <lb/>
            was ædile at the time, nor excessive. But it lately brought <lb/>
            the greatest honour to our friend Milo, that with gladiators, <note type="footnote"> * The Ædiles, among other duties, had the care of the public shows, <lb/>
            to which they were expected to contribute largely out of their private <lb/>
            fortunes. </note><note type="footnote"> t To one of the gods. </note> <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note> <lb/>
            hired for the sake of the republic, which was held together <lb/>
            by my safety, he repressed all the attempts and madness of <lb/>
            Publius Clodius. The justification, therefore, of profuse <lb/>
            bounty is that it is either necessary or useful. Moreover, in <lb/>
            these very cases the rule of mediocrity is the best. Lucius <lb/>
            Philippus, indeed, the son of Quintus, a man in the highest <lb/>
            degree illustrious for his great genius, used to boast that <lb/>
            without any expense lie had attained all the highest honours <lb/>
            that could be obtained. Cotta said the same, and Curio. I <lb/>
            myself, too, might in some degree boast on this subject; for <lb/>
            considering the amplitude of the honours which I attained <lb/>
            with all the votes in my own* year, too-a thing that <lb/>
            happened to none of those whom I have just named-the <lb/>
            expense of my ædileship was certainly trifling.</p>
          <p>These expenses also are more justifiable on walls, docks, <lb/>
            ports, aqueducts, and all things which pertain to the service <lb/>
            of the state, though what is given as it were into our hands <lb/>
            is more agreeable at present, yet these things are more <lb/>
            acceptable to posterity. Theatres, porticos, new temples, I <lb/>
            censure with more reserve for Pompey's sake, but the most <lb/>
            learned men disapprove of them, as also this very Panætius, <lb/>
            whom in these books I have closely followed, though not <lb/>
            translated ; and Demetrius Phalereus, who censures Pericles, <lb/>
            the greatest man of Greece, because he lavished so much <lb/>
            money on that glorious vestibule ;† but all this subject I <lb/>
            have carefully discussed in those books which I have written <lb/>
            upon Government. The whole plan, then, of such largesses <lb/>
            is vicious in its nature, but necessitated by particular occa- <lb/>
            sions, and even then ought to be accommodated to our means, <lb/>
            and regulated by moderation.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But in that second kind of munificence which <lb/>
            proceeds from liberality, we ought in different cases to be <lb/>
            affected in different manners. The case is different of him <lb/>
            who is oppressed with misfortune, and of him who seeks to <lb/>
            better his fortune without being in any adversity. Our <note type="footnote"> * To be Quæstor, Ædile, Prætor, and Consul, the respective ages were <lb/>

            benignity will require to be more prompt toward the dis- <lb/>
            tressed, unless perhaps they merit their distress ; yet from <lb/>
            those who desire to be assisted, not that they may be relieved <lb/>
            from affliction, but that they may ascend to a higher degree, <lb/>
            we ought by no means to be altogether restricted, but to <lb/>
            apply judgment and discretion in selecting proper persons. <lb/>
            For Ennius observes well-</p>
          <p>" Benefactions ill bestowed, I deem malefactions."</p>
          <p>But in that which is bestowed upon a worthy and grateful <lb/>
            man there is profit, as well from himself as also from others ; <lb/>
            for liberality, when free from rashness, is most agreeable, <lb/>
            and many applaud it the more earnestly on this account, <lb/>
            because the bounty of every very exalted man is the common <lb/>
            refuge of all. We should do our endeavour, then, that we <lb/>
            may serve as many as possible with those benefits, the recol- <lb/>
            lection of which may be handed down to their children and <lb/>
            posterity, that it may not be in their power to be ungrateful; <lb/>
            for all men detest one forgetful of a benefit, and they consider <lb/>
            that an injury is done even to themselves by discouraging <lb/>
            liberality, and that he who does so is the common enemy of <lb/>
            the poor. And besides, that benignity is useful to the state <lb/>
            by which captives are redeemed from slavery, and the poor <lb/>
            are enriched. That it was indeed the common custom that <lb/>
            this should be done by our order,* we see copiously described <lb/>
            in the speech of Crassus. This kind of bounty, therefore, <lb/>
            I prefer far before the munificent exhibition of shows. That <lb/>
            is the part of dignified and great men—this of flatterers of <lb/>
            the populace, tickling, as it were, with pleasures the levity <lb/>
            of the multitude. It will, moreover, be expedient that a <lb/>
            man, as he should be munificent in giving, so that he should <lb/>
            not be harsh in exacting ; and in every contract, in selling, <lb/>
            buying, hiring, letting, to be just and good-natured to the <lb/>
            vicinage and surrounding occupiers ; conceding to many much <lb/>
            that is his own right, but shunning disputes as far as he <lb/>
            can conveniently, and I know not but even a little more than <lb/>
            he can conveniently. For, to abate at times a little from our <lb/>
            rights, is not only generous, but sometimes profitable also. <lb/>
            But of our property, which it is truly disgraceful to allow to <note type="footnote"> * The senatorial. </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            get dilapidated, care must be taken, but in such a way that <lb/>
            the suspicion of shabbiness and avarice be avoided. For to <lb/>
            be able to practise liberality, not stripping ourselves of our <lb/>
            patrimony, is indeed the greatest enjoyment of wealth. <lb/>
            Hospitality also has been justly recommended by Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus. For, as it appears to me, indeed, it is very <lb/>
            decorous that the houses of illustrious men should be open <lb/>
            for illustrious guests. And that also brings credit to the <lb/>
            state, that foreigners in our city should not fail of ex- <lb/>
            periencing this species of liberality. It is, moreover, exceed- <lb/>
            ingly useful to those who wish to be very powerful in an <lb/>
            honourable way, to get the command over wealth and interest <lb/>
            among foreign nations, through their guests. Theophrastus, <lb/>
            indeed, writes that Cymon at Athens practised hospitality <lb/>
            even towards his brethren of the Lacian tribe ; for that he <lb/>
            so directed and commanded his stewards, that all things <lb/>
            should be supplied to any of them that should turn aside <lb/>
            into his villa.</p>
          <p>XIX. Now, those benefits which are bestowed out of our <lb/>
            labour, not our money, are conferred as well upon the entire <lb/>
            commonwealth, as upon individual citizens. For to give <lb/>
            legal opinions, to assist with counsel, and to serve as many <lb/>
            as we can with this kind of knowledge, tends very much to <lb/>
            increase both our means and our interest. This, therefore, <lb/>
            as well as many things about our ancestors, was noble, that <lb/>
            the knowledge and interpretation of our most excellently <lb/>
            constituted civil law was always in the highest repute ; <lb/>
            which, indeed, before this confusion of the present times, the <lb/>
            nobles retained in their own possession. Now, like honours <lb/>
            -like all the degrees of rank, so the splendour of this <lb/>
            science is extinguished ; and this is the more unmeet on this <lb/>
            account, because it has happened at the very time when he* <lb/>
            was in existence who far surpassed in this science all who <lb/>
            went before, to whom also he was equal in dignity. This <lb/>
            labour, then, is acceptable to many, and suited to bind men <lb/>
            to us by benefits. But the talent of speaking, being very <lb/>
            closely connected with this art, is more dignified, more agree- <lb/>
            able, and capable of higher ornament. For what is more <lb/>
            excellent than eloquence, in the admiration of the hearers, or <note type="footnote"> * Servius Sulpicius Rufus. </note> <pb n="105"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XX.]</note><lb/>
            in the expectation of those in need of its assistance, or in the <lb/>
            gratitude of those who have been defended ? To this, then, <lb/>
            the first rank of civil dignity was given by our ancestors. <lb/>
            Of an eloquent man, then, and one willingly labouring, and, <lb/>
            what is according to the customs of our forefathers, defending <lb/>
            the causes of many, both ungrudgingly and gratuitously, the <lb/>
            benefits and patronage are very extensive.</p>
          <p>The subject would admonish me that at this opportunity I <lb/>
            should likewise deplore the discontinuance, not to call it the <lb/>
            extinction, of eloquence, did I not apprehend lest I should <lb/>
            appear to be making some complaint upon my own account. <lb/>
            However, we see what orators are extinct, in how few there <lb/>
            is promise, in how much fewer ability, in how many pre- <lb/>
            sumption. But though all, or even many, cannot be skilful <lb/>
            in the law, or eloquent, yet it is in a man's power, by his <lb/>
            exertions, to be of service to many, by asking benefits for <lb/>
            them, commending them to judges and magistrates, watch- <lb/>
            ing the interests of others, entreating in their behalf those <lb/>
            very advocates who either are consulted or defend causes. <lb/>
            They who act thus, gain a great deal of influence, and their <lb/>
            industry diffuses itself most extensively. Furthermore, they <lb/>
            need not be admonished of this (for it is obvious), that they <lb/>
            take care to offend none while they are wishing to serve <lb/>
            others. For oftentime they offend either those whom it is <lb/>
            their duty or whom it is their interest not to offend. If un- <lb/>
            wittingly they do it, it is a fault of negligence; if knowingly, <lb/>
            of rashness. It is necessary, too, that you make an apology, in <lb/>
            whatever way you can, to those whom you unwillingly of- <lb/>
            fend-how that which you did was of necessity, and that <lb/>
            you could not do otherwise; and it will be necessary to make <lb/>
            compensation to them for what injury you have inflicted by <lb/>
            other efforts and good offices.</p>
          <p>XX. But since, in rendering services to men, it is usual <lb/>
            to look either to their character or their fortune, it is easy, <lb/>
            indeed, to say, and so people commonly say, that in bestow- <lb/>
            ing benefits they only attend to a man's character, not to his- <lb/>
            fortune. It is a fine speech ; but pray is there any one who <lb/>
            in rendering a service would not prefer the thanks of a rich <lb/>
            and powerful man before the cause of a poor, though most <lb/>
            worthy man ? For in general our goodwill is more inclined <lb/>
            towards him from whom it appears that remuneration would <pb n="106"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            be easier and quicker. But we ought to consider more at- <lb/>
            tentively what the nature of things is: for of course that <lb/>
            poor man, if he be a good man, though he cannot requite a <lb/>
            kindness, can at least have a sense of it. Now it was well <lb/>
            said, whoever said it, " that he who hath the loan of money, <lb/>
            hath not repaid; and he who hath repaid, bath not the <lb/>
            loan. But both he who hath requited kindness hath a <lb/>
            sense of it, and he who hath a sense of it* bath requited." <lb/>
            But they who consider themselves wealthy, honoured, pros- <lb/>
            perous, do not wish even to be bound by a benefit. More- <lb/>
            over, they consider that they have conferred a favour when <lb/>
            they themselves have received one, however great; and they <lb/>
            also suspect that something is either sought or expected from <lb/>
            them: but they think it like death to them that they should <lb/>
            need patronage, and be called clients. But, on the other <lb/>
            hand, that poor man, because in whatever is done for him <lb/>
            he thinks it is himself and not his fortune that is regarded, <lb/>
            is anxious that he may be seen to be grateful, not only by <lb/>
            him who has merited it from him, but also by those from <lb/>
            whom he expects the like (for he needs it from many). Nor <lb/>
            indeed does he magnify with words any favour of his own <lb/>
            doing, if by chance he confers one, but rather undervalues <lb/>
            it. And this is to be considered, that if you defend a man <lb/>
            of power and fortune, the gratitude is confined to himself <lb/>
            alone, or perhaps to his children ; but if you defend a poor <lb/>
            but worthy and modest man, all poor men who are not <lb/>
            worthless (which is a vast multitude among the people) see <lb/>
            a protection offered to themselves: wherefore, I think it <lb/>
            better that a favour should be bestowed upon worthy per- <lb/>
            sons than upon persons of fortune. We should by all means <lb/>
            endeavour to satisfy every description of people. But if the <lb/>
            matter shall come to competition, undoubtedly Themistocles <lb/>
            is to be received as an authority, who, when he was consulted <lb/>
            whether a man should marry his daughter to a worthy poor <lb/>
            man, or to a rich man of less approved character, said, " I <lb/>
            certainly would rather she married a man without money, <lb/>
            than money without a man." <note type="footnote"> * " ———— A grateful mind, <lb/>

          <p>But our morals are corrupted and depraved by the admi- <lb/>
            ration of other men's wealth. Though what concern is its <lb/>
            amount to any of us ? Perhaps it is of use to him who owns <lb/>
            it; not always even that: but admit that it is of use to him- <lb/>
            self, to be sure he is able to spend more, but how is he an <lb/>
            honester man ? But if he shall be a good man besides, let his <lb/>
            riches not prevent him from getting our assistance-only let <lb/>
            them not help him to get it, and let the entire consideration <lb/>
            be, not how wealthy, but how worthy each individual is. <lb/>
            But the last precept about benefits and bestowing our labour <lb/>
            is, do nothing hostile to equity-nothing in defence of in- <lb/>
            justice. For the foundation of lasting commendation and <lb/>
            fame is justice-without which nothing can be laudable.</p>
          <p>XXI. But since I have finished speaking about that kind <lb/>
            of benefits which have regard to a single citizen, we have <lb/>
            next to discourse about those which relate to all the citizens <lb/>
            together, and which relate to the public good. But of those <lb/>
            very ones, some are of that kind which relate to all the <lb/>
            citizens collectively; some are such that they reach to all <lb/>
            individually, which are likewise the more agreeable. The <lb/>
            effort is by all means to be made, if possible, to consult for <lb/>
            both, and notwithstanding, to consult also for them indivi- <lb/>
            dually ; but in such a manner that this may either serve, or <lb/>
            at least should not oppose, the public interest. The grant of <lb/>
            corn proposed by Caius Gracchus was large, and therefore <lb/>
            would have exhausted the treasury; that of Marcus Octavius <lb/>
            was moderate, both able to be borne by the state, and neces- <lb/>
            sary for the commons; therefore it was salutary both for the <lb/>
            citizens and for the nation. But it is in the first place to be <lb/>
            considered by him who shall have the administration of the <lb/>
            government, that each may retain his own, and that no dimi- <lb/>
            nution of the property of individuals be made by public <lb/>
            authority. For Philip acted destructively, in his tribuneship, <lb/>
            when he proposed the agrarian law, which, however, he readily <lb/>
            suffered to be thrown out, and in that respect showed him- <lb/>
            self to be exceedingly moderate; but when in courting popu- <lb/>
            larity he drove at many things, he uttered this besides im- <lb/>
            properly, "that there were not in the state two thousand <lb/>
            persons who possessed property." A dangerous speech, and <lb/>
            aiming at a levelling of property-than which mischief, what <lb/>
            can be greater? For commonwealths and states were estab- <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note> <lb/>
            lislied principally for this cause, that men should hold what <lb/>
            was their own. For although mankind were congregated <lb/>
            together by the guidance of nature, yet it-was with the hops <lb/>
            of preserving their own property that they sought the pro- <lb/>
            tection of cities.</p>
          <p>Care should also be taken, lest, as often was the case among <lb/>
            our ancestors, on account of the poverty of the treasury and <lb/>
            the continuity of wars, it may be necessary to impose taxation, <lb/>
            and it will be needful to provide long before that this should <lb/>
            not happen. But if any necessity for such a burden should <lb/>
            befal any state (for I would rather speak thus than speak <lb/>
            ominously of our own ;* nor am I discoursing about our own <lb/>
            state only, but about all states in general), care should be <lb/>
            taken that all may understand that they must submit to the <lb/>
            necessity if they wish to be safe.</p>
          <p>And also all who govern a nation are bound to provide <lb/>
            that there be abundance of those things which are neces- <lb/>
            saries—of which, what kind of a provision it is usual and <lb/>
            proper to make, it is not necessary to canvass. For all that <lb/>
            is obvious: and the topic only requires to be touched on. <lb/>
            But the principal matter in every administration of public <lb/>
            business and employments is, that even the least suspicion of <lb/>
            avarice be repelled. "Would to heaven," said Caius Pontius, <lb/>
            the Samnite, "that fortune had reserved me for those times, <lb/>
            and I had been born then, whenever the Romans may have <lb/>
            begun to accept bribes—I would not have suffered them to <lb/>
            reign much longer." He surely would have had to wait many <lb/>
            generations. For it is of late that this evil has invaded this <lb/>
            state; therefore I am well pleased that Pontius was in ex- <lb/>
            istence rather at that time, since so much power resided in <lb/>
            him. It is not yet a hundred and ten years since a law <lb/>
            about bribery was passed by Lucius Piso, when previously <lb/>
            there had been no such law. But afterwards there were so <lb/>
            many laws, and each successive one more severe, so many <lb/>
            persons arraigned, so many condemned, such an Italian war <lb/>
            excited through fear of condemnations, such a rifling and <lb/>
            robbing of our allies, those laws and judgments were sus- <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch relates that Æmilius Paullus, on the conquest of Persius, <lb/>
            king of Macedonia, brought home such an [immense treasure, that the Ro- <lb/>
            man people were entirely relieved from taxes until the consulship of Hir- <lb/>
            tius and Pansa, which was the year after Cicero wrote this work. </note> <pb n="109"/>

            pended, that we are strong through the weakness of others, <lb/>
            not through our own valour.</p>
          <p>XXII. Panætius applauds Africanus because he was self- <lb/>
            denying. Why not applaud him ? But in him there were <lb/>
            other and greater characteristics ; the praise of self-restraint <lb/>
            was not the praise of the man only, but also of those times. <lb/>
            Paullus having possessed himself of the whole treasure of <lb/>
            the Macedonians, which was most immense, brought so much <lb/>
            wealth into the treasury, that the spoils of one commander <lb/>
            put an end to taxes ; but to his own house he brought nothing <lb/>
            except the eternal memory of his name. Africanus, imitating <lb/>
            his father, was nothing the richer for having overthrown <lb/>
            Carthage. What! Lucius Memmius, who was his colleague <lb/>
            in the censorship, was he the wealthier for having utterly <lb/>
            destroyed the wealthiest of cities ? He preferred orna- <lb/>
            menting Italy rather than his own house-although by <lb/>
            the adornment of Italy, his own house itself seems to me <lb/>
            more adorned. No vice, then, is more foul (that my dis- <lb/>
            course may return to the point from whence it digressed) <lb/>
            than avarice, especially in great men and such as administer <lb/>
            the republic. For to make a gain of the republic is not only <lb/>
            base, but wicked also and abominable. Therefore, that which <lb/>
            the Pythian Apollo delivered by his oracle, " that Sparta <lb/>
            would perish by nothing but its avarice," he seems to have <lb/>
            predicted not about the Lacedæmonians alone, but about all <lb/>
            opulent nations. Moreover, they who preside over the state <lb/>
            can by no way more readily conciliate the goodwill of the <lb/>
            multitude than by abstinence and self-restraint.</p>
          <p>But they who wish to be popular, and upon that account <lb/>
            either attempt the agrarian affair, that the owners may be <lb/>
            driven out of their possessions, or think that borrowed <lb/>
            money should be released to the debtors, sap the foundations <lb/>
            of the constitution ; namely, that concord, in the first place, <lb/>
            which cannot exist when money is exacted from some, and <lb/>
            forgiven to others ; and equity, in the next place, which is <lb/>
            entirely subverted, if each be not permitted to possess his <lb/>
            own. For, as I said before, this is the peculiar concern of a <lb/>
            state and city, that every person's custody of his own <lb/>
            property be free and undisturbed. And in this destructive <lb/>
            course to the state they do not obtain even that popu- <lb/>
            larity which they expect ; for lie whose property is taken is <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            hostile; he also to whom it is given disguises his willingnes." <lb/>
            to accept it, and especially in lent monies he conceals his joy <lb/>
            that he may not appear to have been insolvent; but he, on <lb/>
            the other hand, who receives the injury, both remembers and <lb/>
            proclaims his indignation; nor if they are more in number <lb/>
            to whom it is dishonestly given than those from whom it has <lb/>
            been unjustly taken, are they even for that cause more sue <lb/>
            cessful. For these matters are not determined by number, <lb/>
            but by weight. Now, what justice is it that lands which <lb/>
            have been pre-occupied for many years, or even ages, he who <lb/>
            was possessed of none should get, but he who was In posses- <lb/>
            sion should lose ?</p>
          <p>XXIII. And on account of this kind of injustice, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians expelled their Ephorus Lysander, and put <lb/>
            to death their king Agis—a thing which never before had <lb/>
            happened among them. And from that time such great <lb/>
            dissensions ensued, that tyrants arose, and the nobles were <lb/>
            exiled, and a constitution admirably established fell to pieces. <lb/>
            Nor did it fall alone, but also overthrew the rest of Greece <lb/>
            by the contagion of evil principles, which having sprung <lb/>
            from the Lacedæmonians, flowed far and wide. What! <lb/>
            was it not the agrarian contentions that destroyed our own <lb/>
            Gracehi sons of that most illustrious man Tiberius Grac- <lb/>
            chus, and grandsons of Africanus ? But, on the contrary, <lb/>
            Aratus, the Sicyonian, is justly commended, who, when his <lb/>
            native city had been held for fifty years by tyrants, having <lb/>
            set out from Argos to Sicyon, by a secret entrance got <lb/>
            possession of the city, and when on a sudden he had over- <lb/>
            thrown the tyrant Nicocles, he restored six hundred exiles, <lb/>
            who had been the wealthiest men of that state, and restored <lb/>
            freedom to the state by his coming. But when he perceived <lb/>
            a great difficulty about the goods and possessions, because he <lb/>
            considered it most unjust both that they whom he had <lb/>
            restored, of whose property others had been in possession, <lb/>
            should be in want, and he did not think it very fair that <lb/>
            possessions of fifty years should be disturbed, because that <lb/>
            after so long an interval many of those properties were got <lb/>
            possession of without injustice, by inheritance, many by <lb/>
            purchase, many by marriage portions ; he judged neither <lb/>
            that the properties ought to be taken from the latter, nor <lb/>
            that these to whom they had belonged should be without satis- <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXIV.]</note><lb/>
            faction. When, then, he had concluded that there was need <lb/>
            of money to arrange that matter, he said that he would go to <lb/>
            Alexandria, and ordered the matter to be undisturbed until <lb/>
            his return. He quickly came to his friend Ptolemy, who was <lb/>
            then reigning, the second after the building of Alexandria, <lb/>
            and when he bad explained to him that he was desirous to <lb/>
            liberate his country, and informed him of the case, this most <lb/>
            eminent man readily received consent from the opulent king <lb/>
            that he should be assisted with a large sum of money. When <lb/>
            he had brought this to Sicyon, he took to himself for his <lb/>
            council fifteen noblemen, with whom he took cognizance of <lb/>
            the cases, both of those who held other persons' possessions, <lb/>
            and of those who had lost their own ; and by valuing the <lb/>
            possessions. he so managed as to persuade some to prefer <lb/>
            receiving the money, and yielding up the possessions ; others <lb/>
            to think it more convenient that there should be paid down <lb/>
            to them what was the price, rather than they should resume <lb/>
            possession of their own. Thus it was brought about that all <lb/>
            departed without a complaint, and concord was established. <lb/>
            Admirable man, and worthy to have been born in our nation ! <lb/>
            Thus it is right to act with citizens, not (as we have now <lb/>
            seen twice)* to fix up a spear in the forum, and subject the <lb/>
            goods of the citizens to the voice of the auctioneer. But <lb/>
            that Greek thought, as became a wise and superior man, that <lb/>
            it was necessary to consult for all. And this is the highest 0 <lb/>
            reason and wisdom of a good citizen, not to make divisions <lb/>
            in the interests of the citizens, but to govern all by the same <lb/>
            equity. Should any dwell free of expense in another man's <lb/>
            house ? Why so ? Is it that when I shall have bought, <lb/>
            built, repaired, expended, you, without my will, should <lb/>
            enjoy what Is mine ? What else is this but to take from <lb/>
            some what is theirs ; to give to some what Is another man's ? <lb/>
            But what is the meaning of an abolition of debts, unless that <lb/>
            you should buy an estate with my money-that you should <lb/>
            have the estate, and I should not have my money ?</p>
          <p>XXIV. Wherefore, it ought to be provided that there <lb/>
            be not such an amount of debt as may injure the state—a <lb/>
            thing which may be guarded against in many ways ; not <lb/>
            that if there shall be such debt the rich should lose their <note type="footnote"> * Under Sylla, and under Cæsar. </note> <pb n="112"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note> <lb/>
            rights, and the debtors gain what is another's—for nothing <lb/>
            holds the state more firmly together than public credit, <lb/>
            which cannot at all exist unless the payment of money lent <lb/>
            shall be compulsory. It never was more violently agitated <lb/>
            than in my consulship, that debts should not be paid ; the <lb/>
            matter was tried in arms and camps, by every rank and <lb/>
            description of men, whom I resisted in such a manner, that <lb/>
            this mischief of such magnitude was removed from the state. <lb/>
            Never was debt either greater, or better and more easily <lb/>
            paid. For the hope of defrauding being frustrated, the <lb/>
            necessity of paying followed. But on the other hand, this <lb/>
            man, now our victor,* but who was vanquished then, has <lb/>
            accomplished the things which he had in view, when it was <lb/>
            now a matter of no importance to himself. So great was <lb/>
            the desire in him of doing wrong, that the mere wrong- <lb/>
            doing delighted him, although there was not a motive for it. <lb/>
            From this kind of liberality, then, to give to some, to take <lb/>
            from others, they will keep aloof who would preserve the <lb/>
            commonwealth, and will take particular care that each may <lb/>
            hold his own in equity of right and judgments ; and neither <lb/>
            that advantage be taken of the poorer class, on account of <lb/>
            their humbleness, nor that envy be prejudicial to the rich, <lb/>
            either in keeping or recovering their own. They will besides <lb/>
            increase the power of the state in whatever way they can, <lb/>
            either abroad or at home, in authority, territories, tributes. <lb/>
            These are the duties of great men. These were practised <lb/>
            among our ancestors ; they who persevere in those kinds of <lb/>
            duties, will, along with the highest advantage to the republic, <lb/>
            themselves obtain both great popularity and glory.</p>
          <p>Now, in these precepts about things profitable, Antipater <lb/>
            the Tyrian, a Stoic, who lately died at Athens, considers that <lb/>
            two things are passed over by Panætius-the care of health <lb/>
            and of property-which matters I fancy were passed over by <lb/>
            that very eminent philosopher because they were obvious ; <lb/>
            they certainly are useful. Now, health is supported by under- <lb/>
            standing one's own constitution, and by observing what things <lb/>
            are accustomed to do one good or injuryt ; and by temperance <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar, who was suspected of a share in Cataline's conspiracy, after- <lb/>

            in all food and manner of living, for the sake of preserving <lb/>
            the body; and by forbearance in pleasures ; and lastly, by <lb/>
            the skill of those to whose profession these things belong. <lb/>
            Wealth ought to be acquired by those means in which there <lb/>
            is no disgrace, but preserved by diligence and frugality, and <lb/>
            increased, too, by the same means. These matters Xenophon, <lb/>
            the Socratic philosopher, has discussed very completely in <lb/>
            that book which is entitled Œconomics, which I, when I was <lb/>
            about that age at which you are now, translated from the <lb/>
            Greek into Latin.</p>
          <p>XXV. But a comparison of profitable things, since <lb/>
            this was the fourth head, but passed over by Panætius, is <lb/>
            often necessary. For it is usual to compare the good estate <lb/>
            of the body with external advantages, and external with <lb/>
            those of the body, and those of the body among themselves, <lb/>
            and external with external. The good estate of the body is <lb/>
            compared with external advantages in this manner, that you <lb/>
            had rather be healthy than wealthy. External with those <lb/>
            of the body in this manner, to be wealthy rather than of the <lb/>
            greatest physical strength. Those of the body among them- <lb/>
            ,,-elves, thus, that good health should be preferred to pleasure, <lb/>
            and strength to speed. But the comparison of external <lb/>
            objects is thus, that glory should be preferred to wealth, a <lb/>
            city income to a country one. Of which kind of comparison <lb/>
            is that reply of Cato the elder, of whom, when inquiry was <lb/>
            made, what was the best policy in the management of one's <lb/>
            property, he answered, " Good grazing." " What was next ?" <lb/>
            ,; Tolerable grazing." "What third?" " Bad grazing." <lb/>
            "What fourth ?" "Tilling." And when he who had <lb/>
            interrogated him inquired, " What do you think of lending <lb/>
            at usury ?" Then Cato answered, " What do you think of <lb/>
            killing a man ?"* From which, and many other things, it <note type="footnote"> when he wrote the first paragraph of his thirtieth Essay on " Regimen of <lb/>

            that the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind after the <lb/>
            fall which was, 'in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum' not' in sudore <lb/>

            they do judaise ; that it is against nature for money to beget money, <lb/>
            and the like. I say this only, that usury is a ' concessum propter duritiem <lb/>
            cordis:' for since there must be borrowing and lending, and men are so hard <lb/>

          <p>I. PUBLIUS SCIPIO, my son Marcus, he who first was <lb/>
            surnamed Africanus, was accustomed, as Cato, who was <lb/>
            nearly of the same age as he, has written, to say " that he <lb/>
            was never less at leisure than when at leisure, nor less alone <lb/>
            than when be was alone." A truly noble saying, and worthy <lb/>
            of a great and wise man, which declares that both in his <lb/>
            leisure he was accustomed to reflect on business, and in <lb/>
            solitude to converse with himself; so that he never was idle, <lb/>
            and sometimes was not in need of the conversation of an- <lb/>
            other. Thus, leisure and solitude, two things which cause <lb/>
            languor to others, sharpened him. I could wish it were in <lb/>
            my power to say the same. But if I cannot quite attain to <lb/>
            any intimation of so great an excellence of disposition, I <lb/>
            come very near it, in will at least. For, being debarred by <lb/>
            impious arms and force from public affairs and forensic <lb/>
            business, I remain in retirement; and on that account <lb/>
            having left the city, wandering about the fields, I am often <lb/>
            alone. But neither is this leisure to be compared with the <lb/>
            leisure of Africanus, nor this solitude with that. For he, <lb/>
            reposing from the most honourable employments of the state, <lb/>
            sometimes took leisure to himself, and sometimes betook <lb/>
            himself from the concourse and haunts of men into his soli- <lb/>
            tude as into a haven: but my retirement is occasioned by <lb/>
            the want of business, not by the desire of repose. For, the <lb/>
            senate being extinct, and courts of justice abolished, what is <lb/>
            there that I could do worthy of myself, either in the senate- <lb/>
            house or in the forum ? Thus, I who formerly lived in the <lb/>
            greatest celebrity, and before the eyes of the citizens, now <lb/>
            shunning the sight of wicked men, with whom all places <lb/>
            abound, conceal myself as far as it is possible, and often <lb/>
            am alone. But since we have been taught by learned men, <lb/>
            that out of evils it is fit not only to choose the least, but also <lb/>
            from those very evils to gather whatever good is in them, I <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <pb n="116"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            therefore am both enjoying rest-not such, indeed, as he <lb/>
            ought who formerly procured rest for the state,-and I am <lb/>
            not allowing that solitude which necessity, not inclination, <lb/>
            brings me, to be spent in idleness. Although, in my judg- <lb/>
            ment, Africanus obtained greater praise. For there are ex- <lb/>
            tant no monuments of his genius committed to writing- <lb/>
            no work of his leisure-no employment of his solitude. <lb/>
            From which it ought to be understood, that he was never <lb/>
            either idle or solitary, because of the activity of his mind, <lb/>
            and the investigation of those things which he pursued in <lb/>
            thought. But I who have not so much strength that I can <lb/>
            be drawn away from solitude by silent thought, turn all my <lb/>
            study and care to this labour of composition. And thus I <lb/>
            have written more in a short time, since the overthrow of <lb/>
            the republic, than in the many years while it stood.</p>
          <p>II. But as all philosophy, my Cicero, is fruitful and pro- <lb/>
            fitable, and no part of it uncultivated and desert-so no part <lb/>
            in it is more fruitful and profitable than that about duties, <lb/>
            from which the. rules of living consistently and virtuously <lb/>
            are derived. Wherefore, although I trust you constantly <lb/>
            hear and learn these matters from my friend Cratippus, the <lb/>
            prince of the philosophers within our memory, yet I think <lb/>
            it is beneficial that your ears should ring on all sides <lb/>
            with such discourse, and that they, if it were possible, should <lb/>
            hear nothing else. Which, as it ought to be done by all <lb/>
            who design to enter upon a virtuous life, so I know not <lb/>
            but it ought by no one more than you ; for you stand under <lb/>
            no small expectation of emulating my industry-under a <lb/>
            great one of emulating my honours-under no small one, per- <lb/>
            haps, of my fame. Besides, you have incurred a heavy responsi- <lb/>
            bility both from Athens and Cratippus; and since you have <lb/>
            gone to these as to a mart for good qualities, it would be most <lb/>
            scandalous to return empty, disgracing the reputation both <lb/>
            of the city and of the master. Wherefore, try and ac- <lb/>
            complish as much as you can, labour with your mind and <lb/>
            with your industry (if it be labour to learn rather than a <lb/>
            pleasure), and do not permit that, when all things have been <lb/>
            supplied by me, you should seem to have been wanting to <lb/>
            yourself. But let this suffice; for we have often written <lb/>
            much to you for the purpose of encouraging you. Now let <lb/>
            us return to the remaining part of our proposed division.</p><pb n="117"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">CHAP III.]</note></p>
          <p>Panætius, then, who without controversy has discoursed <lb/>
            most accurately about duties, and whom I, making some cor- <lb/>
            rection, have principally followed, having proposed three <lb/>
            heads under which men were accustomed to deliberate and <lb/>
            consult about duty-one, when they were in doubt whether <lb/>
            that about which they were considering was virtuous or base; <lb/>
            another, whether useful or unprofitable; a third, when that <lb/>
            which had the appearance of virtue was in opposition to that <lb/>
            which seemed useful, how this ought to be determined ; he <lb/>
            unfolded the two first heads in three books, but on the third <lb/>
            head he said that he would afterwards write, but did not <lb/>
            perform what he had promised. At which I am the more <lb/>
            surprised on this account, that it is recorded by his disciple <lb/>
            Posidonius, that Panætius lived thirty years after he had <lb/>
            published those books. And I am surprised that this matter <lb/>
            should be only briefly touched on by Posidonius in some <lb/>
            commentaries, especially when he writes that there is no <lb/>
            subject in all philosophy so necessary. But by no means do <lb/>
            I agree with those who deny that this subject was casually <lb/>
            omitted by Panætius, but that it was designedly abandoned, <lb/>
            and that it ought not to have been written at all, because <lb/>
            utility could never be in opposition to virtue. On which <lb/>
            point is one thing that may admit a doubt; whether this head, <lb/>
            which is third in the division of Panætius, ought to have <lb/>
            been taken up, or whether it ought to have been altogether <lb/>
            omitted. The other thing cannot be doubted, that it was <lb/>
            undertaken by Panætius, but left unfinished. For he who <lb/>
            has completed two parts out of a three-fold division, must <lb/>
            have a third remaining. Besides, in the end of the third <lb/>
            book he promises that he will afterwards write about this <lb/>
            third part. To this is also added a sufficient witness, Posi- <lb/>
            donius, who in a certain letter writes that Publius Rutilius <lb/>
            Rufus, who had been a disciple of Panætius, had been ac- <lb/>
            customed to say, that as no painter could be found who could <lb/>
            finish that part of the Coan Venus which Apelles had left <lb/>
            unfinished (for the beauty of the countenance left no hope of <lb/>
            making the rest of the body correspond), so no one could go <lb/>
            through with those things which Panætius had omitted, on <lb/>
            account of the excellence of those parts which he had com- <lb/>
            pleted.</p>
          <p>III. Wherefore, there cannot be a doubt about the opinion <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note> <lb/>
            of Panætius; but whether it was right in him, or otherwise, <lb/>
            to join this third part to the investigation of duty, about <lb/>
            this, perhaps, there may be a question. For whether virtue <lb/>
            be the only good, as is the opinion of the Stoics, or whether <lb/>
            that which is virtuous be, as it appears to your Peripatetics, <lb/>
            so much the greatest good, that all things placed on the other <lb/>
            side have scarcely the smallest weight; it is not to be doubted <lb/>
            but that utility never can compare with virtue. Therefore <lb/>
            we have learned that Socrates used to execrate those who <lb/>
            had first separated in theory those things cohering in nature. <lb/>
            To whom, indeed, the Stoics have so far assented, that they <lb/>
            considered that whatever is virtuous is useful, and that no- <lb/>
            thing can be useful which is not virtuous. But if Panætius <lb/>
            was one who would say that virtue was to be cultivated only <lb/>
            on this account, because it was a means of procuring profit, <lb/>
            as they do who measure the desirableness of objects either <lb/>
            by pleasure or by the absence of pain, it would be allowable <lb/>
            for him to say that our interest sometimes is opposed to <lb/>
            virtue. But as he was one who judged that alone to be good <lb/>
            which is virtuous, but that of such things as oppose this <lb/>
            with some appearance of utility, neither the accession can <lb/>
            make life better, nor the loss make it worse, it appears that <lb/>
            he ought not to have introduced a deliberation of this kind, <lb/>
            in which what seems profitable could be compared with that <lb/>
            which is virtuous. For what is called the summum bonum <lb/>
            by the Stoics, to live agreeably to nature, has, I conceive, <lb/>
            this meaning-always to conform to virtue; and as to all <lb/>
            other things which may be according to nature, to take <lb/>
            them if they should not be repugnant to virtue. And since <lb/>
            this is so, some think that this comparison is improperly in- <lb/>
            troduced, and that no principle should be laid down upon <lb/>
            this head. And, indeed, that perfection of conduct which is <lb/>
            properly and truly called so, exists in the wise alone, and <lb/>
            can never be separated from virtue. But in those persons <lb/>
            in whom there is not perfect wisdom, that perfection can <lb/>
            indeed by no means exist; but the likeness of it can. For <lb/>
            the Stoics call all those duties about which we are discours- <lb/>
            ing in these books, mean duties (media officia). These are <lb/>
            common, and extend widely, which many attain by the good- <lb/>
            ness of natural disposition, and by progressive improvement. <lb/>
            But that duty which the same philosophers call right (rec- <pb n="119"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP IV.]</note><lb/>
            turn), is perfect and absolute, and, as the same philosophers <lb/>
            say, has all the parts perfect, and cannot fall to the lot of any <lb/>
            but the wise man. But when anything is performed in <lb/>
            which mean duties appear, it seems to be abundantly perfect, <lb/>
            because the vulgar do not at all understand how far it falls <lb/>
            short of the perfect; but as far as they understand, they <lb/>
            think there is nothing wanting. Which same thing comes <lb/>
            to pass in poems, in pictures, and in many other matters, <lb/>
            that those things which should not be commended, the un- <lb/>
            skilful are delighted with and commend; on this account, I <lb/>
            suppose, that there is in these things some merit which <lb/>
            catches the unskilful, who indeed are unable to judge what <lb/>
            deficiency there may be in each. Therefore, when they are <lb/>
            apprised of it by the initiated, they readily abandon their <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>IV. These duties, then, of which we are discoursing in <lb/>
            these books, they* say are virtuous in some secondary degree <lb/>
            -not peculiar to the wise alone, but common to every de- <lb/>
            scription of men. By these, therefore, all are moved in <lb/>
            whom there is a natural disposition towards virtue. Nor, <lb/>
            indeed, when the two Decii or the two Scipios are comme- <lb/>
            morated as brave men, or when Fabricius and Aristides are <lb/>
            called just, is either an example of fortitude looked for from <lb/>
            the former, or of justice from the latter, as from wise men. <lb/>
            For neither of these was wise in such a sense as we wish the <lb/>
            term wise man to be understood. Nor were these who were <lb/>
            esteemed and named wise, Marcus Cato and Caius Lælius, <lb/>
            wise men; nor were even those famous seven,t but from the <lb/>
            frequent performance of mean duties they bore some simili- <lb/>
            tude and appearance of wise men. Wherefore, it is neither <lb/>
            right to compare that which is truly virtuous with what is <lb/>
            repugnant to utility, nor should that which we commonly <lb/>
            call virtuous, which is cultivated by those who wish to be <lb/>
            esteemed good men, ever be compared with profits. And <lb/>
            that virtue which falls within our comprehension is as much <lb/>
            to be maintained and preserved by us, as that which is <lb/>
            properly called, and which truly is virtue, is by the wise. <lb/>
            For otherwise, whatever advancement is made towards vir- <lb/>
            tue, it cannot be maintained. But these remarks are made <note type="footnote"> * The Stoics. </note><note type="footnote"> t The seven rise men of Greece. </note> <pb n="120"/>

            regarding those who are considered good men, on account <lb/>
            of their observance of duties ; but those who measure all <lb/>
            things by profit and advantage, and who do not consider <lb/>
            that those things are outweighed by virtue, are accustomed, <lb/>
            in deliberating, to compare virtue with that which they <lb/>
            think profitable ; good men are not so accustomed. There- <lb/>
            fore, I think that Panætius, when he said that men were <lb/>
            accustomed to deliberate on this comparison, meant this <lb/>
            very thing which he expressed,-only that it was their cus- <lb/>
            tom, not that it was also their duty. For not only to think <lb/>
            more of what seems profitable than what is virtuous, but <lb/>
            even to compare them one with the other, and to hesitate <lb/>
            between them, is most shameful. What is it, then. that is <lb/>
            accustomed at times to raise a doubt, and seems necessary <lb/>
            to be considered ? I believe, whenever a doubt arises, <lb/>
            it is what the character of that action may be about <lb/>
            which one is considering. For oftentimes it happens, that <lb/>
            what is accustomed to be generally considered disreputable, <lb/>
            may be found not to be disreputable. For the sake of ex- <lb/>
            ample, let a case be supposed which has a wide applica- <lb/>
            tion. What can be greater wickedness than to slay not <lb/>
            only a man, but even an intimate friend ? Has he then in- <lb/>
            volved himself in guilt, who slays a tyrant, however inti- <lb/>

            Has expediency, then, overcome virtue ? Kay, rather, expe- <lb/>
            diency has followed virtue. Therefore, that we may be <lb/>
            able to decide without any mistake, if ever that which we <lb/>
            call expediency (utile) shall appear to be at variance with <lb/>
            that which we understand to be virtuous (honestum), a <lb/>
            certain rule ought to be established, which if we will fol- <lb/>
            low in comparing such cases, we shall never fail in our <lb/>
            duty. But this rule will be one conformable to the reason- <lb/>
            ing and discipline of the Stoics chiefly, which, indeed, we <lb/>
            are following in these books, because, though both by the <lb/>
            ancient Academicians and by your Peripatetics, who for- <lb/>
            merly were the same sect, things which are virtuous <lb/>
            are preferred to those which seem expedient; nevertheless, <lb/>
            those subjects are more nobly treated of by those* to whom <lb/>
            whatever is virtuous seems also expedient, and nothing ex- <lb/>
            pedient which is not virtuous, than by those according to <note type="footnote"> soned at the source, every man is left to execute for himself the decrees of <lb/>
            immutable equity.' It may, however, be doubted, whether the destruction <lb/>
            of a tyrant be, in any respect, a case of exception from the rules proper to <lb/>
            be observed upon ordinary occasions. The tyrant has, indeed, no particular <lb/>
            security annexed to his person, and may be killed with as little scruple as <lb/>
            any other man, when the object is that of repelling personal assault. In <lb/>
            all other cases, the extirpation of the offender by self-appointed authority, <lb/>
            does not appear to be the appropriate mode of counteracting injustice. For, <lb/>
            first, either the nation, whose tyrant you would destroy, is ripe for the as- <lb/>
            sertion and maintenance of its liberty, or it is not. If it be, the tyrant <lb/>
            ought to be deposed with every appearance of publicity. Nothing can be <lb/>
            more improper, than for an affair, interesting to the general weal, to be con- <lb/>
            ducted as if it were an act of darkness and shame. It is an ill lesson we <lb/>
            read to mankind, when a proceeding, built upon the broad basis of general <lb/>
            justice, is permitted to shrink from public scrutiny. The pistol and the <lb/>
            dagger may as easily be made the auxiliaries of vice as of virtue. To pro- <lb/>
            scribe all violence, and neglect no means of information and impartiality, is <lb/>
            the most effectual security we can have for an issue conformable to reason <lb/>
            and truth. If, on the other hand, the nation be not ripe for a state of free- <lb/>
            dam, the man who assumes to himself the right of interposing violence, <lb/>
            may indeed show the fervour of his conception, and gain a certain noto- <lb/>
            riety; but he will not fail to be the author of new calamities to his coun- <lb/>
            try. The consequences of tyrannicide are well known. If the attempt <lb/>
            prove abortive, it renders the tyrant ten times more bloody, ferocious, and <lb/>
            cruel than before. If it succeed, and the tyranny be restored, it produces <lb/>
            the same effect upon his successors. In the climate of despotism some so- <lb/>
            litary virtues may spring up ; but in the midst of plots and conspiracies, <lb/>
            there is neither truth, nor confidence, nor love, nor humanity."—Godwin's <lb/>

            whom that may be virtuous which is not expedient, and that <lb/>
            expedient which is not virtuous. But to us, our Academic, <lb/>
            sect gives this great licence, that we, whatever may seem <lb/>
            most probable, by our privilege are at liberty to maintain. <lb/>
            But I return to my rule.</p>
          <p>V. To take away wrongfully, then, from another, and for <lb/>
            one man to advance his own interest by the disadvantage <lb/>
            of another man, is more contrary to nature than death, than <lb/>
            poverty, than pain, than any other evils which can befall <lb/>
            either our bodies or external circumstances. For, in the <lb/>
            first place, it destroys human intercourse and society; for <lb/>
            if we will be so disposed that each for his own gain shall <lb/>
            despoil or offer violence to another, the inevitable conse- <lb/>
            quence is, that the society of the human race, which <lb/>
            is most consistent with nature, will be broken asunder. <lb/>
            As, supposing each member of the body was so disposed as <lb/>
            to think it could be well if it should draw to itself the <lb/>
            health of the adjacent member, it is inevitable that the <lb/>
            whole body would be debilitated and would perish ; so <lb/>
            if each of us should seize for himself the interests of <lb/>
            another, and wrest whatever he could from each for the sake <lb/>
            of his own emolument, the necessary consequence is, that <lb/>
            human society and community would be overturned. It is <lb/>
            indeed allowed, nature not opposing, that each should rather <lb/>
            acquire for himself than for another, whatever pertains to <lb/>
            the enjoyment of life; but nature does not allow this, that <lb/>
            by the spoliation of others we should increase our own <lb/>
            means, resources, and opulence. Nor indeed is this forbid- <lb/>
            den by nature alone-that is, by the law of nations-but <lb/>
            it is also in the same manner enacted by the municipal laws <lb/>
            of countries, by which government is supported in individual <lb/>
            states, that it should not be lawful to injure another man for <lb/>
            the sake of one's own advantage.* For this the laws look to, <lb/>
            this they require, that the union of the citizens should be <lb/>
            unimpaired ; those who are for severing it they coerce by <lb/>
            death, by banishment, by imprisonment, by fine. But what <lb/>
            declares this much more is our natural reason, which is a. <lb/>
            Jaw divine and human, which he who is willing to obey, <lb/>
            (and all will obey it who are willing to live according to <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞</foreign> La plus sublime vertu est negative ; elle nous instruit de ne jamais <lb/>

            nature) never will suffer himself to covet what is another <lb/>
            person's, and to assume to himself that which he shall have <lb/>
            wrongfully taken from another.* For loftiness and greatness <lb/>
            of mind, and likewise community of feeling, justice, and libe- <lb/>
            rality, are much more in accordance with nature, than plea- <lb/>
            sure, than life, than riches—which things, even to contemn <lb/>
            and count as nothing in comparison with the common good, <lb/>
            is the part of a great and lofty soul. Therefore, to take away <lb/>
            wrongfully from another for the sake of one's own advan- <lb/>
            tage, is more contrary to nature than death, than pain, than <lb/>
            other considerations of the same kind. And likewise, to <lb/>
            undergo the greatest labours and inquietudes for the sake, if <lb/>
            it were possible, of preserving or assisting all nations- <lb/>
            imitating that Hercules whom the report of men, mindful of <lb/>
            his benefits, has placed in the council of the gods †—is more <lb/>
            in accordance with nature than to live in solitude, not only <lb/>
            without any inquietudes, but even amidst the greatest plea- <lb/>
            sures, abounding in all manner of wealth, though you should <lb/>
            also excel in beauty and strength. Wherefore, every man of <lb/>
            the best and most noble disposition much prefers that life <lb/>
            to this. From whence it is evinced, that man, obeying <lb/>
            nature, cannot injure men. In the next place, he who <lb/>
            injures another that he may himself attain some advantage, <lb/>
            either thinks that he is doing nothing contrary to nature, or <lb/>
            thinks that death, poverty, pain, the loss of children, of <lb/>
            kindred, and of friends, are more to be avoided than doing <note type="footnote"> * "The word natural is commonly taken in so many senses, and is of so <lb/>
            loose a signification, that it seems vain to dispute whether justice be natural <lb/>
            or not. If self-love, if benevolence, be natural to man—if reason and fore- <lb/>
            thought be also natural-then may the same epithet be applied to justice, <lb/>
            order, fidelity, property, society. Men's inclination, their necessities, lead <lb/>
            them to combine; their understanding and experience tell them that this <lb/>
            combination is impossible, where each governs himself by no rule, and pays <lb/>

            trary to nature by injuring men, what use is there in dis- <lb/>
            puting with him who would altogether take away from man <lb/>
            what is human ? But if he thinks that indeed is to be <lb/>
            shunned, but that those things, death, poverty, pain, are much <lb/>
            worse, he errs in this, that he thinks any defect, either of <lb/>
            body or fortune, more grievous than the defects of the mind.</p>
          <p>VI, One thing, therefore, ought to be aimed at by all men ; <lb/>
            that the interest of each individually, and of all collectively, <lb/>
            should be the same; for if each should grasp at his individual <lb/>
            interest, all human society will be dissolved. And also, if <lb/>
            nature enjoins this, that a man should desire to consult the in- <lb/>
            terest of a man, whoever he is, for the very reason that he is <lb/>
            man, it necessarily follows that, as the nature, so the interest, <lb/>
            of all mankind, is a common one. If that be so, we are all <lb/>
            included under one and the same law of nature ; and if this <lb/>
            too be true, we are certainly prohibited by the law of nature <lb/>
            from injuring another. But the first is true ; therefore, the <lb/>
            last is true. For that which some say, that they would take <lb/>
            nothing wrongfully, for the sake of their own advantage, <lb/>
            from a parent or brother, but that the case is different with <lb/>
            other citizens, is indeed absurd. These establish the prin- <lb/>
            ciple that they have nothing in the way of right, no society <lb/>
            with their fellow citizens, for the sake of the common <lb/>
            interest-an opinion which tears asunder the whole social <lb/>
            compact. They, again, who say that a regard ought to be <lb/>
            had to fellow citizens, but deny that it ought to foreigners, <lb/>
            break up the common society of the human race, which, <lb/>
            being withdrawn, beneficence, liberality, goodness, justice, <lb/>
            are utterly abolished. But they who tear up these things <lb/>
            should be judged impious, even towards the immortal gods ; <lb/>
            for they overturn the society established by them among <lb/>
            men, the closest bond of which society is, the consideration that <lb/>
            it is more contrary to nature that man, for the sake of his own <lb/>
            gain, should wrongfully take from man, than that he should en- <lb/>
            dure all such disadvantages, either external or in the person, or <lb/>
            even in the mind itself, as are not the effects of injustice. For <lb/>
            that one virtue, justice, is the mistress and queen of all virtues.. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞</foreign> There is no virtue so truly great and godlike as justice ; most of the <lb/>

          <p>Some person will perhaps say-should not the wise man, <lb/>
            then, if himself famished with hunger, wrest food from <lb/>
            another, some good-for-nothing fellow ? By no means ; for <lb/>
            my life is not more useful to me, than such a disposition <lb/>
            of mind that I would do violence to no man for the sake <lb/>
            of my own advantage. What ! If a worthy man could <lb/>
            despoil Phalaris, a cruel and outrageous tyrant, of his gar- <lb/>
            ments, that he might not himself perish with cold, should he <lb/>
            not do it ? These points are very easy to decide. For if <lb/>
            you will wrongfully take away anything from a good-for- <lb/>
            nothing man for the sake of your own interest, you will act <lb/>
            unsociably and contrary to the law of nature. But if you <lb/>
            be one who can bring much advantage to the state, and to <lb/>
            human society if you remain in life, it may not deserve to <lb/>
            be reprehended should you wrongfully take anything upon <lb/>
            that account from another. But if that be not the case, <lb/>
            it is rather the duty of each to bear his own misfortune, than <lb/>
            wrongfully to take from the comforts of another. Disease, <lb/>
            then, or poverty, or anything of this sort, is not more con- <lb/>
            trary to nature than is the wrongful taking or coveting what <lb/>
            is another's. But the desertion of the common interest is <lb/>
            contrary to nature, for it is unjust. Therefore, the very law <lb/>
            of nature which preserves and governs the interest of men, <note type="footnote"> omnipotence are requisite for the full exertion of it; the one to discover <lb/>
            every degree of uprightness or iniquity in thoughts, words, and actions; the <lb/>

            decrees undoubtedly that things necessary for living should <lb/>
            be transferred from an inert and useless fellow to a wise, <lb/>
            good, and brave man, who, if he should perish, would largely <lb/>
            take away from the common good ; provided he do this* in <lb/>
            such a manner, that he do not, through thinking well of <lb/>
            himself, and loving himself, make this an excuse for com- <lb/>
            mitting injustice. Thus will he always discharge his duty, <lb/>
            advancing the interests of mankind, and that human so- <lb/>
            ciety of which I so often make mention.t Now, as to what <lb/>
            relates to Phalaris, the decision is very easy ; for we have no <lb/>
            society with tyrants, but rather the widest separation from <lb/>
            . them ; nor is it contrary to nature to despoil, if you can, him <note type="footnote"> * That is, provided he transfer to himself the necessaries of life from a <lb/>
            worthless person. </note><note type="footnote"> t "In a loose and general view," says Godwin, " I and my neighbour are <lb/>
            both of us men ; and of consequence entitled to equal attention. But, in <lb/>
            reality, it is probable that one of us is a being of more worth and im- <lb/>
            portance than the other. A man is of more worth than a beast, because, <lb/>
            being possessed of higher faculties, he is capable of a more refined and <lb/>
            genuine happiness. In the same manner the illustrious Archbishop of <lb/>
            Cambray was of more worth than his valet, and there are few of us that <lb/>
            would hesitate to pronounce, if his palace were in flames, and the life of <lb/>
            only one of them could be preserved, which of the two ought to be pre- <lb/>
            ferred. But there is another ground of preference, besides the private con- <lb/>
            sideration of one of them being farther removed from the state of a mere <lb/>
            animal. We are not connected with one or two percipient beings, but with <lb/>
            a society, a nation, and in some sense with the whole family of mankind. <lb/>
            Of consequence that life ought to be preferred which will be most con- <lb/>
            ducive to the general good. In saving the life of Fenelon, suppose at that <lb/>
            moment he conceived the project of his immortal Telemachus, I should <lb/>
            have been promoting the benefit of thousands who have been cured by the <lb/>
            perusal of that work of some error, vice, and consequent unhappiness. <lb/>
            Nay, my benefit would extend further than this; for every individual thus <lb/>
            cured, has become a better member of society, and has contributed in his <lb/>
            turn to the happiness, information, and improvement of others. Suppose <lb/>
            I had been myself the valet, I ought to have chosen to die rather than <lb/>
            Fenelon should have died; the life of Fenelon was really preferable to that <lb/>
            of the valet. But understanding is the faculty that perceives the truth of <lb/>
            this and similar propositions, and justice is the principle that regulates my <lb/>
            conduct accordingly. It would have been just in the valet to have pre- <lb/>
            ferred the archbishop to himself; to have done otherwise would have been <lb/>
            a breach of justice. Suppose the valet had been my brother, my father, or <lb/>
            my benefactor, this would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life <lb/>
            of Fenelon would still be more valuable than that of the valet; and justice, <lb/>
            pure and unadulterated justice, would still have preferred that which was <lb/>
            most valuable. Justice would have taught me to save the life of Fenelon <lb/>
            at the expense of the other.<foreign xml:lang="grc">῍</foreign>—Political Justice, book ii. chap. ii. </note> <pb n="127"/>

            whom it is a virtue to slay-and this pestilential and impious <lb/>
            class ought to be entirely exterminated from the community <lb/>
            of mankind. For as certain limbs are amputated, both if they <lb/>
            themselves have begun to be destitute of blood, and, as it <lb/>
            were, of life, and if they injure the other parts of the body, <lb/>
            so the brutality and ferocity of a beast iu the figure of a <lb/>
            man, ought to be cut off from the common body, as it were, <lb/>
            of humanity.</p>
          <p>Of this sort are all those questions in which our duty is <lb/>
            sought out of the circumstances of the case.</p>
          <p>VII. In this manner, then, I think Panæstius would have <lb/>
            pursued these subjects, had not some accident or occupation <lb/>
            interrupted his design; for which same deliberations there <lb/>
            are in his former books rules sufficiently numerous, by which <lb/>
            it can be perceived what ought to be avoided on account of <lb/>
            its baseness, and what therefore need not be avoided, because <lb/>
            it is not at all base. But since I am putting, as it were, the <lb/>
            top upon a work incomplete, yet nearly finished, as it is the <lb/>
            custom of geometers not to demonstrate everything, but to <lb/>
            require that some postulates be granted to them, that they <lb/>
            may more readily explain what they intend, so I ask of you, <lb/>
            my Cicero, that you grant me, if you can, that nothing <lb/>
            except what is virtuous is worthy to be sought for its own <lb/>
            sake. But if this be not allowed you by Cratippus,* still <lb/>
            you will at least grant that what is virtuous is most worthy <lb/>
            to be sought for its own sake. Whichever of the two you <lb/>
            please is sufficient for me, and sometimes the one, sometimes <lb/>
            the other, seems the more probable; nor does anything <lb/>
            else seem probable.t</p>
          <p>And in the first place, Panæstius is to be defended in this, <lb/>
            that he did not say that the really expedient could ever be <lb/>
            opposed to the virtuous (for it was not permitted to him t to <lb/>
            say so), but only those things which seemed expedient. But <note type="footnote"> * Cratippus, as a Peripatetic, held that virtue was not the only good, <lb/>
            but that other things, such as health, &amp;c. were good, and therefore to be <lb/>
            sought for their own sakes, though in a less degree than virtue ; or, in other <lb/>
            words, the Peripatetics admitted natural as well as moral good-the Stoics <lb/>
            did not. </note><note type="footnote"> t That is to say, he does not admit the probability of the correctness of <lb/>
            such as Epicurus, or Hieronymus, &amp;c. who held that pleasure, the absence <lb/>
            of pain, &amp;c. were worth seeking on their own account </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Because he was a Stoic. </note> <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note> <lb/>
            he often bears testimony that nothing is expedient which is <lb/>
            not likewise virtuous-nothing virtuous which is not likewise <lb/>
            expedient; and he denies that any greater mischief has ever <lb/>
            attacked the race of men than the opinion of those persons <lb/>
            who would separate these things. It was not, therefore, in <lb/>
            order that we should prefer the expedient to the virtuous, <lb/>
            but in order that we should decide between them without <lb/>
            error, if ever they should come in collision, that he intro- <lb/>
            duced that opposition which seemed to have, not which has, <lb/>
            existence. This part, therefore, thus abandoned, I will com- <lb/>
            plete with no help, but, as it is said, with my own forces <lb/>
            For there has not, since the time of Panætius, been anything <lb/>
            delivered upon this subject, of all the works which have <lb/>
            come to my hands, that meets my approbation.</p>
          <p>VIII. When, therefore, any appearance of expediency Is <lb/>
            presented to you, you are necessarily affected by it ; but if, <lb/>
            when you direct your attention to it, you see moral turpitude <lb/>
            attached to that which offers the appearance of expediency, <lb/>
            tnen you are under an obligation not to abandon expediency, <lb/>
            but to understand that there cannot be real expediency <lb/>
            where there is moral turpitude ; because, since nothing is <lb/>
            so contrary to nature as moral turpitude (for nature desires <lb/>
            the upright, the suitable, and the consistent, and rejects the <lb/>
            reverse), and nothing is so agreeable to nature as expe- <lb/>
            diency, surely expediency and turpitude cannot co-exist in <lb/>
            the same subject. And again, since we are born for <lb/>
            virtue, and this either is the only thing to be desired, as <lb/>
            it appeared to Zeno, or is at least to be considered weightier <lb/>
            in its entire importance than all other things, as is the <lb/>
            opinion of Aristotle, it is the necessary consequence, that <lb/>
            whatever is virtuous either is the only, or it is the highest <lb/>
            good ; but whatever is good is certainly useful-therefore, <lb/>
            whatever is virtuous is useful.* Wherefore, it is an error <note type="footnote"> * The following parallel passage will not only show how nearly the <lb/>
            ethics of Cicero approach to those of a Christian philosopher, but will also <lb/>
            suggest the reason why they are not entirely coincident. "It is sufficiently <lb/>
            evident,<foreign xml:lang="grc">῍</foreign> says Dymond, upon the principles which have hitherto been <lb/>
            advanced, " that considerations of utility are only so far obligatory, as they <lb/>
            are in accordance with the moral law. Pursuing, however, the method <lb/>
            which has been adopted in the two last chapters, it may be observed that <lb/>
            this subserviency to the Divine will, appears to be required by the written <lb/>
            revelation. That habitual preference of futurity to the present time which </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="129"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP IX.]</note><lb/>
            of bad men, which, when it grasps at something which seems <lb/>
            useful, separates it immediately from virtue. Hence spring <lb/>
            stilettos, hence poisons, hence forgery of wills, hence thefts, <lb/>
            embezzlements, hence robberies and extortions from allies <lb/>
            and fellow citizens, hence the intolerable oppressions of ex- <lb/>
            cessive opulence-hence, in fine, even in free states, the lust <lb/>
            of sway, than which nothing darker or fouler can be con- <lb/>
            ceived. For men view the profits of transactions with false <lb/>
            judgment, but they do not see the punishment—I do not <lb/>
            say of the laws, which they often break through, but of <lb/>
            moral turpitude itself, which is most severe. Wherefore, <lb/>
            this class of sceptics should be put out of our consider- <lb/>
            ation (as being altogether wicked and impious), who <lb/>
            hesitate whether they should follow that which they see is <lb/>
            virtuous, or knowingly contaminate themselves with wicked- <lb/>
            ness. For the guilty deed exists in the very hesitation, even <lb/>
            though they shall not have carried it out. Therefore, such <lb/>
            matters should not be at all deliberated about, in which the <lb/>
            very deliberation is criminal ; and also from every delibera- <lb/>
            tion the hope and idea of secrecy and concealment ought to. <lb/>
            be removed. For we ought to be sufficiently convinced, if <lb/>
            we have made any proficiency in philosophy, that even though <lb/>
            we could conceal any transaction from all gods and men, yet <lb/>
            that nothing avaricious should be done, nothing unjust, <lb/>
            nothing licentious, nothing incontinent.</p>
          <p>IX. To this purpose Plato introduces that celebrated <lb/>
            Gyges, who, when the earth had opened, in consequence of <note type="footnote"> Scripture exhibits, indicates that our interests here should he held in <lb/>
            subordination to our interests hereafter ; and as these higher interests are <lb/>
            to he consulted by the means which revelation prescribes, it is manifest that <lb/>
            those means are to be pursued, whatever we may suppose to be their effects <lb/>
            upon the present welfare of ourselves or of other men. ' If in this life only <lb/>
            we have hope in God, then are we of all men most miserable.' And why <lb/>
            did they thus sacrifice expediency? Because the communicated will of <lb/>
            God required that course of life by which human interests were ap- <lb/>
            parently sacrificed. It will be perceived that these considerations result <lb/>
            from the truth (too little regarded in talking of' expediency' and 'general <lb/>
            benevolence'), that utility as respects mankind cannot be properly con- <lb/>
            suited without taking into account our interests in futurity. ' Let us eat <lb/>
            and drink, for to-morrow we die,' is a maxim of which all would approve <lb/>
            if we had no concerns with another life. That which might be very ex- <lb/>
            pedient if death were annihilation, may be very inexpedient now."— <lb/>

            certain heavy showers, descended into that chasm, and, as <lb/>
            tradition goes, beheld a brazen horse, in whose side was a <lb/>
            door, on opening which he beheld the body of a dead man <lb/>
            of extraordinary size, and a gold ring upon his linger, which <lb/>
            when he had drawn off, he himself put it on, and then betook <lb/>
            himself to the assembly of the shepherds (for he was the <lb/>
            king's shepherd). There, when he turned the stone of this <lb/>
            ring to the palm of his hand, he was visible to no person, but <lb/>
            himself saw everything ; and when he had turned the ring <lb/>
            into its proper place, he again became visible. Having em- <lb/>
            ployed, then, this convenience of the ring, he committed <lb/>
            adultery with the queen, and, with her assistance, slew the <lb/>
            king, his master, and got rid of those whom he considered likely <lb/>
            to oppose him. Nor could any one discover him in these <lb/>
            crimes. So with the assistance of the ring he suddenly <lb/>
            sprang up to be king of Lydia. Now, if a wise man had <lb/>
            this ring itself, he would think that he was no more at liberty <lb/>
            to commit crime than if he had it not. For virtue, not <lb/>
            secrecy, is sought by good men. And here some philosophers, <lb/>
            and they indeed by no means unworthy men, but not very <lb/>
            acute, say that the story told by Plato is false and fabulous, <lb/>
            just as if he indeed maintained either that it had happened <lb/>
            or could have happened. The import of this ring and of this <lb/>
            example is this—if nobody were to know, nobody even to <lb/>
            suspect that you were doing anything for the sake of riches, <lb/>
            power, domination, lust—if it would be for ever unknown to <lb/>
            gods and men, would you do it ? They deny that the case <lb/>
            is possible. But though indeed it be possible, I only inquire <lb/>
            what they would do if that were possible which they deny <lb/>
            to be so. They argue very stupidly, for they simply deny <lb/>
            that it is possible, and they persist in that answer. They do <lb/>
            not perceive what is the force of that expression, " if it were <lb/>
            possible." For when we ask what they would do if they <lb/>
            possibly could conceal, we are not asking whether they really <lb/>
            could conceal ; but we are putting them, as it were, to the <lb/>
            torture, that if they answer that they would do, if impunity <lb/>
            were offered, what it was their interest to do, they must <lb/>
            confess that they are wicked ; if they deny that they would <lb/>
            do so, they must admit that all base actions are to be shunned <lb/>
            on their own account. But now let us return to'our subject.</p>
          <p>X. Many cases frequently occur, which disturb our minds <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note> <lb/>
            by the appearance of expediency. Not when this is the <lb/>
            subject of deliberation, whether virtue should be deserted <lb/>
            on account of the magnitude of the profit (for on this, indeed, <lb/>
            it is dishonest to deliberate), but this, whether or no that <lb/>
            which seems profitable can be done without baseness. When <lb/>
            Brutus deposed his colleague, Collatinus, from his command, <lb/>
            he might seem to be acting with injustice ; for Collatinus <lb/>
            had been the associate and assistant in the councils of Brutus <lb/>
            in expelling the kings. But when the rulers had taken <lb/>
            this counsel, that the kindred of Superbus, and the name of <lb/>
            the Tarquinii, and the memory of royalty were to be rooted <lb/>
            out ; that which was useful, namely, to consult for his <lb/>
            country, was so virtuous that it ought to have pleased even <lb/>
            Collatinus himself. Therefore the expediency of the measure <lb/>
            prevailed with Brutus on account of its rectitude, without <lb/>
            which expediency could not have even existed. But it was <lb/>
            otherwise in that king who founded the city ; for the appear- <lb/>
            ance of expediency influenced his mind, since, when it seemed <lb/>
            to him more profitable to reign alone than with another, he slew <lb/>
            his brother. He disregarded both affection and humanity, <lb/>
            that he might obtain that which seemed useful, but was not. <lb/>
            And yet he set up the excuse about the wall-a pretence of <lb/>
            virtue neither probable nor very suitable : therefore, with <lb/>
            all due respect to Quirinus or Romulus,* I would say that he <lb/>
            committed a crime.</p>
          <p>Yet our own interests should not be neglected by us, nor <lb/>
            given up to others when we ourselves want them; but each <lb/>
            should serve his own interest, as far as it can be done with- <lb/>
            out injustice to another :—Chrysippus has judiciously made <lb/>
            this remak like many others :—" He, who runs a race, <lb/>
            ought to make exertions, and struggle as much as he can <lb/>
            to be victor ; but he ought by no means to trip up or push <lb/>
            with his hand the person with whom he is contesting. <lb/>
            Thus in life it is not unjust that each should seek for himself <lb/>
            what may pertain to his advantage-it is not just that he <lb/>
            should take from another."</p>
          <p>But our duties are principally confused in cases of friend- <lb/>
            ship ; for both not to bestow on them what you justly may, and <lb/>
            to bestow what is not just, are contrary to duty. But the <lb/>
            rule regarding this entire subject is short and easy. For <note type="footnote"> * Romulus, when deified, was called Quirinus. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="132"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            those things which seem useful-honours, riches, pleasures, <lb/>
            and other things of the same kind—should never be preferred <lb/>
            to friendship. But, on the other hand, for the sake of a <lb/>
            friend a good man will neither act against the state, nor <lb/>
            against his oath and good faith-not even if he shall be <lb/>
            judge in the case of his friend — for he lays aside the <lb/>
            character of a friend when lie puts on that of a judge. So <lb/>
            much he will concede to friendship that he had rather the <lb/>
            cause of his friend were just, and that he would accommo- <lb/>
            date him as to the time of pleading his cause as far as the <lb/>
            laws permit. But when lie must pronounce sentence on his <lb/>
            oath, he will remember that he has called the divinity as <lb/>
            witness-that is, as I conceive, his own conscience, than <lb/>
            which the deity himself has given nothing more divine to <lb/>
            man. Therefore we have received from our ancestors a <lb/>
            noble custom, if we would retain it, of entreating the judge <lb/>
            for what he can do with safe conscience. This entreaty has <lb/>
            reference to those things which, as I mentioned a little while <lb/>
            ago, could be granted with propriety by a judge to his friend. <lb/>
            For if all things were to be done which friends would wish, <lb/>
            such intimacies cannot be considered friendships, but <lb/>
            rather conspiracies. But I am speaking of common friend- <lb/>
            ships ; for there could be no such thing as that among wise <lb/>
            and perfect men. They tell us that Damon and Phintias, <lb/>
            the Pythagoreans, felt such affection for each other, that <lb/>
            when Dionysius, the tyrant, had appointed a day for the <lb/>
            execution of one of them, and he who had been condemned <lb/>
            to death had entreated a few days for himself, for the purpose <lb/>
            of commending his family to the care of his friends, the <lb/>
            other became security to have him forthcoming, so that if he <lb/>
            had not returned, it would have been necessary for himself <lb/>
            to die in his place. When he returned upon the day, the <lb/>
            tyrant having admired their faith, entreated that they would <lb/>
            admit him as a third to their friendship.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, that which seems useful in friendship is <lb/>
            compared with that which is virtuous, let the appearance of <lb/>
            expediency be disregarded, let virtue prevail. Moreover, <lb/>
            when in friendship, things which are not virtuous shall be <lb/>
            required of us, religion and good faith should be preferred to <lb/>
            friendship. Thus that distinction of duty which we are <lb/>
            seeking will be preserved.</p>
          <p>XI. But it is in state affairs that men most frequently <pb n="133"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note><lb/>
            commit crimes under the pretext of expediency-as did our <lb/>
            countrymen in the demolition of Corinth : the Athenians still <lb/>
            more harshly, since they decreed that the thumbs of the Ægi- <lb/>
            netans, who were skilful in naval matters, should be cut off. <lb/>
            This seemed expedient; for Ægina, on account of its proxi- <lb/>
            mity, was too formidable to the Piræus. But nothing which is <lb/>
            cruel can be expedient; for cruelty is most revolting to the <lb/>
            nature of mankind, which we ought to follow. Those, too, <lb/>
            do wrong who prohibit foreigners to inhabit their cities, and <lb/>
            banish them, as Pennus did among our ancestors, and Papius <lb/>
            did lately. For it is proper not to permit him to be as a citizen <lb/>
            who is not a citizen—a law which the wisest of consuls, <lb/>
            Crassus and Scævola, introduced : but to prohibit foreigners <lb/>
            from dwelling in a city is certainly inhuman. Those are <lb/>
            noble actions in which the appearance of public expediency <lb/>
            is treated with contempt in comparison with virtue. Our state <lb/>
            is full of examples, as well frequently on other occasions as <lb/>
            especially in the second Punic war, when she, having suffered <lb/>
            the disaster at Cannæ, exhibited greater spirit than ever she did <lb/>
            in her prosperity-no indication of fear, no mention of peace.</p>
          <p>So great is the power of virtue, that it throws the sem- <lb/>
            blance of expediency into the shade. When the Athenians <lb/>
            could by no means withstand the attack of the Persians, and <lb/>
            determined that, having abandoned their city, and deposited <lb/>
            their wives and children at Troezene, they should embark in <lb/>
            their vessels, and with their fleet protect the liberties of <lb/>
            Greece, they stoned one Cyrsilus, who was persuading them to <lb/>
            remain in the city, and to receive Xerxes : though he seemed <lb/>
            to pursue expediency; but it was unreal, as being opposed <lb/>
            to virtue. Themistocles, after the victory in that war which <lb/>
            took place with the Persians, said in the assembly, that he <lb/>
            had a plan salutary for the state, but that it was necessary <lb/>
            that it should not be publicly known. IIe demanded that <lb/>
            the people should appoint somebody with whom he might <lb/>
            communicate. Aristides was appointed. To him he dis- <lb/>
            closed that the fleet of the Lacedæmonians, which was in <lb/>
            dock at Gytheum, could secretly be burned; of which act <lb/>
            the necessary consequence would be, that the power of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians would be broken; which, when Aristides <lb/>
            had heard, he came into the assembly amidst great expecta- <lb/>
            tions of the people, and said that the plan which Themistocles <pb n="134"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            proposed was very expedient, but by no means honourable. <lb/>
            Therefore, the Athenians were of opinion that what was <lb/>
            not upright was not even expedient, and on the authority of <lb/>
            Aristides, rejected that entire matter which they had not <lb/>
            even heard, They acted better than we who have pirates <lb/>
            free from tribute, and allies paying taxes.</p>
          <p>XII. Let it be inferred, then, that what is base never is <lb/>
            expedient, not even when you obtain what you think to be <lb/>
            useful. For this very thinking what is base to be expedient, <lb/>
            is mischievous. But, as I said before, cases often occur, <lb/>
            when profit seems to be opposed to rectitude, so that it is <lb/>
            necessary to consider whether it is plainly opposed, or can be <lb/>
            reconciled with rectitude. Of that sort are these questions. <lb/>
            If, for example, an honest man has brought from Alexandria <lb/>
            to Rhodes a great quantity of grain during the scarcity and <lb/>
            famine of the Rhodians, and the very high prices of provi- <lb/>
            sions ; if this same man should know that many merchants <lb/>
            had sailed from Alexandria, and should have seen their ves- <lb/>
            sels on the way, laden with corn, and bound for Rhodes, <lb/>
            should he tell that to the Rhodians, or keeping silence, should <lb/>
            he sell his own corn at as high a price as possible? We are <lb/>
            supposing a wise and honest man ; we are inquiring about the <lb/>
            deliberation and consultation of one who would not conceal the <lb/>
            matter from the Rhodians if he thought it dishonourable, but <lb/>
            is in doubt whether it be dishonourable. In cases of this <lb/>
            sort, one view was habitually taken by Diogenes, the Baby- <lb/>
            lonian, a great and approved Stoic; and a different view by <lb/>
            Antipater, his pupil, a very acute man. It seems right to <lb/>
            Antipater, that everything should be disclosed, so that the <lb/>
            buyer should not be ignorant of anything at all that the seller <lb/>
            knew. To Diogenes it appears that the seller ought, just as <lb/>
            far as is established by the municipal law to declare the <lb/>
            faults, to act in other respects without fraud; but since he <lb/>
            is selling, to wish to sell at as good a price as possible. I <lb/>
            have brought my corn—I have set it up for sale—I am sell- <lb/>
            ing it, not at a higher rate than others, perhaps, he will even <lb/>
            say for less, since the supply is increased ; to whom is there <lb/>
            injustice done? The argument of Antipater proceeds on the <lb/>
            other side. What do you say ? When you ought to consult <lb/>
            for the good of mankind, and to benefit human society, and <lb/>
            were born under this law, and have these principles from <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XIII.]</note><lb/>
            nature, which you ought to obey and comply with, that your <lb/>
            interest should be the common interest, and reciprocally, the <lb/>
            common interest yours-will you conceal from men what ad- <lb/>
            vantage and plenty is near them? Diogenes will answer <lb/>
            perhaps, in this manner. It is one thing to conceal from <lb/>
            them, another thing to be silent on the subject: " I do not <lb/>
            conceal from you now, if I do not tell you what is the nature <lb/>
            of the gods, or what is the supreme good; things, the know- <lb/>
            ledge of which would be more beneficial to you than the low <lb/>
            price of wheat. But is there any necessity for me to tell you <lb/>
            whatever is beneficial to you to know?" "Yes, indeed," the <lb/>
            other will say, " it is necessary, that is, if you remember that <lb/>
            there is a social tie established between men by nature." <lb/>
            "I remember that," he will answer, "but is that social tie <lb/>
            such that each has nothing of his own ? for if it be so, we <lb/>
            should not even sell anything, but make a present of it."</p>
          <p>XIII. You see, throughout all this disputation, it is not <lb/>
            said, although this act be base, yet since it is profitable, <lb/>
            I will do it; but on the one side it is said it is profitable <lb/>
            in so much as it is not a base act; and on the other side, be- <lb/>
            cause it is base, on this account it should not be done. An <lb/>
            honest man would dispose of a house on account of some <lb/>
            faults which he himself knows, but others are ignorant of; it <lb/>
            is unwholesome, though considered healthy; it is not known <lb/>
            that snakes make their appearance in all the bed-chambers ; <lb/>
            it is built of bad materials, ready to fall; but nobody knows <lb/>
            this except the master. I ask, if the seller should not tell <lb/>
            these things to the buyer, and should sell the house for a <lb/>
            great deal more than he thought he could sell it for, whether <lb/>
            he would have acted unjustly or dishonestly ? He surely <lb/>
            would, says Antipater. For if suffering a purchaser to come <lb/>
            to loss, and to incur the greatest damage by mistake, be not <lb/>
            that which is forbidden at Athens with public execrations, <lb/>
            namely, a not pointing out of the road to one going astray, <lb/>
            what else is ? It is even more than not showing the way; <lb/>
            for it is knowingly leading another astray. Diogenes argues <lb/>
            on the other side. Has he forced you to purchase who <lb/>
            did not even request you to do so ? He advertised for <lb/>
            sale a house that did not please him; you have purchased <lb/>
            one that pleased you. But if they who advertised " a good <lb/>
            and well-built country house," are not thought to have prac- <lb/>
            tised fraud, even though it be neither good nor well-built: <pb n="136"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            much less have they who have not praised their house. For <lb/>
            where there is judgment in the buyer, what fraud can there <lb/>
            be in the seller ? But if it be not necessary to make good <lb/>
            all that is said, do you think it necessary to make good that <lb/>
            which is not said ? For what is more foolish than that the- <lb/>
            seller should relate the defects of that which lie sells ? Or, <lb/>
            what so absurd as that, by the command of the owner, the <lb/>
            auctioneer should thus proclaim: " I am selling an unhealthy <lb/>
            house."</p>
          <p>In some doubtful cases, then, virtue is thus defended on the <lb/>
            one side; on the other side, it is said on the part of expediency, <lb/>
            that it not only is virtuous to do that which seems profitable, <lb/>
            but even disgraceful not to do it. This is that dissension <lb/>
            which seems often to exist between the profitable and the <lb/>
            virtuous. Which matters we must decide. For we have <lb/>
            not proposed them that we might make a question of them, <lb/>
            but that we might explain them. That corn merchant, then, <lb/>
            seems to me to be bound not to practise concealment on <lb/>
            the Rhodians, nor this house-seller on the purchasers. For <lb/>
            it is not practising concealment if you should be silent about <lb/>
            anything; but when for the sake of your own emolument <lb/>
            you wish those, whose interest it is to know that which you <lb/>
            know, to remain in ignorance. Now, as to this sort of con- <lb/>
            cealment, who does not see what kind of thing it is, and what <lb/>
            kind of a man will practise it ? Certainly not an open, not <lb/>
            a single-minded, not an ingenuous, not a just, not a good <lb/>
            man ; but rather a wily, close, artful, deceitful, knavish, crafty, <lb/>
            double-dealing, evasive fellow.* Is it not inexpedient to <note type="footnote"> * On referring to the conclusion of the last chapter, it will be seen that <lb/>
            neither does Diogenes prove, nor does Antipater admit, that by the corn- <lb/>
            merchant's silence any rule of morality is infringed. On what ground and <lb/>
            for what reason was it incumbent on him to disclose the fact which acci- <lb/>
            dentally came to his knowledge, that other cargoes of corn were at sea ? <lb/>
            none is assigned, but that buyers and sellers are bound by the same social <lb/>
            ties. But these do not, as Antipater observes, bind us to communicate to <lb/>
            every body all we know. In withholding this information, which was wholly <lb/>
            extrinsic to his bargain, no confidence was violated. Had he disclosed it, <lb/>
            the price of the commodity in which he dealt would have been materially <lb/>
            reduced. However noble-minded or liberal it might be in him to put the <lb/>
            buyer in possession of all the intelligence on the subject within his power, <lb/>
            no rules of justice were violated by his withholding it. And these are, aa <lb/>
            Adam Smith observes (Theory of Moral Sentiments, iv. 7), " the only rules <lb/>
            which are precise and accurate; those of other virtues are vague and inde- <lb/>
            terminate. The first may be compared to the rules of grammar; the </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP XIV.]</note><lb/>
            expose ourselves to the imputations of so many vices, and <lb/>
            even more ?</p>
          <p>XIV. But if they are to be blamed who have kept silent, <lb/>
            what ought to be thought of those who have practised false- <lb/>
            hood in words ? Caius Canius, a Roman knight, not without <lb/>
            wit, and tolerably learned, when he had betaken himself to <lb/>
            Syracuse, for the sake, as he was himself accustomed to say, <lb/>
            of enjoyment, not of business, gave out that he wished to <lb/>
            purchase some pleasure-grounds, whither he could invite his <lb/>
            friends, and where he could amuse himself without intruders. <lb/>
            When this had got abroad, one Pythius, who practised dis- <lb/>
            counting at Syracuse, told him that he had pleasure-grounds, <lb/>
            not indeed for sale, but that Canius was at liberty to use <lb/>
            them as his own if he desired, and at the same time he in- <lb/>
            vited the gentleman to dinner at the pleasure-grounds on the <lb/>
            following day. When he had promised to go, then Pythius, <lb/>
            who, as a discounter, was well liked among all ranks, called <lb/>
            some fishermen to him, and requested of them that upon the <lb/>
            following day they should fish in front of his grounds, and <lb/>
            told them what he wished them to do. In due time, Canius <lb/>
            came to dinner-the entertainment was sumptuously pro- <lb/>
            vided by Pythius—a crowd of fishing-boats before their eyes. <lb/>
            Each fisherman for himself brought what he had caught; the <lb/>
            fish were laid before the feet of Pythius. Then Canius says, <lb/>
            " What is this, pray, Pythias—so much fish-so many boats ?" <lb/>
            And he answers, " What's the wonder ? Whatever fish there <lb/>
            are at Syracuse are taken at this place ; here is their watering <lb/>
            place; these men could not do without this villa." Canius, <lb/>
            inflamed with desire, presses Pythius to sell. He is unwill- <note type="footnote"> others to the rules which the critics lay down for the attainment of the <lb/>
            sublime, which present us rather with a general idea of the perfection we <lb/>
            ought to aim at, than afford us any certain and infallible directions for <lb/>
            acquiring it." Puffendorf, considering this very question, after deciding <lb/>
            that no rule of justice was infringed by the corn-merchant, absolves him also <lb/>
            from any offence against the laws of benevolence and humanity. In this <lb/>
            opinion his ingenious commentator, Darbcyrac, fully agrees, and cites the <lb/>
            opinion of a strict casuist, La Placette, to the same effect. Had the mer- <lb/>
            chant, on his arrival, found the market forestalled by the importation of <lb/>
            corn from some other quarter, or had he on the voyage lost ship and cargo, <lb/>
            he could not have expected from the Rhodians the reimbursement of his <lb/>
            loss. Why then should he not avail himself of a favourable state of the <lb/>
            market ? All concur, therefore, in deciding that he was not bound in con- <lb/>
            science to a disclosure, "provided merchants do not impose on us, we may. <lb/>
            easily dispense them," says Puffendorf, "from all acts of pure liberality." </note> <pb n="138"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            ing at first; but, to be brief, he obtains his wish. The <lb/>
            man, eager and wealthy, purchases the place at as much <lb/>
            as Pythius demands, and purchases it furnished. He draws <lb/>
            the articles and completes the transaction. Canius on the <lb/>
            following day invites his friends. He comes early himself; <lb/>
            he sees not a boat; he asks of his next neighbour, was it any <lb/>
            holiday with the fishermen, that he saw none of them. "None <lb/>
            that I know," said he : " but none use to fish here, and there- <lb/>
            fore I was amazed at what happened yesterday." Canius got <lb/>
            angry; yet what could he do ? for my colleague and friend <lb/>
            Aquillius had not yet brought out the forms about criminal <lb/>
            devices; in which very forms, when it was inquired of him, <lb/>
            "What is a criminal device?" he answered, "When one <lb/>
            thing is pretended, and another thing done." Very clearly, <lb/>
            indeed, was this laid down ; as by a man skilled in definition. <lb/>
            Therefore, both Pythius, and all those who do one thing, <lb/>
            while feigning another, are perfidious, base, knavish. No <lb/>
            act of theirs, then, can be useful, when it is stained with so <lb/>
            many vices.</p>
          <p>XV. But if the Aquillian definition is true, pretence <lb/>
            and dissimulation ought to be banished from the whole of <lb/>
            life ; so that neither to buy better, nor to sell, will a good <lb/>
            man feign or disguise anything. And this criminal device <lb/>
            was punished both by the statute laws (as in the case of <lb/>
            guardianship by the twelve tables, in that of the defrauding <lb/>
            of minors, by the Plætorian law), and by judicial decisions <lb/>
            without legal enactment, in which is added according to <lb/>
            good faith" (EX FIDE BONA). Moreover, in other judgments, <lb/>
            the following phrases are very excellent: in the arbitration of <lb/>
            a cause matrimonial, the phrase, "MELIUS ÆQUIUS;" in a case <lb/>
            Of trust, the phrase, "UT INTER BONOS BENE AGlER."* What <lb/>
            then ? Can there be any room for fraud either in that <lb/>
            transaction which is decreed to be adjusted " better and <note type="footnote"> * The Prætor had an equitable jurisdiction. It is to his decrees the text <lb/>
            refers ; and as the principal subjects that came before him were bona fide <lb/>
            contracts, not binding in strict law, but in which he decided according to <lb/>
            conscience, and used in these decrees a set form of words, " ex fide bonâ <lb/>
            agatur," the decisions on this and all other cases in equity came to be <lb/>
            called judicia bonæ fidei. Two other set forms are mentioned in the text: <lb/>
            one used in the case of divorce (as well as in all other cases of arbitration), <lb/>
            where arbitrators, decreeing the restoration of the wife's property, employed <lb/>
            the form QUANTUM ÆQUlUS MELIUS. The other formula was usual in cases <lb/>
            of trust; it ran thus,—INTER BONOS BENE AGIER ET SINE FRAUDATIONE. </note> <pb n="139"/>

            fairer ? " Or can any thing be done deceitfully or knavishly, <lb/>
            when it is pronounced that among honest men there must <lb/>
            be fair dealing?" But criminal device, as Aquillius says, <lb/>
            is comprised in pretence ; therefore all deceit should be <lb/>
            excluded from contracts. The seller should not bring <lb/>
            a person to bid over the value, nor the buyer one to <lb/>
            bid under him. Each of the two, if he should come <lb/>
            to name a price, should not name a price more than once. <lb/>
            Quintus Scævola, indeed, the son of Publius, when he re- <lb/>
            quired that a price of a property of which he was about to <lb/>
            become a purchaser should be named to him once for all, <lb/>
            and the seller had done so, said that he valued it at more, <lb/>
            and gave in addition a hundred sestertia. There is no <lb/>
            person who can deny that this was the act of an honest <lb/>
            man ; they deny that it was of a prudent man ; just as it <lb/>
            would be if a man should sell a tiling for less than he could <lb/>
            get. This, then, is the mischief-that persons think some <lb/>
            men honest, others prudent; through which mistake En- <lb/>
            nius remarks, " that the wise man is wise in vain, who <lb/>
            cannot be of use to himself." That indeed is true, if it be <lb/>
            only agreed on between me and Ennius what " to be of use " <lb/>
            means. I see, indeed, Hecaton of Rhodes, the scholar of <lb/>
            Panætius, saying, in those books about duties which he <lb/>
            wrote to Quintus Tubero, " that it was the duty of a wise <lb/>
            man, that doing nothing contrary to manners, laws, and <lb/>
            institutions, he should have regard to improving his pro- <lb/>
            perty; for we do not wish to be rich for ourselves alone, <lb/>
            but for our children, kindred, friends, and especially for our <lb/>
            country; for the means and affluence of each individually <lb/>
            constitute the riches of the state." To this philosopher the <lb/>
            conduct of Scævola, about which I spoke a little while ago, <lb/>
            can by no means be pleasing ; for to him who disavows <lb/>
            that he would do for the sake of his own gain only just sc <lb/>
            much as is not illegal, neither great pains nor thanks are <lb/>
            due. But if pretence and dissimulation are criminal de- <lb/>
            vices, there are few affairs in which that criminal device <lb/>
            may not be employed ; or if a good man is he who serves <lb/>
            whom he can, injures nobody—certainly we do not easily <lb/>
            find such a good man ; to do wrong, then, is never profitable, <lb/>
            because it is always base ; and to be a good man is always <lb/>
            profitable, because it is always virtuous.</p>
          <p>XVI. And with respect to the law of landed estates, is it <pb n="140"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            ordained among us by the civil law, that by selling them, <lb/>
            the faults should be declared which were known to the <lb/>
            seller. For though by the twelve tables it was sufficient to <lb/>
            be answerable for those defects which were expressly men- <lb/>
            tioned, which he who denied suffered a penalty of double the <lb/>
            value, yet a penalty for silence also was established by the <lb/>
            lawyers. For they determined that, if the seller knew what- <lb/>
            ever defect there was in an estate, he ought to make it good, <lb/>
            unless it was expressly mentioned. Thus, when the augurs <lb/>
            were about to officiate on the augurs' hill,* and had com- <lb/>
            manded Titus Claudius Centumalus, who had a house on the <lb/>
            Cælian Mount, to take down those parts of it, the height of <lb/>
            which obstructed their auspices, Claudius set up the house <lb/>
            for sale, and he sold it; Publius Calpurnius Lanarius pur <lb/>
            chased it. That same notice was given to him by the <lb/>
            augurs ; therefore, when Calpurnius had pulled it down, and <lb/>
            had discovered that Claudius had advertised the house after <lb/>
            he had been commanded by the augurs to pull it down, he <lb/>
            brought him before an arbitrator, to decide " what he ought <lb/>
            to give or do for him in good faith." Marcus Cato pro- <lb/>
            nounced the sentence ; the father of this our Cato (for as <lb/>
            other men are to be named from their fathers, so he who <lb/>
            begot that luminary ought to be named from his son). This <lb/>
            judge, then, decreed as follows:—"Since in selling he had <lb/>
            known that matter, and had not mentioned it, that he <lb/>
            ought to make good the loss to the purchaser." There- <lb/>
            fore he established this principle, that it concerned good <lb/>
            faith that a defect which the seller was aware of should be <lb/>
            made known to the purchaser; but if he decided with justice, <lb/>
            then that corn-merchant did not with justice keep silent, <lb/>
            nor that seller of the unhealthy house.† However, all mental <note type="footnote"> * The Capitol inc. </note><note type="footnote"> t A commentator on this passage very justly observes, that the analogy <lb/>
            is by no means perfect between the cases. Claudius withheld from the buyer <lb/>
            information respecting that very house, by which its utility and its value <lb/>
            were materially reduced. In fact the house which he sold was not the <lb/>
            identical house, as he well knew, which in a short period would be standing <lb/>
            on that spot; it must be replaced by a house less lofty, and which would <lb/>
            cost to the buyer no small sum to unruof, reduce, and alter. This informa- <lb/>
            tion related, therefore, to the house itself which he sold and warranted. <lb/>
            Not so with regard to the corn sold at Rhodes ; the quality of the corn was <lb/>
            not there in question ; the intelligence which the merchant withheld did <lb/>
            not relate to that corn, but was completely extrinsic. Though he might be <lb/>
            bound to satisfy the buyer's inquiry by giving a true account of that corn,</note> <pb n="141"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note><lb/>
            reservations of this kind cannot be comprehended in the civil <lb/>
            law ; but those which can are carefully checked. Marcus <lb/>
            Marius Gratidianus, our kinsman, sold to Caius Sergius <lb/>
            Orata that house which he had himself purchased from the <lb/>
            same man a few years before. This house was subject to a <lb/>
            service; * but Marius had not mentioned this in the con- <lb/>
            ditions of conveyance. The matter was brought to trial. <lb/>
            Crassus was counsel for Orata; Antonius defended Gratidi- <lb/>
            anus: Crassus relied on the law—whatever defect a seller <lb/>
            who knows it had not disclosed, it is fit that he should <lb/>
            make good: Antonius relied on the equity-that since <lb/>
            that defect could not have been unknown to Sergius, who <lb/>
            had formerly sold the house, there was no necessity that it <lb/>
            should be disclosed; neither could he be deceived, who was <lb/>
            aware under what liability that which he had bought was <lb/>
            placed. To what purpose these accounts ? That you may <lb/>
            understand this, that cunning men were not approved by our <lb/>
            ancestors.</p>
          <p>XVII. But the laws abolish frauds in one way, philoso- <lb/>
            phers in another: the laws, as far as they can lay hold of them <lb/>
            by their arm ;† philosophers, as far as they can check them <lb/>
            by reason and wisdom. Reason, then, requires that nothing <lb/>
            be done insidiously, nothing dissemblingly, nothing falsely. <lb/>
            Is it not then an ensnaring to lay a net, even though you <lb/>
            should not beat up the game, nor hunt them to it? For the <lb/>
            wild creatures often fall into it of themselves, no one pur- <lb/>
            suing them. So is it fit you should set up your house for <lb/>
            sale, put up a bill like a net, sell the house because of its <lb/>
            defects, and that somebody should rush into it unwittingly ? <lb/>
            Though I see that this, on account of the corruption of man- <lb/>

            then the comparison would have been more just with a house, which as the <lb/>

            by statutable enactments or by civil law ; yet it is forbidden <lb/>
            by the law of nature. For there is the social tie between man <lb/>
            and man which is of the widest extent, which, though I have <lb/>
            often mentioned it, yet needs to be mentioned oftener. <lb/>
            There is a closer tie between those who are of the same nation ; <lb/>
            a closer still between those who are of the same state. Our <lb/>
            ancestors, therefore, were of opinion that the law of nations <lb/>
            was one thing, the municipal law a different thing. What- <lb/>
            ever is civil law, the same is not, for that reason, necessarily <lb/>
            the law of nations; but whatever is the law of nations, the <lb/>
            the same ought to be civil law. But we possess no solid and <lb/>
            express image of true right and its sister justice: we use <lb/>
            merely their shade and faint resemblances. Would that we <lb/>
            followed even these, for they are taken from the best pat- <lb/>
            terns of nature and truth! For how admirable are those <lb/>
            words, " that I be not ensnared and defrauded on account of <lb/>
            you and your honesty." What golden words those—" that <lb/>
            among honest men there be fair dealing, and without fraud." <lb/>
            But who are honest men, and what is fair dealing, is the great <lb/>
            question. Quintus Scævola, indeed, the high priest, used to <lb/>
            say, that there was the greatest weight in all those decisions <lb/>
            in which was added the form " of good faith;" and he <lb/>
            thought the jurisdiction of good faith extended very widely, <lb/>
            and that it was concerned in wardships, societies, trusts, <lb/>
            commissions, buyings, sellings, hirings, lettings, in which <lb/>
            the intercourse of life is comprised ; that in these it is the <lb/>
            part of a great judge to determine (especially since there <lb/>
            were contrary decisions in most cases) what each ought to <lb/>
            be accountable for to each. Wherefore craftiness ought to <lb/>
            be put away, and that knavery which would fain seem, <lb/>
            indeed, to be prudence, but which is far from it, and differs <lb/>
            most widely.* For prudence consists in the distinguishing of <note type="footnote"> * Addison carries out this distinction far more elaborately. "At the <lb/>
            same time," he says, that I think discretion the most useful talent a man <lb/>
            can be master of, I look upon cunning to be the accomplishment of little, <lb/>
            mean, ungenerous minds. Discretion points out. the noblest ends to us, and <lb/>
            pursues the most proper and laudable methods of attaining them. Cunning <lb/>
            has only private, selfish aims, and sticks at nothing which may make them <lb/>
            succeed. Discretion has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed <lb/>
            eye, commands a whole horizon. Cunning is a kind of short-sightedness <lb/>
            that discovers the minutest objects which are near at hand, but is not able <lb/>
            to discern things at a distance. Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives <lb/>
            a greater authority to the person who possesses it. Cunning, when it is </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="143"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note><lb/>
            good and evil-knavery, if all things that are vicious are <lb/>
            evil, prefers evil to good.</p>
          <p>Nor is it, indeed, in landed property alone that the civil <lb/>
            law deduced from nature punishes knavery and fraud, but <lb/>
            also in the sale of slaves, all fraud of the seller is prevented. <lb/>
            For he who ought to be aware of the health, the running <lb/>
            away, the thefts of slaves, is accountable by the edict of <lb/>
            the Ædiles ; but the case of heirs is different.* From <lb/>
            which it will be understood, since nature is the fountain of <lb/>
            right, that it is according to nature that no one should act <lb/>
            in such a manner, that he should prey on the ignorance of <lb/>
            another.t Nor can there be found in life any greater curse <lb/>
            than the pretence of wisdom in knavery; from which those <note type="footnote"> once detected, loses its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about <lb/>
            even those events which he might have done, had he passed only for a plain <lb/>
            man. Discretion is the perfection of reason, and a guide to us in all the <lb/>
            duties of life; cunning is a kind of instinct that only looks out after our <lb/>
            immediate interest and welfare. Discretion is only found iu men of strong <lb/>
            sense and good understanding; cunning is often to be met with in brutes <lb/>
            themselves, and in persons who are but the fewest removes from them. In <lb/>
            short, cunning is only the mimic of discretion, and may pass upon mean <lb/>
            men in the same manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and gravity <lb/>
            for wisdom."—Spectator, No. 225. </note><note type="footnote"> * Because an heir, having only just come into possession of the property, <lb/>
            consisting of slaves, might fairly be considered ignorant of their evil qualities. </note><note type="footnote"> t We have here a singular proof of the facility with which men, even <lb/>
            when analysing the nicest moral obligations, may be insensible to the <lb/>
            grossest violations of moral fitness involved in the social institutions amidst <lb/>
            which they have been educated. In connection with this nice casuistry <lb/>
            touching the sale of a slave, it is curious to peruse the following description <lb/>
            of the state of things which existed at the very time when Cicero penned <lb/>
            his treatise. </note><note type="footnote"> " The custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves in an island of the <lb/>
            Tyber, there to starve, seems to have been pretty common in Rome ; and <lb/>
            whoever recovered, after having been so exposed, had his liberty given him <lb/>
            by an edict of the Emperor Claudius ; in which it was likewise forbidden <lb/>
            to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness. But supposing that this <lb/>
            edict was strictly obeyed, would it better the domestic treatment of slaves, <lb/>
            or render their lives much more comfortable ? We may imagine what <lb/>
            others would practise, when it was the professed maxim of the elder Cato <lb/>
            to sell his superannuated slaves for any price, rather than maintain what be <lb/>
            esteemed a useless burden. </note><note type="footnote"> " The ergastula, or dungeons where slaves in chains were forced to work, <lb/>
            were very common all over Italy. Columella advises that they be always <lb/>

            call over every day the names of these slaves, like the mustering of a regi- <lb/>

            innumerable cases proceed, where the useful seems to bo <lb/>
            opposed to the virtuous. For how few will be found who, <lb/>
            when promised perfect secrecy and impunity, can abstain <lb/>
            from injustice ?</p>
          <p>XVIII. Let us test the principle, if you please, in those ex- <lb/>
            amples in which, indeed, the mass of mankind do not think per- <lb/>
            haps that there is any crime. For it is not necessary in this <lb/>
            place to treat of assassins, poisoners, will-forgers, robbers, <lb/>
            embezzlers, who are to be kept down, not by means of words <lb/>
            and the disputation of philosophers, but by chains and a <lb/>
            dungeon. But let us consider these acts, which they who <lb/>
            are esteemed honest men commit. Some persons brought <lb/>
            from Greece to Rome a forged will of Lucius Minucius <lb/>
            Basilus, a rich man. That they might the more easily obtain <lb/>
            their object, they put down as legatees along with themselves, <lb/>
            Marcus Crassus and Quintus Hortensius, the most powerful <lb/>
            men of that day ; who, though they suspected that it was a <lb/>
            forgery, but were conscious of no crime in themselves, did <lb/>
            not reject the paltry gift of other men's villainy. What <lb/>
            then ? Was this enough, that they should not be thought to <lb/>
            have been culpable ? To me, indeed, it seems otherwise; <note type="footnote"> deserted ;—a proof of the frequency of these ergastula and of the great <lb/>
            number of slaves usually confined in them. </note><note type="footnote"> " A chained slave for a porter was usual in Rome, as appears from Ovid <lb/>
            and other authors. Had not these people shaken off all sense of com- <lb/>
            passion towards that unhappy part of their species, would they have <lb/>
            presented their friends, at the first entrance, with such an image of the <lb/>
            severity of the master and misery of the slave ? Nothing so common in <lb/>
            all trials, even of civil causes, as to call for the evidence of slaves ; which <lb/>
            was always extorted by the most exquisite torments. Demosthenes says, <lb/>

            that Marcus Satrius, his sister's son, should bear his name, <lb/>
            and had made him his heir, (I am speaking of him who was <lb/>
            patron of the Picene and Sabine districts ; oh ! foul stigma <lb/>
            upon those times !*) was it fair that these noble citizens <lb/>
            should have the property, and that nothing but the name <lb/>
            should come down to Satrius ? For if he who does not keep off <lb/>
            an injury, nor repel it if he can from another, acts unjustly, as <lb/>
            I asserted in the first book, what is to be thought of him who <lb/>
            not only does not repel, but even assists in the injury ? To <lb/>
            me, indeed, even true legacies do not seem honourable, if <lb/>
            they arc acquired by deceitful fawning-not by the reality, <lb/>
            but by the semblance of kind offices. But in such matters <lb/>
            the profitable is sometimes accustomed to be thought one <lb/>
            thing, and the honest another thing. Falsely ; for the rule <lb/>
            about profit is the same as that which obtains respecting <lb/>
            honesty. To him who will not thoroughly perceive this, <lb/>
            no fraud, no villainy will be wanting ; for, considering thus, <lb/>
            " that, indeed, is honest, but this is expedient," he will dare <lb/>
            erroneously to separate things united by nature—which is <lb/>
            the fountain of all frauds, malpractices, and crimes.</p>
          <p>XIX. If a good man, then, should have this power, that <lb/>
            by snapping his fingers his name could creep by stealth into <lb/>
            the wills of the wealthy, he would not use this power, not <lb/>
            even if he had it for certain that no one at all would ever <lb/>
            suspect it. But should you give this power to Marcus <lb/>
            Crassus, that by the snapping of his fingers he could be in- <lb/>
            scribed heir, when he really was not heir ; believe me, he <lb/>
            would have danced in the forum. But the just man, and he <lb/>
            whom we deem a good man, would take nothing from any <lb/>
            man in order to transfer it wrongfully to himself. Let him <lb/>
            who is surprised at this confess that he is ignorant of what <lb/>
            constitutes a good man. But if any one would be willing to <lb/>

            stain upon the times that a friend of Cæsar should he chosen as patron, <lb/>
            especially since, as he insinuates in the 2nd Phillippic, it was through fear, <lb/>

            one; convince himself that a good man is he who serves <lb/>
            whom he can, and injures none except when provoked by <lb/>
            injury. What then ? Does he hurt none, who, as if by <lb/>
            some enchantment, accomplishes the exclusion of the true <lb/>
            heirs, and the substitution of himself in their place ? Should <lb/>
            he not do, then, somebody will say, what is useful, what is <lb/>
            expedient ? Yes, but he should understand that nothing is <lb/>
            either expedient or useful which is unjust. He who has <lb/>
            not learned this, cannot be a good man.</p>
          <p>When a boy, I learned from my father that Fimbria, the <lb/>
            consular,* was judge in the case of Marcus Lutatius Pinthia. <lb/>
            Roman knight, a truly honest man, when he had given <lb/>
            security, t (which he was to forfeit) " unless he was a <lb/>
            good man ;" and that Fimbria thereupon told him that he <lb/>
            never would decide that matter, lest he should either de- <lb/>
            prive a worthy man of his character, if he decided against <lb/>
            him, or should be seen to have established that any one <lb/>
            was a good man, when this matter was comprised in in- <lb/>
            numerable duties and praiseworthy actions. To this good <lb/>
            man, then, whom even Fimbria, not Socrates alone had <lb/>
            known, anything which is not morally right can by no <lb/>
            means seem to be expedient. Such a man, then, not only <lb/>
            will not venture to do, but not even to think, what he would <lb/>
            not venture openly to proclaim. Is it not disgraceful that <lb/>
            philosophers should hesitate about this, which not even <lb/>
            rustics doubt-from whom is derived this proverb, which has <note type="footnote"> have imbibed a persuasion, not merely that ideas are innate, but that they <lb/>
            were acquired during a pre-existent state of the mind or soul. " Habet <lb/>

            now become trite through antiquity ; for when they commend <lb/>
            the integrity and worthiness of any person, they say " he is <lb/>
            one with whom you might play odd and even in the dark."* <lb/>
            What meaning has this proverb but this, that nothing is ex- <lb/>
            pedient which is not morally right, even though you could <lb/>
            obtain it without any body proving you guilty. Do you not <lb/>
            see that, according to that proverb, no excuse can be offered <lb/>
            either to the aforesaid Gyges, nor to this man whom I have <lb/>
            just now supposed able to sweep to himself the inheritances <lb/>
            of all by a snap of the fingers ? For as, how much soever <lb/>
            that which is base may be concealed, yet it can by no means <lb/>
            become morally right (honestum), so it cannot be made out <lb/>
            that whatever is morally wrong can be expedient, since <lb/>
            nature is adverse and repugnant.</p>
          <p>XX. But when the prizes are very great, there is a tempta- <lb/>
            tion to do wrong. When Caius Marius was far from the hope <lb/>
            of the consulship, and was now in the seventh year of his <lb/>
            torpor, after obtaining the prætorship, and did not seem likely <lb/>
            ever to stand for the consulship, he accused Quintus Metellus, <lb/>
            a very eminent man and citizen, whose lieutenant he was, be- <lb/>
            fore the Roman people of a charge that he was protracting the <lb/>
            war, when he had been sent to Rome by him—his own com- <lb/>
            mander;—stating that if they would make himself consul, that <lb/>
            he would in a short time deliver Jugurtha, either alive or dead, <lb/>
            into the power of the Roman people. Upon this he was indeed <lb/>
            made consul, but he deviated from good faith and justice, since, <lb/>
            by a false charge, he brought obloquy upon a most excellent <lb/>
            and respectable citizen, whose lieutenant he was, and by whom <lb/>
            he had been sent. Even my relative Gratidianus did not <lb/>
            discharge the duty of a good man at the time when he was <lb/>
            prætor, and the tribunes of the people had called in the <lb/>
            college of the prætors, in order that the matter of the coinage <lb/>
            might be settled by a joint resolution. For at that period <lb/>
            the coinage was in a state of uncertainty, so that no man <lb/>
            could know how much he was worth. They drew up in <lb/>
            common an edict, with a fine and conviction annexed, and <lb/>
            agreed that they should all go up together to the rostra, in <note type="footnote"> * This play, retained among modern Italians under the name of La <lb/>
            Mora, is thus played :-A and B are the players ; A suddenly raises, we <lb/>

            B, having named the number, wins. Parties, to play it in the dark, must <lb/>
            have reliance on each other's word ; hence the proverb. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>

            the afternoon. And while the rest of them, indeed, went off <lb/>
            each a different way, Marius, from the judgment seats, went <lb/>
            straight to the rostra, and singly published that which had <lb/>
            been arranged in common. And this proceeding, if you <lb/>
            inquire into the result, brought him great honour. In every <lb/>
            street statues of him were erected, and at these incense and <lb/>
            tapers were burned. What need of many words ? No man ever <lb/>
            became a greater favourite with the multitude. These are the <lb/>
            things which sometimes perplex our deliberations, when that <lb/>
            in which equity is violated seems not a very great crime, but <lb/>
            that which is procured by it appears a very great advan- <lb/>
            tage. Thus to Alarms it seemed not a very base act to snatch <lb/>
            away the popular favour from his colleagues and the tribunes <lb/>
            of the people, but it appeared a very expedient thing by <lb/>
            means of that act to become consul, which at that time lie <lb/>
            had proposed to himself. But there is for all, the one rule <lb/>
            which I wish to be thoroughly known to you ; either let not <lb/>
            that which seems expedient be base, or if it be base let it not <lb/>
            seem expedient. What then? Can we judge either the <lb/>
            former Marius or the latter,* a good man ? Unfold and <lb/>
            examine your understanding, that you may see what in it is <lb/>
            the idea, form, and notion of a good man. Does it then fall <lb/>
            under the notion of a good man to lie for the sake of his <lb/>
            own advantage, to make false charges, to overreach, to <lb/>
            deceive ? Nothing, indeed, less so. Is there, then, anything <lb/>
            of such value, or any advantage so desirable, that for it you <lb/>
            would forfeit the splendour and name of a good man ? What <lb/>
            is there which that expediency, as it is called, can bring, so <lb/>
            valuable as that which it takes away, if it deprive you of the <lb/>
            name of a good man, if it rob you of your integrity and <lb/>
            justice ? Now, what difference does it make, whether from <lb/>
            a man one transform himself into a beast, or under the form <lb/>
            of a man, bear the savage nature of a beast ?</p>
          <p>XXI. What ? Are not they who disregard all things up- <lb/>
            Tight and virtuous, provided they can attain power, doing <lb/>
            the same as het who was willing to have even for his father- <lb/>

            come as powerful ? It seemed expedient to him to become as <lb/>
            powerful as possible by the unpopularity of the other. He <lb/>
            did not see how unjust that was towards his country, and <lb/>
            how base and how useless. But the father-in-law himself <lb/>
            always had in his mouth the Greek verses from the Phœ- <lb/>
            nissæ,* which I will translate as well as I can-inelegantly, <lb/>
            perhaps, yet so that the meaning can be understood :—" For <lb/>
            if justice ought ever to be violated, it is to be violated for <lb/>
            the sake of ruling; in other cases cherish the love of <lb/>
            country."</p>
          <p>Eteocles, or rather Euripides, deserved death for making <lb/>
            an exception of that one crime, which is the most accursed <lb/>
            of all. Why, then, do we repress petty villainies, or frau- <lb/>
            dulent inheritances, trades, and sales ? Here is a man <lb/>
            for you, who aspired to be king of the Roman people, and <lb/>
            master of all nations, and accomplished it—if any one says <lb/>
            this desire is an honest one, he is a madman. t For he ap- <lb/>
            proves of the murder of our laws and liberty; the foul and <lb/>
            abominable oppression of these he thinks glorious. But by <lb/>
            what reproof, or rather by what reproach, should I attempt <lb/>
            to tear away from so great an error the man who admits <note type="footnote"> bring a share of the suspicion under which himself laboured upon his rival, <lb/>

            almost shrink the very moment after from the contemplation of honour so <lb/>
            hopeless, and wish that the vengeance were less severe, 'Think not,' says <lb/>
            Cicero,' that guilt requires the burning torches of the Furies to agitate and <lb/>
            torment it. Their own frauds, their crimes, their remembrances of the <lb/>
            past, their terrors of the future, those are the domestic Furies that are ever <lb/>
            present to the mind of the impious.' "--Dr. Brown's " Moral Philosophy," <lb/>

            marl to have upon his soul ? Moreover, could his life be a <lb/>
            beneficial one to himself, when the condition of that life was <lb/>
            this, that he who deprived him of it would be held in the <lb/>
            highest esteem and glory ? But if these things be not use- <lb/>
            ful, which seem so in the highest degree, because they are <lb/>
            full of disgrace and turpitude, we ought to be quite convinced <lb/>
            that there is nothing expedient which is not virtuous.</p>
          <p>XXII. But this indeed was decided, as well on other oc- <lb/>
            casions frequently, as by Caius Fabricius, in his second con- <lb/>
            sulship, and by our senate in the war with Pyrrhus. For <lb/>
            when king Pyrrhus had made aggressive war upon the <lb/>
            Roman people, and when the contest was maintained for <lb/>
            empire with a generous and potent monarch, a deserter from <lb/>
            him came into the camp of Fabricius, and promised him, if he <lb/>
            would propose a reward for him, that as he had come secretly, <lb/>
            so he would return secretly into the camp of Pyrrhus, and <lb/>
            despatch him with poison. Fabricius took care that this <lb/>
            man should be sent back in custody to Pyrrhus, and this <lb/>
            conduct of his was applauded by the senate. And yet if <lb/>
            we pursue the appearance and notion of advantage, one <lb/>
            deserter would have rid us of that great war, and of that <lb/>
            formidable adversary; but it would have been a great dis- <lb/>
            grace and scandal, that he, with whom the contest was for <lb/>
            glory, had been conquered, not by valour, but by villainy. <lb/>
            Whether was it then more expedient, for Fabricius, <lb/>
            who was such a person in our state as Aristides was at <lb/>
            Athens, or for our senate, which never separated expedi- <lb/>
            ency from dignity, to fight against an enemy with arms <lb/>
            or with poison? If empire is to be sought for the sake <lb/>
            of glory, away with guilt, in which there cannot be glory; <lb/>
            but if power itself is to be sought by any means what- <lb/>
            ever, it cannot be expedient when allied to infamy. That <lb/>
            proposition, therefore, of Lucius Philippus, the son of Quintus, <lb/>
            was not expedient, that those states, which, by a decree of <lb/>
            the senate, Lucius Sylla, on receiving a sum of money, had <lb/>
            made free, should again be subject to tribute, and that we <lb/>
            should not return the money which they had given for their <lb/>
            freedom. To this the senate agreed. Disgrace to the em- <lb/>
            pire ! For the faith of pirates is better than was the se <lb/>
            nate's. But our revenues have been increased by it-therefore <lb/>
            it was expedient. How long will people venture to say that <pb n="152"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            anything is expedient which is not virtuous ? Now, can <lb/>
            odium and infamy be useful to any empire which ought to <lb/>
            be supported by glory and the good will of its allies ? I <lb/>
            often disagreed in opinion even with my friend Cato. For <lb/>
            he seemed to me too rigidly to defend the treasury and <lb/>
            tributes; to deny all concessions to the farmers of the revenue; <lb/>
            and many to our allies, when we ought to have been munificent <lb/>
            towards the latter, and to have treated the former as we <lb/>
            were accustomed to do our colonists, and so much the more, <lb/>
            because such a harmony between the orders* conduced to <lb/>
            the safety of the republic. Curio was also in error when he <lb/>
            admitted that the cause of the Transpadani was just, but <lb/>
            always added, " let expediency prevail." He should rather <lb/>
            have said that it was not just, because not expedient for the <lb/>
            republic, than to say it was not expedient, when he confessed <lb/>
            that it was just.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The 6th book of Hecaton, "De Officiis," is full <lb/>
            of such questions -whether it be the part of a good man, <lb/>
            in an exceedingly great scarcity of provisions, not to feed his <lb/>
            slaves; he argues on either side, but still in the end he <lb/>
            guides our duty rather by utility than humanity. He <lb/>
            inquires, if goods must needs be thrown into the sea in a <lb/>
            storm, whether ought one to throw overboard a valuable horse <lb/>
            or a worthless slave. Here pecuniary interest would incline us <lb/>
            one way, humanity another. If a fool should snatch a plank <lb/>
            from a wreck, shall a wise man wrest it from him if he is <lb/>
            able? He says no, because it is an injustice. What will the <lb/>
            master of the ship do ? Will he seize the plank as his own ? <lb/>
            By no means-no more than he would be willing to toss into <lb/>
            the sea one sailing in his ship, because it is his own. For <lb/>
            until they are come to the place to which the vessel was <lb/>
            chartered, the vessel is not the property of the master, but <lb/>
            of the passengers. What, if there be only one plank, two <lb/>
            shipwrecked men, and both wise ? Should neither seize it, or <lb/>
            one yield to the other ? One, indeed, should yield to the <lb/>
            other, namely, to him whose life was of more consequence, <note type="footnote"> * The equestrian order, who were the farmers of the revenue, and the <lb/>
            senators, who exacted too rigidly the full amount of the contracts, notwith- <lb/>
            standing any event that might render the taxes less valuable to the farmers. <lb/>
            This disgusted the knights with the senate, and threw them into the arms of <lb/>
            Caesar, who procured for them a remission of part of their liabilities. </note> <pb n="153"/>

            either for his own sake or that of the commonwealth. But <lb/>
            if these considerations be equal in both cases? Ihere will <lb/>
            be no dispute; but one, conquered, as it were, by lot, or by <lb/>
            playing at odd or even, should yield to the other. What, <lb/>
            if a father should rob temples, or carry a subterraneous <lb/>
            passage into the treasury; should his son inform of it to the <lb/>
            magistrates ? To do that indeed would be impiety. Nay, <lb/>
            he ought even to defend his father if he were accused or <lb/>
            it.- Is not our country then paramount to all duties ? Yes, <note type="footnote"> * The most noted opponent of this crude and indefensible dogma, <lb/>
            which would set up a claim on the score of personal relationship paramount <lb/>
            to all the claims of justice, has been answered, as we have aleadyseen, by <lb/>
            two ethical philosophers of no mean reputation, Jonathan Edwards in his <lb/>
            "Essay on the Nature of True Virtue," and William Godwin, in his Inquiry <lb/>
            concerning Political Justice." It is the latter who has carried these princi- <lb/>
            ples to the greatest extent. Indeed, he appears so far to equalize the rela- <lb/>
            tiveobligations of mankind as to make gratitude an injustice, and to destroy <lb/>
            all peculiarity of claims arising from the closest relationship. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, it is safe to affirm that he has not erred so widely on the one side, <lb/>
            as Cicero in the above sentence has erred on the other. The following pas- <lb/>
            sage contains the strongest statement of Godwin's views on this point. </note><note type="footnote"> " What magic is there in the pronoun 'my that should justify us in <lb/>
            overturning the decisions of impartial truth ? My brother, or my father, <lb/>
            may be a fool, or a profligate, malicious, lying or dishonest. If they be, of <lb/>
            what consequence is it that they are mine ? ' But through my father I am, <lb/>
            indebted for existence, he supported me in the helplessness of infancy.' <lb/>
            When he first subjected himself to the necessity of these cares, he was pro- <lb/>
            bably influenced by no particular motives of benevolence to his future off- <lb/>
            sprint Every voluntary benefit, however, entitles the bestower to some <lb/>
            kindness and retribution. Why? because a voluntary benefit is an evidence <lb/>
            of benevolent intention, that is, in a certain degree of virtue. It is thedis- <lb/>
            position of the mind, not the external action separately taken, that entitles <lb/>
            to respect. But the merit of this disposition is equal, whether the benefit <lb/>
            be bestowed upon me or upon another. I and another mail cannot be <lb/>
            right in preferring our respective benefactors, for my benefactor cannot be <lb/>
            at the same time both better and worse than his neighbour. My benefactor <lb/>
            ought to be esteemed, not because he bestowed a benefit upon me, but be- <lb/>
            cause he bestowed it upon a human being. His desert will be in exact pro- <lb/>

            indeed, but it is advantageous to our country itself to have its <lb/>
            citizens affectionate towards their parents. What, if a father <lb/>
            should endeavour to usurp tyrannic power, or to betray his <lb/>
            country ? Shall the son be silent ? Nay, but he should im- <lb/>
            plore his father not to do it. If he prevail not, he should <lb/>
            reproach—he should even threaten. If at last the matter <lb/>
            should tend to the ruin of his country, he should prefer the <lb/>
            safety of his country to that of his father.</p>
          <p>He also asks, if a wise man should receive base money <lb/>
            unawares for good, shall he, when he will have come to know <lb/>
            it, pay it instead of good, if he owes money to any person ? <lb/>
            Diogenes affirms this ; Antipater denies it-and with him I <lb/>
            rather agree. Ought he who knowingly sells wine that will <lb/>
            not keep, to acquaint the buyer ? Diogenes thinks it unne- <lb/>
            cessary; Antipater thinks it the characteristic of an honest man. <lb/>
            These are, as it were, the controverted laws of the Stoics. In <lb/>
            selling a slave, are his faults to be told-not those which, <lb/>
            unless you tell, the slave would be returned by the civil <lb/>
            Jaw; but these, that he is a liar, a gambler, a pilferer, a <lb/>
            drunkard ? These things to the one seem necessary to be told ; <lb/>
            to the other not. If any person selling gold should suppose <lb/>
            he was selling brass, should an honest man acquaint him <lb/>
            that it was gold, or should he buy for a denarius what was <lb/>
            worth a thousand denarii ? It is plain now, both what is my <lb/>
            view, and what is the controversy between those philoso- <lb/>
            pliers whom I have mentioned.</p>

            worth of different men, I shall inevitably judge most favourably of him of <lb/>

            shall be compelled to prefer the man of moral worth whom I know, to <lb/>
            another who may possess, unknown to me, an essential superiority.' </note><note type="footnote"> " This compulsion, however, is founded in the imperfection of human <lb/>
            nature. It may serve as an apology for my error, but can never change <lb/>
            error into truth. It will always remain contrary to the strict and universal <lb/>
            decisions of justice. The difficulty of conceiving this, is owing merely to <lb/>
            our confounding the disposition from which an action is chosen, with the <lb/>
            action itself. The disposition, that would prefer virtue to vice, and a greater <lb/>
            degree of virtue to a less, is undoubtedly a subject of approbation ; the erro- <lb/>
            neous exercise of this disposition, by which a wrong object is selected, if <lb/>
            unavoidable, is to be deplored, but can by no colouring, and under no de- <lb/>

            which arc made neither by means of force, nor with crimi- <lb/>
            nal intent (as the prætors are accustomed to say) ? If any <lb/>
            one should give some person a cure for the dropsy, and <lb/>
            should covenant with him that he should never afterwards <lb/>
            use that cure-if by that cure he became well, and in some <lb/>
            years afterwards fell into the same disease, and could not <lb/>
            obtain from him with whom he had covenanted, leave to <lb/>
            use it again-what ought to be done ? Since he is an in- <lb/>
            human fellow, who would not give him leave, and no in- <lb/>
            jury would be done to that person by using it, he ought to <lb/>
            consult for his life and health. What! If a wise man, being <lb/>
            required, by one who would make him his heir, when he <lb/>
            would be left by him a large fortune in his will, that be- <lb/>
            fore he entered upon the inheritance he should dance openly <lb/>
            by daylight in the forum — should promise him that he <lb/>
            would do it, because otherwise he would not have made <lb/>
            him his heir; should he do what he promised, or not ? I <lb/>
            would wish that he had not promised, and I think that <lb/>
            this would have been the part suitable to his dignity. Since <lb/>
            he has promised, if he considers it disgraceful to dance in <lb/>
            the forum, he will with greater propriety break his word, <note type="footnote">promise to commit a wicked act, even to assassination; but a man is not <lb/>
            required to commit murder because he has promised to commit it. Thus, <lb/>
            in the Christian scriptures, the son who has said, "I will not work" in the <lb/>
            vineyard, and afterwards repented and went," is spoken of with approba- <lb/>
            tion, his promise was not binding, because fulfilment would have been <lb/>
            wrong. Cranmer, whose religious firmness was overcome in the prospect of <lb/>
            the stake, recanted ; that is, he promised to abandon the protestant faith. <lb/>
            Neither was his promise binding; to have regarded it would have been a <lb/>
            crime. The offence both of Cranmer and of the son in the parable, con- <lb/>
            sisted not in violating their promises but in making them. Respecting the <lb/>
            often discussed question, whether extorted promises are binding, there has <lb/>
            been, I suspect, a general want of advertence to one important point-what <lb/>
            is an extorted promise ? If by an extorted promise is meant a promise <lb/>
            that is made involuntarily, without the concurrence of the will; if it is the <lb/>
            effect of any ungovernable impulse, and made without the consciousness of <lb/>
            the party, then it is not a promise. This may happen. Fear or agitation <lb/>
            may be so great that a person really does not know what he eays or does, <lb/>
            and in such a case a man's promises do not bind him any more than the <lb/>
            promises of a man in a fit of insanity. But if by an "extorted" promise it <lb/>
            is only meant that very powerful inducements were held out to making it, <lb/>
            inducements, however, which did not take away the power of choice—then <lb/>
            these promises are in strictness voluntary, and like all other voluntary en- <lb/>
            gagements they ought to be fulfilled.—Dymond's "Principles of Morality v <lb/>
            chap. 6. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            provided he should not take anything out of the inheritance, <lb/>
            than if he did so ; unless, perhaps, he will contribute that <lb/>
            money to some great occasion of the state-so that it would <lb/>
            not be disgraceful even to dance, since he was about to con- <lb/>
            sult for the interests of his country.*</p>
          <p>XXV. But even those promises ought not to be kept, <lb/>
            which are hurtful to those very persons to whom you have <lb/>
            made them.</p>
          <p>To revert to fictitious tales, Sol promised to Phaeton, <lb/>
            his son, to do whatever he would desire. He desired to be <lb/>
            taken up in his father's chariot. He was taken up. But <lb/>
            before he was well settled, he was burned with the stroke of <lb/>
            lightning. How much better would it have been in this <lb/>
            case, that the promise of the father had not been kept ? Why <lb/>
            should I mention the promise which Theseus exacted from <lb/>
            Neptune, to whom when Neptune gave three wishes, he <lb/>
            wished for the death of his son Hippolytus, when he was <lb/>
            suspected by his father concerning his step-mother; by ob- <lb/>
            taining which promise, Theseus was involved in the greatest <lb/>
            affliction ? Why, that Agamemnon, when he had vowed to <lb/>
            Diana the loveliest thing that should be born that year in his <lb/>
            kingdom, sacrificed Iphigenia, than whom, indeed, .nothing <lb/>
            lovelier was born that year? Better that the promise should not <lb/>
            be performed, than that a horrible crime should be committed. <lb/>
            Therefore, promises are sometimes not to be performed, and <lb/>
            deposits are not always to be restored. If any man in sound <lb/>
            mind should have entrusted a sword to you, and having gone <lb/>
            mad, should ask it back, to restore would be a crime; not to <lb/>
            restore, a duty. What, if he who may have deposited money <lb/>
            with you, should levy war against his country, ought you <lb/>
            to restore the deposit ? I think not. For you would be acting <lb/>
            against your country, which ought to be most dear to you. <lb/>
            So, many things which are right by nature become wrong <note type="footnote"> * The following is Cockman's note upon this passage: " Dancing was <lb/>
            esteemed but a scandalous practice, and unbecoming a sober and prudent <lb/>
            person among the Romans; wherefore our author tells us in his oration for <lb/>
            Murena (chap. 6), nobody almost dances, unless he be drunk or mad, and <lb/>
            calls it omnium vitiorum extremum, a vice that no one would be guilty of <lb/>
            till he had utterly abandoned all virtue ; and umbram luxuriæ, that which <lb/>
            follows riot and debauchery, as the shadow follows the body. The mean- <lb/>

            by occasions. To perform promises, to stand to agreements, <lb/>
            to restore deposits, the expediency being altered, become <lb/>
            contrary to virtue.</p>
          <p>Now, indeed, of those things which seem to be profitable, <lb/>
            contrary to justice, but with the semblance of prudence, I <lb/>
            think enough has been said. But since in the first book we <lb/>
            derived duties from the four sources of virtue, we shall be <lb/>
            engaged with those same, while we show that those things <lb/>
            which seem to be useful are not so as long as they are hostile <lb/>
            to virtue. And indeed of prudence, which craft is apt to <lb/>
            imitate, and likewise of justice, which is always expedient, <lb/>
            we have already treated. Two parts of virtue remain, of <lb/>
            which the one is discerned in the greatness and pre-eminence <lb/>
            of an elevated mind; the other in the habit and regulation <lb/>
            of continence and temperance.</p>
          <p>XXVI. It seemed to Ulysses to be expedient (to act), as <lb/>
            the tragic poets, indeed, have represented-for in Homer, the <lb/>
            best authority, there is no such suspicion of Ulysses—but the <lb/>
            tragedians accused him of wishing to escape from military <lb/>
            service by the affectation of insanity. A dishonourable de- <lb/>
            vice. But it was advantageous, some persons, perhaps, will <lb/>
            say, to reign and live at ease in Ithaci, with his parents, <lb/>
            with his wife, with his son. They may ask, do you think <lb/>
            any glory arising from daily toils and perils to be compared <lb/>
            with this tranquillity ? I think, indeed, this tranquillity is to <lb/>
            be despised and rejected, because I think tranquillity which <lb/>
            was not honourable, was not even advantageous. For what <lb/>
            reproach do you think Ulysses would have heard if he had <lb/>
            persevered in that dissembling, when though he performed <lb/>
            the greatest achievements in the war, he yet heard this from <lb/>
            Ajax ?—</p>
          <p>" Of the oath, of which he was the originator, as you all' <lb/>
            know, he alone disregarded the obligation. Madness he <lb/>
            feigned ; persisted in not joining the army ; and had not the <lb/>
            clear-sighted wisdom of Palamedes seen through the knavish <lb/>
            audacity of the fellow, he would have for ever evaded the <lb/>
            obligation of his sacred oath."</p>
          <p>It was really better for him to buffet, not only with the <lb/>
            foe, but also with the waves, as he did, than to desert Greece, <lb/>
            when combining to wage war against the barbarians. But let <lb/>
            us leave both fables and foreign scenes-let us come to real <lb/>

            history, and that our own. Marcus Atilius Regulus, when <lb/>
            in his second consulship taken in Africa by stratagem by <lb/>
            Xanthippus, the Lacedæmonian general-but when Hamilcar, <lb/>
            the father of Hannibal, was the commander-in-chief-was <lb/>
            sent to the senate, bound by an oath, that unless some noble <lb/>
            captives were restored to the Carthaginians, he should <lb/>
            himself return to Carthage. When he arrived at Rome, he <lb/>
            saw the semblance of advantage, but, as the event declares, <lb/>
            judged it a fallacious appearance, which was this-to remain <lb/>
            in his country, to stay at home with his wife and his chil- <lb/>
            dren ; and, regarding the calamity which he had experienced <lb/>
            as incident to the fortune of war, to retain the rank of <lb/>
            consular dignity. Who can deny these things to be profit- <lb/>
            able ? Whom do you think ? Greatness of mind and fortitude <lb/>
            deny it.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Can you require more creditable authorities ? <lb/>
            For it is characteristic of these virtues to fear nothing, to <lb/>
            despise all human concerns, to think nothing that can happen <lb/>
            to a man intolerable. What, then, did he do ? He came <lb/>
            into the senate-he disclosed his commission-he refused to <lb/>
            declare his own sentiments-he said that as long as he was <lb/>
            bound by an oath to the enemy he was not a senator. And <lb/>
            this, too (oh, foolish man ! some person will exclaim, an <lb/>
            enemy to his own interest!) he denied to be expedient, <lb/>
            namely, that the captives should be restored, for that they <lb/>
            were young men and good generals, that he himself was <lb/>
            already worn out with years. When his authority had pre- <lb/>
            vailed, the captives were retained, and he returned to <lb/>
            Carthage ; nor did the love of his country or of his family <lb/>
            withhold him. Nor was he then ignorant that he was return- <lb/>
            ing to a most cruel enemy, and to exquisite tortures. But <lb/>
            he considered that his oath ought to be observed. Therefore, <lb/>
            at the very time when he was undergoing death by want of <lb/>
            sleep, he was in a better condition than if he had remained <lb/>
            at home an aged captive, and a perjured consular. But he <lb/>
            acted foolishly, since he not only did not advise the sending <lb/>
            back the captives, but even spoke against the measure. How <lb/>
            foolishly? What, even if it was advantageous to his country? <lb/>
            Can that now which is inexpedient for our country be <lb/>
            expedient for any citizen ?</p>

            <pb n="159"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXVIII.]</note><lb/>
            tions of nature, when they separate expediency from virtue. <lb/>
            For we all desire our own interest—we are carried along to <lb/>
            it; nor can we by any means do otherwise. For who is <lb/>
            there that shuns his own advantage ? or rather, who is there <lb/>
            that does not most eagerly pursue it ? But because we never <lb/>
            can find real advantage except in good report, honour, virtue ; <lb/>
            therefore we esteem these things first and chief; we consider <lb/>
            the name of utility not so much noble as necessary. What <lb/>
            is there, then, somebody will say, in an oath? Are we <lb/>
            afraid of angry Jove ? But it is a common principle with <lb/>
            all philosophers, indeed-not of those only who say that the <lb/>
            deity has no labour himself, and imposes none on others-but <lb/>
            of those also who are of opinion that the deity is always <lb/>
            acting and planning something, that the deity never is angry, <lb/>
            nor injurious. But what greater harm could angry Jupiter <lb/>
            do to Regulus, than Regulus did to himself? It was, then, <lb/>
            no force of religion which prevented so great an advantage. <lb/>
            Was it that he might act basely? In the first place, choose <lb/>
            the least among evils. Would, then, this trifling turpitude <lb/>
            bring as much evil as that great torture ? In the next <lb/>
            place, that saying in Accius—" Hast thou broken faith? I <lb/>
            neither have plighted nor do plight faith with any of the <lb/>
            faithless,"—though it is spoken by an impious king, yet is <lb/>
            well spoken. They add, also, that just as we say that some <lb/>
            acts seem useful which are not; so they say that some <lb/>
            acts seem virtuous which are not so ; as for instance, this very <lb/>
            act seems virtuous, to return to torture for the sake of observ- <lb/>
            ing an oath, but it is really not virtuous, because whatever <lb/>
            is extorted by the violence of enemies, ought not to be <lb/>
            fulfilled. They add also, that whatever is very advantageous <lb/>
            becomes virtuous, even though it did not seem so before. <lb/>
            These things are usually urged against Regulus. But let us <lb/>
            consider the first objection.</p>
          <p>XXIX. We need not dread Jupiter, lest in his wrath he <lb/>
            might do us harm, who neither is accustomed to be wroth, <lb/>
            nor to do harm. This reasoning, indeed, applies not more <lb/>
            against Regulus than against every oath ; but in an oath it <lb/>
            ought to be considered, not what is the fear, but what is the <lb/>
            force. For an oath is a religious affirmation ; but what you <lb/>
            solemnly promise, as if the deity were witness, to that you <pb n="160"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            ought to adhere.* For it pertains now not to the anger of the <lb/>
            gods, which exists not, but to justice and fidelity. For well <lb/>
            has Ennius said— <lb/>
            " 0 holy Faith, winged, and the very oath of Jove."</p>
          <p>He, then, who violates an oath, violates Faith, which our <lb/>
            ancestors, as is recorded in Cato's speech, wished to be in the <lb/>
            Capitol, next to Jupiter Greatest and Best. But they argue <lb/>
            that even angry Jupiter could not have done more harm to <lb/>
            Regulus than Regulus did to himself. Certainly not, if <lb/>
            nothing but pain be an evil. But philosophers of the highest <lb/>
            authority assert, not only that it is not the greatest evil, but <lb/>
            that it is not an evil at all. I pray you not to despise a, <lb/>
            witness of theirs, of no slight weight—I know not, indeed, <lb/>
            but that he is the weightiest—namely, Regulus. For, whom <lb/>
            do we require more creditable than the chief of the Roman <lb/>
            people-who, for the sake of adhering to duty, underwent <lb/>
            voluntary torture ? But as to what they say, choose the least <lb/>
            of evils-that is, baseness rather than calamity-can there be <lb/>
            any evil greater than baseness ? And if this implies some- <lb/>
            thing of disgust in the deformity of person, how much worse <lb/>
            should appear the depravity and foulness of a debased mind ? <lb/>
            They,† therefore, who treat of these subjects more boldly, <note type="footnote"> * "An oath is that whereby we call God to witness the truth of what we <lb/>
            say; with a curse upon ourselves, either implied or expressed, should it <lb/>
            prove false."—Milton on Christian Doctrine. </note><note type="footnote"> While the sacredness of oaths is still held as a principle of morals, the <lb/>
            lawfulness of their administration is doubted by many, and their efficacy <lb/>
            perhaps by the majority of modern society. The increased security for the <lb/>
            veracity of him who takes them, which they are supposed to afiord, is in <lb/>
            the case of an honest man unnecessary, and of a dishonest man valueless. <lb/>
            The argument of Godwin with relation to oaths of duty and office, appears <lb/>
            to admit of a universal application ; the same arguments that prove the in- <lb/>
            justice of tests, may be applied universally to all oaths of duty and office. <lb/>
            " If I entered upon the office without an oath, what would be my duty? <lb/>
            Can the oath that is imposed upon me make any alteration in my duty? <lb/>
            if not, does not the very act of imposing it, by implication, assert a false- <lb/>
            hood ? Will this falsehood have no injurious eifect upon a majority of the <lb/>
            persons concerned ? What is the true criterion that I shall faithfully dis- <lb/>
            charge the office that is conferred upon me ? Surely my past life, not any <lb/>
            protestations 1 may be compelled to make. If my life have been unim- <lb/>

            venture to say that that which is base is the only evil; but <lb/>
            they* who treat of them more timidly, yet do not hesitate to <lb/>
            call it the greatest evil. Now, that saying, indeed—"I <lb/>
            neither have plighted, nor do plight faith with any of the <lb/>
            faithless,"—was well imagined by the poet, on this account, <lb/>
            because when Atreus was being delineated, it was necessary <lb/>
            to sustain the character. But if they take this to them- <lb/>
            selves, that that is no faith which is plighted to the <lb/>
            faithless, let them see to it lest it be sought as a subterfuge <lb/>
            for perjury.</p>
          <p>There are also rights of war, and the faith of an oath is <lb/>
            often to be kept with an enemy. For that, which is so sworn <lb/>
            that the mind conceives it ought to be done, that should <lb/>
            be observed. What is otherwise, if you perform it not, <lb/>
            involves no perjury. Thus, if you should not pay a price <note type="footnote"> pain as indifferent. This theory is thus refuted by that most ingenious me- <lb/>
            taphysician and moralist, Dr. Thomas Browne. "Between mere pleasure <lb/>
            and mere virtue there is a competition, in short, of the less with the greater; <lb/>
            hut though virtue be the greater, and the greater in every case in which it <lb/>
            can be opposed to mere pleasure, pleasure is still good in itself, and would <lb/>
            he covetable by the virtuous in every case in which the greater good of <lb/>
            virtue is not inconsistent with it. It is, indeed, because pleasure and pain <lb/>
            are not in themselves absolutely indifferent that man is virtuous in resisting <lb/>
            the solicitations of the one and the threats of the other. And there is thus <lb/>
            a self-confutation in the principles of stoicism, which it is truly astonish- <lb/>
            ing that the founder of the system, or some one of the ancient and modern <lb/>
            commentators on it, should not have discovered. We may praise, indeed, <lb/>
            the magnanimity of him who dares to suffer every external evil which men <lb/>
            can suffer rather than give his conscience one guilty remembrance ; but it <lb/>
            is because there is evil to be endured that we may praise him for his mag- <lb/>
            nanimity in bearing the evil, and if there be no in to be endured, there is <lb/>
            no magnanimity that can be called forth to endure it. The bed of roses <lb/>
            differs from the burning bull; not merely as a square differs from a circle, <lb/>
            or as flint differs from clay, but as that which is physically evil; and if <lb/>
            they do not so differ as good and evil, there could be as little merit in con- <lb/>
            senting when virtue required the sacrifice to suffer all the bodily pain which <lb/>
            the instrument of torture could inflict, rather than to rest in guilty indo- <lb/>
            lence on that luxurious couch of flowers, as there could be in the mere <lb/>
            preference for any physical purpose of a circular to an angular form, or of <lb/>
            the softness of clay to the hardness of flint. Moral excellence is, indeed, <lb/>
            in every case, preferable to mere physical enjoyment; and there is no en- <lb/>
            joyment worthy of the choice of man when virtue forbids the desire. But <lb/>
            virtue is the superior only, not the sole power; she has imperial sway, but <lb/>
            her sway is imperial only because there are forms of inferior good over <lb/>
            which it is her glory to preside."—Moral Philosophy, Lect. xcix. </note><note type="footnote"> it The Peripatetics. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>

            for your life, agreed on with robbers, it is no fraud if you <lb/>
            should not perform it, though bound by an oatli.* For a <lb/>
            pirate is not comprehended in the number of lawful enemies, <lb/>
            but is the common foe of all men. With such a man, neither <lb/>
            should faith nor an oath be in common. For to swear what is <lb/>
            false is not always perjury ; but not to do that which you <lb/>
            swear according to the sentiment of your mind, " ex animi <note type="footnote"> * " Grotius," says an anonymous commentator (de Jure Belli et Pads, 11, <lb/>
            13, § 15), "citing this passage, admits that a person extorting a promise by <lb/>
            force, can have no right to demand its performance ; but thinks that an oath <lb/>
            accompanying it makes it binding in conseienee." Hobbes, de Civ. ii. 16, <lb/>
            maintains that a promise, because extorted by fear, is not the less obligatory in <lb/>
            cases where the premier receives from it some benefit. On this it is remarked <lb/>
            by Puffendorf, that merely abstaining from injury cannot be reckoned <lb/>
            among benefits; that a highwayman, for instance, who does not murder <lb/>
            you, cannot be called your benefactor. Hobbes's doctrine is therefore thus <lb/>
            qualified by Puffendorf, provided that the promiser can legitimately <lb/>
            exact the performance of that promise. To this Barbeyrac, the learned <lb/>
            and acute commentator on both Grotius and Puffendorf, fully accedes, <lb/>
            and pronounces that every act of violence, every sort of menace, by which <lb/>
            the promiser, against his will, is induced to make an engagement into which <lb/>
            he otherwise would not have entered, deprives him of the liberty necessary <lb/>
            to form a valid engagement, and, consequently, annuls all such promises <lb/>
            and convocations. He adds, that the performance of an engagement <lb/>
            made under such circumstances is injurious to society, as it leads to the <lb/>
            encouragement of robbers. Adam Smith has treated this question much at <lb/>
            length, Theory of Mor. Sent. vii. 4. With some exceptions, and guardedly, he <lb/>
            leans to the opposite opinion. Some regard, he thinks, should be paid to <lb/>
            promises of this kind, but how much it is not possible to determine by any <lb/>
            general rule. If the sum promised was very great, such for example as <lb/>
            would ruin by its payment the family of the payer, or sufficient to effect <lb/>
            the most useful purposes, it would appear eomical, at least extremely im- <lb/>
            proper, to throw it into such worthless hands, but in <unclear/>^neral it may be said <lb/>
            that exact propriety requires the observance of such promises where not <lb/>
            inconsistent with other duties, when violated it is always with some degree <lb/>
            of dishonour to the person who made them. It is observable that Paley <lb/>
            appears to have changed his opinion on the subject of such promises. In <lb/>
            the first edition of his valuable work on Moral and Political Philosophy, <lb/>
            III. part 1, 5, he states their obligation to depend on the question whether <lb/>
            mankind are benefited or not by their observance, concluding that lives <lb/>
            are saved by it, he treats such promises as in general binding. But in <lb/>
            subsequent editions he observes, that they may be made the instrument <lb/>
            of almost unlimited extortion, and therefore in the question between the <lb/>
            importance of these opposite consequences resides the doubt concerning the <lb/>
            obligation of such promises. The noble-minded Montaigne remarks on <lb/>
            this subject:—"Ce que la crainte m'a fait une fois vouloir, je suis tenu de la <lb/>
            vouloir encore sins crainte; et quand elle n'aura force que ma langue sans <lb/>
            [a volonté, encore, suis je tenu de faire la maille bonne de ma parole." </note> <lb/>

            tui sententia," as it is expressed in words in our law form, is <lb/>
            perjury. For Euripides says well—" With may tongue have <lb/>
            I sworn ; I bear an unsworn conscience."</p>
          <p>But Regulus was under obligation not to disturb by <lb/>
            perjury the conditions and covenants of war and of the <lb/>
            enemy ; for the affair was transacted with a just and lawful <lb/>
            foe, in regard to whom both the entire Fecial law and many <lb/>
            other laws are binding in common. Had not this been so, <lb/>
            the senate would never have delivered up eminent men bound <lb/>
            to the enemy.-</p>
          <p>XXX. But Titus Veturius and Spurius Postumius, when <lb/>
            they were consuls the second time, were given up to the <lb/>
            Samnites because they had made a peace with them, after <lb/>
            having fought with ill success at Caudium, when our legions <lb/>
            were sent under the yoke; for they had made it without the <lb/>
            command of the people and senate. And at the same time, <lb/>
            Titus Numicius, and Quintus laelius, who were then <lb/>
            tribunes of the people, because the peace was made by their <lb/>
            authority, were given up, that the peace with the Samnites <lb/>
            might be rejected. And of this surrender, Postumius <lb/>
            himself, who was given up, was the advocate and author. <lb/>
            Which same thing Caius Mancinus did, many years after <lb/>
            wards, who advocated that bill which Lucius Furius and <lb/>
            Sextus Atilius, by a decree of the senate, brought in, that <lb/>
            he should himself be delivered up to the Numantines, with <lb/>
            whom he had made a league without the authority of the <lb/>
            senate ; which bill being passed by the people, he was given <lb/>
            up to the enemy. He acted more worthily than Quintus <lb/>
            Pompeius, through whose petitioning against such a measure, <lb/>
            when he was in similar circumstances, the law was not passed. <lb/>
            With this man, that which seemed his interest had more <lb/>
            weight than virtue had ; in the former instances, the false <lb/>
            semblance of expediency was overcome by the authority of <lb/>
            virtue. But, say they, that which was extorted by force <lb/>
            ought not to be ratified ; as if, indeed, force could be used <lb/>
            to a man of fortitude. Why, then, you say, did Regulus go <lb/>
            to the senate, if he was about to dissuade them concerning <lb/>
            the captives ? You are reprehending that which was the <lb/>
            noblest thing in that transaction ; for he did not rely upon <lb/>
            his own judgment, but he undertook the cause that there <lb/>
            might be a decision of the senate; by whom, had not he him- <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            self been the adviser of the measure, the prisoners, indeed, <lb/>
            would have been restored to the Carthaginians. Thus <lb/>
            Regulus would have remained in safety in his country ; <lb/>
            which, because he thought inexpedient for his country, <lb/>
            therefore he believed it virtuous in himself, both to think <lb/>
            and to suffer these things. Now, as to what they say, that <lb/>
            whatever is very useful becomes virtuous, I say, Nay, it is <lb/>
            so really, and does not merely become so; for nothing is ex- <lb/>
            pedient which is not likewise virtuous ; and it is not because <lb/>
            it is expedient that it is virtuous, but because it is virtuous <lb/>
            it is expedient. Wherefore, out of many admirable examples, <lb/>
            one could not easily mention one either more laudable or <lb/>
            more excellent than this.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But out of all this laudable conduct of Regulus, <lb/>
            this alone is worthy of admiration, that he was of opinion <lb/>
            that the prisoners ought to be retained. For that he re- <lb/>
            turned seems wonderful to us now, though at that time he <lb/>
            could not do otherwise. Therefore, that was not the merit <lb/>
            of the man, but of the times. For our ancestors were of <lb/>
            opinion that there was no tie closer than an oath to bind <lb/>
            our faith. This the laws of the twelve tables indicate— <lb/>
            this the leges sacratæ* indicate, this the leagues indicate, <lb/>
            by which our faith is pledged even with enemies. The <lb/>
            opinions and animadversions of the Censors indicate it, who <lb/>
            passed sentence on no subject more strictly than on such as <lb/>
            concerned oaths. Marcus Pomponius, tribune of the people, <lb/>
            fixed a day for Lucius Manlius, the son of Aulus, when he <lb/>
            had been Dictator, to stand his trial, because he had taken <lb/>
            to himself a few days in addition for holding the dictator- <lb/>
            ship. lie accused him also because he had banished from <lb/>
            intercourse with men, his son Titus, who was afterwards <lb/>
            called Torquatus, and had commanded him to reside in the <lb/>
            country. When the young man, the son, had heard this, <lb/>
            that trouble was brought upon his father, he is said to have <lb/>
            hastened to Rome, and to have come with the first dawn to <lb/>
            the house of Pomponius, who, when it was announced to <lb/>
            him, supposing that the son, being enraged, was about to <lb/>
            bring to him some accusation against his father, arose from <note type="footnote"> * The laws concerning liberty and the tribunitial power, so called, because <lb/>
            he who violated them was to be held devoted (saccr) to the resentment of <lb/>
            the deity. </note> <pb n="165"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXXII.]</note><lb/>
            his bed, and, the bystanders having been dismissed, ordered <lb/>
            the youth to come to him. But he, when he entered, hastily <lb/>
            drew his sword, and swore that he would instantly slay him <lb/>
            unless he gave his oath that he would suffer his father to be <lb/>
            discharged. Pomponius, forced by fear, swore this ; he sub- <lb/>
            sequently brought the matter before the people, and informed <lb/>
            them why it was necessary for him to abandon the prosecu- <lb/>
            tion, and then suffered Manlius to be discharged. So much <lb/>
            force had an oath in those times. And this is that Titus <lb/>
            Manlius who acquired the surname of Torquatns, at the Anio, <lb/>
            for taking the collar from the Gaul, whom he, having been <lb/>
            challenged by him, had slain ; in whose third consulship the <lb/>
            Latins were routed and put to flight at the Veseris. A <lb/>
            most eminently great man, but though very indulgent to his <lb/>
            father, was again cruelly severe to his son.</p>
          <p>XXXII. But as Regulus is to be commended for observ- <lb/>
            in- his oath, so those ten are to be condemned whom Hanni- <lb/>
            bal. after the battle of Cannæ, sent to the senate, under an <lb/>
            oath that they would return to that camp which the Cartha- <lb/>
            ginians had got possession of, unless they succeeded about <lb/>
            redeeming the prisoners; if it be true that they did not re- <lb/>
            turn-about whom, all historians do not relate the story in <lb/>
            the same manner. For Polybius, an eminently good author, <lb/>
            writes, that out of ten very noble persons who were then sent, <lb/>
            nine returned, the request not having been granted by the <lb/>
            senate; that one of the ten, who, a short time after he had <lb/>
            gone out of the camp, had returned, as if lie had forgotten <lb/>
            something, remained at Rome. For, by his return into the <lb/>
            camp, he construed it that he was freed from his oath- <lb/>
            not rightly, for fraud does, but fasten, not absolve perjury. <lb/>
            It was, then, silly cunning, perversely imitating prudence. <lb/>
            The senate, therefore, decreed, that this double-dealing and <lb/>
            artful fellow should be brought fettered to Hannibal. But <lb/>
            the greatest act of the senate was this. Hannibald had eight <lb/>
            thousand men prisoners ; not those whom he had taken in <lb/>
            battle, or who had fled from the peril of death, but who had <lb/>
            been left in the camp by the Consuls, Paullus and Yarro. <lb/>
            The senate decreed that these should not be redeemed, though <lb/>
            it might have been done at a small expense, that it might be <lb/>
            impressed upon our soldiers that they were either to con- <lb/>
            quer or die—which circumstance, indeed, having become <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            known, the same author writes that the courage of Hannibal <lb/>
            fell, because the Roman senate and people possessed so lofty <lb/>
            a spirit in their depressed condition. Thus those things <lb/>
            which seem expedient, are overpowered by a comparison <lb/>
            with virtue.</p>
          <p>But Acilius, who wrote his history in Greek, says that <lb/>
            there were more than one who returned into the camp with <lb/>
            the same fraudulent design, that they might be freed from <lb/>
            their oath, and that they were branded by the censors with <lb/>
            every ignominy.</p>
          <p>Let this now be the end of this subject. For it is plain <lb/>
            that those acts which are done with a timid, humble, abject, <lb/>
            and broken spirit (such as would have been the conduct of <lb/>
            Regulus, if, respecting the prisoners, he had either advised <lb/>
            what seemed to be needful for himself, not what he con- <lb/>
            sidered beneficial to the commonwealth, or had desired to <lb/>
            remain at home), are inexpedient, because they are scan- <lb/>
            dalous, foul, and base.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The fourth part remains, which is compre- <lb/>
            hended in propriety, moderation, modesty, continence, tem- <lb/>
            perance. Can anything, then, be expedient, which is contrary <lb/>
            to this train of such virtues ? However, the Cyrenæans, fol- <lb/>
            lowers of Aristippus, and the Annicerians, misnamed philo- <lb/>
            sophers, have made all good consist in pleasure, and have <lb/>
            thought virtue to be commended on this account, because it is <lb/>
            productive of pleasure ; but, as they are antiquated, Epicurus <lb/>
            flourishes, the advocate and author of nearly the same opinion. <lb/>
            Against these we must fight with man and horse, as it is said, <lb/>
            if it is our intention to defend and retain virtue. For if not <lb/>
            only expediency, but all the happiness of life, be contained in <lb/>
            a strong bodily constitution, and in the certain hope of that <lb/>
            constitution, as it is written by Metrodorus ; certainly this ex- <lb/>
            pediency, and that the greatest (as they think), will stand in <lb/>
            opposition to virtue. For, in the first place, where will room <lb/>
            be given for prudence ? Is it that it may seek on all sides <lb/>
            after sweets ? How miserable the servitude of virtue, when <lb/>
            the slave of pleasure ? Moreover, what would be the office of <lb/>
            Prudence? Is it to select pleasures ingeniously? Admit that <lb/>
            nothing could be more delightful than this ; what can be <lb/>
            imagined more base? Now, what room can Fortitude, <lb/>
            which is the contemning of pain and labour, have in his <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XXXIII.]</note><lb/>
            system, who calls pain the greatest of evils? For though <lb/>
            Epicurus may speak, as he does in many places, with suffi- <lb/>
            dent fortitude regarding pain ; nevertheless, we are not to <lb/>
            regard what he may say, but what it is consistent in him to <lb/>
            say, as he would confine good to pleasure, evil to pain ; so if <lb/>
            I would listen to him on the subject of continence and tem- <lb/>
            perance, he says, indeed, many things in many places; but <lb/>
            there is an impediment in the stream,* as they say. For how <lb/>
            can he commend temperance who places the chief good in <lb/>
            pleasure ? For temperance is hostile to irregular passions ; <lb/>
            but irregular passions are the companions of pleasure. And <lb/>
            yet, in these three classes of virtue, they make a shift, in <lb/>
            what ever manner they can, not without cleverness. They <lb/>
            Introduce prudence as the science which supplies pleasures <lb/>
            and repels pain. Fortitude, too, they explain in some man- <lb/>
            ner, when they teach that it is the means of disregarding <lb/>
            death, and enduring pain. Even temperance they introduce <lb/>
            -not very easily, indeed-but yet in whatever way they <lb/>
            can. For they say that the height of pleasure is limited <lb/>
            to the absence of pain.t Justice staggers, or rather falls <lb/>
            to the ground, and all those virtues which are discerned in <lb/>
            society, and the association of mankind. For neither kind- <lb/>
            ness, nor liberality, nor courtesy can exist, any more than <lb/>
            friendship, if they are not sought for their own sakes, but <lb/>
            are referred to pleasure and interest. Let us, therefore, sum <lb/>
            up the subject in few words. For as we have taught that <lb/>
            there is no expediency which can be contrary to virtue; so <lb/>
            we say that all bodily pleasure is opposed to virtue. On <lb/>
            which account I think Callipho and Dinomachus the more <lb/>
            deserving of censure, for they thought they would put an <lb/>
            end to the controversy if they should couple pleasure with <lb/>
            virtue; as if they should couple a human being with a brute. <lb/>
            Virtue does not admit that combination-it spurns, it repels <lb/>
            it. Nor can, indeed, the ultimate principle of good and evil, <lb/>
            which ought to be simple, be compounded of, and tempered <lb/>
            with these most dissimilar ingredients. But about this (for <lb/>
            it is an important subject), I have said more in another <lb/>
            place. Now to my original proposition. How, then, if ever <note type="footnote">* Meaning that the system of Epicurus presents impediments to the <lb/>
            flowing of the virtues, like obstructions in a water-course. </note><note type="footnote"> t That is, that the greatest pleasure consists in the absence of pain. </note> <pb n="168"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK III.</note><lb/>
            that which seems expedient is opposed to virtue, the matter <lb/>
            is to be decided, has been sufficiently treated of above. But <lb/>
            if pleasure be said to have even the semblance of expedi- <lb/>
            ence, there can be no union of it with virtue. For though <lb/>
            we may concede something to pleasure, perhaps it has some- <lb/>
            thing of a relish, but certainly it has in it nothing of utility.</p>
          <p>You have a present from your father, my son Marcus; <lb/>
            in my opinion, indeed, an important one-but it will be just <lb/>
            as you will receive it. However, these three books will de- <lb/>
            serve to be received by you as guests among the commenta- <lb/>
            ries of Cratippus. But as, if I myself had gone to Athens <lb/>
            (which would indeed have been the case had not my country, <lb/>
            with loud voice, called me back from the middle of my jour- <lb/>
            ney), you would sometimes have listened to me also: so, since <lb/>
            my voice has reached you in these volumes, you will bestow <lb/>
            upon them as much time as you can; and you can bestow <lb/>
            as much as you wish. But when I shall understand that <lb/>
            you take delight in this department of science, then will I <lb/>
            converse with you both when present, which will be in a <lb/>
            short time, as I expect-and while you will be far away, <lb/>
            I will talk with you, though absent. Farewell, then, my <lb/>
            Cicero, and be assured that you are indeed very dear to <lb/>
            me, but that yon will be much more dear, if you shall take <lb/>
            delight in such memorials and such precepts.</p><pb n="169"/>

          <p>I. QUINTUS MUCIUS, the augur,* used to relate many <lb/>
            things of Caius Lælius, his father-in-law, from memory, and <lb/>
            in a pleasant manner, and did not scruple in every discourse <lb/>
            to call him a wise man. Moreover I myself, after assuming <lb/>
            the manly toga,† was introduced by my father to Scævola, in <lb/>
            such a way that, as far as I could and it was permitted me, <lb/>
            I never quitted the old man's side. Accordingly, many <lb/>
            sagacious discussions of his, and many short and apt sayings, <lb/>
            I committed to memory, and desired to become better in- <lb/>
            formed by his wisdom. When he died, I betook myself to <lb/>
            Scævola the pontiff, who is the only man in our country that <lb/>
            I venture to pronounce the most distinguished for talent and <lb/>
            for integrity. But of him elsewhere. I now return to the <lb/>
            augur. Among many other circumstances, I remember that <lb/>
            once being seated at home in his arm-chair (as was his <lb/>
            custom), when I was in his company, and a very few of his <lb/>
            intimate friends, he fell by chance upon that subject of dis- <lb/>
            course which at the time was in the mouth of nearly every <lb/>
            one : for you of course remember, Atticus, and the more so <lb/>
            because you were very intimate with Publius Sulpicius, <lb/>
            (when he, as tribune of the people,‡ was estranged by <note type="footnote"> * Augur is often put for any one who predicted future events. Auspex <lb/>

            a deadly hatred from Quintus Pompey, who was then consul, <lb/>
            with whom up to that time he had lived on terms of the <lb/>
            closest union and affeetion,) how great was the surprise and <lb/>
            even regret of the people. Accordingly, when Scævola had <lb/>
            incidentally mentioned that very subject, he laid before us <lb/>
            the discourse of Lælius on Friendship, which had been ad- <lb/>
            dressed by the latter to himself and to the other son-in-law of <lb/>
            Lælius, Caius Fannius, the son of Marcus, a few days after <lb/>
            the death of Afrieanus. The opinions of that disquisition I <lb/>
            committed to memory, and in this book I have set them forth <lb/>
            according to my own judgment. For I have introduced the <lb/>
            individuals as if actually speaking, lest said I" and "said <lb/>
            he" should be too frequently interposed; and that the <lb/>
            dialogue might seem to be held by persons face to face. For <lb/>
            when you were frequently urging me to write something on <lb/>
            the subject of friendship, it seemed to me a matter worthy <lb/>
            as well of the consideration of all as of our intimacy. I have <lb/>
            therefore willingly done so, that I might confer a benefit <lb/>
            on many in consequence of your request. But as in the Cato <lb/>
            Major, which was addressed to you on the subject of old age, <lb/>
            I have introduced Cato when an old man conversing, because <lb/>
            there seemed no person better adapted to speak of that period <lb/>
            of life than he, who had been an old man for so long a time, <lb/>
            and in that old age had been pre-eminently prosperous; so <lb/>
            when I had heard from our ancestors that the attachment of <lb/>
            Caius Lælius and Publius Scipio was especially worthy of <lb/>
            record, the character of Lælius seemed to me a suitable one <lb/>
            to deliver these very observations on friendship which <lb/>
            Scævola remembered to have been spoken by him. Now <lb/>
            this description of discourses, resting on the authority of men <lb/>
            of old, and of those of high rank, seems, I know not on what <lb/>
            principle, to carry with it the greater weight.* Accordingly, <note type="footnote">* “ We continue to think and feel as our ancestors have thought and felt; <lb/>
            so true in innumerable cases is the observation that ' men make up their <lb/>
            principles by inheritance, and defend them as they would their estates, be- <lb/>
            cause they are born heirs to them.' It has been justly said that it is difficult <lb/>
            to regard that as an evil which has been long done, and that there are <lb/>
            many great and excellent things which we never think of doing, merely <lb/>
            because no one has done them before us. ' The prejudice for antiquity is <lb/>
            itself very ancient,' says La Motte ; and it is amusing, at the distance of so <lb/>
            many hundred years, to find the same complaint of undue partiality to the <lb/>
            writers of other ages brought forward against their contemporaries by those </note> <lb/>

            while I am reading my own writing, I am sometimes so much <lb/>
            affected as to suppose that it is Cato, and not myself that is <lb/>
            speaking. But as then I, an old man, wrote to you, who are <lb/>
            an old man, on the subject of old age; so in this book I <lb/>
            myself, a most sincere friend, have written to a friend on the <lb/>
            subject of friendship. On that occasion Cato was the speaker, <lb/>
            than whom there was no one at that time older or wiser. On <lb/>
            this, Lælius, not only a wise man (for so he has been con- <lb/>
            sidered), and one pre-eminent in reputation for friendship, <lb/>
            speaks on that subject. I would wish you to withdraw your <lb/>
            thoughts a little while from me, and fancy that Lælius him- <lb/>
            self is speaking. Caius Fannius and Quintus Mucius come <lb/>
            to their father-in-law after the death of Africanus. With <lb/>
            these the discourse begins. Lælius replies; and the whole <lb/>
            of his dissertation regards friendship, which in reading you <lb/>
            will discover for yourself.</p>
          <p>II. FANNIUS. Such is the case, dear Lælius, nor was there <lb/>
            ever a better or more distinguished man than Africanus. <lb/>
            But you ought to consider that the eyes of all are now turned <lb/>
            upon you, Laelius : you alone they both denominate and <lb/>
            believe to be wise. This character was lately bestowed on <lb/>
            M. Cato : we know that Lucius Atilius, among our fathers, <lb/>
            was entitled a wise man ; but each on a different and pe- <lb/>
            culiar account: Atilius, because he was considered versed in <lb/>
            the civil law; Cato, because he had experience in a variety <lb/>
            of subjects; both in the senate and in the forum many in- <lb/>
            stances are recorded either of his shrewd forethought, or <lb/>
            persevering action, or pointed reply: wherefore he already <lb/>
            had, as it were, the surname of wise in his old age. While of <lb/>
            you it is remarked that you are wise in a different sense, <lb/>
            not only by nature and character, but further, by application <lb/>
            and learning; and not as the vulgar, but as the learned <lb/>
            designate a wise man, such as was none in all Greece. For <lb/>
            as to those who are called the seven wise men, persons who <lb/>
            inquire into such things with great nicety do not consider <lb/>
            them in the class of wise men. We learn that at Athens <lb/>
            there was one peculiarly so, and that he was even pronounced <note type="footnote"> authors whom we are now disposed to consider as too highly estimated by <lb/>
            our own contemporaries on that very account.”—Dr. Brown's Lectures on <lb/>
            the Philosophy of the Mind, lecture xliv. </note> <lb/>

            by the oracle of Apollo the wisest of men.* This is the kind <lb/>
            of wisdom they conceive to be in you, that you consider <lb/>
            every thing connected with you to rest upon yourself, and <lb/>
            consider the events of life as subordinate to virtue: therefore- <lb/>
            they inquire of me (I believe of you also, Scævola) in what <lb/>
            manner you bear the death of Africanus. And the rather <lb/>
            so, because on the last nones, when we had come into the <lb/>
            gardens of Decius Brutus the augur, for the purpose of dis- <lb/>
            cussion, as our practice is, you were not present; although <lb/>
            you were accustomed most punctually to observe that day and <lb/>
            that engagement.</p>
          <p>SCÆVOLA. It is true, many are inquiring, Caius Lælius, as <lb/>
            has been asserted by Fannius. But for my part I answer <lb/>
            them according to what I have remarked, that you bear with <lb/>
            patience the grief which you have suffered, by the death of <lb/>
            one who was at once a very distinguished man, and a very <lb/>
            dear friend; yet that you could not forbear being distressed, <lb/>
            nor would that have been consistent with your feelings as <lb/>
            a man. And with regard to your not having attended last <lb/>
            nones at our assembly, ill health was the cause, and not <lb/>
            affliction.</p>
          <p>LAELius. You certainly said what was right, Scævola, and <lb/>
            agreeable to truth : for neither ought I to have absented my- <lb/>
            self through any inconvenience of mine from that duty which <lb/>
            I have always fulfilled when I was well; nor by any chance <lb/>
            do I conceive it can happen to a man of firmness of character, <lb/>
            that any interruption should take place in his duty. And as <lb/>
            for you, Fannius, who say there is attributed to me so much <lb/>
            merit, as I am neither conscious of nor lay claim to, you <lb/>
            act therein like a friend : but, as it seems to me, you do not <lb/>
            form a right estimate of Cato; for either there never has <lb/>
            been a wise man, which I rather think, or if there ever was <lb/>
            one, he was the man. For (to omit other cases) consider how <note type="footnote"> * Socrates. See Plato's defence of Socrates. </note><note type="footnote"> t " If thou must needs rule, be Zeno's king and enjoy that empire which <lb/>

            Elohims of the earth. Could the world unite in the practice of that despised <lb/>

            he endured the loss of his son ! I remember the instance of <lb/>
            Paullus, and witnessed that of Gallus : but theirs was in <lb/>
            the case of children; but Cato's in that of a mature and <lb/>
            respected man. Wherefore pause before you prefer to Cato, <lb/>
            -even him whom Apollo, as you say, pronounced the wisest of <lb/>
            men: for the deeds of the one are praised, but only the say- <lb/>
            ings of the other. Concerning myself, however (for I would <lb/>
            now address you both), entertain the following sentiments.</p>
          <p>III. Should I say that I am not distressed by the loss of <lb/>
            Scipio, philosophers may determine with what propriety I <lb/>
            should do so; but assuredly I should be guilty of falsehood. <lb/>
            For I am distressed at being bereaved of such a friend, as no <lb/>
            one, I consider, will ever be to me again, and, as I can con- <lb/>
            fidently assert, no one ever was : but I am not destitute of a <lb/>
            remedy. I comfort myself, and especially with this consola- <lb/>
            tion, that I am free from that error by which most men, on <lb/>
            the decease of friends, are wont to be tormented : for I feel <lb/>
            that no evil has happened to Scipio; it has befallen myself, <lb/>
            if indeed it has happened to any. Now to be above measure <lb/>
            distressed at one's own troubles, is characteristic of the man <lb/>
            who loves not his friend, but himself. In truth, as far as he <lb/>
            is concerned, who can deny that his end was glorious ? for <lb/>
            unless he had chosen to wish for immortality, of which he <lb/>
            had not the slightest thought, what did he fail to obtain <lb/>
            which it was lawful for a man to wish for ? A man who, as <lb/>
            soon as he grew up, by his transcendent merit far surpassed <lb/>
            those sanguine hopes of his countrymen which they had con- <lb/>
            ceived regarding him when a mere boy, who never stood for <lb/>
            the consulship, yet was made consul twice; on the first occasion <lb/>
            before his time; on the second, at the proper age as regarded <lb/>
            himself, though for the commonwealth almost too late : who, <lb/>
            by overthrowing two cities,* most hostile to our empire, put <lb/>
            an end, not only to all present, but all future wars. What shall <lb/>
            I say of his most engaging manners; of his dutiful conduct to <lb/>
            his mother; his generosity to his sisters; his kindness to his <lb/>
            friends ; his uprightness towards all ? These are known to <lb/>
            you : and how dear he was to the state, was displayed by its <lb/>
            mourning at his death. How, therefore, could the accession <note type="footnote"> * Carthage was destroyed by Scipio, the second Africanus, B.C. 147; and <lb/>
            Numantia, a town of Spain, B.C. 133. From the latter exploit he obtained <lb/>
            the surname of Numantinus. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP III.]</note><lb/>
            of a few years have benefited such a man ? For although <lb/>
            old age is not burdensome (as I recollect Cato asserted, in con- <lb/>
            versation with myself and Scipio the year before he died), <lb/>
            yet it takes away that freshness which Scipio even yet pos- <lb/>
            sessed. Wherefore his life was such, that nothing could be <lb/>
            added to it, either in respect of good fortune or of glory : <lb/>
            moreover, the very suddenness of his death took away the <lb/>
            consciousness of it. On which kind of death it is difficult to <lb/>
            pronounce : what men conjecture, you yourselves know.* <lb/>
            However, this we may assert with truth, that of the many <lb/>
            most glorious and joyous days which P. Scipio witnessed in <lb/>
            the course of his life, that day was the most glorious when, <lb/>
            on the breaking up of the senate, he was escorted home in the <lb/>
            evening by the conscript fathers, by the allies of the Roman <lb/>
            people, and the Latins, the day before he died : so that from so <lb/>
            high a position of dignity, he may seem to have passed to <lb/>
            the gods above rather than to those below. Nor do I agree <lb/>
            with those who have lately begun to assert this opinion, <lb/>
            that the soul also dies simultaneously with the body, and that <lb/>
            all things are annihilated by death.t <note type="footnote"> * "Certainly the stoics bestowed too much cost upon death, and by their <lb/>
            great preparations madS it appear more fearful. Better, saith he ‘ qui <lb/>
            finem vitæ extremum inter munera ponat naturae.' It is as natural to die <lb/>
            as to be born, and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the <lb/>
            other. He that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one that is wounded in <lb/>
            hot blood, who for the time scarce feels the hurt; and therefore a mind <lb/>
            fixed and bent upon something that is good doth avert the dolours of death; <lb/>
            but above all believe it the sweetest canticle is, ‘ nunc dimittis,' when a man <lb/>
            bath obtained worth, ends, and expectations. Death bath this also, that it <lb/>

            either that of our own ancestors, who paid such sacred honours <lb/>
            to the dead, which surely they would not have done if they <lb/>
            thought those honours did in no way affect them; or that of <lb/>

            indeed is entirely destroyed, but then was flourishing); or <lb/>

            wisest of men, who did not say first one thing and then <lb/>
            another, as is generally done, but always the same; namely, that <lb/>
            the souls of men are divine, and that when they have departed <note type="footnote">his capacities of enjoyment, and to the conceptions of happiness and of <lb/>

            was also held by Scipio; for he indeed, a very few days be- <lb/>

            unaided by any light derived through the medium of tradition or report. <lb/>

            has added nothing to the conceptions of Cicero touching the immortality <lb/>
            -of the soul, but superstition and folly. "I believe," he says, "that the <lb/>

            death by the privilege of their proper natures, and without a miracle ; that <lb/>
            the souls of the faithful, as they leave earth, take possession of heaven; <lb/>
            that those apparitions and ghosts of departed persons are not the wandering <lb/>

            almost entirely on the immortality of souls, which he said he <lb/>
            had learned in sleep through a vision from Africanus. If <lb/>
            this be the fact, that the spirit of the best man most easily <lb/>
            flies away in death, as from the prison-house and chains of the <lb/>
            body; whose passage to the gods can we conceive to have <lb/>
            been readier than that of Scipio ? Wherefore, to be afflicted at <lb/>
            this his departure, I fear, would be the part rather of an <lb/>
            envious person than of a friend. But if, on the other hand, <lb/>
            this be rather the truth, that the death of the soul and of the <lb/>
            body is one and the same, and that no consciousness remains; <lb/>
            as there is no advantage in death, so certainly there is no <lb/>
            evil. For when consciousness is lost, it becomes the same <lb/>
            as if he had never been born at all; yet, both we ourselves <lb/>
            are glad, and this state, as long as it shall exist, will rejoice <lb/>
            that he was born. Wherefore (as I said above) with him <lb/>
            indeed all ended well: with myself, less happily; for it had <lb/>
            been more equitable that, as I entered upon life first, I should <lb/>
            likewise first depart from it. But yet I so enjoy the recollection <lb/>
            of our friendship, that I seem to have lived happily because I <lb/>
            lived with Scipio: with whom I had a common anxiety on pub- <lb/>
            lie and private affairs, and with whom my life both at home <lb/>
            and abroad was associated, and there existed that, wherein con- <lb/>
            sists the entire strength of friendship, an entire agreement of <lb/>
            inclinations, pursuits, and sentiments.* That character for wis- <lb/>
            dom, therefore, which Fannius a little while ago mentioned, does <lb/>
            not so delight me, especially since it is undeserved, as the hope <lb/>
            that the recollection of our friendship will last for ever. And <lb/>
            it is the more gratifying to me, because scarcely in the history <lb/>
            of the world are three or four pairs of friends mentioned <lb/>
            by name;† and I indulge in the hope that the friendship <lb/>
            of Scipio and Lælius will be known to posterity in this class.- <lb/>

            if, as your custom is concerning other matters when your <lb/>

            fact, when I was endeavouring to prevail with you, Fannius <lb/>
            anticipated me : wherefore you will confer a very great <lb/>
            favour on both of us.</p>
          <p>V. LÆLIUS. I indeed should not object, if I could feel <lb/>
            confidence in myself ; for not only is the subject a splendid <lb/>
            one, but we, as Fannius said, have nothing to do. But who <lb/>
            am I ? or what ability is there in me for this ? This is the <lb/>
            practice of scholars, and of Grecian scholars, that a subject <lb/>
            be given them on which they are to dispute, however <lb/>
            suddenly. It is a great undertaking, and requires no little <lb/>
            practice. Wherefore, as to what may be said on the subject <lb/>
            of friendship, I recommend you to seek it from those who pro- <lb/>
            fess such things.* I can only urge you to prefer friendship <lb/>
            to all human possessions ; for there is nothing so suited to <lb/>
            our nature, so well adapted to prosperity or adversity. But <lb/>
            first of all, I am of opinion, that except amongst the virtuous, <lb/>
            friendship cannot exist: I do not analyse this principle too <lb/>
            closely, as they do who inquire with too great nicety into those <lb/>
            things, perhaps with truth on their side, but with little ge- <lb/>
            neral advantage ; for they maintain that there is no good <lb/>
            man but the wise man. Be it so ; yet they define wisdom to be <lb/>
            such as no mortal has ever attained to: whereas we ought to <lb/>
            contemplate these things which exist in practice and in <lb/>
            common life, and not the subjects of fictions or of our own <lb/>
            wishes. I would never pretend to say that Caius Fabricius, <lb/>
            :larius Curius, and Titus Coruncanius, whom our ancestors <lb/>
            esteemed wise, were wise according to the standard of these <lb/>
            moralists. Wherefore let them keep to themselves the name <lb/>
            of wisdom, both invidious and unintelligible ; and let them <lb/>
            allow that these were, good men—nay, they will not even do <lb/>
            that; they will declare that this cannot be granted except to <lb/>
            a wise man. Let us therefore proceed with our dull genius, <note type="footnote"> * The Greek sophists, like the modern Italians, professed to inproviso <lb/>

            as they say. Those who so conduct themselves, and so live <lb/>
            that their honour, their integrity, their justice, and liberality <lb/>
            are approved; so that there is not in them any covetousness, <lb/>
            or licentiousness, or boldness; and that they are of great <lb/>
            consistency, as those men whom I have mentioned above ;- <lb/>
            let us consider these worthy of the appellation of good men, <lb/>
            as they have been accounted such, because they follow (as far <lb/>
            as men are able) nature, which is the best guide of a good <lb/>
            life.* For I seem to myself to have this view, that we are <note type="footnote"> * “ A person when he speaks of Nature, should know distinctly what he <lb/>
            means. The word carries with it a sort of intermediate authority; and he <lb/>
            who uses it amiss, may connect that authority with rules and actions which <lb/>
            are little entitled to it. There are few senses in which the word is used <lb/>
            that do not refer, however obscurely, to God; and it is for that reason <lb/>
            that the notion of authority is connected with the word. ' The very name <lb/>
            of Nature implies that it must owe its birth to some prior agent, or, to <lb/>
            speak properly, signifies in itself nothing.' Milton, Christ. Doct. p. 14. Yet, <lb/>
            unmeaning as the term is, it is one of which many persons are very fond, <lb/>
            whether it be that their notions are really indistinct, or that some purposes <lb/>
            are answered by referring to the obscurity of Nature rather than to God. <lb/>
            ‘ Nature has decorated the earth with beauty and magnificence,' ‘ Nature <lb/>
            has furnished us with joints and limbs,' are phrases sufficiently unmeaning, <lb/>
            and yet I know not that they are likely to do any other harm than to give <lb/>
            currency to the common fiction. But when it is said that ‘ Nature teaches <lb/>
            us to adhere to truth,' ' Nature condemns us for dishonesty or deceit,' <lb/>
            ‘ Men are taught by Nature that they are responsible beings,' there is con- <lb/>
            siderable danger that we have both fallacious and injurious notions of the <lb/>
            authority which thus teaches or condemns us upon this subject, it were <lb/>
            well to take the advice of Boyle :—‘ Nature,' he says, ‘ is sometimes indeed <lb/>
            commonly taken for a kind of semi-deity. In this sense it is best not to <lb/>
            use it at all.' (See Inquiry into the vulgarly received notions of Nature.) <lb/>
            It is dangerous to induce confusion into our ideas respecting our relation- <lb/>
            ship with God. </note><note type="footnote"> " A law of nature is a very imposing phrase ; and it might be supposed, <lb/>
            from the language of some persons, that nature was an independent legis- <lb/>
            latress, who had sat and framed laws for the government of mankind. <lb/>
            Nature is nothing; yet it would seem that men do sometimes practically <lb/>
            imagine that a 'law of nature' possesses proper and independent autho- <lb/>
            rity ; and it may be suspected that with some, the notion is so palpable <lb/>
            and strong, that they set up the authority of ' the law of nature' without <lb/>
            reference to the will of God, or perhaps in opposition to it. Even if <lb/>
            notions like these float in the mind only with vapoury indistinctness, a <lb/>
            correspondent indistinctness of moral notions is likely to ensue. Every <lb/>
            man should make to himself the rule never to employ the word nature <lb/>
            when he speaks of ultimate moral authority. A law possesses no authority; <lb/>
            the authority rests only in the legislator, and as nature makes no laws, a <lb/>
            Jaw of nature involves no obligation but that which is imposed by the <lb/>
            Divine will.”-Dymond's Essays, Essay I. Chapter II. </note> <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>

            so formed by nature, that there should be a certain social <lb/>
            tie among all ; stronger, however, as each approaches <lb/>
            nearer to us. Accordingly, citizens are preferable to <lb/>
            foreigners, and relations to strangers ; for with the latter, <lb/>
            nature herself has created a friendly feeling, though this has <lb/>
            not sufficient strength. For in this respect friendship is <lb/>
            superior to relationship, because from relationship benevo- <lb/>
            lence can be withdrawn, and from friendship it cannot: for <lb/>
            with the withdrawal of benevolence the very name of friend- <lb/>
            ship is done away, while that of relationship remains. Now <lb/>
            how great the power of friendship is, may be best gathered <lb/>
            from this consideration, that out of the boundless society of <lb/>
            the human race, which nature herself has joined together, <lb/>
            friendship is a matter so contracted, and brought into so <lb/>
            narrow a compass, that the whole of affection is confined to <lb/>
            two, or at any rate to very few.</p>
          <p>VI. Now friendship is nothing else than a complete union <lb/>
            of feeling on all subjects, divine and human, accompanied by <lb/>
            kindly feeling and attachment ; than which, indeed, I am not <lb/>
            aware whether, with the exception of wisdom, anything <lb/>
            better has been bestowed on man by the immortal gods. <lb/>
            Some men prefer riches, others good health, others influence, <lb/>
            others again honours, many prefer even pleasures : the last, <lb/>
            indeed, is the characteristic of beasts ; while the former are <lb/>
            fleeting and uncertain, depending not so much on our own <lb/>
            purpose, as on the fickleness of fortune. Whereas those who <lb/>
            place the supreme good in virtue, therein do admirably : but <lb/>
            this very virtue itself both begets and constitutes friendship; <lb/>
            nor without this virtue can friendship exist at all. Now let <lb/>
            us define this virtue according to the usage of life, and of <lb/>
            our common language ; and let us not measure it, as certain <lb/>
            learned persons do, by pomp of language ; and let us include <lb/>
            among the good those who are so accounted-the Paulli, the <lb/>
            Gates, the Galli, the Scipios, and the Phili ; with these men <lb/>
            ordinary life is content: and let us pass over those who <lb/>
            are nowhere found to exist. Amongst men of this kind, <lb/>
            therefore, friendship finds facilities so great that I can <lb/>
            scarcely describe them. In the first place-to whom can <lb/>
            life be “ worth living," as Ennius says, who does not repose <lb/>
            ton the mutual kind feeling of some friend ? What can be <lb/>
            more delightful than to have one to whom you can speak on <lb/>
            <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP VII.]</note>. all subjects just as to yourself? Where would be the great <lb/>
            enjoyment in prosperity, if you had not one to rejoice in it <lb/>
            equally with yourself? And adversity would indeed be <lb/>
            difficult to endure, without some one who would bear it even <lb/>
            with greater regret than yourself. In short, all other objects <lb/>
            that are sought after, are severally suited to some one single <lb/>
            purpose : riches, that you may spend them ; power, that you <lb/>
            may be courted; honours, that you may be extolled; <lb/>
            pleasures, that you may enjoy them ; good health, that you <lb/>
            may be exempt from harm, and perform the functions of the <lb/>
            body. Whereas friendship comprises the greatest number of <lb/>
            objects possible : wherever you turn yourself, it is at hand ; <lb/>
            shut out of no place, never out of season, never irksome ; <lb/>
            and therefore we do not use fire and water, as they say, on <lb/>
            more occasions than we do friendship. And I am not now <lb/>
            speaking of common-place cr ordinary friendship (though <lb/>
            even that brings delight and benefit), but of real and true <lb/>
            friendship, such as belonged to those of whom very few are <lb/>
            recorded : for prosperity, friendship renders more brilliant; <lb/>
            and adversity more supportable, by dividing and communi- <lb/>
            cating it.*</p>
          <p>VII. And while friendship embraces very many and great <lb/>
            advantages, she undoubtedly surpasses all in this, that she <lb/>
            shines with a brilliant hope over the future, and never suffers <lb/>
            the spirit to be weakened or to sink. Besides, he who looks <lb/>
            on a true friend, looks as it were upon a kind of image of <lb/>
            himself: wherefore friends, though absent, are still present; <note type="footnote"> * “ The sympathies of virtuous minds when not warmed by the breath of <lb/>
            friendship, are too faint and cold to satisfy the social cravings of our nature, <lb/>
            their compassion is too much dissipated by the multiplicity of its objects <lb/>
            and the varieties of distress to suffer it to flow long in one channel, while <lb/>
            the sentiments of congratulation are still more slight and superficial. A <lb/>
            transient tear of pity, or a smile of complacency equally transient, is all we <lb/>
            can usually bestow on the scenes of happiness or of misery which we meet <lb/>
            with in the paths of life. But man naturally seeks for a closer union, a <lb/>
            more permanent conjunction of interests, a more intense reciprocation of <lb/>
            feeling; he finds the want of one or more with whom he can trust the <lb/>
            secrets of his heart, and relieve himself by imparting the interior joys and <lb/>
            sorrows with which every human breast is fraught. He seeks, in short, <lb/>
            another self, a kindred spirit whose interest in his welfare bears some pro- <lb/>
            portion to his own, with whom he may lessen his cares by sympathy, and <lb/>
            multiply his pleasures by participation.”-Hall's Funeral Sermon for <lb/>

            though in poverty, they are rich ; though weak, yet in the <lb/>
            enjoyment of health ; and, what is still more difficult to <lb/>
            assert, though dead they are alive ; so entirely does the <lb/>
            honour, the memory, the regret of friends attend them ; from <lb/>
            which circumstance, the death of the one seems to be happy, <lb/>
            and the life of the other praiseworthy : nay, should you <lb/>
            remove from nature the cement of kind feelings, neither a <lb/>
            house nor a city will be able to stand ; even the cultivation <lb/>
            of the land will not continue. If it be not clearly perceived <lb/>
            how great is the power of friendship and concord, it can be dis- <lb/>
            tinctly inferred from quarrels and dissensions; for what house <lb/>
            is there so established, or what state so firmly settled, that may <lb/>
            not utterly be overthrown by hatred and dissension ? from <lb/>
            which it may be determined how much advantage there is in <lb/>
            friendship. They relate, indeed, that a certain learned man <lb/>
            of Agrigentum* promulgated in Greek verses the doctrine, <lb/>
            that all things which cohere throughout the whole world, and <lb/>
            all things that are the subjects of motion, are brought <lb/>
            together by friendship, and are dispelled by discord ; and <lb/>
            this principle all men understand, and illustrate by their <lb/>
            conduct. Therefore, if at any time any act of a friend has <lb/>
            been exhibited, either in undergoing or in sharing dangers, <lb/>
            who is there that does not extol such an act with the highest <lb/>
            praise ? What shouts of applause were lately heard through <lb/>
            the whole theatre, on the occasion of a new play by my <lb/>
            guest and friend, Marcus Pacuvius, when the king, being <lb/>
            ignorant which of them was Orestes, Pylades said he was <lb/>
            Orestes, that he might be put to death instead of him ; but <lb/>
            Orestes, as was the fact, solemnly maintained that he was the <lb/>
            man ? They stood up and applauded in an imaginary case : <lb/>
            what must we suppose they would have done in a real one <lb/>
            Nature herself excellently asserted her rightful power, when <lb/>
            tnen pronounced that to be rightly done in another, which <lb/>
            they could not do themselves. Thus far I seem to have been <lb/>
            able to lay down what are my sentiments concerning friend- <lb/>
            ship. If anything remains (and I fancy there is much), ask <lb/>
            of those, if you please, who practise such discussions.</p>
          <p>FANNIUS. But we would rather hear it from you ; although <note type="footnote"> * Empedocles, a philosopher, poet, and historian of Agrigentum in <lb/>

            1 have often asked such questions, and heard their opinions, <lb/>
            and that not without satisfaction, yet what we desire is the <lb/>
            somewhat different thread of your discourse.-SCÆVOLA. You <lb/>
            would say so still more, Fannius, if you had been present <lb/>
            lately in the gardens of Scipio, when the subject of Govern- <lb/>
            ment was discussed. What an able pleader was he then on <lb/>
            the side of justice against the subtle argument of Philus !— <lb/>
            FANNIUS. Nay, it was an easy task for the most just of men <lb/>
            to uphold the cause of justice.-SCÆVOLA. What shall we <lb/>
            say then of friendship ? Would it not be easy for him to <lb/>
            eulogize it, who, for maintaining it with the utmost fidelity, <lb/>
            steadiness, and integrity, has gained the highest glory ?</p>
          <p>VIII. LÆLIUS. Why, this is using force against one : for <lb/>
            what matters it by what kind of request you compel me ? <lb/>
            You certainly do compel me. For to oppose the wishes of <lb/>
            one's sons-in-law, especially in a good matter, is not only <lb/>
            hard, but it is not even just. After very often, then, reflect- <lb/>
            ing on the subject of friendship, this question seems to me <lb/>
            especially worthy of consideration, whether friendship has <lb/>
            become an object of desire, on account of weakness or want, <lb/>
            so that by giving and receiving favours, each may receive <lb/>
            from another, and mutually repay, what he is himself in- <lb/>
            capable of acquiring. Or whether this is only a property of <lb/>
            friendship ; whilst there is another cause, higher and nobler, <lb/>
            and more directly derived from nature herself ? For love <lb/>
            (from which friendship takes its name) is the main motive for <lb/>
            the union of kind feelings: for advantages truly are often <lb/>
            derived from those who are courted under a pretence of <lb/>
            friendship, and have attention paid them for a temporary <lb/>
            purpose. In friendship there is nothing false, and nothing <lb/>
            pretended ; and whatever belongs to it is sincere and spon- <lb/>
            taneous. Wherefore friendship seems to me to have sprung <lb/>
            rather from nature than from a sense of want, and more from <lb/>
            an attachment of the mind with a certain feeling of affection, <lb/>
            than from a calculation how much advantage it would afford. <lb/>
            And of what nature indeed it is, may be observed in the <lb/>
            case of certain beasts ; for they love their offspring up to a <lb/>
            certain time, and are loved by them in such a way that their <lb/>
            emotions are easily discovered. And this is much more evi- <lb/>
            dent in man. In the first place, from that affection which <lb/>
            subsists between children and parents, which cannot be de- <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin">[CHAP IX.</note><lb/>
            stroyed without detestable wickedness : next, where a similar <lb/>
            feeling of love has existed, if we have met with any one with <lb/>
            whose character and disposition we sympathize, because we <lb/>
            appear to discover in him a certain effulgence as it were of <lb/>
            integrity and virtue. For nothing is more amiable than virtue, <lb/>
            nothing which more strongly allures us to love it, seeing that <lb/>
            because of their virtue and integrity we can in a certain <lb/>
            degree love those whom we have never seen. Who can <lb/>
            mention the name of Caius Fabricius, and Marius Curius, <lb/>
            otherwise than with love and affection, though he never saw <lb/>
            them ? Who can forbear hating Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius <lb/>
            Cassius, and Spurius Mælius ? Against two generals we had <lb/>
            a struggle for empire in Italy, I mean Pyrrhus and Hannibal ; <lb/>
            towards the former, on account of his honourable conduct, <lb/>
            we bear not a very hostile disposition; while this state will <lb/>
            always detest the latter for his cruelty.</p>
          <p>IX. Now if such be the influence of integrity, that we <lb/>
            love it even in those whom we have never seen, and, what is <lb/>
            much more, even in an enemy, what wonder if men's feelings <lb/>
            are affected when they seem to discover the goodness and <lb/>
            virtue of those with whom they may become connected by <lb/>
            Intercourse ? although love is confirmed by the reception of <lb/>
            kindness, and by the discovery of an earnest sympathy, and <lb/>
            by close familiarity ; which things being added to the first <lb/>
            emotion of the mind and the affections, there is kindled a large <lb/>
            amount of kindly feeling. And if any imagine that this <lb/>
            proceeds from a sense of weakness, so that there shall bd <lb/>
            secured a friend, by whom a man may obtain that which he <lb/>
            wants, they leave to friendship a mean indeed, and, if I may <lb/>
            so speak, anything but respectable origin, when they make <lb/>
            her to be born of indigence and want: were this the case, <lb/>
            then in proportion as a man judged that there were the least <lb/>
            resources in himself, precisely in that degree would he be best <lb/>
            qualified for friendship: whereas the fact is far otherwise. <lb/>
            For just as a man has most confidence in himself, and as he <lb/>
            is most completely fortified by worth and wisdom, so that he <lb/>
            needs no one's assistance, and feels that all his resources <lb/>
            reside in himself; in the same proportion he is most highly <lb/>
            distinguished for seeking out and forming friendships. For <lb/>
            what did Africanus want of me ? nothing whatever ; nor <lb/>
            indeed did I need aught from him : but I loved him from <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP X.]</note> <lb/>
            admiration of his excellence; lie in turn perhaps was at- <lb/>
            tached to me from some high opinion which he entertained <lb/>
            of my character, and association fostered our affection. But <lb/>
            although many and great advantages ensued, yet it was <lb/>
            not from any hope of these that the causes of our attachment <lb/>
            sprang: for as we are beneficent and liberal, not to exact <lb/>
            favour in return (for we are not usurers in kind actions), but <lb/>
            by nature are inclined to liberality, thus I think that friend- <lb/>
            ship is to be desired, not attracted by the hope of reward, but <lb/>
            because the whole of its profit consists in love only. From <lb/>
            such opinions, they who, after the fashion of beasts, refer <lb/>
            everything to pleasure, widely differ: and no great wonder, <lb/>
            since they cannot look up to anything lofty, magnificent, <lb/>
            or divine, who cast all their thoughts on an object so mean <lb/>
            and contemptible. Therefore let us exclude such persons <lb/>
            altogether from our discourse; and let us ourselves hold this <lb/>
            opinion, that the sentiment of loving, and the attachment of <lb/>
            kind feelings, are produced by nature, when the evidence of <lb/>
            virtue has been established; and they who have eagerly sought <lb/>
            the latter, draw nigh and attach themselves to it, that they <lb/>
            may enjoy the friendship and character of the individual they <lb/>
            have begun to love, and that they may be commensurate and <lb/>
            equal in affection, and more inclined to confer a favour than <lb/>
            to claim any return. And let this honourable struggle be <lb/>
            maintained between them ; so not only will the greatest <lb/>
            advantages be derived from friendship, but its origin from <lb/>
            nature rather than from a sense of weakness, will be at once <lb/>
            more impressive and more true. For if it were expediency <lb/>
            that cemented friendships, the same when changed would <lb/>
            dissolve them; but because nature can never change, there- <lb/>
            fore true friendships are eternal. Thus you see the origin <lb/>
            of friendship, unless you wish to make some reply to these <lb/>
            views.—FANNIUS. Xay, go on, Lælius, for I answer for <lb/>
            Scæola here (who is my junior) on my own authority.- <lb/>
            SCÆVOLA. You do right ; wherefore let us attend.</p>
          <p>X. LAELIUS. Listen, then, my excellent friends, to the <lb/>
            discussion which was very frequently held by me and Scipio <lb/>
            on the subject of friendship; although he indeed used to say <lb/>
            that nothing was more difficult than that friendship should <lb/>
            continue to the end of life; for it often happened, either that <lb/>
            the same course was not expedient to both parties, or that <pb n="186"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note> <lb/>
            they held different views of politics : he also remarked that <lb/>
            the characters of men often changed; in some cases by <lb/>
            adversity, in others by old age becoming oppressive; and he <lb/>
            derived an authority for such notions from a comparison with <lb/>
            early life, because the strongest attachment of boys are con- <lb/>
            stantly laid aside with the prætexta; even if they should main- <lb/>
            tain it to manhood, yet sometimes it is broken off by rivalry, <lb/>
            for a dowried wife, or some other advantage, which they <lb/>
            cannot both attain. And even if men should be carried on <lb/>
            still further in their friendship, yet that feeling is often <lb/>
            undermined, should they fall into rivalry for preferments ; <lb/>
            for there is no greater enemy to friendship than covet- <lb/>
            ousness of money, in most men, and even in the best, an <lb/>
            emulous desire of high offices and glory; in consequence of <lb/>
            which the most bitter enmities have often arisen between the <lb/>
            dearest friends. For great dissensions, and those in most <lb/>
            instances justifiable, arise, when some request is made of <lb/>
            friends which is improper ; as, for instance, that they should <lb/>
            become either the ministers of their lust or their supporters <lb/>
            in the perpetration of wrong ; and they who refuse to do so, <lb/>
            it matters not however virtuously, yet are accused of dis- <lb/>
            carding the claims of friendship by those persons whom they <lb/>
            are unwilling to oblige; but they who dare to ask anything <lb/>
            of a friend, by their very request seem to imply that they <lb/>
            would do anything for the sake of that friend: by the coin- <lb/>
            plaining of such persons, not only are long-established <lb/>
            intimacies put an end to, but endless animosities are engen- <lb/>
            dered. All these many causes, like so many fatalities, are <lb/>
            ever threatening friendship, so that, he said, to escape them <lb/>
            all, seemed to him a proof not merely of wisdom, but even of <lb/>
            good fortune.</p>
          <p>XI. Wherefore let us first consider, if you please, how <lb/>
            far love ought to proceed in friendship. If Coriolanus had <lb/>
            friends, were they bound to carry arms against their country <lb/>
            with Coriolanus? Were their friends bound to support <lb/>
            Viscellinus or Spurius Mælius when they aimed at the <lb/>
            sovereignty? Nay, in the case of Tiberius Gracchus, when <lb/>
            disturbing the commonwealth, we saw him totally abandoned <lb/>
            by Quintus Tubero, and other friends of his own standing. <lb/>
            But in the case of Caius Blossius, of Cumæ, the friend of <lb/>
            cur family, Scævola, when he had come to me (then attend- <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note> <lb/>
            ing upon the consuls Lænas and Rupilius in their council) to <lb/>
            sue for pardon, he brought forward his plea, that he es- <lb/>
            teemed Tiberius Gracchus so highly, that he thought it his <lb/>
            duty to do whatever he wished. So I said, "What, even if he <lb/>
            wished you to set fire to the capitol?" " He never would <lb/>
            have thought of that," he replied. " But what if he had ?" <lb/>
            " Then I would have complied." You see what an abominable <lb/>
            speech: and, by Hercules, he did so, and even worse than he <lb/>
            said; for he did not follow the mad schemes of Tiberius <lb/>
            Gracchus, but in fact headed them, and did not act as the <lb/>
            accomplice of his violence, but even as the captain. There- <lb/>
            fore in consequence of such rashness, being terrified by a <lb/>
            new prosecution, he fled precipitately into Asia, joined the <lb/>
            enemy, and atoned to the commonwealth by a punishment <lb/>
            just and severe. It is no excuse therefore for a fault; that <lb/>
            you committed it for a friend's sake; for since the belief in <lb/>
            another's excellence was that which conciliated friendship, it <lb/>
            is hard for friendship to continue when you have apostatized <lb/>
            from virtue. Now if we shall lay it down as right, either to <lb/>
            concede to friends whatever they wish, or to obtain from <lb/>
            them whatever we wish, we must have indeed consummate <lb/>
            wisdom, if such a course leads to no vice. But we are speak- <lb/>
            ing of those friends who are before our eyes, whom we see <lb/>
            around us, or else whom we know by report, and with whom <lb/>
            every-day life is familiar: from that class we must take our <lb/>
            instances, and, above all, from those who make the nearest <lb/>
            approaches to wisdom. We see that Papus Æmilius was the <lb/>
            intimate friend of Caius Luscinus (so we have learned from <lb/>
            our fathers) ; that they were twice consuls together, and col- <lb/>
            leagues in the censorship ; and that at the same time Marcus <lb/>
            Curius and Titus Coruncanius were most intimate with <lb/>
            them and with each other, is a matter of history, and there- <lb/>
            fore we cannot even suspect that any one of these ever <lb/>
            asked his friend anything that was contrary to their honour, <lb/>
            their oath, and the interest of the state: for what reason is <lb/>
            there for making such a remark about men like them ? I <lb/>
            am convinced, had any of them made the request, lie would <lb/>
            not have obtained it, for they were men of the purest prin- <lb/>
            ciple ; besides, it would be equally as wrong to agree to <lb/>
            any such request when made, as to make it. And yet Caius <lb/>
            Caibo and Caius Cato both took the part of Tiberius Grac- <pb n="188"/>
            <note type="margin">[CHAP XII.</note><lb/>
            chus, as did his brother Cains, at that time by no means an <lb/>
            agitator, but now one of the most violent</p>
          <p>XII. Let this law therefore be established in friendship, <lb/>
            viz., that we should neither ask things that are improper, nor <lb/>
            grant them when asked; for it is a disgraceful apology, and <lb/>
            by no means to be admitted, as well in the case of other <lb/>
            offences, as when any one avows he has acted against the state <lb/>
            for the sake of a friend.* For we are placed, 0 Fannius and <lb/>
            Scævola, in such a position, that we ought to see from a <lb/>
            distance the future calamities of the commonwealth; for the <lb/>
            practice of our ancestors has already in some respect swerved <lb/>
            from its career and course. Tiberius Gracchus has endeavoured <lb/>
            to obtain the sovereignty, or rather he reigned for a few <lb/>
            months. Had the Roman people ever heard or witnessed <lb/>
            anything similar? Even after his death, his friends and <lb/>
            relations maintained his cause; and what malice they exer- <lb/>
            cised against Publius Scipio, I cannot relate without tears ; <lb/>
            for, owing to the recent punishment of Tiberius Gracchus, <lb/>
            we withstood Carbo by whatever means we could. And con- <lb/>
            cerning the tribuneship of Caius Gracchus, what we have to <lb/>
            expect I have no disposition to anticipate; still the movement <lb/>
            is creeping on, and when once it has begun, it rushes with <lb/>
            increasing precipitation to destruction: for already you have <lb/>
            seen with regard to the ballot, what great mischief has been <note type="footnote"> * " The knowledge concerning good respecting society, doth handle it <lb/>
            also, not simply alone, but comparatively ; whereunto belongeth the <lb/>
            weighing of duties between person and person, case and case, particular <lb/>
            and public ; as we see in the proceeding of Lucius Brutus against his own <lb/>
            sons, which was so much extolled ; yet what was said ? <lb/>
            ' Infelix utcunque ferent ea facta minores.' <lb/>
            So the case was doubtful, and had opinion on both sides. Again, we see <lb/>
            when M. Brutus and Cassius invited to a supper certain whose opinions <lb/>
            they meant to feel whether they were fit to be made their associates, and <lb/>
            cast forth the question touching the killing of a tyrant being a usurper, <lb/>
            they were divided in opinion ; some holding that servitude was the extreme <lb/>
            of evils, and others that tyranny was better than a civil war ; and a number <lb/>
            of the like eases there are of comparative duty, amongst which, that of <lb/>
            all others is the most frequent, where the question is of a great deal of <lb/>
            good to ensue of a small injustice which Jason of Thessalia determined <lb/>
            against the truth. ' Aliqua sunt injuste facienda ut multa juste Her! <lb/>
            possint.' But the reply is good : ' Auctorem præsentis justitiæ habes <lb/>
            sponsorem future non habes.' Men must pursue things which are just at <lb/>
            present, and leave the future to a divine Providence."—Bacon's Advane. <lb/>

            caused—first, by the Gabinian law,* and two years after by <lb/>
            the Caspian: for already I fancy I see the people separated <lb/>
            from the senate, and the most important measures carried at <lb/>
            the caprice of the mob; for more people will learn how <lb/>
            such things may be done, than how they may be resisted. <lb/>
            Wherefore do I say this? Because without allies no one <lb/>
            attempts anything of the kind ; therefore this should be <lb/>
            pressed on all good men, that if inadvertently they should <lb/>
            have fallen unawares into friendships of that character, they <lb/>
            must not think themselves bound in such a manner that they <lb/>
            must not desert their friends when doing wrong in any impor- <lb/>
            tant matter : at the same time, punishment should be enacted <lb/>
            against the wicked; and not less severe for those who have <lb/>
            followed another, than for those who have been themselves <lb/>
            the leaders of the wickedness. Who was more illustrious <lb/>
            in Greece than Themistocles ? who more powerful ? And <lb/>
            when he, as general in the Persian war, had freed Greece <lb/>
            from slavery, and through unpopularity had been driven into <lb/>
            exile, lie could not endure the injustice of his ungrateful <lb/>
            country, which he ought to have borne; he acted the same <lb/>
            part as Coriolanus had done among us twenty years before. <lb/>
            No one was found to support these men against their coun- <lb/>
            try; accordingly, they both committed suicide. Wherefore <lb/>
            such a combination with wicked men not only must not be <lb/>
            sheltered under the excuse of friendship, but should rather <lb/>
            be visited with every kind of punishments: so that no one <lb/>
            may think it permitted to him to follow a friend, even <lb/>
            when waging war against his country. And as matters <lb/>
            have begun to proceed, I know not whether that will not <lb/>
            some day occur. To me, however, it is no less a cause of <lb/>
            anxiety in what state the republic shall be after my death, <lb/>
            than in what state it is at this day.</p>
          <p>XIII. Let this, therefore, be established as a primary law <lb/>
            concerning friendship, that we expect from our friends only <lb/>
            what is honourable, and for our friends' sake do what is <lb/>
            honourable; that we should not wait till we are asked; that <lb/>
            zeal be ever ready, and reluctance far from us; but that we <note type="footnote"> * Lex Gabinia de Comitiis, by Aulus Gabinius, the tribune, A.U.C. 614. <lb/>

            take pleasure in freely giving our advice; that in our <lb/>
            friendship, the influence of our friends, when they give good <lb/>
            advice, should have great weight; and that this be em- <lb/>
            ployed to admonish not only candidly, but even severely, if <lb/>
            the case shall require, and that we give heed to it when so <lb/>
            employed; for, as to certain persons, whom I understand to <lb/>
            have been esteemed wise men in Greece, I am of opinion <lb/>
            that some strange notions were entertained by them; but <lb/>
            there is nothing which they do not follow up with too great <lb/>
            subtlety: among the rest, that excessive friendships should <lb/>
            be avoided, lest it should be necessary for one to feel <lb/>
            anxiety for many: that every one has enough, and more <lb/>
            than enough, of his own affairs ; that to be needlessly impli- <lb/>
            cated in those of other people is vexatious ; that it was most <lb/>
            convenient to hold the reins of friendship as loose as pos- <lb/>
            sible, so as either to tighten or slacken them when you <lb/>
            please; for they argue, that the main point towards a happy <lb/>
            life, is freedom from care, which the mind cannot enjoy if <lb/>
            one man be, as it were, in travail for others. Nay, they <lb/>
            tell us that some are accustomed to declare, still more <lb/>
            unfeelingly (a topic which I have briefly touched upon just <lb/>
            above), that friendships should be cultivated for the purpose <lb/>
            of protection and assistance, and not for kind feeling or <lb/>
            affection; and therefore the less a man possesses of inde- <lb/>
            pendence, and of strength, in the same degree he most <lb/>
            earnestly desires friendships; that thence it arises that <lb/>
            women seek the support of friendship more than men, and <lb/>
            the poor more than the rich, and persons in distress,* rather <lb/>
            than those who are considered prosperous. Admirable phi- <lb/>
            losophy ! for they seem to take away the sun from the world <lb/>
            who withdraw friendship from life; for we receive nothing <lb/>
            better from the immortal gods, nothing more delightful: for <lb/>
            what is this freedom from care ?-in appearances, indeed, <lb/>
            flattering; but, in many cases, in reality to be disdained. <lb/>
            Nor is it reasonable to refuse to undertake any honourable <lb/>
            matter or action lest you should be anxious, or to lay it aside <lb/>
            when undertaken; for if we fly from care, we must fly <lb/>
            from virtue also ; for it is impossible that she can, without <note type="footnote"> * Calamitosi, the ruined ; from calamitas, a hail-storm, which breaks <lb/>

            some degree of distress, feel contempt and detestation for <lb/>
            qualities opposed to herself; just as kindheartedness for <lb/>
            malice, temperance for profligacy, and bravery for cowardice. <lb/>
            Accordingly, you see that upright men are most distressed <lb/>
            by unjust actions; the brave with the cowardly; the virtu- <lb/>
            ous with the profligate : and, therefore, this is the character- <lb/>
            istic of a well-regulated mind, both to be well pleased with <lb/>
            what is excellent, and to be distressed with what is contrary. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if trouble of mind befall a wise man (and as- <lb/>
            suredly it will, unless we suppose that all humanity is <lb/>
            extirpated from his mind), what reason is there why we <lb/>
            should altogether remove friendship from life, lest because of <lb/>
            it we should take upon ourselves some troubles ? for what <lb/>
            difference is there (setting the emotions of the mind aside), <lb/>
            I do not say between a man and a beast, but between a man <lb/>
            and a stone, or log, or anything of that kind ? For they do <lb/>
            do not deserve to be listened to, who would have virtue to be <lb/>
            callous, and made of iron, as it were; which indeed is, as in <lb/>
            other matters, so in friendship also, tender and susceptible; <lb/>
            so that friends are loosened, as it were, by happy events, <lb/>
            and drawn together by distresses.</p>
          <p>XIV. Wherefore the anxiety which has often to be felt for <lb/>
            a friend, is not of such force that it should remove friendship <lb/>
            from the world, any more than that the virtues, because they <lb/>
            bring with them certain cares and troubles, should therefore <lb/>
            be discarded. For when it produces friendship (as I said <lb/>
            above), should any indication of virtue shine forth, to which <lb/>
            a congenial mind may attach and unite itself-when this <lb/>
            happens, affection must necessarily arise. For what is so <lb/>
            unmeaning as to take delight in many vain things, such as <lb/>
            preferments, glory, magnificent buildings, clothing and <lb/>
            adornment of the body ; and not to take an extreme delight <lb/>
            in a soul endued with virtue, in such a soul as can either <lb/>
            love, or (so to speak) love in return ? for there is nothing <lb/>
            more delightful than the repayment of kindness, and the <lb/>
            interchange of devotedness and good offices. Now if we add <lb/>
            this, which may with propriety be added, that there is <lb/>
            nothing which so allures and draws any object to itself a.;; <lb/>
            congeniality does friendship; it will of course be admitted <lb/>
            as true, that the good must love the good. and unite them to <lb/>
            themselves, just as if connected by relationship and nature; <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin">[BOOK XIV.</note> <lb/>
            for nothing is more apt to seek and seize on its like than <lb/>
            nature. Wherefore this certainly is clear, Tannins and <lb/>
            Scævola (in my opinion), that among the good a liking for <lb/>
            the good is, as it were, inevitable; and this indeed is ap- <lb/>
            pointed by nature herself as the very fountain of friendship.* <lb/>
            But the same kind disposition belongs also to the multitude; <lb/>
            for virtue is not inhuman, or cruel, or haughty, since she is <lb/>
            accustomed to protect even whole nations, and to adopt the <lb/>
            best measures for their welfare, which assuredly she would <lb/>
            not do did she shrink from the affection of the vulgar. And <lb/>
            to myself, indeed, those who form friendships with a view <lb/>
            to advantage, seem to do away with its most endearing <lb/>
            bond ; for it is not so much the advantage obtained through <lb/>
            a friend, as the mere love of that friend, which delights ; and <lb/>
            then only what has proceeded from a friend becomes de- <lb/>
            lightful, if it has proceeded from zealous affection : and that <lb/>
            friendship should be cultivated from a sense of necessity, is <lb/>
            so far from being the case, that those who, being endowed <lb/>
            with power and wealth, and especially with virtue (in <lb/>
            which is the strongest support of friendship), have least <lb/>
            need of another, are most liberal and generous. Yet I am <lb/>
            not sure whether it is requisite that friends should never <lb/>
            stand in any need; for wherein would any devotedness of <lb/>
            mine to him have been exerted, if Scipio had never stood <lb/>
            in need of my advice or assistance at home or abroad ? <note type="footnote"> * "Of all attachments to an individual, that which is founded altogether <lb/>
            upon esteem and approbation of his good conduct and behaviour, con- <lb/>

            respectable. Such friendships arising, not from a constrained sympathy, <lb/>
            not from a sympathy which has been assumed and rendered habitual for <lb/>
            for the sake of convenience and accommodation, but from a natural sym- <lb/>
            pathy, from an involuntary feeling that the persons to whom we attach <lb/>
            ourselves are the natural and proper objects of esteem and approbation, <lb/>

            advantage on friendship.</p>
          <p>XV. Persons, therefore, who are wallowing in indulgence, <lb/>
            will not need to be listened to if ever they shall descant <lb/>
            upon friendship, which they have known neither by ex- <lb/>
            perience nor by theory. For who is there, by the faith of <lb/>
            gods and men, who would desire, on the condition of his <lb/>
            loving no one, and himself being loved by none, to roll in <lb/>
            affluence, and live in a superfluity of all things? For this is <lb/>
            the life of tyrants, in which undoubtedly there can be no <lb/>
            confidence, no affection, no steady dependence on attach- <lb/>
            ment ; all is perpetually mistrust and disquietude-there is <lb/>
            no room for friendship. For who can love either him <lb/>
            whom he fears, or him by whom he thinks he himself is <lb/>
            feared ? Yet are they courted, solely in hypocrisy, for a <lb/>
            time ; because, if perchance (as it frequently happens) they <lb/>
            have been brought low, then is it perceived how desti- <lb/>
            tute they were of friends. And this, they say, Tarquin* <lb/>
            expressed ; that when going into exile, he found out whom <lb/>
            he had as faithful friends, and whom unfaithful ones, since <lb/>
            then he could no longer show gratitude to either party; <lb/>
            although I wonder that, with such haughtiness and im- <lb/>
            patience of temper, he could find one at all. And as the <lb/>
            character of the individual whom I have mentioned could <lb/>
            not obtain true friends, so the riches of many men of rank <lb/>
            exclude all faithful friendship; for not only is fortune blind <lb/>
            herself, but she commonly renders blind those whom she <lb/>
            embraces. Accordingly such persons are commonly puffed <lb/>
            up with pride and insolence, nor can any thing be found <lb/>
            more intolerable than a fortunate fool. And thus, indeed, <lb/>
            one may observe, that those who before were of agreeable <lb/>
            character, by military command, by preferment, by pros- <lb/>
            perity, are changed, and old friendships are despised by <lb/>
            them, and new ones cherished. For what can be more <lb/>
            foolish than, when men are possessed of great influence by <lb/>
            their wealth, power, and resources, to procure other things <lb/>
            which are procured by money-horses, slaves, rich apparel, <note type="footnote"> * Tarquinius, surnamed Superbus, the seventh and last king of Rome. <lb/>

            costly vases-and not to procure friends, the most valuable <lb/>
            and fairest furniture of life, if I may so speak; for while <lb/>
            they are procuring those things, they know not for whom <lb/>
            they are procuring them, nor for whose sake they are <lb/>
            labouring.* For every one of these things belongs to him <lb/>
            who is most powerful, whereas the possession of his friend- <lb/>
            ships is preserved to every one steadfast and secure; so that <lb/>
            if those things are preserved which are, as it were, the gifts <lb/>
            of fortune, yet a life unadorned and abandoned by friends <lb/>
            cannot possibly be happy. But on this head enough.</p>
          <p>XVI. But it is required to lay down what limits there are <lb/>
            in friendship, and, as it were, what bounds of loving, con- <lb/>
            cerning which I see three opinions held, of none of which I <lb/>
            approve :-the first, that we should be affected towards a <lb/>
            friend in the same manner as towards ourselves; the second, <lb/>
            that our goodwill towards our friends should exactly and <lb/>
            equally answer to their goodwill towards us; the third, that <lb/>
            at whatever value a man sets himself, at the same he should <lb/>
            be estimated by his friends. To none of these three opinions <lb/>
            do I entirely assent. For the first one is not true, that as a <lb/>
            man feels towards himself so he should be disposed towards <lb/>
            his friend. For how many things, which for our own sake <lb/>
            we should never do, do we perform for the sake of our <lb/>
            friends ? To ask favours of unworthy persons, to supplicate <lb/>
            them, to inveigh bitterly against any one, and to accuse him <lb/>
            with great vehemence, which in our own cases cannot be done <lb/>
            creditably, in the case of our friends are most honourably <lb/>
            done; and there are many cases in which good men subtract <lb/>
            many things from their own interests, or allow them to be <lb/>
            subtracted, that their friends, rather than themselves, may <lb/>
            enjoy them. The second opinion is that which limits friend- <lb/>
            ship to an equality of kind actions and kind wishes: this is <lb/>
            indeed to reduce friendship to figures too minutely and penu- <lb/>
            riously, so that there may be a balance of received and paid. <lb/>
            True friendship seems to be far too rich and affluent for that, <lb/>
            and not to observe, narrowly, lest it should pay more than it <lb/>
            receives: nor need it be feared lest anything should be lost <note type="footnote"> * In this, as in many other passages, Cicero has written the sentiment <lb/>
            and almost the language of the Scriptures : " He heapeth up riches, and <lb/>
            knoweth not who shall gather them." </note> <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XVII.]</note><lb/>
            or fall to the ground, or lest more than what is fair should <lb/>
            be accumulated on the side of friendship. But the third <lb/>
            limitation is most detestable, that at whatever value a man <lb/>
            sets on himself, at that value he should be estimated by his <lb/>
            friends; for often, in certain persons, either their spirit is <lb/>
            too humble, or their hope of improving their condition too <lb/>
            desponding; it is not, therefore, the part of a friend to be <lb/>
            towards him what he is to himself; but rather to use every <lb/>
            effort, and to contrive to cheer the prostrate spirit of his <lb/>
            friend. and to encourage better hopes and thoughts. There- <lb/>
            fore I must lay down some other limit of true friendship, as <lb/>
            soon as I shall have stated what Scipio was accustomed <lb/>
            above all things to reprehend. He used to declare that no <lb/>
            speech could be found more hostile to friendship, than his <lb/>
            who had said that a man ought so to love as if one day he <lb/>
            would come to hate.* Nor, indeed, could he be induced to <lb/>
            believe that this, as was supposed, was said by Bias, † who <lb/>
            was considered one of the seven wise men ; but that it was <lb/>
            the opinion of some wicked or ambitious man, or one who <lb/>
            sought to bring everything under his own power. For in <lb/>
            what manner can any one be a friend to him to whom he <lb/>
            thinks he may possibly become an enemy ? Moreover, it will <lb/>
            follow that he desires and wishes his friend to do wrong as <lb/>
            often as possible, that he may afford him, as it were, so many <lb/>
            handles for reproach. And, again, at the right conduct and <lb/>
            advantage of his friends he will necessarily be tormented, <lb/>
            grieved, and jealous. Wherefore this precept, to whomso- <lb/>
            ever it belongs, is powerful only for the destruction of friend- <lb/>
            ship. This, rather, should have been the precept, that we <lb/>
            should employ such carefulness in forming our friendships, <lb/>
            that we should not any time begin to love the man whom we <lb/>
            could ever possibly hate. Moreover, if we have been but <lb/>
            unfortunate in our selection, Scipio was of opinion that this <lb/>
            should be submitted to, rather than that a time of alienation <lb/>
            should ever be contemplated.</p>
          <p>XVII. I think, therefore, we must adopt these limitations, <lb/>
            that when the character of friends is correct, then there <note type="footnote"> * Si aliquando esset osurus. This sentiment is taken from the Ajax of <lb/>

            should be a community between them of all things, of pur- <lb/>
            pose and of will, without any exception; so that, even if by <lb/>
            any chance it has happened that the less honourable wishes <lb/>
            of our friends have to be forwarded, in which either their <lb/>
            life is concerned, or their reputation, then you may decline a <lb/>
            little from the straight path,* provided only extreme infamy <lb/>
            do not follow; for there is a point to which indulgence may <lb/>
            be granted to friendship: yet reputation must not be disre- <lb/>
            garded; nor ought we to esteem the good will of our fellow <lb/>
            countrymen as an engine of small value in the administration <lb/>
            of the state, although to seek it by fawning and flattering is <lb/>
            mean indeed ; yet virtue, on which affection is consequent, <lb/>
            should by no means be rejected. But frequently (for I <lb/>
            return to Scipio, the whole of whose discourse was concern- <lb/>
            ing friendship) he used to complain, that in all other things <lb/>
            men were comparatively careful; so that every man could <lb/>
            tell how m'any goats or how many sheep he possessed, yet <lb/>
            how many friends he had he could not tell; and in procuring <lb/>
            the former, men employed carefulness, while in selecting <lb/>
            their friends they were negligent, nor had they, as it were, <lb/>
            any signs or marks by which they determined who were <lb/>
            suited for friendship. The steadfast, then, and the steady, <lb/>
            and the consistent are to be selected, of which class of <lb/>
            persons there is a great scarcity; and, in truth, it is difficult <lb/>
            for any one to judge, unless after he is experienced. Now <lb/>
            the trial must be made in actual friendship; thus friendship <lb/>
            outstrips judgment, and removes the power of making ex- <lb/>
            periments. It is the part, therefore, of a prudent man, to <lb/>
            check the impetus of his kindly feeling as he would his <lb/>
            chariot, that we may have our friendships, like our horses, <note type="footnote"> * " Something indeed, not unlike the doctrine of the casuists, seems to <lb/>
            have been attempted by several philosophers. There is something of this <lb/>
            kind in the third book of Cicero's Offices, where he endeavours, like a <lb/>
            casuist, to give rules for our conduct in many nice cases in which it is <lb/>
            difficult to determine whereabouts the point of propriety may lie. It ap- <lb/>
            pears too from many passages in the same book, that several other philoso- <lb/>
            phers had attempted something of the same kind before him. Neither he <lb/>
            nor they, however, appeared to have aimed at giving a complete system of <lb/>
            this sort, but only meant to show how situations may occur in which it is <lb/>
            doubtful whether the highest propriety of conduct consists in observing or <lb/>
            in receding from what in ordinary cases are the rules of duty."—Smith's <lb/>
            Moral Philosophy, Part vii. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP XVIII.]</note><lb/>
            fully proved, when the character of our friends has been in <lb/>
            some measure tested. Of some, it is often discovered in <lb/>
            small sums of money how void of worth they are. Some, <lb/>
            whom a small sum could not influence, are discovered in the <lb/>
            case of a large one. But, even if some shall be found who <lb/>
            think it sordid to prefer money to friendship, where should <lb/>
            we find those who do not place above friendship high digni- <lb/>
            ties, magistracies, military command, civil authorities, and <lb/>
            influence? so that, when on the one side these objects have <lb/>
            been proposed, and the claim of friendship on the other, <lb/>
            they would not far prefer the former. For nature is too weak <lb/>
            to despise the possession of power; for, even if they have <lb/>
            attained it by the slighting of friendship, they think the act <lb/>
            will be thrown into the shade, because friendship was not <lb/>
            overlooked without strong grounds. Therefore real friend- <lb/>
            ships are found with most difficulty among those who are in- <lb/>
            vested with high offices, or in business of the state. For <lb/>
            where can you find the man who would prefer his friend's <lb/>
            advancement to his own? And why? For to pass over <lb/>
            these matters, how grievous, how impracticable to most men <lb/>
            does participation in afflictions appear! to which it is not <lb/>
            easy to find the man who will descend. Although Ennius * <lb/>
            truly says, "A sure friend is discerned in an unsure matter." <lb/>
            Yet these two charges of inconstancy and of weakness con- <lb/>
            demn most men: either in their prosperity they despise a <lb/>
            friend, or in his troubles they desert him.</p>
          <p>XVIII. He who, therefore, shall have shown himself in both <lb/>
            cases as regards friendship, worthy, consistent, and steadfast; <lb/>
            such a one we ought to esteem of a class of persons ex- <lb/>
            tremely rare, nay, almost godlike. Now, the foundation of <lb/>
            that steadfastness and constancy, which we seek in friendship, <lb/>
            is sincerity. For nothing is steadfast which is insincere. <lb/>
            Besides, it is right that one should be chosen who is frank and <lb/>
            good-natured, and congenial in his sentiments; one, in fact, who <lb/>
            is influenced by the same motives ; all which qualities have a <lb/>
            tendency to create sincerity. For it is impossible for a wily and <note type="footnote"> * Ennius, a Latin poet, born at Rudii, in Calabria. He wrote, in heroic <lb/>
            verse, eighteen books of the Annals of the Roman Republic, which are <lb/>
            frequently quoted by Cicero. He was the intimate friend of Cato and <lb/>
            Scipio ; the former of whom he accompanied when quæstor of Sardinia. <lb/>
            His death took place about 170 years before the Christian era. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP XIX.</note><lb/>
            tortuous disposition to be sincere. Nor in truth can the man <lb/>
            who has no sympathy from nature, and who is not moved by the <lb/>
            same considerations, be either attached or steady. To the same <lb/>
            requisites must be added, that he shall neither take delight in <lb/>
            bringing forward charges, nor believe them when they arise; <lb/>
            all which causes belong to that consistent principle, of which <lb/>
            now for some time I have been treating. Thus the remark <lb/>
            is true, which I made at first, that friendship can only exist <lb/>
            among the good : for it is the part of a good man (whom at <lb/>
            the same time we may call a wise man) to observe these two <lb/>
            rules in friendship: first, that there shall be nothing pre- <lb/>
            tended or simulated (for even to hate openly better becomes <lb/>
            the ingenuous man, than by his looks to conceal his sen <lb/>
            timents); in the next place, that not only does he repel <lb/>
            charges when brought (against his friends) by any one, but <lb/>
            is not himself suspicious, ever fancying that some infidelity <lb/>
            has been committed by his friend. To all this there should <lb/>
            be added a certain suavity of conversation and manners, <lb/>
            affording as it does no inconsiderable zest to friendship. <lb/>
            Now solemnity and gravity on all occasions, certainly, carry <lb/>
            with them dignity; but friendship ought to be easier and <lb/>
            more free and more pleasant, and tending more to every kind <lb/>
            of politeness and good nature.</p>
          <p>XIX. But there arises on this subject a somewhat difficult <lb/>
            question ; whether ever new friends, if deserving friendship, <lb/>
            are to be preferred to old ones, just as we are wont to prefer <lb/>
            young colts to old horses ? a perplexity unworthy of a man; <lb/>
            for there ought to be no satiety of friendship as of other <lb/>
            things : every thing which is oldest (as those wines which <lb/>
            bear age well) ought to be sweetest; and that is true which <lb/>
            is sometimes said, "many bushels of salt must be eaten <lb/>
            together," before the duty of friendship can be fulfilled. But <lb/>
            new friendships, if they afford a hope that, as in the case of <lb/>
            plants which never disappoint, fruits shall appear, such are <lb/>
            not to be rejected; yet the old one must be preserved in its <lb/>
            proper place, for the power of age and custom is exceedingly <lb/>
            great; besides, in the very case of the horse, which I just <lb/>
            mentioned, if there is no impediment, there is no one who <lb/>
            does not more pleasurably use that to which he is accustomed <lb/>
            than one unbroken and strange to him; and habit asserts its <lb/>
            power, and habit prevails, not only in the case of this, which <pb n="199"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XX.]</note><lb/>
            is animate, but also in the cases of those things which are <lb/>
            inanimate, since we take delight in the very mountainous or <lb/>
            woody scenery among which we have long dwelt. But it is <lb/>
            of the greatest importance in friendship that the superior <lb/>
            should be on an equality with the inferior. For there often <lb/>
            are instances of superiority, as was the case with Scipio, one, <lb/>
            so to speak, of our own herd. He never ranked himself <lb/>
            above Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or other friends of <lb/>
            an inferior grade. But his brother, Quintus Maximus, a <lb/>
            distinguished man, though by no means equal to himself, <lb/>
            simply because he was the elder, he treated as his superior, <lb/>
            and he wished all his friends should receive additional dignity <lb/>
            through him. And this conduct should be adopted and <lb/>
            imitated by all, so that if they have attained to any excellence <lb/>
            in worth, genius, or fortune, they should communicate them <lb/>
            with their friends, and share them with their connexions; so <lb/>
            that if men have been born of humble parentage, or if they <lb/>
            have kinsmen less powerful than themselves, either in mind <lb/>
            or in fortune, they should increase the consequence of such <lb/>
            persons, and be to them a source of credit and of dignity; as <lb/>
            in works of fiction, they who for some time, through igno- <lb/>
            rance of their origin and descent, have been in a state of <lb/>
            servitude, when they have been discovered and found out to <lb/>
            be the sons of gods or kings, yet retain their affection for the <lb/>
            shepherds, whom for many years they looked upon as their <lb/>
            parents. And this assuredly is much rather to be observed <lb/>
            in the case of parents that are real and undoubted. For the <lb/>
            fruit of talent, and worth, and every excellence, is gathered <lb/>
            most fully when it is bestowed on every one most nearly <lb/>
            connected with us.</p>
          <p>XX. As therefore those who are superior in the con- <lb/>
            nexion of friendship and of union, ought to put themselves <lb/>
            on a level with their inferiors; so ought the inferiors not to <lb/>
            grieve that they are surpassed by their friends either in <lb/>
            genius, or fortune, or rank : whereas most of them are always <lb/>
            either complaining of something, or even breaking out into <lb/>
            reproaches; and so much the more if they think they have <lb/>
            anything which they can say was done by them in an <lb/>
            obliging and friendly manner with some exertion on their <lb/>
            part. A disgusting set of people assuredly they are who are <lb/>
            ever reproaching you with their services ; which the man on <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin">[CHAP XX.</note><lb/>
            whom they are conferred ought indeed to remember, but he <lb/>
            who conferred them ought not to call them to mind. Where <lb/>
            fore, as those who are superior ought in the exercise of <lb/>
            friendship to condescend; so, in a measure, they ought to <lb/>
            raise up their inferiors. For there are some persons who <lb/>
            render friendships with them annoying, while they fancy <lb/>
            they are slighted: this does not commonly happen except to. <lb/>
            those who think themselves liable to be slighted ; and from <lb/>
            this belief they require to be relieved, not only by your pro- <lb/>
            fessions but by your actions. Now, first of all, so much <lb/>
            advantage is to be bestowed on each as you yourself can pro- <lb/>
            duce; and in the next place, as much as he whom you love <lb/>
            and assist can bear; for you could not, however eminent you <lb/>
            might be, bring all your friends to the very highest honour; <lb/>
            just as Scipio had power to make Publius Rutilius consul, <lb/>
            but could not do the same for his brother Lucius: indeed, <lb/>
            even if you have the power to confer what you please on <lb/>
            another, yet you must consider what he can bear. On the <lb/>
            whole, those connections only can be considered as friend- <lb/>
            ships, when both the dispositions and age have been es- <lb/>
            tablished and matured. Nor, when persons have been in <lb/>
            early life attached to hunting or tennis, are they bound to <lb/>
            make intimates of those whom at that time they loved, as <lb/>
            being endowed with the same taste : for on that principle, <lb/>
            our nurses and the tutors of our childhood, by right of <lb/>
            priority, will claim the greatest part of our affection ; who, <lb/>
            indeed, should not be neglected, but possess our regard in <lb/>
            some other manner: otherwise friendships could not continue <lb/>
            steadfast. For dissimilar habits and dissimilar pursuits <lb/>
            ensue; the dissimilarity of which severs friendships: it is <lb/>
            for no other cause that the good cannot be friends of the <lb/>
            worthless, or the worthless of the good ; but that there is <lb/>
            between them the greatest difference that can subsist of cha- <lb/>
            racters and pursuits. For in friendships this precept may <lb/>
            be properly laid down, not to let ill-regulated affection (as <lb/>
            often is the case) thwart and impede the great usefulness of <lb/>
            friends : nor in truth (to revert to fiction could Neoptolemus* <note type="footnote"> * Neoptolemus, a surname of Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles. He was so <lb/>
            called because he came to the Trojan war in the last year of the siege of <lb/>
            Troy. According to the fates, Troy could not be taken without his assist- <lb/>
            ance. His mother, Deidamia, was the daughter of Lycomedcs, king of the <lb/>
            island of Scyros. </note> <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXI.]</note> <lb/>
            have taken Troy if he had been inclined to listen to Lyco- <lb/>
            medes, with whom he had been brought up, when with many <lb/>
            tears he sought to prevent his journey : and often important <lb/>
            occasions arise, so that you must bill farewell to your friends; <lb/>
            and he who would hinder them, because he cannot easily <lb/>
            bear the regret for their loss, such an one is both weak and <lb/>
            effeminate by nature, and on that ground unjust in his friend- <lb/>
            ship. And in every case it is necessary to consider, both <lb/>
            what you would ask of a friend, and what favour you would <lb/>
            permit to be obtained from yourself.</p>
          <p>XXI. There is a kind of calamity also, sometimes inevi- <lb/>
            table, in the discarding of friendships. For at length our <lb/>
            discourse descends, from the intimacies of the wise, to ordinary <lb/>
            friendships. The faults of friends often break out as well on <lb/>
            the friends themselves as on strangers; and yet the disgrace <lb/>
            of such persons must redound to their friends: such friend- <lb/>
            ships therefore must be dissolved by the intermission of <lb/>
            intercourse, and (as I have heard Cato say) should be <lb/>
            ripped rather than rent; unless some intolerable sense of <lb/>
            wrong has been kindled, so that it is neither right, nor cre- <lb/>
            ditable, nor possible that an estrangement and separation <lb/>
            should not take place immediately. But if any change of <lb/>
            character or pursuits (as commonly happens) shall have taken <lb/>
            place, or quarrel arisen with respect to political parties (for <lb/>
            I speak now, as I observed a little before, not of the friend- <lb/>
            ships of the wise but of such as are ordinary), we should <lb/>
            have to be cautious, lest not only friendships be found to be <lb/>
            laid aside, but even animosity to have been incurred; for <lb/>
            nothing can be more disgraceful than to be at war with him <lb/>
            with whom you have lived on terms of friendship. From <lb/>
            his friendship with Quintus Pompey,* Scipio had withdrawn <lb/>
            himself on my accountt (as you know); moreover, on account <lb/>
            of the dissension which existed in the republic, he was <lb/>
            estranged from my colleague Metellus; † on both occasions he <note type="footnote"> * Quintus Pompeius a consul, who carried on war against the Numan. <lb/>
            tines, and made an ignominious treaty. He is the first of that noble family <lb/>
            of whom mention is made. </note><note type="footnote"> f Meo nomine, on my acceunt; desiderium expresses a "feeling of <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[CHAP XXII.</note> <lb/>
            acted with dignity and decision, and with an offended but <lb/>
            not bitter feeling. Wherefore, in the first place, pains must <lb/>
            be taken that there be no alienation of friends ; but if aught <lb/>
            of the kind shall have occurred, that that friendship should <lb/>
            seem rather to have died away than to have been violently <lb/>
            destroyed. In truth we must take care lest friendship turn <lb/>
            into bitter hostilities; from which quarrels, hard language, <lb/>
            and insults are produced, and yet if they shall be bearable, <lb/>
            they must be borne; and thus much honour should be paid <lb/>
            to an old friendship, that he shall be in fault who inflicts the <lb/>
            injury, and not he who suffers it. On the whole, against all <lb/>
            such faults and inconveniences there is one precaution and <lb/>
            one provision, that we should not begin to love too hastily, <lb/>
            nor love unworthy persons. Now they are worthy of friend- <lb/>
            ship in whom there exists a reason why they should be loved ; <lb/>
            a rare class (for in truth all that is excellent is rare); nor is <lb/>
            aught more difficult than to find anything which in every <lb/>
            respect is perfect of its kind: but most men recognize no. <lb/>
            thing as good in human affairs but what is profitable; and <lb/>
            with their friends, as with cattle, they love those most espe- <lb/>
            dally from whom they hope they will receive most ad- <lb/>
            vantage ; and thus they are destitute of that most beautiful <lb/>
            and most natural friendship, which is desirable for itself and <lb/>
            of itself; nor do they exemplify to themselves what and how <lb/>
            powerful this quality of friendship is. For every one loves <lb/>
            himself, not that he may exact from himself some reward of <lb/>
            his affection, but that, for his own sake, every one is dear to <lb/>
            himself. And unless this same principle be transferred to <lb/>
            friendship, a true friend will never be found; for sueh an <lb/>
            one is, as it were, a second self. Now, if this is apparent in <lb/>
            beasts, birds, fishes, creatures of the field, tame and wild, that <lb/>
            first they love themselves (for the principle is alike born with <lb/>
            every living thing); in the next place, that they seek out and <lb/>
            desire some creatures of the same species to which they may <lb/>
            unite themselves, and do this with desire, and with a kind of <lb/>
            resemblance to human love; how much more naturally does <lb/>
            this take place in man by nature, who not only loves himself, <lb/>
            but seeks for another whose soul he may so mingle with his <lb/>
            own, as almost to create one person out of two ?</p>
          <p>XXII. Yet most men, perversely, not to say shamelessly, <lb/>
            desire to have a friend, such as they themselves are unable <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXII.]</note><lb/>
            to be ; and allowances which they themselves make not for <lb/>
            their friends, they require from them. Now, the fair thing <lb/>
            is, first that a man himself should be good, and then that he <lb/>
            should seek another like to himself. Amongst such persons, <lb/>
            there may be established that solidity of friendship which I <lb/>
            have long been treating on : when men are united by <lb/>
            benevolent feeling, they will first of all master those <lb/>
            passions to which others are slaves ; next, they will take <lb/>
            pleasure in equity and justice, and the one will undertake <lb/>
            everything for the other ; nor will the one ever ask of the <lb/>
            other anything but what is honourable and right : nor will <lb/>
            they only mutually regard and love each other, but even have <lb/>
            a feeling of respect; for he removes the greatest ornament <lb/>
            of friendship, who takes away from it respect. Accordingly, <lb/>
            there is a pernicious error in those who think that a free in- <lb/>
            dulgence in all lusts and sins is extended in friendship. <lb/>
            Friendship was given us by nature as the handmaid of <lb/>
            virtues, and not as the companion of our vices : that since, <lb/>
            alone and unaided, virtue could not arrive at the highest <lb/>
            attainments, she might be able to do so when united and <lb/>
            associated with another*; and if such a society between any <lb/>
            persons either exists or has existed, or is likely to do so, <lb/>
            their companionship is to be esteemed, in respect of the chief <lb/>
            good in life, most excellent and most happy. This, I say, is <lb/>
            that association in which all things exist which men deem <lb/>
            worthy the pursuit;—reputation, high esteem, peace of mind, <lb/>
            and cheerfulness ; so that where these blessings are present, <lb/>
            life is happy, and without these cannot be so. And whereas <note type="footnote"> * “But it is not merely as a source of pleasure, or as a relief from pain, <lb/>
            that virtuous friendship is to be coveted, it is as much recommended by its <lb/>
            utility. He who has made the acquisition of a judicious and sympathizing <lb/>
            friend, may be said to have doubled his mental resources : by associating <lb/>
            an equal, perhaps a supreme mind with his own, he has provided the <lb/>
            means of strengthening his reason, of perfecting his counsels, of discerning <lb/>
            and correcting his errors. He can have recourse at all times to the judg- <lb/>
            ment and assistance of one who, with the same power of discernment with <lb/>
            himself, comes to the decision of a question with a mind neither harassed <lb/>
            with the perplexities, nor heated with the passions which so frequently <lb/>
            obscure the perception of our true interests. Next to the immediate <lb/>
            guidance of God by his Spirit, the counsel and encouragement of virtuous <lb/>
            and enlightened friends afford the most powerful aid in the encounter of <lb/>
            temptation and in the career of duty.”—Hall's Funeral Sermon for <lb/>
            Dr. Ryland. </note> <lb/>

            this is the best and highest of objects, if we would gain it, <lb/>
            attention must be paid to virtue ; without which we can <lb/>
            neither obtain friendship nor anything worthy of pursuit: <lb/>
            indeed, should this be disregarded, they who think they <lb/>
            possess friends, too late find that they are mistaken, when <lb/>
            some grievous misfortune compels them to make the trial. <lb/>
            Wherefore (for I must say it again and again) when you <lb/>
            have formed your judgment, then it behoves you to give <lb/>
            your affections ; and not when you have given your affec- <lb/>
            tions, then to form the judgment ; but while in many cases <lb/>
            we suffer for our carelessness, so especially in choosing and <lb/>
            cultivating friends ; for we adopt a preposterous plan, and <lb/>
            set about doing what has been already done, which we are <lb/>
            forbidden by the old proverb to do. For, being entangled on <lb/>
            every side, either by daily intercourse or else by kind offices, <lb/>
            suddenly, in the middle of our course, on some offence <lb/>
            arising, we break off our friendships altogether.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Wherefore so much the more is this great negli- <lb/>
            gence to be blamed in a matter of the highest necessity. For <lb/>
            friendship is the only point in human affairs, concerning the <lb/>
            benefit of which, all with one voice agree ; although by <lb/>
            many virtue herself is despised, and is said to be a mere <lb/>
            bragging and ostentation. Many persons despise riches ; for, <lb/>
            being content with a little, moderate food and a moderate <lb/>
            style of living delights them ; as to high offices, in truth, <lb/>
            with the ambitious desire of which some men are inflamed, <lb/>
            how many men so completely disregard them, that they think <lb/>
            nothing is more vain and more trifling : and likewise there <lb/>
            arc those who reckon as nothing other things which to <lb/>
            some men seem worthy of admiration :* concerning friend- <note type="footnote"> * Among these may be mentioned Lord Bacon, not only as one of those <lb/>
            to whom Cicero here is especially referring, but as one who himself held <lb/>
            the highest office to which the ambition of a subject could aspire. In his <lb/>
            eleventh essay entitled, " Of great place," he makes the following observa- <lb/>
            tions : “Men in great place are thrice servants; servants of the sovereign or <lb/>
            state, servants of fame, and servants of business, so as they have no freedom <lb/>
            neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times. It is <lb/>
            a strange desire to seek power and lose liberty, or to seek power over others <lb/>
            and to lose power over a man's self. The rising unto place is laborious, <lb/>
            and by pains men come to greater pains, and it is sometimes base and by <lb/>
            indignities men come to dignities. The standing is slippery, and the regress <lb/>
            is either a downfall or a' least an eclipse, which is a melancholy tiling; </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXIII.]</note><lb/>
            ship, all to a man have the same opinion. Those who have <lb/>
            devoted themselves to political affairs, and those who find <lb/>
            pleasure in knowledge and learning, and those who transact <lb/>
            their own affairs at their leisure, and lastly, those who have <lb/>
            given themselves wholly up to pleasure, feel that with <lb/>
            out friendship life is nothing, at least if they are inclined <lb/>
            in any degree to live respectably ; for somehow or other, <lb/>
            friendship entwines itself with the life of all men, nor does <lb/>
            it suffer any mode of spending our life to be independent of <lb/>
            itself. Moreover, if there is any one of such ferocity and <lb/>
            brutality of nature, that he shuns and hates the intercourse <lb/>
            of mankind, such as we have heard that one Timont was at <lb/>
            Athens ; yet even he cannot possibly help looking out for <lb/>
            some one on whom he may disgorge the venom of his ill- <lb/>
            nature. And this would be most clearly decided if something <lb/>
            of this kind could happen-that some god should remove us <lb/>
            from the crowded society of men, and place us somewhere <lb/>
            in solitude, and there supplying us with abundance <lb/>
            and plenty of all things which nature requires, yet <lb/>
            should take from us altogether the opportunity of seeing a <lb/>
            human being ; who would then be so insensible that he <lb/>
            could endure such a life, and from whom would not solitude <lb/>
            take away the enjoyment of all pleasure ? Accordingly, <lb/>
            there is truth in that which I have heard our old men relate <lb/>
            to have been commonly said by Archytas of Tarentum,t and <note type="footnote">‘cum non sis qui fueris non esse cur velis vivere.’ Nay, retire men cannot <lb/>
            when they would, neither will they when it were reason, but are impatient <lb/>
            of privateness, even in age and sickness which require the shadow; like old <lb/>
            townsmen that will be still sitting at their street deor, though thereby they <lb/>
            offer age to scorn. Certainly, great persons had need to borrow other men's <lb/>
            opinions to think themselves happy, for if they judge by their own feeling <lb/>
            they cannot find it, but if they think with themselves what other men think <lb/>
            of them, and that other men would fain be as they are, then they are happy <lb/>
            as it were by report, when perhaps they find the contrary within; for they <lb/>
            are the first that find their own griefs, though they be the last that find their <lb/>
            own faults. Certainly, men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves, <lb/>
            and while they are in the puzzle of business, they have no time to tend <lb/>
            their own health, either of body or mind. ‘Illi mors gravis ineubat qui <lb/>

            principles of our constitution. “Abstracting,” he says, from those affections <lb/>
            which interest us in the happiness of others, and from all the advantages <lb/>
            which we ourselves derive from the social union we are led by a natural <lb/>
            and instinctive desire to associate with our own species. This principle is <lb/>
            easily discernible in the minds of children, and it is common to man with <lb/>
            many of the brutes. After experiencing, indeed, the pleasures of social <lb/>
            life, the influence of habit, and a knowledge of the comforts inseparable <lb/>
            from society, contribute greatly to strengthen the instinctive desire, and <lb/>
            hence some authors have been induced to display their ingenuity by dis- <lb/>
            puting its existence. Whatever opinion we form on this speculative ques- <lb/>
            tion, the desire of society is equally entitled to be ranked among the natural <lb/>
            and universal principles of our constitution. How very powerfully this <lb/>
            principle of action operates, appears from the effects of solitude upon the <lb/>
            mind. We feel ourselves in an unnatural state, and by making companions <lb/>
            of the lower animals, or by attaching ourselves to inanimate objects, strive <lb/>
            to fill up the void of which we are conscious.”—Stewart's Outlines of <lb/>
            Moral Philosophy, part ii. chap. i. </note><note type="footnote"> But while admitting the natural yearning of the human mind for com- <lb/>
            panionship, some modern philosophers, especially those of a graver and <lb/>
            more reflective character, have insisted on the importance of retirement and <lb/>
            frequent solitude. Thus, Dr. Johnson, the great moralist of the last gene- <lb/>
            ration, observes : "The love of retirement has in all ages adhered closely to <lb/>
            those minds which have been most enlarged by knowledge, or elevated by <lb/>
            genius. Those who enjoyed every thing generally supposed to confer hap- <lb/>
            piness, have been forced to seek it in the shades of privacy. Though they <lb/>
            possessed both power and riches, and were therefore surrounded by men <lb/>
            who considered it as their chief interest to remove from them every thing <lb/>
            that might offend their ease, or interrupt their pleasure, they have soon felt <lb/>
            the languor of satiety, and found themselves unable to pursue the race of <lb/>
            life without frequent respirations of intermediate solitude. To produce this <lb/>
            disposition, nothing appears requisite but quick sensibility and active <lb/>
            imagination; for though not devoted to virtue or science, the mau whow </note> <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XXV.]</note> <lb/>
            friendship is various and manifold, and many occasions arc <lb/>
            presented of suspicion and offence, which it is the part of <lb/>
            a wise man sometimes to wink at, sometimes to make light of, <lb/>
            or at others to endure. This one ground of offence must be <lb/>
            mitigated in order that truth and sincerity in friendship may <lb/>
            be preserved ; for friends require to be advised and to be <lb/>
            reproved : and such treatment ought to be taken in a friendly <lb/>
            spirit, when it is kindly meant. But somehow or other it is <lb/>
            very true, what my dear friend Terence says in his Andria :* <lb/>
            " Complaisance begets friends, but truth ill-will." Truth is <lb/>
            grievous, if indeed ill-will arises from it, which is the bane <lb/>
            of friendship. But complaisance is much more grievous, <lb/>

            the same expectations and disappointments, that he will gladly snatch an <lb/>
            hour of retreat to let his thoughts expatiate at large, and seek for that <lb/>
            variety in his own ideas which the objects of sense cannot afford him. <lb/>
            These are some of the motives which have had power to sequester kings <lb/>
            and heroes from the crowds that soothed them with flatteries, or inspirited <lb/>
            them with acclamations. But their efficacy seems confined to the higher <lb/>
            mind, and to operate little upon the common classes of mankind, to whose <lb/>
            conceptions the present assemblage of things is adequate, and who seldom <lb/>
            range beyond those entertainments and vexations which solicit their atten- <lb/>
            tion by pressing on their senses.”—Rambler, No. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> Sir Thomas Brown, also, has a quaint but beautiful passage to the <lb/>
            same effect: " Unthinking heads who have not learned to be alone are in a <lb/>
            prison to themselves, if they be not also with others ; whereas, on the con- <lb/>
            trary, they whose thoughts are in a fair and hurry within, are sometimes <lb/>
            fain to retire into company to be out of the crowd of themselves. He who <lb/>
            must needs have company, must needs have sometimes bad company. Be <lb/>
            able to be alone ; lose not the advantage of solitude and the society of thy- <lb/>
            self; nor be only content but delight to be alone and single with Omni- <lb/>
            presency. He who is thus prepared, the day is not uneasy, nor the night <lb/>
            black unto him. Darkness may bound his eyes, not his imagination. In <lb/>
            his bed he may lie, like Pompey and his sons, in all quarters of the earth ; <lb/>
            may speculate the universe, and enjoy the whole world in the hermitage of <lb/>
            himself. Thus, the old ascetic Christians found a paradise in a desert, and <lb/>
            with little converse on earth, held a conversation in heaven ; thus they <lb/>
            astronomized in caves, and though they beheld not the stars, had the glory <lb/>

            yielding to his faults.* But the greatest of all faults is <lb/>
            chargeable on him who disregards truth, and thus by com. <lb/>
            plaisance is led into dishonesty. Accordingly, in managing <lb/>
            this whole matter, carefulness and diligence must be employed : <lb/>
            first, that our advice may be free from bitterness, and next, <lb/>
            that reproof may be unattended by insult: in our complai- <lb/>
            sance, however (since I gladly adopt the saying of Terence), <lb/>
            let there be a kindness of manner, let flattery, however, the <lb/>
            handmaid of vices, be far removed, since it is not only <lb/>
            unworthy of a friend, but even of a free man : for you live <lb/>
            after one fashion with a tyrant, after another with a friend. <lb/>
            Now where a man's ears are shut against the truth, so that <lb/>
            be cannot hear the truth from a friend, the welfare of such a <lb/>
            one is to be despaired of: for the following remark of Cato <lb/>
            is shrewd, as many of his are, "that bitter enemies deserve <lb/>
            better at the hands of some, than those friends who seem <lb/>
            agreeable : that the former often speak the truth, the latter <lb/>
            never.” And it is an absurd thing, that those who receive <lb/>
            advice, do not experience that annoyance which they ought <lb/>
            to feel, but feel that from which they ought to be free ; for <note type="footnote"> * " The duty which leads us to seek the moral reformation of our friend <lb/>
            wherever we perceive an imperfection that requires to be removed, is, as I <lb/>
            have said, the highest duty of friendship, because it is a duty that has for <lb/>
            its object the highest good which it is in our power to confer ; and he who <lb/>
            refrains from the necessary endeavour, because he fears to give pain to one <lb/>
            whom he loves, is guilty of the same weakness which in a case of bodily <lb/>
            accident or disease would withhold the salutary potion because it is <lb/>
            nauseous, or the surgical operation which is to preserve life, and to preserve <lb/>
            it with comfort, because the use of the instrument which is to be attended <lb/>
            with relief and happiness implies a little momentary addition of suffering. <lb/>
            To abstain from every moral effort of this sort in the mere fear of offending, <lb/>
            is, from the selfishness of the motive, a still greater breach of duty, and <lb/>
            almost, too, a still greater weakness. He whom we truly offend by such <lb/>
            gentle admonitions as friendship dictates, admonitions of which the chief <lb/>
            authority is sought in the very excellence of him whom we wish to make <lb/>
            still more excellent, is not worthy of the friendship which we have wasted <lb/>
            on him ; and if we thus lose his friendship we are delivered from one who <lb/>
            could not be sincere in his past professions of regard, and whose treachery <lb/>
            therefore we might afterwards have had reason to lament. If he be worthy <lb/>

            done that which it was our duty to do, and we shall have the double grati- <lb/>
            fication of witnessing the amendment which we desired, and of knowing <lb/>
            that we have contributed to an effect which was almost like the removal of <lb/>
            a vice from ourselves, or a virtue added to our own moral character.”— <lb/>

            they are not distressed because they have done wrong ; but <lb/>
            take it amiss that they are rebuked : whereas, on the <lb/>
            contrary, they ought to be sorry for their misconduct, and to <lb/>
            be glad at its correction.</p>
          <p>XXV. As, therefore, both to give and to receive advice is <lb/>
            the characteristic of true friendship, and that the one should <lb/>
            perform his part with freedom but not harshly, and the <lb/>
            other should receive it patiently and not with recrimination ; <lb/>
            so it should be considered that there is no greater bane to <lb/>
            friendship than adulation, fawning, and flattery.* For this <lb/>
            vice should be branded under as many names as possible, <lb/>
            being that of worthless and designing men, who say every <lb/>
            thing with a view of pleasing, and nothing with regard to <lb/>
            truth. Now while hypocrisy in all things is blameable (for <lb/>
            it does away with all judgment of truth, and adulterates <lb/>
            truth itself), so especially is it repugnant to friendship, for it <lb/>
            destroys all truth, without which the name of friendship can <lb/>
            avail nothing. For since the power of friendship consists in <lb/>
            this, that one soul is as it were made of many, how could <lb/>
            that take place if there should not be in any one a soul, one <lb/>
            and the same always, but fickle, changeable, and manifold ? <lb/>
            For what can be so pliant, so inconsistent, as the soul of that <lb/>
            man, who veers not only to the feelings and wishes, but even <lb/>
            to the look and very nod of another. " Does any one say, <lb/>
            'No?' so do I; says any, ‘Yes ?' so do I: in a word, I have <note type="footnote"> *“He that is too desirous to be loved," says Dr. Johnson, "will soon <lb/>
            learn to flatter; and when he has exhausted all the variations of honest <lb/>
            praise, and can delight no longer with the civility of truth, he will invent <lb/>
            new topics of panegyric, and break out into raptures at virtues and beauties <lb/>
            conferred by himself. It is scarcely credible to what degree discernment <lb/>
            may be dazzled by the mist of pride, and wisdom infatuated by the in- <lb/>
            toxication of flattery; or how low the genius may descend by successive <lb/>
            gradations of servility, and how swiftly it may fall down the precipice of <lb/>
            falsehood. No man can indeed observe without indignation on what names, <lb/>
            both of ancient and modern times, the utmost exuberance of praise has <lb/>
            been lavished, and by what hands it has been bestowed. It has never yet <lb/>
            been found that the tyrant, the plunderer, the oppressor, the most hateful <lb/>
            of the hateful, the most profligate of the profligate, have been denied any <lb/>
            celebrations which they were willing to purchase, or that wickedness and <lb/>
            folly have not found correspondent flatterers through all their subordi- <lb/>
            nations, except when they have been associated with avarice or poverty, <lb/>
            and have wanted either inclination or ability to hire a panegyrist.”— <lb/>

            charged myself to assent to everything,"* as the same <lb/>
            Terence says ; but he speaks in the character of Gnatho,† <lb/>
            and to select a friend of this character is an act of down- <lb/>
            right folly. And there are many like Gnatho, though his <lb/>
            superiors in rank, fortune, and character ; the flattery of <lb/>
            such people is offensive indeed, since respectability is associ- <lb/>
            ated with duplicity. Now, a fawning friend may be distin- <lb/>
            guished from a true one, and discerned by the employment <lb/>
            of diligence, just as everything which is falsely coloured and <lb/>
            counterfeit, from what is genuine and true. The assembly <lb/>
            of the people, which consists of the most ignorant persons, <lb/>
            yet can decide what difference there is between the seeker <lb/>
            after popular applause, the flatterer and the worthless citizen, <lb/>
            and one who is consistent, dignified, and worthy. With what <lb/>
            flatteries did Curius Papirius lately insinuate himself into <lb/>
            the ears of the assembly, when he sought to pass an act to <lb/>
            to re-elect the tribunes of the people ? I opposed it. But <lb/>
            I say nothing of myself; I speak with greater pleasure con- <lb/>
            cerning Scipio. 0 immortal gods ! what dignity was his ! <lb/>
            what majesty in his speech ! so that you might readily pro- <lb/>
            nounce him the leader of the Roman people, and not their <lb/>
            associate : but you were present, and the speech is still <lb/>
            extant: accordingly, this act, meant to please the people, was <lb/>
            rejected by the votes of the people. But, to return to <lb/>
            myself, you remember when Quintus Maximus, brother of <lb/>
            Scipio, and Lucius Mancius were consuls, how popular the <lb/>
            sacerdotal act of Caius Licinius Crassus seemed to be ; for <lb/>
            the election‡ of the colleges was thereby transferred to the <note type="footnote"> * Shakspeare has exhibited a precisely similar character in the following <lb/>

            presentation of the people. And he first commenced the <lb/>
            practice of turning towards the forum, and addressing the <lb/>
            people.* And yet regard for the immortal gods, under my <lb/>
            advocacy, gained an easy triumph over his plausiblet address. <lb/>
            Now this occurred in my prætorship, five years before I was <lb/>
            consul ; so that that cause was supported rather by its own <lb/>
            importance than by supreme influence.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Now, if upon the stage, that is, before the as- <lb/>
            sembly, where every advantage is given to fictions and <lb/>
            imitations, yet the truth prevails (if only it be set forth and <lb/>
            illustrated); what ought to be the case in friendship, which <lb/>
            is measured according to simple truth ? for in it (as the say- <lb/>
            ing is) ye see an open heart and show your own also; you <lb/>
            can have nothing faithful, nothing certain; and you cannot <lb/>
            love or be loved, since you are uncertain how far it is sin- <lb/>
            cerely done. And yet that flattery, however pernicious it <lb/>
            be, can hurt no one but the man who receives it and is <lb/>
            most delighted with himself. Hence it happens that he <lb/>
            opens his ears widest to Batteries who is a flatterer of him- <lb/>
            self, and takes the highest delight in himself: no doubt <lb/>
            virtue loves herself, for she is best acquainted with herself <lb/>
            and is conscious how amiable she is : but I am not speaking <lb/>
            of virtue, but of a conceit of virtue; for not so many desire <lb/>
            to be endowed with virtue itself, as to seem to be so. Flat- <lb/>
            tery delights such men : when conversation formed to their <lb/>
            wishes is addressed to such persons, they think those deceit- <lb/>
            ful addresses to be the evidence of their merits. This, <lb/>
            therefore, is not friendship at all, when one party is unwilling <lb/>
            to hear the truth, and the other prepared to speak falsely. <lb/>
            Nor would the flattery of parasites in comedies seem to us <lb/>
            facetious, unless there were swaggering soldiers also. -Does <lb/>
            then Thais pay me many thanks ? It was enough to answer <lb/>
            ‘yes, many; but he says ‘infinite.'" The flatterer always <lb/>
            exaggerates that which he, for whose pleasure he speaks, <lb/>
            wishes to be great. Although the flattering falsehood may <lb/>
            have influence with those who themselves allure and invite <lb/>
            it; yet more steady and consistent persons require to be <note type="footnote"> different orders of priests were self-elected, so that the proposed law of <lb/>

            warned that they take care lest they are entrapped by such <lb/>
            crafty flattery; for every one, except the man who is extremely <lb/>
            obtuse, observes the person who openly employs adulation. <lb/>
            But lest the crafty and insidious man should insinuate him- <lb/>
            self, you must be studiously on your guard; for he is not very <lb/>
            easily recognized, seeing that he often flatters by opposing; <lb/>
            and pretending that he quarrels, is fawning all the time, and <lb/>
            at last surrenders himself, and allows himself to be beaten: so <lb/>
            that he who has been deluded may fancy that he has seen <lb/>
            farther than the other; for what can be more disgraceful than <lb/>
            to be deluded ? And lest this happen, we must be more <lb/>
            cautious, as it is said in the Epiclerus, " To-day, above all the <lb/>
            foolish old fellows of the comedy, you will have deceived me <lb/>
            and played upon me in a most amusing manner." For this <lb/>
            is the most foolish character of all in the plays, that of un- <lb/>
            thinking and credulous old men. But I know not how it <lb/>
            is that my address, passing from the friendship of perfect <lb/>
            men, that is of the wise (for I speak of that wisdom which <lb/>
            seems within the reach of man), has digressed into frivo- <lb/>
            lous friendships. Wherefore, let me return to that from <lb/>
            which I set out, and bring these remarks at length to a con- <lb/>
            clusion.</p>
          <p>XXVII. It is virtue, virtue I say, Caius Tannins, and you, <lb/>
            Quintus Mucius, that both wins friendship and preserves it; <lb/>
            for in it is found the power of adapting one's self to circum- <lb/>
            stances, and also steadfastness and consistency;* and when <note type="footnote"> * " The necessity of virtue, then, in every bosom of which we resolve to <lb/>
            share the feelings, would be sufficiently evident, though we were to con- <lb/>
            sider those feelings only; but all the participation is not to be on our part. <lb/>
            We are to place confidence, as well as to receive it ; we are not to be <lb/>
            comforters only, but sometimes too the comforted ; and our own conduct <lb/>
            may require the defence which we are sufficiently ready to afford to the <lb/>
            conduct of our friend. Even with respect to the pleasure of the friendship <lb/>
            itself, if it be a pleasure on which we set a high value, it is not a slight <lb/>
            consideration whether it be fixed on one whose regard is likely to be as <lb/>
            stable as ours, or on one who may in a few months, or perhaps even in a few <lb/>
            weeks, <unclear>withhohl</unclear> from us the very pleasure of that intimacy which before had <lb/>
            been profusely lavished on us. In every one of these respects I need not <lb/>
            point out to you the manifest superiority of virtue over vice. Virtue only <lb/>
            is stable, because virtue only is consistent and the caprice which, under a <lb/>
            momentary impulse, begins an eager intimacy with one, as it began it from <lb/>
            an impulse as momentary with another, will soon find a third, with whom <lb/>
            it may again begin it with the same exclusion, for the moment, of every <lb/>
            previous attachment. Nothing can he juste: than the observation of </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="213"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP XXVII.</note><lb/>
            she has exalted herself and displayed her own effulgence, and <lb/>
            hath beheld the same and recognized it in another, she moves <lb/>
            towards it, and in her turn receives that which is in the other; <lb/>
            from which is kindled love or friendship, for both derive <lb/>
            their name from loving; for to love is nothing else than to be <lb/>
            attached to the person whom you love, without any sense of <lb/>
            want, without any advantage being sought; and yet advantage <lb/>
            springs up of itself from friendship, even though you may <lb/>
            not have pursued it. It was with kind feelings of this de- <lb/>
            scription that I, when young, was attached to those old men, <lb/>
            Lucius Paullus, Marcus Cato, Caius Gallus, Publius Nasica, <lb/>
            and Tiberius Gracchus,* the father-in-law of our friend <lb/>
            Scipio. This is even more strikingly obvious between per- <lb/>
            sons of the same age, as between me and Scipio, Lucius <lb/>
            Furius, Publius Rupilius, and Spurius Mummius : and now <lb/>
            in turn, in my old age I repose in the attachment of younger <lb/>
            men, as in yours and that of Quintus Tubero; nay, I even <note type="footnote"> Rousseau on these hasty starts of kindness, that, ‘he who treats us at first <lb/>
            sight like a friend of twenty years' standing, will very probably at the end <lb/>
            of twenty years treat us as a stranger if we have any important service to <lb/>
            request of him.' </note><note type="footnote"> "If without virtue we have little to hope in stability, have we even, while <lb/>
            the semblance of friendship lasts, much more to hope as to those services of <lb/>
            kindness which we may need from our friends ? The secrets which it may <lb/>
            be of no importance to divulge, all may keep with equal fidelity ; because <lb/>
            nothing is to be gained by circulating what no man would take sufficient <lb/>
            interest in hearing, to remember after it was heard ; but if the secret be of <lb/>
            a kind which, if made known, would gain the favour of some one whose <lb/>
            favour it would <unclear>e</unclear> more profitable to gain than to retain ours, can we <lb/>
            expect fidelity from a mind that thinks only of what is to be gained by <lb/>
            vice, in the great social market of moral feelings, not of what it is right to <lb/>
            do ? Can we expect consolation in our affliction from one who regards <lb/>
            our adversity only as a sign that there is nothing more to be hoped from <lb/>
            our intimacy ; or trust our virtues to the defence of him who defends or <lb/>
            assails, as interest prompts, and who may see his interest in representing <lb/>
            us as guilty of the very crimes with which slander has loaded us ? In <lb/>
            such cases we have no title to complain of the treacheries of friendship ; <lb/>
            for it was not friendship in which we trusted : the treachery is as much the <lb/>
            fault of the deceived as of the deceiver ; we have ourselves violated some <lb/>
            of the most important duties of friendship ; the duties which relate to its <lb/>
            commencement.”—Moral Philosophy, Lect. 89. </note><note type="footnote"> * T. Gracchus, who with his brother C. Gracchus excited great tumults <lb/>

            course of our life and nature is so directed that a new period <lb/>
            is ever arising, it is especially to be wished that with those <lb/>
            comrades with whom you set out, as it were, from the start- <lb/>
            ing, with the same you may, as they say, arrive at the gaol. <lb/>
            But, since human affairs are frail and fleeting, some persons <lb/>
            must ever be sought for whom we may love, and by whom <lb/>
            we may be loved: for when affection and kind feeling are <lb/>
            done away with, all cheerfulness likewise is banished from <lb/>
            existence. To me, indeed, though he was suddenly snatched <lb/>
            away, Scipio still lives, and will always live; for I love the <lb/>
            virtue of that man, and that worth is not yet extinguished : <lb/>
            and not before my eyes only is it presented, who ever had it <lb/>
            in possession, but even with posterity it will be illustrious <lb/>
            and renowned; for never shall any undertake any high <lb/>
            achievements with spirit and hope, without feeling that the <lb/>
            memory and the character of that man should be placed <lb/>
            before him. Assuredly, of all things that either fortune or <lb/>
            nature has bestowed on me, I have none which I can compare <lb/>
            with the friendship of Scipio.* In it I had concurrence in <lb/>
            politics, and in it advice for my private affairs. In it also, <lb/>
            I possessed a repose replete with pleasure. Never in the <lb/>
            slightest degree did I offend him, at least so far as I was <lb/>
            aware; never did I myself hear a word from him that I was <lb/>

            but even our travelling and visits to the country were in <lb/>
            common. For what need I say of our constant pursuits of <lb/>
            knowledge and learning, in which, retired from the eyes of <lb/>
            the world, we spent all our leisure time ? Now, if the recol- <lb/>
            lection and memory of these things had died along with him, <lb/>
            I could in no wise have borne the loss of that most intimate <lb/>
            and affectionate friend; but these things have not perished, <lb/>
            yea, they are rather cherished and improved by reflection <lb/>
            and memory and even if I were altogether bereft of them, <lb/>
            yet would age itself bring me much comfort, for I cannot now <lb/>
            very long suffer these regrets. Now all afflictions, if brief, <lb/>
            ought to be tolerable, howsoever great they may be. Such are <lb/>
            the remarks I had to make on friendship. But as for you, I <lb/>
            exhort you to lay the foundations of virtue, without which <lb/>
            friendship cannot exist, in such a manner that, with this one <lb/>
            exception, you may consider that nothing in the world is <lb/>
            more excellent than friendship. <note type="footnote">* " The pleasures resulting from the mutual attachment of kindred <lb/>
            spirits are by no means confined to the moments of personal intercourse ; <lb/>
            they diffuse their odours, though more faintly, through the seasons of <lb/>
            absence, refreshing and exhilarating the mind by the remembrance of the <lb/>
            past and the anticipation of the future. It is a treasure possessed when <lb/>
            it is not employed-a reserve of strength, ready to be called into action <lb/>
            when most needed-a fountain of sweets, to which we may continually <lb/>
            repair, whose waters are inexhaustible,”—Robert Hall's Funeral Sermon <lb/>

          <p>"0 Tirus,* if I shall have assisted you at all, or alleviated <lb/>
            the anxiety which now fevers, and, fixed in your heart, <lb/>
            distracts you, shall I have any reward ?"</p>
          <p>I. For I may address you, Atticus, in the same lines in <lb/>
            which he addresses Flaminius, <lb/>
            " That man, not of great property, but rich in integrity."</p>
          <p>And yet I am very sure that not, as Flaminius,</p>
          <p>" Are you, 0 Titus, so racked by anxiety night and day <lb/>
            for I know the regularity and even temperament of your <lb/>
            mind; and I am well aware that you have derived not only <lb/>
            your surname from Athens, but also refinement and wisdom: <lb/>
            and yet I suspect that you are sometimes too deeply affected <lb/>
            by the same causes by which I myself am; the consolation of <lb/>
            which is of a higher kind, and requires to be put off to <lb/>
            another occasion.t But at present I have thought it good to <note type="footnote"> * Titus Pomponius Atticus, to whom this treatise is addressed, was a <lb/>
            celebrated Roman knight. Cicero wrote to him a number of letters which <lb/>
            still survive. He was surnamed Atticus from his perfect knowledge of <lb/>
            the Greek language and literature. A minute account of his life has been <lb/>
            written by Cornelius Nepos, one of his intimate friends. </note><note type="footnote"> † ., This alludes to the disordered state of the commonwealth occasioned <lb/>

            the senate. No man had more at stake in these public convulsions than <lb/>
            Cicero; and nothing sets the power of his mind in a more striking point <lb/>
            of view than his being able, at such an alarming crisis, sufficiently to com- <unclear/> <lb/>

            write to you something on Old Age; for of this burden which <lb/>
            I have in common with you of old age, either now weighing <lb/>
            upon, or at any rate approaching us, I wish both you and <lb/>
            myself to be relieved, although I am very sure that you <lb/>
            indeed bear it, and will bear it, with temper and wisdom (as <lb/>
            you do all things). But to my mind, when I was about to <lb/>
            write an essay on old age, you occurred as worthy of a gift, <lb/>
            which each of us might enjoy in common. For my part I <lb/>
            have found the composition of this book so delightful, that it <lb/>
            has not only wiped off all the annoyances of old age, but has <lb/>
            rendered old age even easy and delightful. Never, there- <lb/>
            fore, can philosophy be praised in a manner sufficiently <lb/>
            worthy, inasmuch as he who obeys philosophy is able to pass <lb/>
            every period of life without irksomeness. But upon other <lb/>
            subjects we both have discoursed much, and often shall dis- <lb/>
            course : this book, on the subject of old age, I have sent <lb/>
            to you. And all the discourse we have assigned not to <lb/>
            Tithonus,* as Aristot the Chian did, lest there should be too <lb/>
            little of authority in the tale; but to Marcus Cato,t when an <lb/>
            old man, that the discourse might carry with it the greater <lb/>
            weight; at whose house we introduce Lælius § and Scipio, ex- <lb/>
            pressing their wonder that he so patiently bears old age, and <lb/>
            him replying to them. And if he shall appear to discourse <lb/>
            more learnedly than he himself was accustomed to do iu his <lb/>
            own books, ascribe it to Greek literature, of which it is well <lb/>
            known that he was very studious in old age. But what need <lb/>
            is there to say more ? for now the conversation of Cato him- <lb/>

            burdensome to you; which to most old men is so disagree- <lb/>
            able, that they say they support a burden heavier than Ætna. <lb/>
            CATO.-It is not a very difficult matter, Scipio and Laelius, <lb/>
            which you seem to be surprised at; for to those who have <lb/>
            no resource in themselves for living well and happily, every <lb/>
            age is burdensome; but to those who seek all good things <lb/>
            from themselves, nothing can appear evil which the necessity <lb/>
            of nature entails; in which class particularly is old age, which <lb/>
            all men wish to attain, and yet they complain of it when they <lb/>
            have attained it; so great is the inconsistency and wayward- <lb/>
            ness of folly. They say that it steals over them more quickly <lb/>
            than they had supposed. Now, first of all, who compelled <lb/>
            them to form a false estimate of its progress ? for how does <lb/>
            old age more quickly steal upon youth, than youth upon boy- <lb/>
            hood ? Then, again, how would old age be less burdensome to <lb/>
            them, if they were in their 800th year than in their 80th ? for <lb/>
            the past time, however long, when it had flowed away, would <lb/>
            not be able to soothe with any consolation an old age of folly. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if you are accustomed to admire my wisdom,- <lb/>
            and I would that it were worthy of your high opinion and <lb/>
            my surname,-in this I am wise that I follow nature, that <lb/>
            best guide, as a god, and am obedient to her ;* by whom it <lb/>
            is not likely, when the other parts of life have been well <lb/>
            represented, that the last act should have been ill done, as it <lb/>
            were by an indolent poet. But yet it was necessary that there <lb/>
            should be something final, and, as in the berries of trees and <lb/>
            the fruits of the earth, something withered and falling through <lb/>
            seasonable ripeness; which must be taken quietly by a wise <lb/>
            man : for what else is it, to war with nature, than, after the <lb/>
            manner of the giants, to fight with the gods ? LÆLIUS. But, <lb/>
            Cato, you will do a very great favour to us, as I may also <lb/>
            engage on behalf of Scipio, if inasmuch as we hope, or at <note type="footnote"> * “The acknowledgment of the intention of the Creator as the proper <lb/>

            to nature, vice and moral transgression contrary to nature; for man's <lb/>
            nature is a constitution in which reason and desire are elements, but of <lb/>
            these elements it was plainly intended that reason should control desire, <lb/>
            not that desire should overmaster reason.”—Whewell's Elements of Mo- <lb/>

            least desire, to become old men, we shall have learned long <lb/>
            before from you by what methods we may most easily be <lb/>
            able to bear the increasing burden of age. CATO. Well, I <lb/>
            will do so, Lælius; especially if, as you say, it is likely to be <lb/>
            pleasant to each of you. SCIPIO. In truth we wish, unless <lb/>
            it be irksome, Cato, just as if you had completed some long <lb/>
            journey, on which we also must enter, to see of what nature <lb/>
            that spot is at which you have arrived.</p>
          <p>III. CATO. I will do it as well as I shall be able, Lælius; <lb/>
            for I have often been present at the complaints of men of my <lb/>
            own age (and equals with equals, according to the old proverb, <lb/>
            most easily flock together), and have heard the things which <lb/>
            Caius Salinator and Spurius Albinus, men of consular rank, <lb/>
            and nearly of my age, were wont to deplore: on the one hand, <lb/>
            that they had no pleasures, without which they thought life <lb/>
            was valueless; on the other, that they were neglected by those <lb/>
            by whom they had been accustomed to be courted, in which <lb/>
            they appeared to me not to accuse that which deserved ac- <lb/>
            cusation ; for if that happened from the fault of old age, the <lb/>
            same things would be experienced by me and all others <lb/>
            advanced in years : and yet the old age of many of them I <lb/>
            have remarked to be without complaint, who were not <lb/>
            grieved to be let free from the thraldom of the passions, and <lb/>
            were not looked down upon by their friends; but of all com- <lb/>
            plaints of this kind, the fault lies in the character of the man, <lb/>
            not in his age. For old men of regulated minds, and neither <lb/>
            testy nor ill-natured, pass a very tolerable old age. But a <lb/>
            discontented and ill-natured disposition is irksome in every <lb/>
            age.* LÆLIUS. It is as you say, Cato. But perhaps some <note type="footnote"> * “It may very reasonably be suspected that the old draw upon them- <lb/>
            t'elves the greatest part of those insults which they so much lament; and <lb/>
            that age is rarely despised but when it is contemptible. If men imagine <lb/>
            that excess of debauchery can be made reverend by time; that knowledge <lb/>
            is the consequence of long life, however idly and thoughtlessly employed ; <lb/>
            that priority of birth will supply the want of steadiness or honesty, can it <lb/>
            raise much wonder that their hopes are disappointed, and that they see <lb/>
            their posterity rather willing to trust their own eyes in their progress into <lb/>
            life, than enlist themselves under guides who have lost their way ? </note><note type="footnote"> " He that would pass the latter part of life with honour and decency, <lb/>
            must, when he is young, consider that he shall one day be old; and re- <lb/>

            lay up knowledge for his support, when his powers of acting shall <unclear>forsale</unclear> <lb/>
            him; and in age forbear to animadvert with rigour on faults which ex- <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[CHAP IV.</note><lb/>
            one may say, that to you, on account of your wealth, and <lb/>
            resources, and dignity, old age appears better to endure, but <lb/>
            that this cannot be the lot of many. CATO. That to be sure, <lb/>
            Lælius, is something, but all things are by no means involved <lb/>
            in it: as Themistocles is said to have replied to a certain man <lb/>
            of Seriphus* in a dispute, when the other had said that he had <lb/>
            gained distiuctiou, not by his own glory, but by that of his <lb/>
            country; neither, by Hercules, said he, if I had been a man <lb/>
            of Seriphus, should I ever have been eminent, nor if you <lb/>
            had been an Athenian, would you ever have been renowned. <lb/>
            Which, in like manner, can be said about old age. For <lb/>
            neither can old age be easy in extreme poverty, not even to <lb/>
            a wise man; nor to a foolish man, even in the greatest <lb/>
            plenty, otherwise than burdensome. The fittest arms of old <lb/>
            age, Scipio and Lælius, are the attainment and practice of <lb/>
            the virtues ; which, if cultivated at every period of life, pro- <lb/>
            duce wonderful fruits when you have lived to a great age; <lb/>
            not only, inasmuch as they never fail, not even in the last <lb/>
            period of life-and yet that is a very great point-but also <lb/>
            because the consciousness of a life well spent, and the recol- <lb/>
            lection of many virtuous actions, is most delightful.†</p>

            by years. While health endures, the latter part of life, in the eye of reason, <lb/>
            is certainly the more eligible. The memory of a well-spent youth gives a <lb/>

            was in that man dignity refined by courtesy; nor had old <lb/>
            age changed his character. And yet I began to cultivate <lb/>
            his acquaintance when he was not a very old man, but still <lb/>
            when somewhat advanced in age. For he had been consul <lb/>
            for the first time in the year after I was born, and in his <lb/>
            fourth consulship I, then a stripling, marched with him as <lb/>
            a soldier to Capua, and in the fifth year after, as quæstor to <lb/>
            Tarentum; I was next made ædile, and four years afterwards <lb/>
            prætor, an office which I held in the consulship of Tudi- <lb/>
            tanus* and Cethegus, when he, a very old man, was the <lb/>
            promoter of the Cincian t law, about fees and presents. He <lb/>
            both carried on campaigns like a young man when he was <lb/>
            quite old, and by his temper cooled Hannibal when im- <lb/>
            petuous from the fire of youth, about whom our friend <lb/>
            Ennius has admirably spoken:—“Who alone, by delay re- <lb/>
            trieved our state; for he did not value rumour above our <lb/>
            safety, therefore brighter and brighter is now the glory of <lb/>
            that man." And with what vigilance, with what talent did. <lb/>
            he recover Tarentum ? When too, in my hearing, as Sali- <lb/>
            nator, who, after losing the town, had taken refuge in the <lb/>
            citadel, was boasting and speaking thus: "It was owing to my <lb/>
            exertions, Quintus Fabius, that you recovered Tarentum." <lb/>
            "Unquestionably," said he laughing, "for unless you had lost <lb/>
            it, I should never have regained it." Nor in truth was he more <lb/>
            excellent in arms than in civil affairs; for, in his second <lb/>
            consulship, when Spurius Carvilius, his colleague, was neuter, <lb/>
            he made a stand to the utmost of his power against Caius <lb/>
            Flaminius, tribune of the commons, when he was for dis- <lb/>
            tributing the Picenian and Gallic land to individuals, con- <lb/>
            trary to the authority of the senate: and when he was augur, <lb/>
            he had the spirit to say that those things were performed <lb/>
            with the best auspices which were performed for the welfare <lb/>

            The panegyric lie pronounced is still in our hands; which <lb/>
            when we read, what philosopher do we not despise ? nor, <lb/>
            in truth, was he great only in public and in the eyes of <lb/>
            his fellow citizens, but still more admirable in private and <lb/>
            at home. What conversation ! what maxims! what deep <lb/>
            acquaintance with ancient history! what knowledge of the <lb/>
            law of augury ! his learning too, for a Roman, was extensive. <lb/>
            He retained in memory all, not only domestic but foreign <lb/>
            wars; and I at that time enjoyed his conversation with as <lb/>
            much avidity as if I was already divining that which came <lb/>
            to pass, that when he was gone, there would be none other <lb/>
            for me to learn from.</p>
          <p>V. To what end then do I say so much about Maximus ? <lb/>
            because doubtless you see that it is quite wrong to say that <lb/>
            such an old age was miserable. Still, all men cannot be <lb/>
            Scipios or Maximi, so as to remember the stormings of cities, <lb/>
            battles by land and sea, wars conducted and triumphs gained <lb/>
            by themselves. The old age also of a life past in peace and <lb/>
            innocence and elegance is a gentle and mild one, such as we <lb/>
            have heard that of Plato to have been, who, in his eighty- <lb/>
            first year, died while writing; such as that of Isocrates, who <lb/>
            says that he wrote that book which is entitled the Panathe- <lb/>
            naican in his ninety-fourth year, and he lived five years <lb/>
            after : whose master, Gorgias, the Leontine, completed one <lb/>
            hundred and seven years, nor did he ever loiter in his pur- <lb/>
            suit and labour; who, when it was asked of him why he <lb/>
            liked to be so long in life, said : "I have no cause for <lb/>
            blaming old age." An admirable answer, and worthy of a <lb/>
            man of learning: for the foolish lay their own vices and <note type="footnote"> attack, on occasion of an unfavourable omen which appears on the left side <lb/>
            of the Trojan army. Hector treats both the advice and the adviser with <lb/>
            much contempt; and among other sentiments equally just and animated, <lb/>
            nobly replies (as the lines are finely translated by Air. Pope) : <lb/>
            ‘Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend, <lb/>
            Or where the suns arise, or where descend; <lb/>
            To right, to left, unheeded take your way’— <lb/>

            their own faults to the charge of old age, which that Ennius, <lb/>
            of whom I lately made mention, was not disposed to do: “As <lb/>
            the gallant steed, who often at the close of the race won the <lb/>
            Olympic prizes, now worn out with old age, takes his rest." <lb/>
            He compares his own old age to that of a mettled and victo- <lb/>
            rious steed, and that indeed you can very well remember; <lb/>
            for it was in the nineteenth year after his death that the <lb/>
            present consuls, Titus Flaminius* and Marcus Acilius, were <lb/>
            elected, and he died in the second consulship of Cœpio and <lb/>
            Philip; when I too, at the age of sixty-five, had supported <lb/>
            the Voconian law t with a powerful voice and unimpaired <lb/>
            lungs. At the age of seventy, for so many years Ennius <lb/>
            lived, he in such a manner endured two burdens, which are <lb/>
            deemed the greatest, poverty and old age, that he almost <lb/>
            seemed to take pleasure in them. For when I consider it in <lb/>
            my mind, I find four causes why old age is thought miserable: <lb/>
            one, that it calls us away from the transaction of affairs; the <lb/>
            second, that it renders the body more feeble; the third, that <lb/>
            it deprives us of almost all pleasures; the fourth, that it is <lb/>
            not very far from death. Of these causes let us see, if you <lb/>
            please, how great and how reasonable each of them is.</p>
          <p>VI. Does old age draw us away from active duties ? <lb/>
            From which ? from those which are performed by youth <lb/>
            and strength ? Are there, then, no concerns of old age, <lb/>
            which even when our bodies are feeble, are yet carried <lb/>
            on by the mind ? Was Q. Maximus, then, unemployed ? <lb/>
            Was L. Paulus, your father, Scipio, unemployed, the father- <lb/>
            in-law of that most excellent man, my son ? Those other old <lb/>
            men, the Fabricii, the Curii, the Coruncanii, when they sup- <lb/>
            ported the commonwealth by wisdom and authority, were <lb/>
            they unemployed ? It was an aggravation of the old age of <lb/>
            Appius Claudius that he was blind, and yet he, when the <lb/>
            opinion of the senate was inclined to peace, and the con- <lb/>
            clusion of a treaty with Pyrrus, did not hesitate to utter <lb/>
            these words, which Ennius has expressed in verse:- <lb/>
            Whither have your minds, which used to stand upright <lb/>
            before, in folly turned away?" And all the rest with the <lb/>
            utmost dignity, for the poem is well known to you, and yet <note type="footnote"> * A.U.C. 604. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Voconian law enacted that no one should make a woman his heir. </note> <pb n="224"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP VI.</note><lb/>
            the speech of Appius himself still exists: and he delivered <lb/>
            this speech seventeen years after his second consulship, <lb/>
            when ten years had intervened between the two consulships, <lb/>
            and he had been censor before his former consulship; from <lb/>
            which it is concluded that in the war with Pyrrhus, he <lb/>
            was a very old man, and yet we have been thus informed <lb/>
            by our fathers. Therefore they advance no argument, who <lb/>
            say that old age is not engaged in active duty, and resemble <lb/>
            those who should say that the pilot in navigation is unem- <lb/>
            ployed, for that while some climb the mast, others run up <lb/>
            and down the decks, others empty the bilge-water, lie, <lb/>
            holding the helm, sits at the stern at his ease. He does not <lb/>
            do those things that the young men do, but in truth he does <lb/>
            much greater and better things. Great actions are not <lb/>
            achieved by exertions of strength, or speed, or by quick <lb/>
            movement of bodies, but by talent, authority, judgment; of <lb/>
            which faculties old age is usually so far from being deprived, <lb/>
            that it is even improved in them: unless, indeed, I, who <lb/>
            both as a soldier and tribune, and lieutenant-general, and <lb/>
            consul, have been employed in various kinds of wars, now <lb/>
            seem to you to be idle when I am not engaged in wars. <lb/>
            But I counsel the senate as to what wars are to be engaged <lb/>
            in, and in what manner; against Carthage,* which has now <lb/>
            for a long time been meditating mischief, I have long been <lb/>
            denouncing war; about which I shall not cease to fear until <lb/>
            I shall know that it has been razed to the ground; which <lb/>
            victory I wish the immortal gods may reserve for you, <lb/>
            Scipio, that you may consummate the unfinished exploits of <lb/>
            your grandfather; since whose death this is the thirty-third <lb/>
            year: but all succeeding years will cherish the memory of <lb/>
            that man. He died in the year before I was censor, nine <lb/>
            years after my consulship, when he had been in my consul- <lb/>
            ship created consul a second time. Would he, therefore, if <lb/>
            he had lived to one hundred years old, ever have regretted <lb/>
            his old age ? for he would not exercise himself, either in <lb/>
            running a race, or in leaping, or at a distance with spears, <lb/>
            or in close quarters with swords, but in counsel, reflection, <lb/>
            and judgment. Now, unless those faculties existed in old <note type="footnote"> * " Delenda est Carthago” was so common an expression of Cato's as tar <lb/>
            have become proverbial. </note> <pb n="225"/>

            men, our ancestors would never have called the supreme <lb/>
            council by the name of senate.* Among the Lacædemo- <lb/>
            nians, those who hold the highest office, as they are, so also <lb/>
            are they styled, elders. But if you shall be inclined to read <lb/>
            or hear of foreign matters, you will find the greatest com- <lb/>
            monwealths have been overthrown by young men, and <lb/>
            supported and restored by the old. "Pray, how lost you your <lb/>
            commonwealth, so great as it was, in so short a time?" For <lb/>
            such is the appeal, as it is in the play of the poet Nasvius; † <lb/>
            both other answers are given, and these especially : " There <lb/>
            came forward orators inexperienced, foolish young men." <lb/>
            Rashness, beyond a doubt, belongs to life when in its bloom; <lb/>
            wisdom to it in old age.</p>
          <p>VII. But the memory is impaired. I believe it, unless <lb/>
            you keep it in practice, or if you are by nature rather dull. <lb/>
            Themistocles had learned by heart the names of all his <lb/>
            fellow citizens. Do you suppose, therefore, when he ad- <lb/>
            vanced in age, he was accustomed to address him as Lysi- <lb/>
            machus who was Aristides ? For my part, I know not only <lb/>
            those persons who are alive, but their fathers also, and <lb/>
            grandfathers; nor in reading tombstones am I afraid, as <lb/>
            they say, lest I should lose my memory; for by reading <lb/>
            these very tombstones, I regain my recollection of the dead.t <note type="footnote"> * So called from the Latin word senex. The members of this august <lb/>

            Nor indeed have I heard of any old man having forgotten in <lb/>
            what place he had buried a treasure; they remember all <lb/>
            things which they care about: appointments of bail ;* who <lb/>
            are indebted to them, and to whom they are indebted.! What <lb/>

            with reference to subjects which are uninteresting or distasteful to the indi- <lb/>

            little or no attention, and consequently few or no associations are connected <lb/>
            with the facts observed. Hence these facts never become the property of <lb/>
            the mind, and of course can never be recalled. On the other hand, on what <lb/>
            subjects do we find that the faculty of recollection is the most susceptible ? <lb/>
            Unquestionably on those, on which the individual is most deeply interested, <lb/>
            either from taste, habit, or professional pursuit. Its apparent defects are <lb/>
            clearly traceable to voluntary habits of inactivity and neglect ; while like <lb/>
            every other faculty of the intellectual nature, it is capable of receiving from <lb/>

            wards Zeno, Cleanthes, or him whom you have also seen at <lb/>

            the vigorous pursuit of their studies commensurate with <lb/>
            their life in all these men ? Come, to pass over these sublime <lb/>

            tlemen at Rome, neighbours and acquaintances of mine, in <lb/>

            in the farm, either in sowing, or in reaping, or in storing the <lb/>
            produce; and yet in those men this is less to be wondered <lb/>
            at; for no man is so old, as not to think he may live a <lb/>
            year. But they also take pains in those matters, which they <lb/>
            know do not at all concern themselves. " He plants trees to <lb/>
            benefit another generation," as our friend Statius § says in <lb/>
            his Synephebi. Nor, in truth, let the husbandman, however <lb/>
            old, hesitate to reply to any one who asks him "for whom he <lb/>
            is sowing :” "For the immortal gods, who intended that I <lb/>

            many things, perhaps, which he does like; and youth also <lb/>
            often meets with things which he does not like. But the <lb/>
            same Cæeilus makes the following assertion, which is still <lb/>
            more objectionable: —Then, for my part, I reckon this <lb/>
            circumstance connected with old age the most wretched, <lb/>
            to be conscious at that age that one is disagreeable to <lb/>
            others." Pleasant rather than disagreeable. For as wise <lb/>
            old men take pleasure in young men possessed of good <lb/>
            disposition, and the old age of those persons becomes <lb/>
            lighter who are courted and loved by youth; so young men <lb/>
            take pleasure in the lessons of the old, by which they are led <lb/>
            on to the pursuits of virtue. Nor am I aware that I am less <lb/>
            agreeable to you than you are to me. But you see that old <lb/>
            age is so far from being feeble and inactive, that it is even <lb/>
            industrious, and always doing and devising something; <lb/>
            namely, such pursuits as have belonged to each man in for- <lb/>
            mer life. Nay, they even learn something new; as we see <lb/>
            Solon in his verses boasting, who says that he was becoming <lb/>
            an old man, daily learning something new, as I have done, <lb/>
            who, when an old man, learned the Greek language ;* <lb/>
            which too I so greedily grasped, as if I were desirous of <lb/>
            satisfying a long protracted thirst, that those very things <lb/>
            became known to me which you now see me use as illus- <lb/>
            trations. And when I heard that Socrates had done this <lb/>
            on the lyre, for my part I should like to do that also,—for <lb/>
            the ancients used to learn the lyre: but with their literature, <lb/>
            at any rate, I have taken pains.</p>
          <p>IX. Nor even now do I feel the want of the strength of a <lb/>
            young man—for that was the second topic about the faults <lb/>
            of old age-no more than when a young man I felt the want <lb/>
            of the strength of the bull or of the elephant. What one has, <note type="footnote"> * Referring to this fact in the life of Cato, Lord Bacon says, " As to the <lb/>
            judgment of Cato the censor, he was well punished for his blasphemy <lb/>

            past threescore years old, he was taken with an extreme desire to go to <lb/>
            school again and to learn the Greek tongue to the end to peruse the Greek <lb/>
            authors, which doth well demonstrate, that his former censure of the <lb/>
            Grecian learning was rather an affected gravity than according to the in- <lb/>

            that one ought to use; and whatever you do, you should do <lb/>
            it with all your strength. For what expression can be morp <lb/>
            contemptible than that of Milo* of Crotona, who, when ho <lb/>
            was now an old man, and was looking at the prize-fighters <lb/>
            exercising themselves on the course, is reported to have <lb/>
            looked at his arms, and, weeping over them, to have said, <lb/>
            "But these, indeed, are now dead."t Nay, foolish man, not <lb/>
            these arms so much as yourself; for you never derived your <lb/>
            nobility from yourself, but from your chest and your arms. <lb/>
            Nothing of the kind did Sextus Ælius ever say, nothing of <lb/>
            the kind many years before did Titus Coruncanius, nothing <lb/>
            lately did Publius Crassus; by whom instructions in juris- <lb/>
            prudence were given to their fellow citizens, and whose <lb/>
            wisdom was progressive even to their latest breath. For <lb/>
            the orator, I fear lest he be enfeebled by old age; for elo- <lb/>
            quence is a gift not of mind only, but also of lungs and <lb/>
            strength. On the whole, that melodiousness in the voice is <lb/>
            graceful, I know not how, even in old age; which, indeed, I <lb/>
            have not lost, and you see my years. Yet there is a grace- <lb/>
            ful style of eloquence in an old man, unimpassioned and <lb/>
            subdued, and very often the elegant and gentle discourse of <lb/>
            an eloquent old man wins for itself a hearing; and if you <lb/>
            have not yourself the power to produce this effect, yet you <lb/>
            may be able to teach it to Scipio and Lælius. For what <note type="footnote"> * Milo. A famous Athlete, of Crotona, in Italy. He is said to have <lb/>

            passed, he discovers a monstrous inclination to that which it is not in the <lb/>
            course of Providence to recall. The state of an old man, who is dissatisfied <lb/>
            merely for his being such, is the most out of all measures of reason and <lb/>
            good sense of any being we have any account of, from the highest angel to <lb/>
            the lowest worm. How miserable is the contemplation, to consider a <lb/>
            libidinous old man fretting at the course of things, and being almost the <lb/>
            sole malcontent in the creation. But let us a little reflect upon what he <lb/>
            has lost by the number of years ; the passions which he had in youth are <lb/>
            not to be obeyed as they were then, but reason is more powerful now with- <lb/>

            sures of it are no other than the dreams of a man in that distemper ; and <lb/>
            it is as absurd to wish the return of that season of life, as for a man in <lb/>
            health to be sorry for the loss of gilded palaces, fairy walks, and flowery <lb/>
            pastures, with which he remembers he was entertained in the troubled <lb/>
            slumbers of a fit of sickness.”—The Spectator, No. 153. </note> <pb n="230"/>

            is more delightful than old age surrounded with the stu- <lb/>
            dious attention of youth ? Shall we not leave even such a <lb/>
            resource to old age, as to teach young men, instruct them, <lb/>
            train them to every department of duty ? an employment, <lb/>
            indeed, than which what can be more noble ? But, for <lb/>
            my part, I thought the Cneius and Publius Scipios, and <lb/>
            your two grandfathers, L. Æmilius and P. Africanus, quite <lb/>
            happy in the attendance of noble youths; nor are any pre- <lb/>
            ceptors of liberal accomplishments to be deemed otherwise <lb/>
            than happy, though their strength hath fallen into old age <lb/>
            and failed ; although that very failure of strength is more <lb/>
            frequently caused by the follies of youth than by those of <lb/>
            old age; for a lustful and intemperate youth transmits to <lb/>
            old age an exhausted body.* Cyrus too, in Xenophon, in <lb/>
            that discourse which he delivered on his death-bed when he <lb/>
            was a very old man, said that he never felt that his old <lb/>
            age had become feebler than his youth had been. I recol- <lb/>
            lect, when a boy, that Lucius Metellus, who, when four <lb/>
            years after his second consulship he had been made "pon- <lb/>
            tifex maximus," and for twenty-two years held that sacer- <lb/>
            dotal office, enjoyed such good strength at the latter period <lb/>
            of his life, that he felt no want of youth. There is no need <lb/>
            for me to speak about myself, and yet that is the privilege <lb/>
            of old age, and conceded to my time of life.</p>
          <p>X. Do you see how, in Homer, Nestor very often pro- <lb/>
            claims his own virtues ? for he was now living in the third <lb/>
            generation of men; nor had he occasion to fear lest, when <lb/>
            stating the truth about himself, he should appear either too <lb/>
            arrogant or too talkative ; for, as Homer says,t from his <lb/>
            tongue speech flowed sweeter than honey; for which charm <lb/>
            he stood in need of no strength of body : and yet the famous <lb/>

            like to be able to make the same boast that Cyrus did : but <lb/>
            one thing I can say, that although I have not, to be sure, that <lb/>
            strength which I had either as a soldier in the Punic war, or <lb/>
            as quæstor in the same war, or as consul in Spain, or, four <lb/>
            years afterwards, when as military tribune I fought a battle at <lb/>
            Thermopylae, in the consulship of Marcus Acilius Glabrio: <lb/>
            yet, as you see, old age has not quite enfeebled me or broken <lb/>
            me down : the senate-house does not miss my strength, nor <lb/>
            the rostra,* nor my friends, nor my clients, nor my guests ; <lb/>
            for I have never agreed to that old and much-praised <lb/>
            proverb, which advises you to become an old man early, if <lb/>
            you wish to be an old man long. I for my part would rather <lb/>
            be an old man for a shorter length of time than be an old <lb/>
            man before I was one. And, therefore, no one as yet has <lb/>
            wished to have an interview with me, to whom I have been <lb/>
            denied as engaged. But I have less strength than either of <lb/>
            you two. Neither even do you possess the strength of Titus <lb/>
            Pontius the centurion: is he, therefore, the more excellent <lb/>
            man ? Only let there be a moderate degree of strength, and let <lb/>
            every man exert himself as much as he can ; and in truth that <lb/>
            man will not be absorbed in regretting the want of strength. <lb/>
            Milo, at Olympia, is said to have gone over the course while <lb/>
            supporting on his shoulders a live ox. Whether, then, would <lb/>
            you rather have this strength of body, or Pythagoras's <lb/>
            strength of intellect, bestowed upon you ? In a word, enjoy <lb/>
            that blessing while you have it: when it is gone, do not <lb/>
            lament it; unless, indeed, young men ought to lament the <lb/>
            loss of boyhood, and those a little advanced in age the loss <lb/>
            of adolescence. There is a definite career in life, and one <lb/>
            way of nature, and that a simple one; and to every part ot <lb/>
            life its own peculiar period has been assigned : so that both <lb/>
            the feebleness of boys, and the high spirit of young men, and <lb/>
            the steadiness of now fixed manhood, and the maturity of old <lb/>
            age, have something natural, which ought to be enjoyed in <lb/>
            their own time. I suppose that you hear, Scipio, what your <note type="footnote"> * Rostra: a pulpit from which the orators used to harangue the people <lb/>

            age of ninety : when lie has commenced a journey on foot, <lb/>
            he never mounts at all; when on horseback, he never dis- <lb/>
            mounts : by no rain, by no cold, is he prevailed upon to <lb/>
            have his head covered ; that there is in him the greatest <lb/>
            hardiness of frame ; and therefore he performs all the duties <lb/>
            and functions of a king. Exercise, therefore, and tempe- <lb/>

          <p>XI. Is there no strength in old age ? neither is strength <lb/>
            exacted from old age. Therefore, by our laws and insti- <lb/>
            tutions, our time of life is relieved from those tasks which <lb/>
            cannot be supported without strength. Accordingly, so far are <lb/>
            we from being compelled to do what we cannot do, that we are <lb/>
            not even compelled to do as much as we can. But so feeble- <lb/>
            are many old men, that they cannot execute any task of <lb/>
            duty, or any function of life whatever ; but that in truth is <lb/>
            not the peculiar fault of old age, but belongs in common to <lb/>
            bad health. How feeble was the son of Publius Africanus, <lb/>
            he who adopted you! What feeble health, or rather no <lb/>
            health at all, had he ! and had that not been so, he would <lb/>
            have been the second luminary of the state; for to his pater- <lb/>
            nal greatness of soul a richer store of learning had been <lb/>
            added.t What wonder, therefore, in old men, if they are <note type="footnote"> * Masinissa, son of Gala, king of a small part of Northern Africa: he <lb/>

            about D. c. 149. </note><note type="footnote"> † " There are perhaps," says Dr. Johnson, “very few conditions more to <lb/>
            be pitied than that of an active and elevated mind labouring under the <lb/>
            weight of a distempered body. The time of such a man is always spent in <lb/>
            forming schemes which a change of wind hinders him from executing, his <lb/>
            powers fume away in projects and in hope, and the day of action never arrives. <lb/>
            He lies down delighted with the thoughts of to-morrow, pleases his ambition <lb/>
            with the fame he shall acquire, or his benevolence with the good he shall <lb/>
            confer. But in the night the skies are overcast, the temper of the air is <lb/>
            changed, he wakes in languor, impatience, and distraction, and has no <lb/>
            longer any wish but for ease, nor any attention but to misery. It may be <lb/>
            said that disease generally begins that equality which death completes; <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP XI.]</note><lb/>
            sometimes weak, when even young men cannot escape that. <lb/>
            We must make a stand, Scipio and Lælius, against old age, <lb/>
            and its faults must be atoned for by activity; we must <lb/>
            fight, as it were, against disease, and in like manner against <lb/>
            old age. Regard must be paid to health; moderate exer- <lb/>
            cises must be adopted; so much of meat and drink must be <lb/>
            taken, that the strength may be recruited, not oppressed. <lb/>
            Nor, indeed, must the body alone be supported, but the <lb/>
            mind and the soul much more; for these also, unless you <lb/>
            drop oil on them as on a lamp, are extinguished by old age. <lb/>
            And our bodies, indeed, by weariness and exercise, become <lb/>
            oppressed; but our minds are rendered buoyant by exercise. <lb/>
            For as to those, of whom Coecilius speaks, "foolish old men," <lb/>
            fit characters for comedy, by these he denotes the credulous, <lb/>
            the forgetful, the dissolute; which are the faults not of old <lb/>
            age, but of inactive, indolent, drowsy old age. As petu- <lb/>
            lance and lust belong to the young more than to the old, yet <lb/>
            not to all young men, but to those who are not virtuous ; so <lb/>
            that senile folly, which is commonly called dotage, belongs <lb/>
            to weak old men, and not to all. Four stout sons, five <lb/>
            daughters, so great a family, and such numerous dependants, <lb/>
            did Appius manage, although both old and blind; for he <lb/>
            kept his mind intent like a bow, nor did he languidly sink <lb/>
            under the weight of old age. He retained not only autho- <lb/>
            rity, but also command, over his family: the slaves feared <lb/>
            him ; the children respected him; all held him dear : there <lb/>
            prevailed in that house the manners and good discipline of <lb/>
            our fathers. For on this condition is old age honoured if it <lb/>
            maintains itself, if it keeps up its own right, if it is subser- <lb/>
            vient to no one, if even to its last breath it exercises control <lb/>
            over its dependants. For, as I like a young man in whom <lb/>
            there is something of the old, so I like an old man in whom <lb/>
            there is something of the young; and he who follows this <lb/>
            maxim, in body will possibly be an old man, but he will <lb/>
            never be an old man in mind. I have in hand my seventh <lb/>
            book of Antiquities ; I am collecting all the materials of our <lb/>

            Ethics, supposed to be drawn up by one of his disciples, and known by the <lb/>

            who always lives in these pursuits and labours, it is not <lb/>
            perceived when old age steals on. Thus gradually and un- <lb/>
            consciously life declines into old age; nor is its thread <lb/>
            suddenly broken, but the vital principle is consumed by <lb/>
            length of time.</p>
          <p>:II. Then follows the third topic of blame against old <lb/>
            age, that they say it has no pleasures. Oh, noble privi- <lb/>
            lege of age! if indeed it takes from us that which is in <lb/>
            youth the greatest defect. For listen, most excellent young <lb/>
            men, to the ancient speech of Archytas of Tarentum, a man <lb/>
            eminently great and illustrious, which was reported to me <lb/>
            when I, a young man, was at Tarentum with Quintus Maxi- <lb/>
            mus. He said that no more deadly plague than the pleasure <lb/>
            of the body was inflicted on men by nature; for the pas- <lb/>
            sions, greedy of that pleasure, were in a rash and unbridled <lb/>
            manner incited to possess it; that hence arose treasons against <lb/>
            one's country, hence the ruining of states, hence clan- <lb/>
            destine conferences with enemies: in short, that there <lb/>
            was no crime, no wicked act, to the undertaking of which <lb/>
            the lust of pleasure did not impel; but that fornica- <lb/>
            tions and adulteries and every such crime, were provoked <lb/>
            by no other allurements than those of pleasure. And <lb/>
            whereas either nature or some god had given to man nothing <lb/>
            more excellent than his mind; that to this divine func- <lb/>
            tion and gift, nothing was so hostile as pleasure: since <lb/>
            where lust bore sway, there was no room for self-restraint; <lb/>
            and in the realm of pleasure, virtue could by no possi- <lb/>
            bility exist. And that this might be the better understood, <lb/>
            he begged you to imagine in your mind any one actuated by <lb/>
            the greatest pleasure of the body that could be enjoyed; he <lb/>
            believed no one would doubt, but that so long as the person <lb/>
            was in that state of delight, he would be able to consider <lb/>
            nothing in his mind, to attain nothing by reason, nothing by <lb/>
            reflection : wherefore that there was nothing so detestable <lb/>
            and so destructive as pleasure, inasmuch as that when it was <lb/>
            excessive and very prolonged, it extinguished all the light of <lb/>
            the soul. Nearchus of Tarentum, our host,* who had re- <note type="footnote"> * The title of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>, or public host of a nation or city, is exceedingly <lb/>
            common in the classic writers. The duty of the person on whom it <lb/>

            mained throughout in friendship with the Roman people, said <lb/>
            lie had heard from older men, that Archytas held' this con- <lb/>
            versation with Caius Pontius the Samnite, the father of him <lb/>
            by whom, in the Caudian battle, * Spurius Postumius and <lb/>
            Titus Veturius, the consuls, were overcome, on which occa- <lb/>
            sion Plato the Athenian had been present at that discourse; <lb/>
            and I find that he came to Tarentum in the consulship of <lb/>
            Lucius Camillus and Appius Claudius, t Wherefore do I <lb/>
            adduce this? that we may understand that if we could not <lb/>
            by reason and wisdom despise pleasure, great gratitude <lb/>
            would be due to old age for bringing it to pass that that <lb/>
            should not be a matter of pleasure which is not a matter of <lb/>
            duty. For pleasure is hostile to reason, hinders deliberation, <lb/>
            and, so to speak, closes the eyes of the mind, nor does it hold <lb/>
            any intercourse with virtue. I indeed acted reluctantly in <lb/>
            expelling from the senate Lucius Flamininus, brother of that <lb/>
            very brave man, Titus Flamininus, seven years after he had <lb/>
            been consul; but I thought that his licentiousness should be <lb/>
            stigmatized. For that man, when he was consul in Gaul, was <lb/>
            prevailed on at a banquet, by a courtezan, to behead one of <lb/>
            those who were in chains, condemned on a capital charge. <lb/>
            He escaped in the censorship of his brother Titus, who <lb/>
            had immediately preceded me: but so profligate and aban- <lb/>
            doned an act of lust could by no means be allowed to pass <lb/>
            by me and Flaccus, since with private infamy it combined <lb/>
            the disgrace of the empire.</p>
          <p>XIII. I have often heard from my elders, who said that, <lb/>
            in like manner, they, when boys, had heard from old men, <lb/>
            that Caius Fabricius was wont to wonder that when he was <lb/>
            ambassador to king Pyrrhus, he had heard from Cineas the <lb/>
            Thessalian, that there was a certain person at Athens, who <lb/>
            professed himself a wise man, and that he was accustomed to <lb/>
            say that all things which we did were to be referred to plea- <lb/>
            sure : and that hearing him say so, Manius Curius and Titus <lb/>
            Coruncanius were accustomed to wish that that might be <note type="footnote"> business to the city in which he resided, and to use all the interest he <lb/>
            possessed in furthering the purpose of their mission. </note><note type="footnote"> * Prœlio Caudino. Caudi and Caudium, a town of the Samnites, near <lb/>

            <note type="margin">CHAP XIII.]</note> <lb/>
            the persuasion of the Samnites and Pyrrhus himself, that <lb/>
            they might the more easily be conquered when they had <lb/>
            given themselves up to pleasure. Manius Curius had lived <lb/>
            with Publius Decius, who, five years before the consulship <lb/>
            of the former, had devoted himself for the commonwealth in <lb/>
            his fourth consulship. Fabricius had been acquainted with <lb/>
            him, and Coruncanius had also known him; who, as well <lb/>
            from his own conduct in life, as from the great action of <lb/>
            him whom I mention, Publius Decius, judged that there was <lb/>
            doubtless something in its own nature excellent and glorious, <lb/>
            which should be followed for its own sake, and which, scorn- <lb/>
            ing and despising pleasure, all the worthiest men pursued. <lb/>
            To what end then have I said so many things about plea- <lb/>
            sure ? Because it is so far from being any disparagement, <lb/>
            that it is even the highest praise to old age, that it has no <lb/>
            great desire for any pleasures. It lacks banquets, and piled- <lb/>
            up boards, and fast-coming goblets ; it is therefore also free <lb/>
            from drunkenness and indigestion and sleeplessness. But if <lb/>
            something must be conceded to pleasure (since we do not <lb/>
            easily withstand its allurements, for Plato beautifully calls <lb/>
            pleasure the bait of evils, inasmuch as, by it, in fact, men <lb/>
            are caught as fishes with a hook), although old age has <lb/>
            nothing to do with extravagant banquets, yet in reasonable <lb/>
            entertainments it can experience pleasure. I, when a boy, <lb/>
            often saw Caius Duilius,* son of Marcus, the first man who <lb/>
            had conquered the Carthaginians by sea, returning from <lb/>
            dinner, when an old man : he took delight in numerous <lb/>
            torches and musicians, things which he, as a private person, <lb/>
            had assumed to himself without any precedent: so much <lb/>
            indulgence did his glory give him. But why do I refer to <lb/>
            others ? let me now return to myself. First of all, I always <lb/>
            had associates in clubs; and clubs were established when <lb/>
            I was quæstor, on the Idæan worship of the great mother <lb/>
            being adopted. Therefore I feasted with my associates† <lb/>
            altogether in a moderate way; but there was a kind of <lb/>
            fervour peculiar to that time of life, and as that advances, all <lb/>
            things will become every day more subdued. For I did not <lb/>
            calculate the gratification of those banquets by the pleasures <note type="footnote"> * C. Duilius, surnamed Nepos, obtained a naval victoiv over the Cartha- <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[CHAP XIV.</note><lb/>
            of the body, so much as by the meetings of friends and con- <lb/>
            versations. For well did our ancestors style the reclining <lb/>
            of friends at an entertainment, because it carried with it a <lb/>
            union of life, by the name " convivium”* better than the <lb/>
            Greeks do, who call this same thing as well by the name of <lb/>
            “compotatio” as “concœnatio:” so that what in that kind <lb/>
            (of pleasures) is of the least value, that they appear most to <lb/>
            approve of.</p>
          <p>XIV. For my part, on account of the pleasure of conver- <lb/>
            sation, I am delighted also with seasonable entertainments, <lb/>
            not only with those of my own age, of whom very few sur- <lb/>
            vive, but with those of your age, and with you; and I give <lb/>
            great thanks to old age, which has increased my desire for <lb/>
            conversation, and taken away that of eating and drinking. <lb/>
            But even if such things delight any person (that I may not <lb/>
            appear altogether to have declared war against pleasure, of <lb/>
            which perhaps a certain limited degree is even natural), I <lb/>
            am not aware that even in these pleasures themselves old age <lb/>
            is without enjoyment. For my part, the presidencies † esta- <lb/>
            blished by our ancestors delight me ; and that conversation, <lb/>
            which after the manner of our ancestors, is kept up over our <lb/>
            cups from the top of the table; and the cups, as in the Sym- <lb/>
            posium of Xenophon, small and dewy, and the cooling of <lb/>
            the wine in summer, and in turn either the sun, or the fire <lb/>
            in winter: practices which I am accustomed to follow among <lb/>
            the Sabines also, and I daily join a party of neighbours, <lb/>
            which we prolong with various conversation till late at <lb/>
            night, as far as we can. But there is not, as it were, so <lb/>
            ticklish a sensibility of pleasures in old men. I believe it: <lb/>
            but then neither is there the desire. But nothing is irksome, <lb/>
            unless you long for it. Well did Sophocles, when a certain <lb/>
            man inquired of him advanced in age, whether he enjoyed <lb/>
            venereal pleasures, reply, " The gods give me something <lb/>
            better; nay, I have run away from them with gladness, as <lb/>
            from a wild and furious tyrant." For to men fond of such <lb/>
            things, it is perhaps disagreeable and irksome to be without <lb/>
            them; but to the contented and satisfied it is more delightful <lb/>
            to want them than to enjoy them: and yet he does not want <lb/>
            who feels no desire; therefore I say that this freedom from <note type="footnote"> * Conviviwn, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμπόσιον</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> “Nec regna vini sortiere talis.”—Horace, Book I. Ode 4. </note> <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin">CHAP XIV.]</note> <lb/>
            desire is more delightful than enjoyment. But if the prime <lb/>
            of life has more cheerful enjoyment of those very pleasures, <lb/>
            in the first place they are but petty objects which it en- <lb/>
            joys, as I have said before; then they are those of which. <lb/>
            old age, if it does not abundantly possess them, is not <lb/>
            altogether destitute. As he is more delighted with Turpio <lb/>
            Ambivius, who is spectator on the foremost bench,* yet <lb/>
            he also is delighted who is in the hindmost; so youth <lb/>
            having a close view of pleasures, is perhaps more grati- <lb/>
            fied ; but old age is as much delighted as is necessary in <lb/>
            viewing them at a distance. But of what high value are the <lb/>
            following circumstances, that the soul, after it has served out, <lb/>
            as it were, its time under lust, ambition, contention, enmities, <lb/>
            and all the passions, shall retire within itself, and, as the <lb/>
            phrase is, live with itself? But if it has, as it were, food for <lb/>
            study and learning, nothing is more delightful than an old age <lb/>
            of leisure. I saw Caius Gallus, the intimate friend of your <lb/>
            father, Scipio, almost expiring in the employment of calcu- <lb/>
            latin- the sky and the earth. How often did daylight over- <lb/>
            take him when he had begun to draw some figure by night. <lb/>
            how often did night, when he had begun in the morning ! <lb/>
            How it did delight him to predict to us the eclipses of the sun <lb/>
            and the moon, long before their occurrence! What shall we <lb/>
            say in the case of pursuits less dignified, yet, notwithstanding, <lb/>
            requiring acuteness! How Nævius did delight in his Punic <lb/>
            "war ! how Plautus in his Truculentus! how in his Pseudolus I <lb/>
            I saw also the old man Livy, † who, though he had brought a <lb/>
            play upon the stage six years before I was born, in the consul- <lb/>
            ship of Cento and Tuditanus, yet advanced in age even to the <lb/>
            time of my youth. Why should I speak of Publius Licinius <lb/>
            Crassus's study both of pontifical and civil law ? or of the <lb/>
            present Publius Scipio, who within these few days was cre- <lb/>
            ated chief pontiff? Yet we have seen all these persons whom <lb/>
            I have mentioned, ardent in these pursuits when old men. <lb/>
            But as to Marcus Cethegus, whom Ennius rightly called the <note type="footnote"> * Primd caved. The theatre was of a semicircular form : the foremost <lb/>
            rows next the stage were called orchestra: fourteen rows behind them were <lb/>

            quently called cavea. </note><note type="footnote"> t Livius A ndronicus flourished at Rome about 240 years before the <lb/>

            “ marrow of persuasion,” with what great zeal did we see him <lb/>
            engage in the practice of oratory, even when an old man! <lb/>
            What pleasures, therefore, arising from banquets, or plays, <lb/>
            or harlots, are to be compared with these pleasures ? And <lb/>
            these, indeed, are the pursuits of learning, which too, with <lb/>
            the sensible and well educated, increase along with their age: <lb/>
            so that is a noble saying of Solon, when he says in a certain <lb/>
            verse, as I observed before, that he grew old learning many <lb/>
            things every day-than which pleasure of the mind, certainly, <lb/>
            none can be greater.</p>
          <p>XV. I come now to the pleasures of husbandmen, with <lb/>
            which I am excessively delighted ; which are not checked <lb/>
            by any old age, and appear in my mind to make the <lb/>
            nearest approach to the life of a wise man.* For they have <lb/>
            relation to the earth, which never refuses command, and <lb/>
            never returns without interest that which it hath received ; <lb/>
            but sometimes with less, generally with very great interest. <lb/>
            And yet for my part it is not only the product, but the virtue <lb/>
            and nature of the earth itself delight me ; which, when in its <lb/>
            softened and subdued bosom it has received the scattered <lb/>
            seed, first of all confines what is hidden within it, from which <lb/>
            harrowing, which produces that effect, derives its name <lb/>
            (occatio) ; then, when it is warmed by heat and its own com- <lb/>
            pression, it spreads it out, and elicits from it the verdant <lb/>
            blade, which, supported by the fibres of the roots, gradually <lb/>
            grows up, and, rising on a jointed stalk, is now enclosed in a <lb/>
            sheath, as if it were of tender age, out of which, when it <lb/>
            hath shot up, it then pours forth the fruit of the ear, piled in <lb/>
            due order, and is guarded by a rampart of beards against the <lb/>
            pecking of the smaller birds. Why should I, in the case <lb/>
            of vines, tell of the plantings, the risings, the stages of <lb/>
            growth ? That you may know the repose and amusement of <lb/>
            my old age, I assure you that I can never have enough of <lb/>
            that gratification. For I pass over the peculiar nature of all <lb/>
            things which are produced from the earth: which generates <note type="footnote"> * “ God Almighty first planted a garden ; and indeed it is the purest of <lb/>

            fall, and is borne down to the ground, unless it be propped, <lb/>
            in order to raise itself up, embraces with its tendrils, as it <lb/>
            were with hands, whatever it meets with ; which, as it creeps <lb/>
            with manifold and wandering course, the skill of the hus- <lb/>
            bandmen, pruning with the knife, restrains from running <lb/>
            into a forest of twigs, and spreading too far in all directions. <lb/>
            Accordingly, in the beginning of spring, in those twigs <lb/>
            which are left, there rises up as it were at the joints of the <lb/>
            branches that which is called a bud, from which the nascent <lb/>
            grape shows itself; which, increasing in size by the moisture <lb/>
            of the earth and the heat of the sun, is at first very acid to <lb/>
            the taste, and then as it ripens grows sweet, and being <lb/>
            clothed with its large leaves does not want moderate warmth, <lb/>
            and yet keeps off the excessive heat of the sun ; than which <lb/>
            what can be in fruit on the one hand more rich, or on the <lb/>
            other hand more beautiful in appearance ? Of which not <lb/>
            only the advantage, as I said before, but also the cultivation <lb/>
            and the nature itself delights me : the rows of props, the <lb/>
            joining of the heads, the tying up and propagation of vines, <lb/>
            and the pruning of some twigs, and the grafting of others, <lb/>
            which I have mentioned. Why should I allude to irriga- <lb/>
            tions, why to the diggings of the ground, why to the trenching <lb/>
            by which the ground is made much more productive ? Why <lb/>
            should I speak of the advantage of manuring ? I have treated <lb/>
            of it in that book which I wrote respecting rural affairs, <lb/>
            concerning which the learned Hesiod has not said a single <lb/>
            word, though he has written about the cultivation of the <lb/>
            land. But Homer, who, as appears to me, lived many ag<unclear>s</unclear> <lb/>
            before, introduces Laertes soothing the regret which lie felt <lb/>
            for his son, by tilling the land and manuring it. Nor in- <lb/>
            deed is rural life delightful by reason of corn-fields only <lb/>
            and meadows and vineyards and groves, but also for its <lb/>
            gardens and orchards; also for the feeding of cattle, the <lb/>
            swarms of bees, and the variety of all kinds of flowers.* Nor <note type="footnote"> * " I look upon the pleasure which we take in a garden, as one of the <lb/>

            but even those things which I have mentioned, I perceive to <lb/>
            have been rather long. But you will forgive me; for both <lb/>
            from my love of rural life I have been carried away, and old <lb/>
            age is by nature rather talkative, that I may not appear to <lb/>
            vindicate it from all failings. In such a life then as this, <lb/>
            Marcus Curius,t after he had triumphed over the Samnites, <lb/>
            over the Sabines, over Pyrrhus, spent the closing period of <lb/>
            his existence. In contemplating whose country seat, too <lb/>
            (for it is not far distant from my house), I cannot sufficiently <lb/>
            admire either the continence of the man himself, or the moral <lb/>
            character of the times.</p>
          <p>When the Samnites had brought a great quantity of gold to <lb/>
            Curius as he sat by his fire-side, they were repelled with dis- <lb/>
            dain by him ; for he said that it did not appear to him glorious <lb/>
            to possess gold, but to have power over those who possessed <lb/>
            gold. Could so great a soul fail in rendering old age pleasant ? <lb/>
            But I come to husbandmen, that I may not digress from my- <lb/>
            self. In the country at that time there were senators, and <lb/>
            they too old men : inasmuch as Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus <lb/>
            was at the plough when it was announced to him that he was <lb/>
            made dictator : by whose command when dictator, Caius <lb/>
            Servilius Ahala, the master of the horse, arrested and put <lb/>
            to death Spurius Melius, who was aspiring to kingly power. <lb/>
            From their country-house, Curius and other old men were <lb/>
            summoned to the senate, from which cause they who sum- <lb/>
            moned them were termed "viatores." Was then their old <lb/>
            age to be pitied, who amused themselves in the cultivation <lb/>
            of land ? In my opinion, indeed, I know not whether any <lb/>
            other can be more happy: and not only in the discharge of <note type="footnote"> first parents before the fall. It is naturally apt to fill the mind with calm- <lb/>
            ness and tranquillity, and to lay all its turbulent passions at rest. It gives <lb/>
            us a great insight into the contrivance and wisdom of Providence, and <lb/>
            suggests innumerable subjects for meditation.”-Spectator, No. 477. </note><note type="footnote"> * Consitio, sowing or planting; insitio, grafting; repastinatio, trench- <lb/>

            duty, because to the whole race of mankind the cultivation <lb/>
            of the land is beneficial; but also from the amusement, which <lb/>
            I have mentioned, and that fulness and abundance of all <lb/>
            things which are connected with the food of men, and also <lb/>
            with the worship of the gods; so that, since some have a <lb/>
            desire for these things, we may again put ourselves on good <lb/>
            terms with pleasure. For the wine-cellar of a good and <lb/>
            diligent master is always well stored; the oil-casks, the <lb/>
            pantry also, the whole farm-house is richly supplied; it <lb/>
            abounds in pigs, kids, lambs, hens, milk, cheese, honey. <lb/>
            Then, too, the countrymen themselves call the garden a <lb/>
            second dessert. And then what gives a greater relish to <lb/>
            these things is that kind of leisure labour, fowling and hunt- <lb/>
            in-. Why should I speak of the greenness of meadows, or <lb/>
            the rows of trees, or the handsome appearance of vineyards <lb/>
            and olive grounds ? Let me cut the matter short. Nothing <lb/>
            can be either more rich in use, or more elegant in appear- <lb/>
            ance than ground well tilled; to the enjoyment of which <lb/>
            old age is so far from being an obstacle, that it is even, <lb/>
            an invitation and allurement. For where can that age <lb/>
            be better warmed either by basking in the sun or by the <lb/>
            fire, or again be more healthfully refreshed by shades or <lb/>
            waters ? Let the young, therefore, keep to themselves their <lb/>
            arms, horses, spears, clubs, tennis-ball, swimmings, and <lb/>
            races : to us old men let them leave out of many amuse- <lb/>
            ments the tali and tesseræ;* and even in that matter it may <lb/>
            be as they please, since old age can be happy without these <lb/>
            amusements.</p>
          <p>XVII. For many purposes the books of Xenophon are <lb/>
            very useful; which read, I pray you, with diligence, as you <lb/>
            are doing. At what length is agriculture praised by him in <lb/>

            bulus, [and remarks] that Cyrus the younger,* king of the <lb/>
            Persians, pre-eminent in talent and the glory of his empire, <lb/>
            when Lysander† the Lacedæmonian, a man of the highest <lb/>
            valour, had come to him at Sardis, and had brought to him <lb/>
            presents from the allies, both in other respects was courteous <lb/>
            and kind towards Lysander, and in particular showed to him <lb/>
            an enclosed piece of ground planted with great care. And that <lb/>
            when Lysander admired both the tallness of the trees and the <lb/>
            lines arranged in a quincunx, and the ground well cultivated <lb/>
            and clear, and the sweetness of the perfumes which were <lb/>
            breathed from the flowers, he said that he admired not only the <lb/>
            diligence, but also the skilfulness of the man by whom these <lb/>
            grounds had been planned and measured out; and that Cyrus <lb/>
            answered him, “Well, it was I who planned all these grounds ; <lb/>
            mine are the rows, mine the laying out; many also of these <lb/>
            trees were planted by my own hand." That then Lysander, <lb/>
            beholding his purple robe and the elegance of his person, and <lb/>
            his Persian dress adorned with much gold and many jewels, <lb/>
            said, "0 Cyrus, they truly report you as happy, since excel- <lb/>
            lence is combined with your fortune !" This lot then old men <lb/>
            may enjoy ; nor does age hinder us from retaining the pursuit <lb/>
            both of other things, and especially of cultivating the land, <lb/>
            even to the last period of old age. In the case of Marcus <lb/>
            Valerius Corvus, we have heard that he continued to live to <lb/>
            his hundredth year, while, when his (active) life had been <lb/>
            spent, he lived in the country and tilled the land: between <lb/>
            whose first and sixth consulship forty-six years intervened. <lb/>
            Thus, as long a period of life as our ancestors considered to <lb/>
            reach to the beginning of old age, just so long was the career <lb/>
            of his honours : and the close of his life was happier on this <lb/>
            account than the middle, because it had more of authority <lb/>
            and less of toil. Now authority is the crown of old age. How <lb/>
            great was it in Lucius Cæcilius Metellus! how great in <lb/>
            Atilius Calatinus ! on whom was that singular inscription- <lb/>
            "Many nations agree that he was the leading man of the <lb/>
            people." It is a well-known epitaph, inscribed on his tomb. <lb/>
            He therefore was justly dignified, about whose praises the <note type="footnote"> * Cyrus the younger. He attempted to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes, <lb/>

            report of all men was concurrent. How great a man have <lb/>
            we seen in Publius Crassus, late pontifex maximus ; how <lb/>
            great a man subsequently in Marcus Lepidus, invested with <lb/>
            the same sacerdotal office ! Why should I speak of Paulus or <lb/>
            Africanus ? or, as I have already done, about Maximus ? men <lb/>
            not only in whose expressed judgment, but even in whose <lb/>
            acquiescence authority resided. Old age, especially an <lb/>
            honoured old age, has so great authority, that this is of more <lb/>
            value than all the pleasures of youth.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But in my whole discourse remember that I am <lb/>
            praising that old age which is established on the foundations <lb/>
            of youth : from which this is effected which I once asserted <lb/>
            with the great approbation of all present,-that wretched <lb/>
            was the old age which had to defend itself by speaking. <lb/>
            Neither grey hairs nor wrinkles can suddenly catch respect; <lb/>
            but the former part of life honourably spent, reaps the fruits <lb/>
            of authority at the close. For these very observances, which <lb/>
            seem light and common, are marks of honour-to be saluted, to <lb/>
            be sought after, to receive precedence, to have persons rising <lb/>
            up to you, to be attended on the way, to be escorted home, to <lb/>
            be consulted; points which, both among us and in other states, <lb/>
            in proportion as they are the most excellent in their morals, are <lb/>
            the most scrupulously observed. They say that Lysander the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian, whom I mentioned a little above, was accus- <lb/>
            tomed to remark, that Lacedæmon was the most honourable <lb/>
            abode for old age; for nowhere is so much conceded to that <lb/>
            time of life, nowhere is old age more respected. Nay, further, <lb/>
            it is recorded that when at Athens, during the games, a cer- <lb/>
            tain elderly person had entered the theatre, a place was <lb/>
            nowhere offered him in that large assembly by his own <lb/>
            townsmen ; but when he had approached the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who, as they were ambassadors, had taken their seats together <lb/>
            in a particular place, they all rose up and invited the old <lb/>
            man to a seat; and when reiterated applause had been be- <lb/>
            btowed upon them by the whole assembly, one of them <lb/>
            remarked, that the Athenians knew what was right, but <lb/>
            were unwilling to do it. There are many excellent rules in <lb/>
            our college,* but this of which I am treating especially, that <lb/>
            in proportion as each man has the advantage in age, so he <note type="footnote"> * In nostro collegio. The College of Augurs is here meant, which Cicera <lb/>
            calls, "amplissimi sacerdotii collegium.” </note> <pb n="246"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP XIX.</note><lb/>
            takes precedence in giving his opinion; ar.d older augurs are <lb/>
            preferred not only to those who are higher in office, but even <lb/>
            to such as are in actual command. What pleasures, then, of <lb/>
            the body can be compared with the privileges of authority ? <lb/>
            which they who have nobly employed seem to me to have <lb/>
            consummated the drama of life, and not like inexpert per- <lb/>
            formers to have broken down in the last act. Still old men <lb/>
            are peevish, and fretful, and passionate, and unmanageable, <lb/>
            —nay, if we seek for such, also covetous : but these are the <lb/>
            faults of their characters, not of their old age. And yet <lb/>
            that peevishness and those faults which I have mentioned <lb/>
            have some excuse, not quite satisfactory indeed, but such <lb/>
            as may be admitted. They fancy that they are neglected, <lb/>
            despised, made a jest of; besides, in a weak state of body <lb/>
            every offence is irritating. All which defects, however, <lb/>
            are extenuated by good dispositions and qualities ; and this <lb/>
            may be discovered not only in real life, but on the stage, <lb/>
            from the two brothers that are represented in the Brothers ;* <lb/>
            how much austerity in the one, and how much gentleness in <lb/>
            the other ! Such is the fact: for as it is not every wine, so <lb/>
            it is not every man's life, that grows sour from old age. I <lb/>
            approve of gravity in old age, but this in a moderate degree, <lb/>
            like everything else ; harshness by no means. † What avarice <lb/>
            in an old man can propose to itself I cannot conceive : for <lb/>
            can anything be more absurd than, in proportion as less of <lb/>
            our journey remains, to seek a greater supply of provisions?</p>
          <p>XLX. A fourth reason remains, which seems most of all <lb/>
            to distress and render anxious our time of life, namely, the <lb/>
            near approach of death, which certainly cannot be far distant <lb/>
            from old age. 0 wretched old man, who in so long a time <lb/>
            of life hast not seen that death is a thing to be despised ! <lb/>
            Which either ought altogether to be regarded with indiffer- <lb/>
            ence, if it entirely annihilates the mind, or ought even to be <note type="footnote"> * A delphi. A play of Terence: Demea and Micio are the names of the <lb/>

            passionate man. When the vigour of youth fails him, and his amusements <lb/>

            into peevishness ; that peevishness, for want of novelty and variety, becomes <lb/>
            habitual; the world falls off from around him, and he is left, as Homer ex- <lb/>

            desired, if it leads it to a place where it is destined to be im- <lb/>
            mortal.* Yet no third alternative certainly can be found.</p>
          <p>What, therefore, should I fear, if after death I am sure <lb/>
            either not to be miserable or to be happy ? Although who is <lb/>
            so foolish, though he be young, as to be assured that he will <lb/>
            live even till the evening ? Nay, that period of life has <lb/>
            many more probabilities of death than ours has : young <lb/>
            men more readily fall into diseases, suffer more severely, are <lb/>
            cured with more difficulty, and therefore few arrive at old <lb/>
            age. Did not this happen so, we should live better and more <lb/>
            wisely, for intelligence, and reflection, and judgment reside <lb/>
            in old men, and if there had been none of them, no states <lb/>
            could exist at all. But I return to the imminence of death. <lb/>
            What charge is that against old age, since you see it to be <lb/>
            common to youth also ? I experienced not only in the case <lb/>
            of my own excellent son, but also in that of your brothers, <lb/>
            Scipio, men plainly marked out for the highest distinction, <lb/>
            that death was common to every period of life. Yet a young <note type="footnote"> * " I thank God I have not those straight ligaments or narrow obligations <lb/>

            die; that is, to cease to breathe, to take a farewell of the elements, to be a <lb/>
            kind of nothing for a moment, to be within one instant of a spirit. When <lb/>
            I take a full view and circle of myself without this reasonable moderator <lb/>
            and equal piece of justice, I do conceive myself the miserablest person ex- <lb/>
            taut ; were there not another life that I hope for, all the vanities of this <lb/>
            world should not intreat a moment's bi eath from me ; could the devil work <lb/>
            my belief to imagine I could never die, I would not outlive that very <lb/>
            thought; I have so abject a conceit of this common way of existence, this <lb/>
            retaining to the sun and elements—I cannot think this is to be a man, or to <lb/>
            live according to the dignity of humani y: in expectation of a better, I can <lb/>
            with patience embrace this life; yet ii my best meditations do often defy <lb/>
            death ; I honour any man that contemis it, nor can highly love any that is <lb/>
            afraid of it. This makes me natural <unclear/> love a soldier, and honour those <lb/>

            man hopes that he will live a long time, which expectation <lb/>
            an old man cannot entertain. His hope is but a foolish one : <lb/>
            for what can be more foolish than to regard uncertainties as <lb/>
            certainties, delusions as truths ? An old man indeed has <lb/>
            nothing to hope for ; yet he is in so much the happier state <lb/>
            than a young one; since he has already attained what the <lb/>
            other is only hoping for. The one is wishing to live long, <lb/>
            the other has lived long. And yet, good gods ! what is there <lb/>
            in man's life that can be called long ? For allow the latest <lb/>
            period: let us anticipate the age of the kings of the Tar- <lb/>
            tessii. For there dwelt, as I find it recorded, a man named <lb/>
            Arganthonius at Gades,* who reigned for eighty years, and <lb/>
            lived 120. But to my mind, nothing whatever seems of long <lb/>
            duration, in which there is any end. For when that arrives, <lb/>
            then the time which has passed has flowed away; that only <lb/>
            remains which you have secured by virtue and right conduct. <lb/>
            Hours indeed depart from us, and days and months and <lb/>
            years; nor does past time ever return, nor can it be dis- <lb/>
            covered what is to follow. Whatever time is assigned to <lb/>
            each to live, with that he ought to be content: for neither <lb/>
            need the drama be performed entire by the actor, in order <lb/>
            to give satisfaction, provided he be approved in whatever <lb/>
            act he may be: nor need the wise man live till the <lb/>
            plaudite. † For the short period of life is long enough <lb/>

            by so sublime a prize, the man of virtue looks down with contempt on <lb/>
            all the allurements of pleasure, and all the menaces of danger. Death <lb/>
            itself loses its terrors when he considers that its dominion extends only <lb/>
            over a part of him, and that, in spite of death and time, the rage of the <lb/>

            further, you need no more grieve than farmers do when the <lb/>
            loveliness of spring-time hath passed, that summer and <lb/>
            autumn have come. For spring represents the time of youth, <lb/>
            and gives promise of the future fruits ; the remaining seasons <lb/>
            are intended for plucking and gathering in those fruits. Now <lb/>
            the harvest of old age, as I have often said, is the recollection <lb/>
            and abundance of blessings previously secured. In truth <lb/>
            everything that happens agreeably to nature is to be reckoned <lb/>
            among blessings. What, however, is so agreeable to nature <lb/>
            as for an old man to die ? which even is the lot of the young, <lb/>
            though nature opposes and resists. And thus it is that <lb/>
            young men seem to me to die, just as when the violence of <lb/>
            flame is extinguished by a flood of water; whereas old men <lb/>
            die, as the exhausted fire goes out, spontaneously, without <lb/>
            the exertion of any force : and as fruits when they are <lb/>
            green are plucked by force from the trees, but when ripe and <lb/>
            mellow drop off, so violence takes away their lives from <lb/>
            youths, maturity from old men ; a state which to me indeed <lb/>
            is so delightful, that the nearer I approach to death, I seem <lb/>

          <p>XX. Of all the periods of life there is a definite limit; <lb/>
            but of old age there is no limit fixed; and life goes on very <lb/>
            well in it, so long as you are able to follow up and attend to <lb/>
            the duty of your situation, and, at the same time, to care <lb/>
            nothing about death : whence it happens that old age is even <lb/>
            of higher spirit and bolder than youth. Agreeable to this <lb/>
            was the answer given to Pisistratus,* the tyrant, by Solon; <lb/>
            when on the former inquiring, "in reliance on what hope <lb/>
            he so boldly withstood him," the latter is said to have <lb/>
            answered, "on old age." The happiest end of life is this- <lb/>
            when the mind and the other senses being unimpaired, the <lb/>
            same nature, which put it together, takes asunder her own <lb/>
            work. As in the case of a ship or a house, he who built them <lb/>
            takes them down most easily; so the same nature which has <lb/>
            compacted man, most easily breaks him up. Besides, every <lb/>
            fastening of glue, when fresh, is with difficulty torn asunder, <lb/>
            but easily when tried by time. Hence it is that that short rem- <lb/>
            nant of life should be neither greedily coveted, nor without <lb/>
            reason given up : and Pythagoras forbids us to abandon the <lb/>
            station or post of life without the orders of our commander, <lb/>
            that is of God.† There is indeed a saying of the wise Solon, in <note type="footnote"> even the best seasons of life are able to supply sufficient gratifications with- <lb/>
            out anticipating uncertain felicities, it cannot surely be supposed that old <lb/>
            age, worn with labours, harassed with anxieties, and tortured with diseases, <lb/>
            should have any gladness of its own, or feel any satisfaction from the con- <lb/>
            templation of the present. All the comfort that can now be expected must <lb/>
            be recalled from the past, or borrowed from the future; the past is very <lb/>
            soon exhausted; all the events or actions of which the memory can afford <lb/>
            pleasure, are quickly recollected; and the future lies beyond the grave, <lb/>
            where it can be reached only by virtue and devotion. Piety is the only <lb/>

            B. c. 527. </note><note type="footnote"> t Upon this passage Melmoth has a note, of which the following is an <lb/>
            abstract : "Although the practice of suicide too generally prevailed among <lb/>
            the ancient Greeks and Romans, yet it was a practice condemned by the <lb/>
            best and wisest of their philosophers. Nothing can be more clear and ex- <lb/>
            press than the prohibition of Pythagoras with respect to this act, as cited by <lb/>
            Cicero in the present passage; and in this he was followed both by Socrates <lb/>
            and Plato, those noblest and most enlightened of the pagan moralists, con- <lb/>
            sidered suicide as an act of rebellion against the authority of the Supreme <lb/>
            Being, who having placed man in his present post, bath reserved to himself <lb/>
            alone the right of determining the proper time for his dismission. Agreeably <lb/>
            to these principles, Cicero in his relation of Scipio's dream, represents the <lb/>
            departed spirit of Emilius as assuring his son, who had expressed an im- </note> <pb n="251"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP XX.]</note><lb/>
            which he declares that he does not wish his oivn death to be <lb/>
            unattended by the grief and lamentation of friends. He <note type="footnote">patience of joining him in the heavenly mansions, that there was no admit- <lb/>
            tance into those regions of felicity for the man who attempted to force his <lb/>
            way into them by his own unauthorized act. The Platonic poet, it is well <lb/>
            known, places those unhappy persons in a state of punishment, who not <lb/>
            having the piety and the courage to support their misfortunes with due <lb/>
            resignation, impiously endeavoured to deliver themselves by venturing to be <lb/>
            their own executioners." </note><note type="footnote"> Such were the sentiments of the most approved moralists among the <lb/>
            ancient philosophers; the doctrine of the Stoics, it must be acknowledged, <lb/>
            was more relaxed upon this important article ; but although they did not <lb/>
            scruple to represent it even as a duty in some very particular circum- <lb/>
            stances, they ought, if they had reasoned consequentially from their own <lb/>
            principles, to have held it forth as highly criminal in all. For there is no <lb/>
            precept of morality which they inculcate more frequently, nor in stronger <lb/>
            terms, than an unlimited submission to the dispensations of Providence ; <lb/>
            the truth is, the ancient writers of this sect are not more at variance with <lb/>
            reason than with themselves in what they have delivered upon this subject. <lb/>
            Inconsistency, indeed, is one of the characteristical marks of the Stoical <lb/>
            system, as Plutarch has proved by a variety of instances drawn from the <lb/>
            writings of Chrysippus. Those of Seneca and Epictetus may equally be <lb/>
            produced in support of the same charge, so far at least as relates to their <lb/>
            sentiments on the present question; for they sometimes contend for the <lb/>
            lawfulness of suicide without any restriction, sometimes only under very <lb/>
            peculiar circumstances, and sometimes zealously press upon their disciples, <lb/>
            as an indispensable obligation, the duty of a pious acquiescence under all <lb/>
            the various calamities of human life. </note><note type="footnote"> Agreeably to this last position, Seneca, in answer to a querulous letter <lb/>
            he had received from his friend Lucilius, writes thus :-" A wise and good <lb/>
            man," says he, " should stand prepared for all events, remembering that he <lb/>
            is destined to pass through a world where pain and sorrow, disease and in- <lb/>
            firmity, are posted in his way. It is not in his power to change these <lb/>
            conditions upon which he receives his present existence; but it certainly is <lb/>
            to submit to them with such fortitude and acquiescence in the laws of <lb/>
            nature, as becomes a virtuous mind. It should be our constant endeavour, <lb/>
            therefore, to reconcile our minds to these unalterable laws of Providence, <lb/>
            and to submit to them without murmur or complaint; fully persuaded that <lb/>
            every thing is as it ought to be, and that the government of the world is in <lb/>
            the hands of the Supreme Being. To deliver himself up to that Being <lb/>
            with an implicit and unreserved resignation, is the merit of a truly great <lb/>
            soul, as it is of a base and little mind to entertain unworthy suspicions of <lb/>
            the order established in the world, to attempt to break through the laws of <lb/>
            Providence; and instead of correcting his own ways, impiously presume to <lb/>
            correct the ways of God.”—Sen. Ess. 107. </note><note type="footnote"> To the same purpose, and with equal inconsistency, is the doctrine of <lb/>
            Epictetus; on the one hand telling those who complain under the pressure <lb/>
            of any calamity that they have the remedy in their own power, and on the <lb/>
            other exhorting them to bear with a patient composure of mind the evils <lb/>

            wishes, I suppose, that he should be dear to his friends. But <lb/>
            I know not whether Ennius does not say with more pro- <lb/>
            priety, <lb/>
            " Let no one pay me honour with tears, nor celebrate my funeral with <lb/>
            mourning."</p>
          <p>He conceives that a death ought not to be lamented which <lb/>
            an immortality follows. Besides, a dying man may have <lb/>
            some degree of consciousness, but that for a short time, espe- <lb/>
            cially in the case of an old man: after death, indeed, con- <lb/>
            sciousness either does not exist, or it is a thing to be desired. <lb/>
            But this ought to be a subject of study from our youth to be <lb/>
            indifferent about death; without which study no one can be <lb/>
            of tranquil mind. For die we certainly must, and it is <lb/>
            uncertain whether or not on this very day. He, therefore, <lb/>
            who at all hours dreads impending death, how can he be at <lb/>
            peace in his mind ? concerning which there seems to be no <lb/>
            need of such long discussion, when I call to mind not only <lb/>
            Lucius Brutus, who was slain in liberating his country; nor <lb/>
            the two Decii, who spurred on their steeds to a voluntary <lb/>
            death; nor Marcus Atilius,* who set out to execution, that <lb/>
            he might keep a promise pledged to the enemy; nor the two <lb/>
            Scipios, who even with their very bodies sought to obstruct <lb/>
            the march of the Carthaginians ; nor your grandfather Lucius <lb/>
            Paulus, † who by his death atoned for the temerity of his <note type="footnote"> warranted desertion of that post in which the Supreme Being has thought <lb/>
            proper to place them. </note><note type="footnote"> With the exception of the cases of soldiers, suicide was not forbidden by <lb/>
            the Roman law, nor was it discountenanced by public opinion. Voluntary <lb/>
            suicide, by the law of England is a crime; and every suicide is presumed to <lb/>
            be voluntary until the contrary is made apparent. It is remarkable, how- <lb/>
            ever, that even English moralists are by no means unanimous in con- <lb/>
            demning it; both Hume and Godwin submit it to the test of a mere calculation <lb/>
            of expediency. The Code Penal of France contains no legislation on the <lb/>
            subject of suicide. Of the modern codes of Germany, some adopt the <lb/>
            silence of the French code, and others vary in their particular provisions. <lb/>
            In the Bavarian and Saxon codes, suicide is not mentioned. The Prussian <lb/>
            code forbids all mutilation of the dead body of a self-murderer, under ordi- <lb/>
            nary circumstances, but declares that it shall be buried without any marks <lb/>

            men, and they not only ignorant, but mere peasants, des- <lb/>
            pise ? On the whole, as it seems to me indeed, a satiety of <lb/>
            all pursuits causes a satiety of life. There are pursuits pe- <lb/>
            culiar to boyhood; do therefore young men regret the loss of <lb/>
            them ? There are also some of early youth ; does that now <lb/>
            settled age, which is called middle life, seek after these ? <lb/>
            There are also some of this period ; neither are they looked for <lb/>
            by old age. There are some final pursuits of old age; accor- <lb/>
            dingly, as the pursuits of the earlier parts of life fall into <lb/>
            disuse, so also do those of old age; and when this has taken <lb/>
            place, satiety of life brings on the seasonable period of <lb/>

            we are shut up in this prison of the body, we are fulfilling as <note type="footnote"> -It In another of his writings, "The Tusculan Questions," Cicero thus ex- <lb/>
            presses himself: "There is, I know not how, in minds, a certain presage as it <lb/>
            were, o a future existence. And this takes the deepest root, and is most <lb/>
            discoverable in the greatest geniuses and most exalted minds." It was <lb/>
            naturally to be expected that far more distinct and elevated views should <lb/>
            be entertained upon this subject subsequently to the dawn of the Christian <lb/>
            dispensation, and it is most interesting to observe both the resemblances and <lb/>
            the contrasts which obtain between the views of Cicero, the most enlightened <lb/>
            of heathen advocates for the soul's immortality, and of Christian moralists;- <lb/>
            the analogies doubtless arising from the universality and instinctiveness of <lb/>
            the notion, and the differences being readily explained by the fuller light <lb/>
            shed upon the subject by the Christian revelation. We will select Addison <lb/>
            as one of the most charming, if not one of the most profound of the latter <lb/>
            school. In stating the arguments for the immortality of the soul, in one <lb/>
            of his elegant essays, he has the following observations :—" I consider these <lb/>
            several proofs drawn: First, from the nature of the soul itself, and particu- <lb/>
            larly its immateriality, which though not absolutely necessary to the eternity <lb/>
            of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almost a demonstration. <lb/>
            Secondly. From its passions and sentiments. As particularly from its love <lb/>
            of existence, its horror of anihilation, and its hopes of immortality, with <lb/>
            that secret satisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that <lb/>
            uneasiness which follows in it upon the commission of vice. Thirdly, <lb/>
            From the nature of the Supreme Being, whose justice, wisdom, goodness. <lb/>
            and veracity, are all concerned in this great point. But among these and <lb/>
            other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul, there is one <lb/>
            drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection, without a <lb/>
            possibility of its ever arriving at it, which is a hint that I do not remember <lb/>
            to have seen opened and improved by others who have written upon this <lb/>
            subject, though it seems to me to carry a great weight with it. How can it <lb/>
            enter into the thoughts of man, that the soul, which is capable of such <lb/>
            immense perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, <lb/>
            shall fall away into nothing almost as soon as it is created ? Are such <lb/>
            abilities made for no purpose ? A brute arrives at a point of perfection <lb/>
            that he can never pass in a few years ; he has all the endowments he is <lb/>
            capable of, and were he to live ten thousand more, would be the same <lb/>
            thing he is at present. Were a human soul thus at a stand in her accom- <lb/>
            plishments, were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of further <lb/>
            enlargements, I could imagine it might fall away insensibly, and drop at <lb/>
            once into a state of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being <lb/>
            that is in a perpetual progress of improvements, and travelling on from <lb/>
            perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad into the works of <lb/>
            its Creator, and made a few discoveries of his infinite goodness, wisdom, <lb/>
            and power, must perish at her first setting out, and in the beginning of her <lb/>
            inquiries? </note><note type="footnote"> " There is not in my opinion a more pleasing and triumphant considera- <lb/>

            it were the function and painful task of destiny: for the <lb/>
            heaven-born soul has been degraded from its dwelling- <lb/>
            place above, and as it were buried in the earth, a situation <lb/>
            uncongenial to its divine and immortal nature. But I believe <lb/>
            that the immortal gods have shed souls into human bodies, <lb/>
            that beings might exist who might tend the earth, and by <lb/>
            contemplating the order of the heavenly bodies, might imitate <lb/>
            it in the manner and regularity of their lives.* Nor have <lb/>
            reason and argument alone influenced me thus to believe, but <lb/>
            likewise the high name and authority of the greatest philo- <lb/>
            sophers. I used to hear that Pythagoras and the Pytha- <lb/>
            goreans, † who were all but our neighbours, who were formerly <lb/>
            called the Italian philosophers, had no doubt that we possess <lb/>
            souls derived from the universal divine mind. Moreover, <lb/>
            the arguments were conclusive to me, which Socrates de- <lb/>
            livered on the last day of his life concerning the immortality <lb/>
            of the soul,-he who was pronounced by the oracle of Apollo <lb/>
            the wisest of all men. But why say more ? I have thus per- <lb/>

            which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it must be a prospect pleasing <lb/>

            of man should be an attempt to represent on earth the beauty and harmony <lb/>

            past, and their sagacity regarding things future,-so many <lb/>
            arts, so many sciences, so many discoveries, that the nature <lb/>

            the mind is ever in action and has no source of motion, <lb/>

            argument, that men know very many things before they are <lb/>
            born, since when mere boys, while they are learning difficult <lb/>
            subjects, they so quickly catch up numberless ideas, that they <lb/>
            seem not to be learning them then for the first time, but to <lb/>

          <p>XXII. Moreover, in Xenophon, Cyrus the elder,* on his <lb/>
            death-bed, discourses thus: “Never imagine, 0 my dearest <lb/>
            sons, that when I have departed from you, I shall exist <lb/>
            nowhere, or cease to be : for while I was with you you <lb/>
            never saw my soul; though you concluded from the actions <lb/>
            which I performed that it was in this body. Believe, <lb/>
            therefore, that it still exists, though you will see nothing of <lb/>
            it. Nor, in truth, would the honours of illustrious men con- <lb/>
            tinue after death, if their own spirits did not make us pre- <lb/>
            serve a longer remembrance of them. I could never, indeed, <lb/>
            be persuaded that souls, while they were in mortal bodies, <lb/>
            lived; and when they had quitted them, perished: nor, in <lb/>
            truth, that the soul became senseless when it made its escape <lb/>
            from a senseless body; but that it then became wise when <lb/>
            freed from every corporeal admixture, it had become pure <lb/>
            and genuine. Besides, when the constitution of man is <lb/>
            broken up by death, it is clear whither each of its other parts <lb/>
            depart; for they all return to the source from whence <lb/>
            they sprang : whereas the soul alone, neither shows itself <lb/>
            when it is with us, nor when it departs. Further, you see <lb/>
            there is nothing so like death as sleep. Yet the souls of per- <lb/>
            sons asleep especially manifest their divine nature; for when <lb/>
            they are disengaged and free, they foresee many future <lb/>
            events.t From which we conclude in what state they will be <note type="footnote"> Platonic schools, which undoubtedly produced the most respectable philo- <lb/>

            only relate to our awaked souls, a confused and broken tale of that that <lb/>

            not, methinks, thoroughly defined it; nor yet Galen, though he seem to have <lb/>
            corrected it ; for those noctambuloes and night-walkers, though in their <lb/>
            sleep, do yet enjoy the action of their senses, we must therefore say <lb/>
            that there is something in us that is not in the jurisdiction of Morpheus, <lb/>
            and that those abstracted and ecstatic souls do walk about in their own corns, <lb/>
            as spirits with the bodies they assume wherein they seem to hear, see, and <lb/>
            feel, though indeed, the organs are destitute of sense, and their natures of <lb/>
            those faculties that should inform them. Thus it is observed that men <lb/>
            sometimes upon the hour of their departure, do speak and reason above <lb/>
            themselves ; for then the soul. beginning to be freed from the ligaments of <lb/>
            the body, begins to reason like herself, and to discourse in a strain above <lb/>

            she exerts herself. The slow of speech make unpremeditated harangues, <lb/>

            serve my memory." Such were the dying words of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Let me, if you please, revert to my own views. <lb/>
            No one will ever persuade me that either your father, Paulus, <lb/>
            or two grandfathers, Paulus and Africanus, or the father of <lb/>
            Africanus, or his uncle, or the many distinguished men whom <lb/>
            it is unnecessary to recount, aimed at such great exploits as <lb/>
            might reach to the recollection of posterity, had they not <lb/>
            perceived in their mind that posterity belonged to them. Do <lb/>
            you suppose, to boast a little of myself, after the manner of <lb/>
            old men, that I should have undergone such great toils, <lb/>
            by day and night, at home and in service, had I thought to <lb/>
            limit my glory by the same bounds as my life ? Would it not <lb/>
            have been far better to pass an easy and quiet life without <lb/>
            any toil or struggle ? But I know not how my soul, stretch- <lb/>
            ing upwards, has ever looked forward to posterity, as if, when <lb/>
            it had departed from life, then at last it would begin to live.* <note type="footnote"> a great dispute amongst the learned. The matter of fact is, I think, in- <lb/>
            contestable, and has been looked upon as such by the greatest writers who <lb/>
            have been never suspected either of superstition or enthusiasm. I do not <lb/>
            suppose that the soul in these instances is entirely loose and unfettered from <lb/>
            the body: it is sufficient if she is not so far sunk and immersed in matter, <lb/>
            nor entangled and perplexed in her operations with such motions of blood <lb/>
            and spirits, as when she actuates the machine in its waking hours. The <lb/>
            corporeal union is slackened enough to give the mind more play. The <lb/>
            soul seems gathered within herself, and recovers that spring which is broken <lb/>
            and weakened when she operates more in concert with the body.”—Spec- <lb/>
            tator, No. 487. </note><note type="footnote"> * ,Dr. Thomas Brown attaches no value to the argument for the immor- <lb/>
            tality of the soul, derived from the aspiration after it which is common to <lb/>
            all. “ I am aware," he says, " that in judging from the mind itself a <lb/>
            considerable stress has often been laid on the existence of feelings which <lb/>
            admit of a very easy solution, without the necessity of ascribing them to <lb/>
            any instinctive foreknowledge of a state of immortal being. Of this sort <lb/>
            particularly seems to me an argument which, both in ancient and modern <lb/>
            times, has been brought forward as one of the most powerful arguments <lb/>
            for our continued existence, after life has seemed to close upon us for ever. <lb/>
            I allude to the universal desire of this immortal existence. But surely, it <lb/>
            life itself be pleasing, and even though there were no existence beyond the <lb/>
            grave,-life might still, by the benevolence of Him who conferred it, have <lb/>
            been rendered a source of pleasure ; it is not wonderful that we should <lb/>
            desire futurity, since futurity is only protracted life. It would indeed have <lb/>
            been worthy of our astonishment if man, loving his present life, and </note> <note type="footnote"> s2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            And, indeed, unless this were the case, that souls were im- <lb/>
            mortal, the souls of the noblest of men would not aspire <lb/>
            above all things to an immortality of glory.* Why need I <lb/>
            adduce that the wisest man ever dies with the greatest equa- <lb/>
            nimity, the most foolish with the least ? Does it not seem to <lb/>
            you that the soul, which sees more and further, sees that it <note type="footnote"> knowing that it was to terminate in the space of a very few years, should <lb/>
            not have regretted the termination of what he loved ; that is to say, <lb/>
            should not have wished the continuance of it beyond the period of its <lb/>
            melancholy close. The universal desire then, even if the desire were truly <lb/>
            universal, would prove nothing, but the goodness of Him who has made <lb/>
            the realities of life-or if not the realities, the hopes of life -so pleasing <lb/>
            that the mere loss of what is possessed, or hoped, appears like a positive <lb/>
            evil of the most afflicting kind.”-Dr. Brown's Moral Philosophy, see. 97. </note><note type="footnote"> * “ I am fully persuaded that one of the best springs of generous and <lb/>
            worthy actions is having generous and worthy thoughts of ourselves. Who- <lb/>
            ever has a mean opinion of the dignity of his nature will act in no higher <lb/>
            a rank than he has allotted himself in his own estimation. If he considers <lb/>
            his being as circumscribed by the uncertain term of a few years, his designs <lb/>
            will be contracted into the same narrow space he imagines is to bound his <lb/>
            existence. How can he exalt his thoughts to anything great and noble, <lb/>
            who only believes that after a short turn on the stage of this world, he is <lb/>
            to sink into oblivion, and to lose his consciousness for ever ? For this <lb/>
            reason I am of opinion that so useful and elevated a contemplation as that <lb/>
            of the soul's immortality cannot be resumed too often. There is not a <lb/>
            more improving exercise to the human mind than to be frequently review- <lb/>

            observations : " If the love of fame is so far indulged by the mind as to <lb/>
            become independent and predominant; it is dangerous and irregular, but <lb/>
            it may be usefully employed as an inferior and secondary motive, and will <lb/>
            serve sometimes to revive our activity, when we begin to languish and lose <lb/>
            sight of that more certain, more valuable, and more durable reward, which <lb/>
            ought always to be our first hope and our last. But it must be strongly <lb/>
            impressed upon our minds that virtue is not to be pursued as one of the <lb/>
            means to fame; but fame to be accepted as the only recompence which <lb/>
            mortals can bestow on virtue, to be accepted with complacence, but not <lb/>
            sought with eagerness. Simply to be remembered is no advantage; it is <lb/>
            a privilege which satire as well as panegyric can confer, and is not more <lb/>
            enjoyed by Titus or Constantine than by Timocrean of Rhodes, of whom <lb/>
            we only a know from his epitaph, that he had eaten many a meal, drank <lb/>

            is to be drawn from the consciousness that we shall share the attention of <lb/>

            is passing to a better state, while that body, whose vision is <lb/>
            duller, does not see it ? I, indeed, am transported with eager- <lb/>

            and have myself written. Whither, indeed, as I proceed, no <lb/>
            one assuredly should easily force me back, nor, as they did <lb/>
            with Pelias, cook me again to youth. Foi if any god should <lb/>
            grant me, that from this period of life I should become a <lb/>
            child again and cry in the cradle, I should earnestly refuse <lb/>
            it :* nor in truth should I like, after having run, as it were, <lb/>
            my course, to be called back to the starting-place t from the <lb/>
            goal. For what comfort has life ? What trouble has it not, <lb/>
            rather? But grant that it has; yet it assuredly has either <lb/>
            satiety or limitation (of its pleasures). For I am not dis- <lb/>
            posed to lament the loss of life, which many men, and those <lb/>
            learned men too, have often done; neither do I regret that I <lb/>
            have lived, since I have lived in such a way that I con- <lb/>
            ceive I was not born in vain : and from this life I depart as <lb/>
            from a temporary lodging, not as from a home. For nature <lb/>
            has assigned it to us as an inn to sojourn in, not a place of <lb/>
            habitation. Oh, glorious day! when I shall depart to that <lb/>
            divine company and assemblage of spirits, and quit this <lb/>
            troubled and polluted scene. For I shall go not only to those <lb/>

            more distinguished for pious affection ; whose body was <lb/>
            burned by me, whereas, on the contrary, it was fitting that <lb/>
            mine should be burned by him. But his soul not deserting <lb/>
            me, but oft looking back, no doubt departed to those regions <lb/>
            whither it saw that I myself was destined to come. Which, <lb/>
            though a distress to me, I seemed patiently to endure : not that <lb/>
            I bore it with indifference, but I comforted myself with the <lb/>
            recollection that the separation and distance between us would <lb/>
            not continue long. For these reasons, 0 Scipio (since you <lb/>
            said that you with Lælius were accustomed to wonder at this), <lb/>
            old age is tolerable to me, and not only not irksome, but even <lb/>
            delightful. And if I am wrong in this, that I believe the <lb/>
            souls of men to be immortal, I willingly delude myself: nor <lb/>
            do I desire that this mistake, in which I take pleasure, should <lb/>
            be wrested from me as long as I live; but if I, when dead, <lb/>
            shall have no consciousness, as some narrow-minded philoso- <lb/>
            pliers imagine, I do not fear lest dead philosophers should <lb/>
            ridicule this my delusion. But if we are not destined to be <lb/>
            immortal, yet it is a desirable thing for a man to expire at <lb/>
            his fit time. For, as nature prescribes a boundary to all other <lb/>
            things, so does she also to life. Now old age is the consum- <lb/>
            mation of life, just as of a play; from the fatigue of which <lb/>
            we ought to escape, especially when satiety is superadded. <lb/>
            This is what I had to say on the subject of old age ; to which <lb/>
            may you arrive! that, after having experienced the truth <lb/>
            of those statements which you have heard from me, you may <lb/>
            be enabled to give them your approbation. <note type="footnote"> there is reason to fear it had little hold on his convictions, could inspire <lb/>
            him with such delight, what may we be expected to feel who are assured <lb/>
            of such an event by the true sayings of God ! How should we rejoice in <lb/>
            the prospect-the certainty, rather, of spending a blissful eternity with <lb/>
            those whom we loved on earth; of seeing them emerge from the ruins of <lb/>
            the tomb, and the deeper ruins of the fall, not only uninjured, but refined <lb/>
            and perfected. What delight will it afford to renew the sweet counsel we <lb/>
            have taken together, to recount the toils of combat and the labour of the <lb/>
            way, and to approach not the house but the throne of God in company, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE often observed, 0 Brutus, that your uncle <lb/>
            Cato, when he delivered his opinion in the senate, was <lb/>
            accustomed to handle important points of philosophy, in- <lb/>
            consistent with popular and forensic usage ; but that yet, <lb/>
            in speaking, he managed them so that even these seemed <lb/>
            to the people worthy of approbation ; which was so <lb/>
            much the greater excellency in him, than either in you or <lb/>
            in me, because we are more conversant in that philosophy <lb/>
            which has produced a copiousness of expression, and in <lb/>
            which those things are propounded which do not widely <lb/>
            differ from the popular opinion. But Cato, in my opinion a <lb/>
            complete Stoic, both holds those notions which certainly do <lb/>
            not approve themselves to the common people ; and belongs <lb/>
            to that sect which aims at no embellishments, and does not <lb/>
            spin out an argument. He therefore succeeds in what he <lb/>
            has purposed, by certain pithy and, as it were, stimulating <lb/>
            questions. There is, however, nothing so incredible that it <lb/>
            may not be made plausible by eloquence ; nothing so rough <lb/>
            and uncultivated that it may not, in oratory, become brilliant <lb/>
            and polished.</p>
          <p>As I have been accustomed to think thus, I have made a <lb/>
            bolder attempt than he himself did of whom I am speaking. <lb/>
            For Cato is accustomed to treat stoically of magnanimity, of <lb/>
            modesty, of death, and of all the glory of virtue, of the im- <lb/>
            mortal gods, and of patriotism, with the addition of the orna- <lb/>
            ments of eloquence. But I have, for amusement, digested <lb/>
            into common-places those topics which the Stoics scarcely <lb/>
            prove in their retirement and in their schools. Such <lb/>
            topics are termed, even by themselves, paradoxes, be- <lb/>
            cause they are remarkable, and contrary to the opinion of <lb/>
            all men. I have been desirous of trying whether they <lb/>
            might not come into publicity, that is before the forum, and <lb/>
            be so expressed as to be approved ; or whether learned <pb n="264"/>
             <note type="margin">[PAR I.</note><lb/>
            expressions were one thing, and a popular mode of address <lb/>
            another. I undertook this with the more pleasure, because <lb/>
            these very paradoxes, as they are termed, appear to me to <lb/>
            be the most Socratic, and by far the most true. Accept <lb/>
            therefore this little work, composed during these shorter <lb/>
            nights, since that work of my longer watchings appeared in <lb/>
            your name. You will have here a specimen of the manner <lb/>
            I have been accustomed to adopt when I accommodate those <lb/>
            things which in the schools are termed theses to our oratorical <lb/>
            manner of speaking. I do not, however, expect that you <lb/>
            will look upon yourself as indebted to me for this perform- <lb/>
            ance, which is not such as to he placed, like the Minerva of <lb/>
            Phidias, in a citadel, but still such as may appear to have <lb/>
            issued from the same studio.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I AM apprehensive that this position may seem to some <lb/>
            among you to have been derived from the schools of the <lb/>
            Stoics,* and not from my own sentiments. Yet I will tell <lb/>
            you my real opinion, and that too more briefly than so im- <lb/>
            portant a matter requires to be discussed. By Hercules, I <lb/>
            never was one who reckoned among good and desirable <lb/>
            things, treasures, magnificent mansions, interest, power, or <note type="footnote"> * The ethical doctrines of the Stoics have attracted most attention, as <lb/>
            exhibited in the lives of distinguished Greeks and Romans. To live <lb/>
            according to nature was the basis of their ethical system ; but by this it <lb/>
            was not meant that a man should follow his own particular nature ; he <lb/>
            must make his life conformable to the nature of the whole of things. This <lb/>
            principle is the foundation of all morality; and it follows that morality is <lb/>
            connected with philosophy. To know what is our relation to the whole <lb/>
            of things, is to know what we ought to be and to do. This fundamental <lb/>
            principle of the Stoics is indisputable, but its application is not always <lb/>
            easy, nor did they all agree in their exposition of it. Some things were <lb/>
            good, some bad, and some indifferent; the only good things were virtue, <lb/>
            wisdom, justice, temperance, and the like. The truly wise man pos- <lb/>
            sesses all knowledge ; he is perfect and sufficient in himself; he despises <lb/>
            all that subjects to its power the rest of mankind ; he feels pain, but he is <lb/>
            not conquered by it. But the morality of the Stoics, at least in the later <lb/>
            periods, though it rested on a basis apparently so sound, permitted the <lb/>
            wise man to do nearly everything that he liked. Such a system, it has <lb/>
            been well observed, might do for the imaginary wise man of the Stoics ; <lb/>
            but it was not a system whose general adoption was compatible with the <lb/>
            existence of any actual society. </note> <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin">PAR I]</note><lb/>
            those pleasures to which mankind are most chiefly addicted. <lb/>
            For I have observed, that those to whom these things <lb/>
            abounded, still desired them most: for the thirst of cupidity <lb/>
            is never filled or satiated. They are tormented not only <lb/>
            with the lust of increasing, but with the fear of losing what <lb/>
            they have. I own that I often look in vain for the good <lb/>
            sense of our ancestors, those most continent men, who <lb/>
            affixed the appellation of good to those weak, fleeting, <lb/>
            circumstances of wealth, when in truth and fact their senti- <lb/>
            ments were the very reverse.* Can any bad man enjoy a <lb/>
            good thing ? Or, is it possible for a man not to be good, <lb/>

            And yet we see all those things so distributed that <lb/>
            wicked men possess them, and that they are inauspicious <lb/>
            to the good. Now let any man indulge his raillery, if he <lb/>
            please ; but right reason will ever have more weight with <lb/>
            me than the opinion of the multitude. Nor shall I ever <lb/>
            account a man, when he has lost his stock of cattle, or <lb/>
            furniture, to have lost his good things. Nor shall I seldom <lb/>
            speak in praise of Bias, who, if I mistake not, is reckoned <lb/>
            among the seven wise men. For when the enemy took pos- <lb/>

            managed their flight as to carry off with them their effects, <lb/>

            same, “Why," answered he, " I do so, for I carry with me <lb/>
            all my possessions." He did not so much as esteem those <lb/>
            playthings of fortune, which we even term our blessings, to <lb/>
            be his own.t But some one will ask, What then is a real <lb/>
            good ? Whatever is done uprightly, honestly, and virtu- <lb/>
            ously, is truly said to be done well; and whatever is upright, <lb/>
            honest, and agreeable to virtue, that alone, as I think, is a <lb/>
            good tiling.</p>

            march; yea, and the care of it sometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory; <lb/>

            Shall I begin with Romulus ? Or, after the state was free, <lb/>
            with those who liberated it ? By what steps then did <lb/>
            Romulus ascend to heaven ? By those which these people <lb/>

            other kings, for all of them, excepting Tarquin the Proud, <lb/>
            were equally excellent. Should any one ask, What did <lb/>
            Brutus perform when he delivered his country ? Or, as <lb/>
            to those who were the participators of that design, what was <lb/>
            their aim, and the object of their pursuit? Lives there the <lb/>

            whole force of the enemy ? What power devoted the elder <lb/>

            between the times of both ? What shall I say of innumerable <lb/>

          <p>Now let the deriders of this sentiment and principle come <lb/>
            forward; let even them take their choice, whether they would <lb/>
            rather resemble the man who is rich in marble palaces, adorned <lb/>
            with ivory, and shining with gold, in statues, in pictures, in <lb/>

            readily prevailed upon to admit that those things which are <lb/>
            transferred, now hither, now thither, are not to be ranked <lb/>

            maintain, and eagerly dispute, that pleasure is the highest <lb/>
            good; a sentiment that to me seems to be that of a brute, <lb/>
            rather than that of a man.* Shall you, endowed as you are <lb/>

            according to this, pleasure and sensuality pass for terms equivalent; and <lb/>
            therefore he that takes it in this sense alters the subject of the discourse. <lb/>
            Sensuality is indeed a part, or rather one kind of pleasure, such an one as <lb/>
            it is ; for pleasure in general is the consequent apprehension of a suitable <lb/>
            object, suitably applied to a rightly disposed faculty ; and so must be con- <lb/>
            versant both about the faculties of the body and of the soul respectively; <lb/>
            as being the result of the functions belonging to both. </note><note type="footnote"> "Since God never created any faculty either in soul or body, but withal <lb/>
            prepared for it a suitable object, and that in order to its gratification ; can <lb/>
            we think that religion was designed only for a contradiction to nature ? <lb/>
            And, with the greatest and most irrational tyranny in the world, to tantalize <lb/>
            and tie men up from enjoyment, in the midst of all the opportunities of <lb/>
            enjoyment? To place men with the furious affections of hunger and <lb/>
            thirst in the very bosom of plenty, and then to tell them that the envy of <lb/>
            Providence has sealed up everything that is suitable under the character of <lb/>
            unlawful ? For certainly, first to frame appetites fit to receive pleasure, <lb/>

            a thing hugely contrary to the natural felicity of the creature, and conse- <lb/>

            excellent and more divine), so degrade and prostrate yourself <lb/>
            as to think there is no difference between yourself and any <lb/>
            quadruped ? Is there any real good that does not make him <lb/>
            who possesses it a better man ? For in proportion as every <lb/>
            man has the greatest amount of excellence, he is also in that <lb/>
            proportion most praiseworthy ; nor is there any excellence <lb/>
            on which the man who possesses it may not justly value <lb/>
            himself. But what of these qualities resides in pleasure ? <lb/>
            Does it make a man better, or more praiseworthy ? Does <lb/>
            any man extol himself in boasting or self-recommendation <lb/>
            for having enjoyed pleasures ? Now if pleasure, which is <lb/>
            defended by the advocacy of many, is not to be ranked <lb/>
            among good things, and if the greater it is the more it <lb/>

            happiness. </note><note type="footnote"> “So then actions are to be estimated by their tendency. Whatever is</note> <pb n="272"/>
             <note type="margin">[PAR III.</note><lb/>
            which the sin consists may be greater in one instance and <lb/>
            less in another, but guilt itself, in whatsoever light you be- <lb/>
            hold it, is the same. A pilot oversets a ship laden with gold <lb/>
            or one laden with straw: in value there is some difference, <lb/>
            but in the ignorance of the pilot there is none. Your illicit <lb/>
            desire has fallen upon an obscure female. The mortification <lb/>
            affects fewer persons than if it had broken out in the case of <lb/>
            some high born and noble virgin; nevertheless it has been <lb/>
            guilty, if it be guilty to overstep the mark. When you have <lb/>
            done this, a crime has been committed; nor does it matter <lb/>
            in aggravation of the fault how far you run afterwards ; <note type="footnote"> expedient, is right. It is the utility of any moral rule alone which con- <lb/>
            stitutes the obligation of it. But to all this there seems a plain objection, <lb/>
            viz. that many actions are useful, which no man in his senses will allow to <lb/>
            he right. There are occasions in which the hand of the assassin would be <lb/>
            very useful. The present possessor of some great estate employs his in- <lb/>
            fluence and fortune, to annoy, corrupt, or oppress, all about him. His <lb/>
            estate would devolve, by his death, to a successor of an opposite character. <lb/>
            It is useful, therefore, to despatch such a one as soon as possible out of the <lb/>
            way; as the neighbourhood will exchange thereby a pernicious tyrant for a <lb/>
            wise and generous benefactor. It might be useful to rob a miser, and give <lb/>
            the money to the poor ; as the money, no doubt, would produce more <lb/>
            happiness by being laid out in food and clothing for half a dozen distressed <lb/>
            families, than by continuing locked up in a miser's chest. It may be useful <lb/>
            to get possession of a place, a piece of preferment, or of a seat in Parlia- <lb/>
            ment, by bribery or false swearing : as by means of them we may serve <lb/>
            the public more effectually than in our private station. What then shall <lb/>
            we say ? Must we admit these actions to be right, which would be to <lb/>
            justify assassination, plunder, and perjury ; or must we give up our princi- <lb/>
            ple, that the criterion of right is utility ? It is not necessary to do either. <lb/>
            The true answer is this ; that these actions, after all, are not useful, and <lb/>
            for that reason, and that alone, are not right. To see this point perfectly, <lb/>
            it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions arc twofold, par- <lb/>
            ticular and general. The particular bad consequence of an action, is the <lb/>
            mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions. The <lb/>
            general bad consequence is, the violation of some necessary or useful <lb/>
            general rule. Thus, the particular bad consequence of the assassination <lb/>
            above described, is the fright and pain which the deceased underwent ; the <lb/>
            loss he suffered of life, which is as valuable to a bad man as to a good one, <lb/>
            or more so ; the prejudice and affliction, of which his death was the occa- <lb/>
            sion, to his family, friends, and dependants. The general bad consequence <lb/>
            is the violation of this necessary general rule, that no man be put to death <lb/>
            for his crimes but by public authority. Although, therefore, such an action <lb/>
            have no particular bad consequences, or greater particular good conse- <lb/>
            quences, yet it is not useful, by reason of the general consequence, which <lb/>
            is of more importance, and which is evil.”—Moral and Political Philo- <lb/>

            certainly it is not lawful for any one to commit sin, and that <lb/>
            which is unlawful is limited by this sole condition, that it <lb/>
            is shown to be wrong. If this guilt can neither be made <lb/>
            greater nor less (because, if the thing was unlawful, therein <lb/>
            sin was committed), then the vicious acts which spring out <lb/>
            of that which is ever one and the same must necessarily be <lb/>
            equal. Now if virtues are equal amongst themselves, it <lb/>
            must necessarily follow that vices are so likewise; and it is <lb/>
            most easy to be perceived that a man cannot be better than <lb/>
            good, more temperate than temperate, braver than brave, <lb/>
            nor wiser than wise. Will any man call a person honest, <lb/>
            who, having a deposit of ten pounds of gold made to him <lb/>
            without any witness, so that he might take advantage of it <lb/>
            with impunity, shall restore it, and yet should not do the <lb/>
            same in the case of ten thousand pounds ?* Can a man be <lb/>
            accounted temperate who checks one inordinate passion and <lb/>
            gives a loose to another ? Virtue is uniform, conformable to <lb/>
            reason, and of unvarying consistency; nothing can be added <lb/>
            to it that can make it more than virtue; nothing can be <lb/>
            taken from it, and the name of virtue be left. If good offices <lb/>
            are done with an upright intention, nothing can be more <lb/>
            upright than upright is; and therefore it is impossible that <lb/>
            any thing should be better than what is good. It there- <lb/>
            fore follows that all vices are equal; for the obliquities of <lb/>
            the mind are properly termed vices. Now we may infer, <lb/>
            that as all virtues are equal, therefore all good actions, when <lb/>
            they spring from virtues, ought to be equal likewise; and <lb/>
            therefore it necessarily follows, that evil actions, springing <lb/>
            from vices, should be also equal.</p>
          <p>You borrow, says one, these views from philosophers. I <lb/>
            was afraid you would have told me that I borrowed it from <lb/>
            panders. But Socrates reasoned in the manner you do.- <lb/>
            By Hercules, you say well; for it is recorded that he was a <lb/>
            learned and a wise person. Meanwhile as we are contending, <lb/>
            not with blows, but with words, I ask you whether good <lb/>
            men should inquire what was the opinion of porters and <lb/>
            labourers, or that of the wisest of mankind ? Especially too <note type="footnote"> * The reader will probably be reminded by this passage of the words of <lb/>
            the Great Teacher: " He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful <lb/>

            as no truer sentiment than this can be found, nor one more <lb/>
            conducive to the interests of human life. For what influence <lb/>
            is there which can more deter men from the commission of <lb/>
            every kind of evil, than if they become sensible that there are <lb/>
            no degrees in sin ? That the crime is the same, whether they <lb/>
            offer violence to private persons or to magistrates. That in <lb/>
            whatever families they have gratified their illicit desire, the <lb/>
            turpitude of their lust is the same.</p>
          <p>But some one will say, what then ? does it make no differ- <lb/>
            ence, whether a man murders his father or his slave ? If <lb/>
            you instance these acts abstractedly, it is difficult to decide <lb/>
            of what quality they are. If to deprive a parent of life is in <lb/>
            itself a most heinous crime, the Saguntines were then parri- <lb/>
            cides, because they chose that their parents should die as <lb/>
            freemen rather than live as slaves. Thus a case may happen <lb/>
            in which there may be no guilt in depriving a parent of life, <lb/>
            and very often we cannot without guilt put a slave to death. <lb/>
            The circumstances therefore attending this case, and not the <lb/>
            nature of the thing, occasion the distinction: these circum- <lb/>
            stances as they lean to either case, that case becomes the <lb/>
            more favourable; but if they appertain alike to both, the <lb/>
            acts are then equal. There is this difference—that in killing <lb/>
            a slave, if wrong is done, it is a single Sill that is committed; <lb/>
            but many are involved in taking the life of a father. The <lb/>
            object of violence is the man who begat you, the man who <lb/>
            fed you, the man who brought you up, the man who gave <lb/>
            your position in your home, your family, and the state. This <lb/>
            offence is greater by reason of the number of sins (involved <lb/>
            in it), and is deserving of a proportionately greater punish- <lb/>
            ment. But in life we are not to consider what should be the <lb/>
            punishment of each offence, but what is the rule of right to each <lb/>
            individual. We are to consider everything that is not be- <lb/>
            coming as wicked, and everything which is unlawful as <lb/>
            heinous. What! even in the most trifling matters ? To be <lb/>
            sure; for if we are unable to regulate the course of events, <lb/>
            yet we may place a bound to our passions. If a player <lb/>
            dances ever so little out of time, if a verse is pronounced by <lb/>
            him longer or shorter by a single syllable than it ought to <lb/>
            be, he is hooted and hissed off the stage. And shall you, who <lb/>
            ought to be better regulated than any gesture, and more regu- <lb/>
            lar than any verse shall you be found faulty even in a syllable <pb n="275"/>

            shall I approve may fellow citizen's life while he is counting <lb/>
            his misdeeds with his fingers ? If some of these are trifling,* <lb/>
            how can it be regarded as more venial when whatever wrong <lb/>
            is committed, is committed to the violation of reason and <lb/>
            order ? Now, if reason and order are violated, nothing can <lb/>
            be added by which the offence can seem to be aggravated.</p>

            a community? Surely, not every assembly of thieves and <lb/>
            ruffians? Is it then the entire rabble of outlaws and <lb/>
            robbers assembled in one place? No; you will doubtless <lb/>

            magistrates having been driven away by the sword, there was <lb/>
            not even the name of a senate in the state. Could that gang <lb/>

            But in accommodating the plans of conduct to the train of events, the differ- <lb/>

            subservient to the man. Some men seem to have been taken along by a <lb/>
            succession of events, and as it were handed forward in helpless passiveness <lb/>
            from one to another ; having no determined principle in their own charac- <lb/>
            ters by which they could constrain those events to serve a design formed <lb/>
            antecedently to them, or apparently in defiance of them. The events <lb/>
            seized them as a neutral material, not they the events. Others, advancing <lb/>

            which they may in their first apparent tendency threaten to frustrate." <lb/>
            Shakspeare develops a similar idea in the following passage :— <lb/>

            " It cannot be denied but outward accidents conduce much to fortune ; <lb/>
            favour, opportunity, death of others, occasion fitting virtue, but chiefly, the <lb/>
            mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands: ‘ Faber quisque fortunes suae,' <lb/>
            saith the poet, and the most frequent of external causes is, that the folly of <lb/>
            one man is the fortune of another ; for no man prospers so suddenly as by <lb/>
            others' errors. ‘ Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco.' Overt <lb/>
            and apparent virtues bring forth praise ; but there be secret and hidden <lb/>
            virtues that bring forth fortune ; certain deliveries of a man's self, which <lb/>
            have no name. The Spanish name, ' disemboltura,' partly expresseth <lb/>
            these when there be not stonds nor restiveness in a man's nature, but that <lb/>
            the wheels of his mind keep way with the wheels of his fortune ; for so Livy <lb/>
            (after he had described Cato Major in these words, ‘ In illo viro, tantum <lb/>
            robur corporis et animi fuit, ut quocunque loco natus esset, fortunam sibi <lb/>
            facturus videretur,') falleth upon chat that he had, ‘versatile ingenium ;' <lb/>
            therefore, if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall see fortune ; for <lb/>
            though she be blind, yet she is not invisible. The way of fortune is like <lb/>
            the milky way in the sky ; which is a meeting, or a knot, of a number of <lb/>
            small stars, not seen asunder, but giving light together ; so are there a <lb/>
            number of little and scarce discerned virtues, or rather faculties and customs, <lb/>
            that make men fortunate." </note><note type="footnote"> * The Apostle Paul lays down the same principle:—" Know ye not <lb/>

            gardeners, yet still they are slaves; in like manner, they who <lb/>

            are equally fools with the others. " Nay, but (say they) we <lb/>

            superior to your fellow slaves. But as in a household, they <lb/>

            unreasonable wishes and desires; but be does that in vain, if he has those <lb/>
            of another to gratify. But in all concessions of this kind, a man should <lb/>
            consider whether the present he makes flows from his own love, or the im- <lb/>
            portunity of his beloved. If from the latter, he is her slave ; if from the <lb/>

            Why was courage given to a man, if his wife's fears are to frustrate it ? When <lb/>

            his tank his mullets or his carp, then handling them, and <lb/>
            boasting of the abundance of his lampreys, would not the <lb/>
            old Roman think that such a man was so very a slave, that he <lb/>
            was not even fit for a very high employment in a household? <lb/>
            Is the slavery of those men doubtful, who from their greedi- <lb/>

            tented to live liberally, who has no desire, no hankering <lb/>
            after, no wish for more. It is your own mind, and not the <lb/>
            talk of others, nor your possessions, that must pronounce <lb/>
            you to be rich ; for it ought to think that nothing is want- <lb/>
            in- to it, and care for nothing beyond. Is it satiated, or <lb/>
            even contented with your money ? I admit that you are <lb/>
            rich ; but if for the greed of money you think no source of <lb/>
            profit disgraceful (though your order cannot make any <lb/>
            honest profits), if you every day are cheating, deceiving, <lb/>
            craving, jobbing, poaching, and pilfering ; if you rob the <lb/>
            allies and plunder the treasury ; if you are for ever longing <lb/>
            for the bequests of friends, or not even waiting for them, <lb/>
            but forging them yourself, are such practices the indications <lb/>
            of a rich or a needy man ? It is the mind, and not the <lb/>
            coffers of a man, that is to be accounted rich. For though <lb/>
            the latter be full, when I see yourself empty, I shall not <lb/>
            think you rich ; because men measure the amount of riches <lb/>
            by that which is sufficient for each individual. Has a man <lb/>
            a daughter ? then he has need of money. But he has two, <lb/>
            then he ought to have a greater fortune ; he has more, then <lb/>
            he ought to have more fortune still; and if, as we are told <lb/>
            of Danaus, he has fifty daughters, so many fortunes require <lb/>
            a great estate. For, as I said before, the degree of wealth <lb/>
            is dependent on how much each individual has need of. He <lb/>
            therefore who has not a great many daughters, but innu- <lb/>
            merable passions, which are enough to consume a very great <lb/>
            estate in a very short time, how can I call such a man rich, <lb/>
            when he himself is conscious that he is poor ? Many have <lb/>
            heard you say, that no man is rich who cannot with his in- <lb/>
            come maintain an army ; a thing which the people of Rome <lb/>
            some time ago, with their so great revenues, could scarcely <lb/>
            do. Therefore, according to your maxim, you never can be <lb/>
            rich, until so much is brought in to you from your estates, <lb/>
            that out of it you can maintain six legions, and large auxi- <lb/>
            liaries of horse and foot.* You therefore, in fact, confess <note type="footnote"> * " It will be found," says Dr. Johnson, " on a nearer view, that those <lb/>
            who extol the happiness of poverty, do not mean the same state with those <lb/>

            of magnificence ; and, being accustomed to contemplate the downfall of <lb/>
            empires, or to contrive forms of lamentations for monarchs in distress, rank <lb/>
            all the classes of mankind in a state of poverty who make no approaches <lb/>

            what you desire ; you therefore have never concealed your <lb/>
            poverty, your neediness, and your beggary.</p>
          <p>For as we see that they who make an honest livelihood by <lb/>
            commerce, by industry, by farming the public revenue, have <lb/>
            occasion for their earnings; so, whoever sees at your house <lb/>
            the crowds of accusers and judges together; whoever sees <lb/>
            rich and guilty criminals plotting the corruption of trials <lb/>
            with you as their adviser, and your bargainings for pay for <lb/>
            the distribution of patronage, your pecuniary interventions <lb/>
            in the contests of candidates, your" despatching your freed- <lb/>
            men to fleece and plunder the provinces; whoever calls to <lb/>
            mind your dispossessing your neighbours, your depopulating <lb/>
            the country by your oppressions, your confederacies with <lb/>
            slaves, with freedmen, and with clients; the vacating of es- <lb/>
            tates': the proscriptions of the wealthy; the corporations mas- <lb/>
            sacred, and the harvest of the times of Sylla; the wills you <lb/>
            have forged, and the many men you have made away with; <lb/>
            in short, that all things were venal with you in your levies, <lb/>
            your decrees, your own votes, and the votes of others; the <lb/>
            forum, your house, your speaking, and your silence; who <lb/>
            must not think that such a man confesses he has occasion for <lb/>
            all he has acquired ? But who can truly designate him as <lb/>
            a rich man who needs all his earnings ? For the advantage <lb/>
            of riches consists in plenty, and this plenty declares the <lb/>
            overflow and abundance of the means of life, which, as you <lb/>
            can never attain, you can never be rich. I shall say nothing <lb/>
            of myself, because as you (and that with reason) despise my <lb/>
            fortune-for it is in the opinion of the generality middling, <lb/>
            in yours next to nothing, and in mine sufficient- I shall <lb/>
            speak to the subject. Now if facts are to be weighed and <lb/>
            estimated by us, whether are we more to esteem-the money <lb/>
            of Pyrrhus which he sent to Fabricius, or the continency of <lb/>
            Fabricius for refusing that money?-the gold of the Sam- <lb/>
            nites, or the answer of Manius Curius ?-the inheritance of <lb/>
            Lucius Paulus, or the generosity of Africanus, who gave <lb/>
            to his brother Quintus his own part of that Inheritance ? <lb/>
            Surely the latter evidences of consummate virtue are more <lb/>
            to be esteemed than the former, which are the evidences of <note type="footnote"> command the wealth of nations, and to have fleets and armies in pay."- <lb/>

            wealth. If, therefore, we are to rate every man rich only in <lb/>
            proportion to the valuable things he possesses, who can <lb/>
            doubt that riches consist in virtue, since no possession, no <lb/>
            amount of gold and silver, is more to be valued than virtue ?</p>
          <p>Immortal gods ! Men are not aware how great a revenue <lb/>
            is parsimony; for I now proceed to speak of extravagant <lb/>
            men, I take my leave of the money-hunter. The revenue <lb/>
            one man receives from his estate is six hundred sestertia; <lb/>
            I receive one hundred from mine. To that man who has <lb/>
            gilded roofs and marble pavements in his villas, and who <lb/>
            unboundedly covets statues, pictures, vestments, and fur- <lb/>
            niture, his income is insufficient, not only for his expenditure, <lb/>
            but even for the payment of his interest; while there will <lb/>
            be some surplus even from my slender income, through <lb/>
            cutting off the expenses of voluptuousness. Which then is <lb/>
            the richer, he who has a deficit, or he who has a surplus ? <lb/>
            -he who is in need, or he who abounds ?-the man whose <lb/>
            estate, the greater it is, requires the more to sustain it, 01 <lb/>
            whose estate maintains itself by its own resources?*</p>
          <p>But why do I talk of myself, who through the contagion <lb/>
            of fashion and of the times, am perhaps a little infected with <lb/>
            the fault of the age ? In the memory of our fathers, Manius <lb/>
            Manilius (not to mention continually the Curii and the Lus- <lb/>
            cinii) at length became poor; for he had only a little house <note type="footnote"> it " Riches are of no value in themselves, their use is discovered only in <lb/>
            that which they procure. They are not coveted unless by narrow under- <lb/>
            standings, which confound the means with the end, but for the sake of <lb/>
            power, influence, and esteem ; or by some of less elevated and refined sen- <lb/>
            timents as necessary to sensual enjoyment. </note><note type="footnote"> " The pleasures of luxury many have, without uncommon virtue, been <lb/>
            able to despise, even when affluence and idleness have concurred to tempt <lb/>
            them ; and therefore he who feels nothing from indigence, but the want of <lb/>
            gratifications which he could not in any other condition make consistent <lb/>
            with innocence, has given no proof of eminent patience. Esteem and in- <lb/>
            fluence every man desires, but they are equally pleasing and equally valu- <lb/>
            able, by whatever means they are obtained ; and whoever has found the <lb/>
            art of securing them without the help of money ought in reality to be <lb/>
            accounted rich, since he has all that riches can purchase toa wise man. <lb/>
            Cincinnatus, though he lived upon a few acres cultivated by his own hand, <lb/>
            was sufficiently removed from all the evils generally comprehended under <lb/>
            the name of poverty, when his reputation was such that the voice of his <lb/>
            country called him from his farm to take absolute command into his hand ; <lb/>
            nor was Diogenes much mortified by his residence in a tub, where he was <lb/>
            honoured with the visit of Alexander the Great."—The Rambler, No. 202. </note> <pb n="287"/>

            at Carani and a farm near Labicum. Now are we, because <lb/>
            we have greater possessions, richer men ? I wish we were. <lb/>
            But the amount of wealth is not defined by the valuation of <lb/>
            the census, but by habit and mode of life; not to be greedy <lb/>
            is wealth; not to be extravagant is revenue. Above all <lb/>
            things, to be content with what we possess is the greatest <lb/>
            and most secure of riches. If therefore they who are the <lb/>
            most skilful valuers of property highly estimate fields and <lb/>
            certain sites, because such estates are the least liable to <lb/>
            injury, how much more valuable is virtue, which never <lb/>
            can be wrested, never can be filched from us, which <lb/>
            cannot be lost by fire or by shipwreck, and which is not <lb/>
            alienated by the convulsions of tempest or of time, with <lb/>
            which those who are endowed alone are rich, for they alone <lb/>
            possess resources which are profitable and eternal; and they <lb/>
            are the only men who, being contented with what they <lb/>
            possess, think it sufficient, which is the criterion of riches: <lb/>
            they hanker after nothing, they are in need of nothing, they <lb/>
            feel the want of nothing, and they require nothing. As to <lb/>
            the unsatiable and avaricious part of mankind, as they have <lb/>
            possessions liable to uncertainty, and at the mercy of chance, <lb/>
            they who are for ever thirsting after more, and of whom <lb/>
            there never was a man for whom what he had sufficed; they <lb/>
            are so far from being wealthy and rich, that they are to be <lb/>
            regarded as necessitous and beggared. <pb n="288"/>

          <p>WHEN I had arrived in Africa as military tribune of the <lb/>
            fourth legion, as you know, under the consul, Lucius Man- <lb/>
            lius, nothing was more delightful to me than having an in- <lb/>
            terview with Massinissa, a prince who, for good reasons, was <lb/>
            most friendly to our family. When I arrived, the old mail <lb/>
            shed tears as he embraced me. Soon after he raised his <lb/>
            eyes up to heaven and said, I thank thee, most glorious sun, <lb/>
            and ye the other inhabitants of heaven, that before I depart <lb/>
            from this life, I see in my kingdom and under this roof, <lb/>
            Publius Cornelius Scipio, by whose very name I am re- <lb/>
            freshed, for never does the memory of that greatest, that <lb/>
            most invincible of men, vanish from my mind. After this I <lb/>
            informed myself from him about his kingdom, and he from <lb/>
            me about our government; and that day was consumed in <lb/>
            much conversation on both sides.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, having been entertained with royal magnifi- <lb/>
            cence, we prolonged our conversation to a late hour of the <lb/>
            night; while the old man talked of nothing but of Africanus, <lb/>
            and remembered not only all his actions, but all his sayings. <lb/>
            Then, when we departed to bed, owing to my journey and <lb/>
            my sitting up to a late hour, a sleep sounder than ordinary <lb/>
            came over me. In this (I suppose from the subject on <lb/>
            which we had been talking, for it commonly happens that <lb/>
            our thoughts and conversations beget something analogous <lb/>
            in our sleep, just as Ennius writes about Homer, of whom <lb/>
            assuredly, he was accustomed most frequently to think and <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            talk when awake),* Africanus presented himself to me in <lb/>
            that form which was more known from his statue than from <lb/>
            his own person.</p>
          <p>No sooner did I know him than I shuddered. " Draw <lb/>
            near (said he), with confidence, lay aside your dread, and <lb/>

            which by me was forced to submit to the people of Rome, <lb/>
            but is now renewing its former wars, and cannot remain at <lb/>
            peace, (he spoke these words pointing to Carthage from ar. <lb/>

            They are old ideas revived, either in an entire state, or heterogeneously <lb/>
            mingled together. I doubt if it be possible for a person to have in a drearr <lb/>
            any idea, whose elements did not in some form strike him at a previous <lb/>
            period. If these break loose from their connecting chain, and become <lb/>
            jumbled together incoherently, as is often the case, they give rise to absurd <lb/>
            combinations ; but the elements still subsist, and only manifest themselves <lb/>
            in a new and unconnected shape. Dreams generally arise without any <lb/>
            assignable cause, but sometimes we can very readily discover their origin. <lb/>
            Whatever has much interested us during the day is apt to resolve itself <lb/>
            into a dream, and this will generally be pleasurable or the reverse, accord- <lb/>
            in-, to the nature of the exciting cause. If, for instance, our reading or <lb/>
            conversation be of horrible subjects, such as spectres, murders, or confla- <lb/>
            grations, they will appear before us magnified and heightened in our <lb/>
            dreams. Or if we have been previously sailing upon a rough sea, we are <lb/>
            apt to suppose ourselves undergoing the perils of shipwreck. Pleasurable <lb/>
            sensations during the day are also apt to assume a still more pleasurable <lb/>
            aspect in dreams. In like manner, if we have a longing for anything, we <lb/>
            are apt to suppose that we possess it. Even objects altogether unattain- <lb/>
            able are placed within our reach : we achieve impossibilities, and triumph <lb/>

            those of a miracle, in which the ordinary laws of nature are triumphed <lb/>
            over, can such an event ever take place. The sacred writings testify that <lb/>
            miracles were common in former times, but I believe no man of sane mind <lb/>
            will contend that they ever occur in the present state of the world. In <lb/>
            judging of things as now constituted, we must discard supernatural influence <lb/>
            altogether, and estimate events according to the general laws which the <lb/>
            great Ruler of nature has appointed for the guidance of the universe. If <lb/>
            in the I recent day it were possible to conceive a suspension of these laws, <lb/>
            it must, as in former ages, be in reference to some great event and to serve <lb/>
            s"me mi hty purpose connected with the general interests of the human <lb/>
            race ; but if faith is to be placed in modern miracles, we must suppose <lb/>
            that God suspended the above laws for the most trivial and useless of pur- <lb/>
            poses. At the same time there can be no doubt that many circumstances <lb/>
            occurring in our dreams have been actually verified ; but this must be <lb/>
            regarded as altogether the effect of chance ; and for one dream which turn <lb/>
            out to he true, it least a thousand are false. In fact, it is only when they <lb/>
            are of the former description, that we take any notice of them, the latter <lb/>

            having existed before its union with the body. This was attempting to sup- <lb/>

            that which, placed upon the extremity of the heavens, but <lb/>

            " How long will your attention be fixed upon the earth ? <lb/>
            Do you not see into what temples you have entered ? All <lb/>
            things are connected by nine circles, or rather spheres ; one <lb/>
            of which (which is the outermost) is heaven, and compre- <lb/>
            hends all the rest, (inhabited by) that all-powerful God, <lb/>
            who bounds and controls the others ; and in this sphere <lb/>
            reside the original principles of those endless revolutions <lb/>
            which the planets perform. Within this are contained seven <lb/>
            other spheres, that turn round backwards, that is, in a con- <lb/>
            trary direction to that of the heaven. Of these, that planet <lb/>
            which on earth you call Saturn, occupies one sphere. That <lb/>

            friendly and salutary to mankind. Next the lucid one, ter- <lb/>

            centre of the whole system, is immovable and below all the <lb/>
            rest ; and all bodies, by their natural gravitation, tend <lb/>
            towards it."</p>
          <p>Which, as I was gazing at in amazement I said, as I re- <lb/>
            covered myself, from whence proceed these sounds so <lb/>
            strong, and yet so sweet, that fill my ears? " The melody <lb/>
            (replies he) which you hear, and which, though composed <lb/>
            in unequal time, is nevertheless divided into regular har- <lb/>
            mony, is effected by the impulse and motion of the spheres <lb/>
            themselves, which, by a happy temper of sharp and grave <lb/>
            notes, regularly produces various harmonic effects. Now it <lb/>
            is impossible that such prodigious movements should pass in <lb/>
            silence; and nature teaches, that the sounds which the <lb/>
            spheres at one extremity utter must be sharp, and those on <lb/>
            the other extremity must be grave ; on which account, that <lb/>
            highest revolution of the star-studded heaven, whose motion <lb/>
            is more rapid, is carried on with a sharp and quick sound ; <lb/>
            whereas this of the moon, which is situated the lowest, and <lb/>
            at the other extremity, moves with the gravest sound. For <lb/>
            the earth, the ninth sphere, remaining motionless, abides in- <lb/>
            variably in the innermost position, occupying the centra. <lb/>
            spot in the universe.</p>
          <p>" Now these eight directions, two of which* have the same <lb/>
            powers, effect seven sounds, differing in their modulations, <lb/>
            which number is the connecting principle of almost all <lb/>
            things. Some learned men, by imitating this harmony with <lb/>
            strings and vocal melodies, have opened a way for their re- <lb/>
            turn to this place ; as all others have done, who, endued <lb/>
            with pre-eminent qualities, have cultivated in their mortal <lb/>
            life the pursuits of heaven.</p>
          <p>"The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have become <lb/>

            pages of Shakspeare appears to have been suggested by this part of the <lb/>
            writings of Cicero. It is as follows :— <lb/>
            " Sit, Jessica, see how the floor of heaven <lb/>

            down from very high mountains to the parts which are <lb/>
            called Catadupa, are destitute of the sense of hearing, by <lb/>
            reason of the greatness of the noise. Now this sound, which <lb/>
            is effected by the rapid rotation of the whole system of <lb/>
            nature, is so powerful, that human hearing cannot compre- <lb/>
            hend it, just as you cannot look directly upon the sun, be- <lb/>
            cause your sight and sense are overcome by his beams."</p>
          <p>Though admiring these scenes, yet I still continued direct- <lb/>
            in.- my eyes in the same direction towards the earth. On <lb/>
            this Africanus said, " I perceive that even now you are con <lb/>

            opposite to you, from whom you assuredly can expect no <lb/>
            glory.</p>
          <p>You are now to observe, that the same earth is encircled <lb/>
            and encompassed as it were by certain zones, of which the <lb/>
            two that are most distant from one another, and lie as it <lb/>
            were towards the vortexes of the heavens in both directions, <lb/>
            are rigid as you see with frost, while the middle and the <lb/>
            largest zone is burnt up with the heat of the sun. Two of <lb/>
            these are habitable ; of which the southern, whose inhabit- <lb/>
            ants imprint their footsteps in an opposite direction to you, <lb/>
            have no relation to your race. As to this other, lying to- <lb/>
            wards the north, which you inhabit, observe what a small <lb/>
            portion of it falls to your share: for all that part of the <lb/>
            earth which is inhabited by you, which narrows towards the <lb/>
            south and north,* but widens from east to west, is no other <lb/>
            than a little island surrounded by that sea, which on earth <lb/>
            you call the Atlantic, sometimes the great sea, and some- <lb/>
            times the ocean ; and yet with so grand a name, you see how <lb/>
            diminutive it is! Now do you think it possible for your re- <lb/>
            nown, or that of any one of ns, to move from those cultivated- <lb/>
            and inhabited spots of ground, and pass beyond that Cau- <lb/>

            of modern minds are content to range in a narrower compass; a single nation <lb/>
            and a few years, have generally sufficient amplitude to fill our imaginations. <lb/>
            A little consideration will indeed teach us, that fame has other limits than <lb/>
            mountains and oceans, and that he who places happiness in the frequent <lb/>
            repetition of his name, may spend his life in propagating it, without any <lb/>

            are born after you, and not by those who were born before <lb/>
            you, who certainly were as numerous and more virtuous; <lb/>
            especially, as amongst the very men who are thus to <lb/>
            celebrate our renown, not a single one can preserve the <lb/>
            recollections of a single year ? For mankind ordinarily <lb/>
            measure their year by the revolution of the sun, that is of a <lb/>
            single heavenly body. But when all the planets shall return <lb/>
            to the same position which they once had, and bring back <lb/>
            after a long rotation the same aspect of the entire heavens, <lb/>
            then the year may be said to be truly completed; in which I <lb/>
            do not venture to say how many ages of mankind will be <lb/>
            contained. For, as of old, when the spirit of Romulus <note type="footnote">learning in that whereunto man's nature doth most aspire, which is immor- <lb/>
            tality or continuance. For to this tendeth generation, and raising of houses <lb/>
            and families ; to this buildings, foundations, and monuments ; to this <lb/>
            tendeth the desire of memory, fame and celebration, and in effect the <lb/>
            strength of all other human desires. We see, then, how far the monuments <lb/>
            of wit and learning are more durable than the monuments of power, or of <lb/>
            the hands. For have not the verses of Homer continued twenty-five hun- <lb/>
            dred years or more, without the loss of a syllable or letter, during which <lb/>
            time infinite palaces, temples, castles, cities, have been decayed and demo- <lb/>
            lished ? It is not possible to have the true pictures or statues of Cyrus, <lb/>
            Alexander, Cæsar, no, nor of the kings or great personages of much later <lb/>
            years ; for the originals cannot last, and the copies cannot but lose of the <lb/>
            life and truth. But the images of men's wits and knowledge remain in <lb/>
            books exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual renova- <lb/>
            tion. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate <lb/>
            still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing <lb/>
            infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages ; so that if the invention <lb/>
            of the ship was thought so noble, which carrieth riches and commodities <lb/>
            from place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in participa- <lb/>
            tion of their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified, which, as <lb/>
            ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant to par- <lb/>
            ticipate of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the one of the other ? <lb/>
            Nay, further, we see some of the philosophers, which were least divine and <lb/>
            most immersed in the senses, and denied generally the immortality of the <lb/>
            soul, yet came to this point, that whatsoever motions the spirit of man <lb/>
            could act and perform without the organs of the body, they thought might <lb/>
            remain after death, which were only those of the understanding, and not <lb/>
            of the affections: so immortal and incorruptible a thing did knowledge <lb/>
            seem unto them to be. But we that know by divine revelation, that not <lb/>
            only the understanding but the affections purified, not only the spirit but <lb/>
            the body changed, shall be advanced to immortality, do disclaim these <lb/>
            rudiments of the senses."—Lord Bacon's Advancement of Learning <lb/>

            back to the same starting-point, shall again disappear, then <lb/>
            you are to reckon the year to be complete. But be assured <lb/>
            that the twentieth part of such a year is not yet elapsed.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, you hope to return to this place, towards <lb/>
            which all the aspirations of great and good men are tending, <lb/>
            what must be the value of that human fame that endures for <lb/>
            but a little part of a single year ?* If, then, you would fain <lb/>
            direct your regards on high, and aspire to this mansion and <lb/>
            eternal abode, you neither will devote yourself to the <lb/>
            rumours of the vulgar, nor will you rest your hopes and <lb/>
            your interest on human rewards. Virtue herself ought to <lb/>
            attract you by her own charms to true glory ; what others <lb/>
            may talk of you, for talk they will, let themselves consider. <lb/>
            But all such talk is confined to the narrow limits of those <lb/>
            regions which you see. None respecting any man was ever- <lb/>

          <p>"Do so strive," replied he, ,; and do not consider yourself, <lb/>
            but your body, to be mortal. For you are not the being <lb/>
            which this corporeal figure evinces; but the mind of every <lb/>
            man is the man, and not that form which may be delineated <note type="footnote"> incide as nearly as possible with Scripture in the Book of Ecclesiastes, <lb/>
            chap. ii. ver. 14—22. " The wise man's eyes are in his head ; but the <lb/>
            fool walketh in darkness. And I myself perceived also that one event hap- <lb/>
            peneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, <lb/>
            so it happeneth even to me ; and why was I then more wise ? Then I said <lb/>
            in my heart, that this also is vanity. For there is no remembrance of the <lb/>
            wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is, in the days <lb/>
            to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man ? As the fool. <lb/>
            Therefore, I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is <lb/>
            grievous unto me ; for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Yea, I hated <lb/>
            all my labour which I had taken under the sun ; because I should leave it <lb/>
            unto the man that shall be after me. And who knoweth whether he shall <lb/>
            he a wise man or a fool ? Yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein <lb/>
            I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. <lb/>
            This is also vanity. Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair <lb/>
            of all the labour which I took under the sun. For there is a man whose <lb/>
            labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that bath <lb/>
            not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity <lb/>
            and a great evil. For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation <lb/>
            of his heart, wherein he bath laboured under the sun ? " </note><note type="footnote"> * The principle here enunciated by Cicero is thus expanded by Bishop <lb/>
            Butler into an argument for the sou"s immortality :— </note><note type="footnote"> " From our being so nearly related to and interested in certain systems <lb/>
            of matter, suppose our flesh and bo.ies, and afterwards ceasing to be at all <lb/>
            related to them, the living agents, ourselves, remaining all this while un- <lb/>
            destroyed, notwithstanding such alienation; and consequently these systems <lb/>
            of matter not being ourselves; it follows further, that we have no ground to <lb/>
            conclude any other supposed interval system of matter to be the living <lb/>
            agents ourselves ; because we can have no ground to conclude this, but <lb/>
            so form our relation to and interest in such other system of matter at death, <lb/>
            to be the destruction o' the living agents. We have already several times <lb/>

            tain common established laws of nature, yet we remain the same living <lb/>

            with a finger. Know therefore* that you are a divine person. <lb/>
            Since it is divinity! that has consciousness, sensation, memory, <lb/>
            and foresight ;-that governs, regulates, and moves that body <lb/>
            over which it has been appointed, just as the Supreme Deity <lb/>
            rules this world; and in like manner, as an eternal God <lb/>
            guides this world, which in some respect is perishable, so an <lb/>
            eternal spirit animates your frail body.</p>
          <p>For that which is ever movingt is eternal; now that which <lb/>
            communicates to another object a motion which it received <lb/>
            elsewhere, must necessarily cease to live as soon as its motion <lb/>
            is at an end. Thus the being which is self-motive is the <lb/>
            only being that is eternal, because it never is abandoned by <note type="footnote"> more at once, does not prove anything to the contrary. We have passed <lb/>
            undestroyed through those many and great revolutions of matter so pecu- <lb/>
            ilarly appropriated to us ourselves ; why should we imagine death will be so <lb/>
            fatal to us ? Nor can it be objected, that what is thus alienated or lost is <lb/>
            no part of our original solid body, but only adventitious matter; because we <lb/>
            may lose entire limbs, which must have contained many solid parts and <lb/>
            vessels of the original body ; or if this be not admitted, we have no proof <lb/>
            that any of these solid parts are dissolved or alienated by death. Though, by <lb/>
            the way, we are very nearly related to that extraneous or adventitious matter <lb/>
            whilst it continuesunited to, and distending the several parts of, our solid body. <lb/>
            But after all the relation a person bears to those parts of his body to which he <lb/>
            is the most nearly related, what does it appear to amount to but this, that <lb/>
            the living agent and those parts of the body mutually affect each other ? <lb/>
            And the same thing, the same thing in kind though not in degree, may be <lb/>
            said of all foreign matter which gives us ideas, and which we have any <lb/>
            power over. From these observations the whole ground of the imagination <lb/>
            is removed, that the dissolution of any matter is the destruction of a living <lb/>
            agent, from the interest he once had in such matter. </note><note type="footnote"> * It was the common opinion of all the ancient philosophers who fol- <lb/>

            and immortality of the soul is difficult to determine. For we are not to <lb/>

            proceed from a beginning; therefore a beginning can rise <lb/>
            from no other cause, for if it proceeded from another cause it <lb/>
            would not be aboriginal, which, if it have no commencement, <lb/>
            certainly never has an end; for the primaeval principle, if <lb/>
            extinct, can neither be re-produced from any other source nor <lb/>
            produce any thing else from itself, because it is necessary <lb/>
            that all things should spring from some original source. The <lb/>
            principle of motion, therefore, can only exist in a self-motive <lb/>
            being, and it is impossible that such a being should be born <lb/>
            or that it should die, otherwise all heaven must go to wreck, <lb/>
            and the whole system of nature must stop; nor can it come <lb/>
            under any other force, should it be removed from its original <lb/>
            impulsion.*</p>
          <p>Since therefore it is plain that whatever is self-motive <lb/>
            must be eternal, who can deny that this natural property is <lb/>
            bestowed upon our minds? t For every thing that is moved <note type="footnote"> * It only remains then to bring this idea of the material word into con- <lb/>
            nexion with the principle that motion in all cases, originates from mind ; <lb/>
            or in other words, is the effect of will-either the supreme will, or the will of <lb/>
            created minds. Motion is either constant and uniform, obeying what we call <lb/>
            a law, or it is incidental. The visible and palpable world then, according to <lb/>
            this theory, is MOTION, constant and uniform, emanating from infinite centres, <lb/>
            and springing during every instant of its continuance from the creative <lb/>
            energy. The instantaneous cessation of this energy, at any period, is there- <lb/>
            fore abstractedly quite as easily conceived of as is its continuance ; and <lb/>
            whether, in the next instant, it shall continue, or shall cease—whether the <lb/>
            material universe shall stand or shall vanish-is an alternative of which, irre- <lb/>
            spective of other reasons, the one member may be as easily taken as the <lb/>
            other ; just as the moving of the hand, or the not moving it, in the next <lb/>
            moment depends upon nothing but our volition. The annihilation of the <lb/>
            solid spheres-the planets, and the suns, that occupy the celestial spaces; <lb/>
            would not on this supposition be an act of irresistible force crushing that <lb/>
            which resists compression, or dissipating and reducing to an ether that which <lb/>
            firmly coheres ; but it would simply be the non-exertion in the next in- <lb/>
            stant of a power which has been exerted in this instant; it would be, not a <lb/>
            destruction, but a rest; not a crash and ruin, but a pause.—Taylor's Physi- <lb/>

            it exposes the mind, passively, to the influence of the inferior element, be- <lb/>
            comes in return the means of its exerting a power-and how extensive and <lb/>
            mysterious a power is it-over the solid matter around it. Mind, embodied, <lb/>
            by a simple act or volition, originates motion. That is to say, its will or <lb/>
            desire, through the instrumentality of muscular contractions, as applied to the <lb/>
            body itself, or to other bodies, puts it or them in movement. This power <lb/>
            of the mind in overcoming the vis inertia of matter and the force of gravi- <lb/>
            tation, is the only active influence in relation to the material world which <lb/>
            we have a certain knowledge of its possessing; for, as is obvious, the various <lb/>
            combinations of substances that are brought about by the skill of mill, are <lb/>
            all indirectly effected through the instrumentality of the muscular system ; <lb/>
            nor can it be ascertained, whether the chemical changes and assimilations <lb/>
            that are carried on in the secreting glands and the viscera are effected by <lb/>
            an unconsious involuntary mental operation. This organic influence ex- <lb/>
            cepted, supposing it to exist, the mechanical power of the mind is the only <lb/>
            one it enjoys ; but this it enjoys in no mean degree. It may, without much <lb/>
            hazard, be assumed, that motion in all instances originates in an immediate <lb/>
            volition, either of the supreme or of some created mind, and that this power <lb/>
            is exerted by the latter through the means of a corporeal structure."— <lb/>

          <p>THOUGH I doubt nott that many messengers and indeed <lb/>
            that rumour itself with characteristic rapidity will have out- <lb/>
            stripped this letter, and that you will already have heard <lb/>
            that a third year has been added to your labours, and to our <lb/>
            impatience, yet I have thought that the announcement of this <lb/>
            annoyance should be made to you by me also. For while <lb/>
            every one else despaired of the success, I still, by repeated <lb/>
            letters, gave you hopes of an early return, not only that I <lb/>
            might amuse you as long as possible with that pleasing <lb/>
            expectation, but because I did not doubt that through the <lb/>
            strong interest made both by me and the prætors the object <lb/>
            might be accomplished. Now as it has so happened that <lb/>
            neither the prætors by their interest, nor I by my zeal, were <lb/>
            able to effect any thing, it is certainly difficult not to feel <lb/>
            mortification at it, but yet we ought never to suffer our <lb/>
            minds which are employed in managing and supporting the <lb/>
            arduous affairs of government to be crushed or dejected by <lb/>
            misfortune. And because men ought to be most annoyed by <lb/>
            those ills which are incurred by their own faults, there is in <lb/>
            this transaction somewhat more afflicting to me than ought to <lb/>
            be to you, for it happened by my misconduct contrary to <lb/>
            your understanding with me when parting, and subsequently <note type="footnote"> * Quintus Cicero was at this time propraetor of Asia Minor. </note><note type="footnote"> t In the original “ non dubitabam.” The Roman idiom in epistolary <lb/>

            by letters, that your successor was not named last year. <lb/>
            This I did unwisely, with a view of consulting the welfare <lb/>
            of our allies, of crushing the presumptuousness of certain <lb/>
            traders,t and with the desire of increasing my own glory <lb/>
            through your merits ; especially as I effected the result of a <lb/>
            third year being added to that second.</p>
          <p>Having thus frankly acknowledged that it was my fault, it <lb/>
            is the part of your wisdom and kindness to take care and <lb/>
            manage that this which has been unwisely schemed by me <lb/>
            may be corrected by your diligence ; and surely, if you exert <lb/>
            yourself in all the duties of government so as to seem to vie <lb/>
            not only with others but with yourself, if you call in use all <lb/>
            your faculties, all your attention, all your thought, to that <lb/>
            love of glory, which is so powerfully prevalent in all trans- <lb/>
            actions, believe me, that one year added to your toil will <lb/>
            bring many years of pleasure to us, and even glory to our <lb/>
            posterity. Wherefore, I in the first place beg of you, that <lb/>
            you will not suffer your spirit to be damped or diminished, <lb/>
            nor yourself to be overwhelmed, as with a flood, by the <lb/>
            multitude of business; but that, on the contrary, you will <lb/>
            arouse yourself, and make a firm stand, even if you spon- <lb/>
            taneously incur it; for you do not bear a part in such a <lb/>
            government as is governed by fortune, but one in which <lb/>
            discretion and diligence has the greatest influence. Had I <lb/>
            seen your command prolonged at a time when you were <lb/>
            involved in the management of some great and dangerous <lb/>
            war, then I should have been disquieted in my mind, because <lb/>
            I should have been sensible that the power of fortune over <lb/>
            us was prolonged at the same time. But since that depart- <lb/>
            ment of the state has been committed to you in which <lb/>
            fortune has very little or no part, it seems to me to <lb/>
            depend entirely on your own virtue and wisdom. We <lb/>
            apprehend, I think, no treachery of enemies ; no revolt of <lb/>
            our allies ; no want of money or scarcity of provisions, and <lb/>
            no mutiny in the army. Yet these have often happened to <lb/>
            the wisest of men, who are forced to yield to the assaults of <note type="footnote"> * Traders. "Several complaints bad been carried to Rome against <lb/>

            government was the province of Asia Minor, one of the best the Romans <lb/>
            had, and that a great many merchants resided there for the benefit of corn- <lb/>

            a tempest.</p>
          <p>The most profound peace and perfect tranquillity has <lb/>
            fallen to your lot; but though those are circumstances that <lb/>
            may well give pleasure to a vigilant steersman, yet they may <lb/>
            be fatal to a sleeping one. For your province is composed, <lb/>
            first of that kind of allies, who of all the human race are the <lb/>
            most humanized ; and in the next place of those Roman <lb/>
            citizens, who either as farmers of the public revenues, are <lb/>
            most intimately connected with me,* or, having so traded as <lb/>
            to have become rich, consider they possess their fortunes in <lb/>
            security through the beneficial influence of my consular <lb/>
            administration. Yet even among these very men serious dis- <lb/>
            putes exist, many injustices are committed, and great con- <lb/>
            tentions are the consequence; and, thinking thus, I am <lb/>
            sensible that you have not a little business upon your <lb/>
            hands. I know that this business is very important, and <lb/>
            requires great wisdom. But still remember that I main- <lb/>
            tain, that this is a business which rather requires wisdom <lb/>
            than good fortune. If you restrain yourself, how easy <lb/>
            is it to restrain those you govern. This may indeed be <lb/>
            a great and difficult matter to others, as indeed it is a most <lb/>
            difficult achievement; but the practice of it was ever easy to <lb/>
            you; and well it might be, as your disposition is such that it <lb/>
            seems capable of moderation even without harming; while <lb/>
            such an education has been enjoyed by you as would be <lb/>
            capable of correcting the most vicious nature. When you <lb/>
            check, as you do, the passion for money, for pleasure, and <lb/>
            for all other things, can there be forsooth any danger of <lb/>
            your being unable to restrain a dishonest trader, or a too <lb/>
            rapacious publican ? For even the Greeks, when they <lb/>
            behold your living in this manner, will think that some one <note type="footnote"> * So Cicero in his speech in support of the Manilian Law, says, in <lb/>

          <p>I write to you in this strain, not that you might practise <lb/>
            these things, but that you may rejoice that you do practise <lb/>
            them, and that you have ever done so. For it is a glorious <lb/>
            thing for a man to have been invested with three years <lb/>
            sovereign power in Asia, in such a manner that no statue, no <lb/>
            picture, no plate, no garment, no slave, no beauty, no hoard <lb/>
            of money, in which things this province abounds, ever caused <lb/>
            him to swerve from his continence and moderation !† Again, <note type="footnote"> * We have a striking parallel passage to this in Cicero's oration, " Pro <lb/>
            Loge Manilia.” In eulogizing the continence of Pompey in Asia Minor, he <lb/>
            says, “Non avaritia ab institute cursu ad prædam aliquam devocavit, non <lb/>
            libido ad voluptatem, non amcenitas ad delectationem, non nobilitas urbis ad <lb/>
            cognitionem, non denique labor ipse ad quietem Postremo signa, et tabulas, <lb/>
            ceteraque ornamenta Græcorum oppidorum, quæ ceteri tollenda esse <lb/>
            arbitrantur, ea sibi ille ne visenda quidem existimavit. Itaque omnes quidem, <lb/>
            nunc in his locis Cn. Pompeium, sicut aliquem non ex hac urbe missum, <lb/>

            the acquisition of any gain, nor his passions to any pleasure, nor the <lb/>
            magnificence of a city to acquaint himself with it, nor fatigue itself to <lb/>
            repose. Moreover those statues and paintings and other ornaments of <lb/>
            Greek towns, which others consider as things to be carried away, he did not <lb/>
            even regard as objects to be visited, and thus indeed all men now in these <lb/>
            regions look upon Cneius Pompey, not as a certain individual despatched <lb/>
            from this city, but as one descended from heaven." </note><note type="footnote"> t “ Statues and paintings, and works of art in general, were favourite <lb/>
            objects of rapacity with the Roman commanders, and were carried off with- <lb/>

            from Syracuse to Rome, first excited that cupidity which led the Roman <lb/>
            provincial magistrates to pillage without scruple or distinction the houses of <lb/>
            private individuals, and the temples of the Gods. Marcellus and Mummius <lb/>
            however, despoiled only hostile and conquered countries. They had made <lb/>
            over their plunder to the public, and after it was conveyed to Rome, <lb/>
            devoted it to the embellishment of the capital; but subsequent governors of <lb/>
            provinces, having acquired a taste for works of art, began to appropriate to <lb/>
            themselves those masterpieces of Greece, which they had formerly neither <lb/>
            known nor esteemed. Some contrived plausible pretexts for borrowing <lb/>
            valuable works of art from cities and private persons; without any intention <lb/>
            of restoring them, while others, less cautious or more shameless, seized <lb/>
            whatever pleased them, whether public or private property, without excuse <lb/>
            or remuneration. But though this passion was common to most provincial <lb/>
            governors, none of them ever came up to the full measure of the rapacity <lb/>
            of Verres, when prætor of Scily. He seized tapestry, pictures, gold and <lb/>
            silver, plate, vases, gems, and Corinthian bronzes, till he literally did not <lb/>
            leave a single article of value of these descriptions iu the whole island.”— <lb/>

            what can be a more distinguished, a more desirable circum- <lb/>
            stance, than that this virtue, this moderation, this purity of <lb/>
            mind, should not be buried or concealed in darkness, but dis- <lb/>
            played in the sight of Asia, to the eyes of the noblest of our <lb/>
            provinces, and to the ears of all people and nations. That <lb/>
            the inhabitants are not alarmed at your journeys !-that they <lb/>
            are not impoverished by your expenses !-that they are not <lb/>
            frightened by your approach !—that there is the utmost <lb/>
            rejoicing, both public and private, wherever you go !-that <lb/>
            every town seems to receive you as its guardian, not as its <lb/>
            tyrant!—every house as a guest, and not as a robber !*</p>
          <p>But upon this subject, experience by this time must have <lb/>
            instructed you that it is not sufficient for you alone to <lb/>
            practise these virtues, but you are to give careful attention, <lb/>
            that invested as you are with this government, not only you, <lb/>
            but all officers subordinate to your authority, are to act for <lb/>
            the good of our allies, of our fellow citizens, and of our <lb/>
            country. You have, it is true, lieutenants under you, who <lb/>
            will themselves have regard to their own dignity; and of <lb/>
            these the chief in preferment, in dignity, and in experience, <lb/>
            is Tubero, who, I make no doubt, especially while he is <lb/>
            writing his history, will be able to choose from his own <lb/>
            annals such models of conduct, as he both can and will <lb/>
            imitate ; and Allienus, too, attached to us as well in affec- <lb/>
            tion and inclination, as in imitation of our lives. Need I to <lb/>
            mention Gratidius, who, I know for a certainty, labours for <lb/>
            his own fame, so as, with a brotherly affection for us, to <lb/>
            labour equally for ours. You have a quæstor,† whom lot, and <note type="footnote"> * Ejusmodi in provinciam homines cum imperio mittimus, ut, etiam si <lb/>

          <p>Should any of your officers appear of a more selfish dis- <lb/>

            neglects the laws by which he is bound in his own person, <lb/>
            but not if he should prostitute for interest that power which <lb/>
            you have annexed to his office. It does not however seem <lb/>
            desirable to me, especially as our manners have lately leaned <lb/>
            so much to laxity and ambition, that you should scrutinize <lb/>
            and dissect out every instance of corruption ;* but to pro- <lb/>
            portion the trust you repose in every one, according to the <lb/>
            degree of honesty he possesses. In like manner you should <lb/>
            be answerable for those whom our government has given you <lb/>
            as assessors and assistants, only under the restrictions which <lb/>
            I have already laid down.</p>
          <p>As to those whom you have chosen to belong to your <lb/>
            domestic establishment, or to be with you as your necessary <lb/>
            retinue, and who are accustomed to be designated as of the <lb/>
            prætor's cohort, you are answerable, not only for all their <lb/>
            actions, but for all their sayings. But you have about your <lb/>
            person those whom you may easily love while they act <lb/>
            rightly ; and such as but slightly consult your reputation you <lb/>
            can most easily coerce. Meanwhile it is natural to suppose, <lb/>
            that, while you were inexperienced, your generosity might <lb/>
            have been imposed upon ; for the more virtuous any man is <lb/>
            in himself, the less easily does he suspect others to be <lb/>
            vicious.f <note type="footnote"> * Shakspeare seems to have had this passage in his recollection when he <lb/>
            wrote that passage in his play of Julius Cæsar: <lb/>

            That every nice offence should bear its comment." </note><note type="footnote"> t This principle of morals has been confirmed by the experience of <lb/>
            mankind until it has almost become proverbial, it is asserted by Dr. <lb/>

            to our safe passage through ways beset on all sides, by fraud and malice, <lb/>
            has been always considered, when it exceeds the common measures, as a <lb/>
            token of depravity and corruption; and a Greek writer of sentences has <lb/>
            laid down, as a standing maxim, that he who believes not another on his <lb/>

          <p>But now let this third year be distinguished by the same <lb/>
            purity which marked the two former, and even by more <lb/>
            caution and diligence. Let your ears be such as are <lb/>
            supposed to hear what they listen to, but not into which <lb/>
            things may be falsely and dishonestly whispered for the sake <lb/>
            of gain, without being the receptacles of false and malicious <lb/>
            whispers, insinuations, and complaints. Suffer not your seal <lb/>
            to be a common chattel, but as your very self; let it not be <lb/>
            the tool of another's pleasure, but the evidence of your own. <lb/>
            Let your pursuivant keep the rank which our ancestors <lb/>
            assigned to him, who did not rashly entrust that office to any <lb/>
            but freed men, over whom they exercised pretty much the <lb/>
            same command, as they did over their slaves, and that not as <lb/>
            a post of advantage but of labour and service. Let the lictor <lb/>
            be the agent of your lenity rather than of his own, and let i <lb/>
            his axe and his rods be stronger evidences of his post than <lb/>
            of his power.</p>
          <p>In short, let all the province be sensible how dearly you <note type="footnote"> must either have learned by experience or observation the wickedness of <lb/>
            mankind, and been taught to avoid fraud by having often suffered or seen <lb/>
            treachery, or he must derive his judgment from the consciousness of his own <lb/>
            disposition, and impute to others the same inclinations, which he feels <lb/>
            predominant in himself. </note><note type="footnote"> " When therefore a young man, not distinguished by vigour of intellect, <lb/>
            comes into the world full of scruples and diffidence, makes a bargain with <lb/>
            many provisional limitations ; hesitates in his answer to a common question <lb/>
            lest more should be intended than he can immediately discover; has a long <lb/>
            reach in detecting the projects of his acquaintance; considers every caress <lb/>
            as an act of hypocrisy, and feels neither gratitude nor affection from the <lb/>
            tenderness of his friends, because he believes no one to have any real <lb/>
            tenderness, but for himself; whatever expectations this early sagacity may <lb/>
            raise of his future eminence or riches, I can seldom forbear to consider him <lb/>
            as a wretch incapable of generosity or benevolence; as a villain early com- <lb/>
            pleted beyond the need of common opportunities and gradual temptations. </note><note type="footnote"> Suspicion is indeed a temper so uneasy and restless, that it is very justly <lb/>
            appointed the concomitant of guilt. It is said, that no torture is equal to <lb/>
            the inhibition of sleep long continued; a pain to which the state of that <lb/>
            man bears a very exact analogy, who dares never give rest to his vigilance <lb/>
            and circumspection, but considers himself as surrounded by secret foes, and <lb/>
            fears to entrust his children or his friend with the secret that throbs in his <lb/>
            breast and the anxieties that break into his face. To avoid, at this expense, <lb/>
            those evils to which easiness and friendship might have exposed him, is <lb/>
            surely to buy safety at too dear a rate, and in the language of the Roman <lb/>
            satirist to save life by losing all for which a wise man would live.”—Rambler, <lb/>

            prize the welfare, the children, the fame, and the fortunes of <lb/>
            all who are under your command. Let it be notorious that <lb/>
            you will be equally the enemy of the man who gives, as of <lb/>
            him who receives a present, if you shall know it; for no one <lb/>
            will give them, when it shall be clearly perceived that those <lb/>
            who pretend to have the greatest interest with you are ac- <lb/>
            customed to obtain nothing from you.</p>
          <p>Yet this address of mine to you is not because I would <lb/>
            have you treat your dependants in a too severe or suspicious <lb/>
            manner. For if any of them for two years have never fallen <lb/>
            under suspicion of avarice, as I hear Cæsius, Chærippus, <lb/>
            and Labeo, have done, and I believe it because I know them <lb/>
            well; there is nothing which I should not think may be <lb/>
            most properly committed to them and to men of their <lb/>
            character. But if there is a man, from whom you have <lb/>
            already received offence, or of whom you have known any- <lb/>
            thing ill, never entrust anything to him, nor commit to him <lb/>
            any portion of your reputation. But if within your province <lb/>
            you have got any person who has been thoroughly admitted <lb/>
            to your intimacy, and who is unknown to me, consider how <lb/>
            far you ought to trust him. Not but that there may be <lb/>
            many worthy men amongst the provincials ; but this it is <lb/>
            lawful to hope, but dangerous to determine. For every <lb/>
            man's nature is concealed with many folds of disguise, and <lb/>
            covered as it were with various veils. His nature, his <lb/>
            brows, his eyes, and very often his countenance are deceitful, <lb/>
            and -his speech is most commonly a lie.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, out of that class of men who, being devoted to <lb/>
            the love of money, are destitute of all those qualities from <lb/>
            which we cannot be separated, where can you find one <lb/>
            who will sincerely love you, a mere stranger to them. and <lb/>
            not pretend to do so for the sake of advantage ? It <lb/>
            would seem to me very extraordinary, especially as those <lb/>
            very men pay seldom any regard to any private man, while <lb/>
            they are all invariably attached themselves to the prætors. <lb/>
            However, if amongst such kind of men you should find one <lb/>
            (for the thing is not impossible), who loves you more than <lb/>
            he does his own interest, eagerly enrol such a man in the <lb/>
            number of your friends ; but if you do not perceive this, there <lb/>
            will be no class in your acquaintance more to be avoided : <lb/>
            because they know all the arts of getting money, they Jo <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            nothing but for money, and they are indifferent about the <lb/>
            opinion of any man with whom they are not to continue to live.</p>
          <p>Certain connections too with the Greeks themselves are to <lb/>
            be most carefully guarded against, except with a very few <lb/>
            men, who, if any, are worthy of ancient Greece. For truly, in <lb/>
            general they are deceitful and treacherous, and trained up <lb/>
            by perpetual subjection, in the art of sycophancy.* All of <lb/>
            these I would say should be liberally treated, and the best <lb/>
            of them received into hospitality and friendship ; but too <lb/>
            close intimacies with them are not very safe, for though they <lb/>
            dare not oppose our wishes, yet they are jealous not only of <lb/>
            our countrymen but even of their own. Though they dare <lb/>
            not fly in the face of a Roman magistrate, yet at the bottom <lb/>
            they hate not only us but their own countrymen.</p>
          <p>Now, as in matters of this kind, as I wish to be cautious <lb/>
            and diligent (though I fear I may seem too rigid), what do <lb/>
            you think is my feeling with respect to slaves, whom we <lb/>
            ought to keep under the strictest commmand in all places, <lb/>
            but especially in the provinces ? Concerning this class many <lb/>
            directions might be given ; but the shortest and plainest <lb/>
            method I can recommend is, that in all your Asiatic <lb/>
            journeys, they should behave as if you were travelling over <lb/>
            the Appian way, and that they think there is not the least <lb/>
            difference whether they were entering Tralles † or Formiæ.‡ <lb/>
            But if any of your slaves should distinguish himself by his <lb/>
            fidelity, let him be employed in your domestic and private <lb/>
            affairs, but not let him have the smallest thing to do with <lb/>
            any public concern, or anything relating to the business of <lb/>
            your government. For though many things may properly <note type="footnote"> * Juvenal alludes to the same characteristic vice of the Greeks in th <unclear/> <lb/>

            ing observation and animadversion, they ought not to be <lb/>
            committed to them.</p>
          <p>But I know not how my discourse has deviated into a style <lb/>
            of dictation, though that was not my intention at the com- <lb/>
            mencement. For why should I dictate to a man not inferior <lb/>
            to me in knowledge, especially in all matters of this kind, <lb/>
            and even superior in experience ? but I thought it would be <lb/>
            very agreeable, if my sanction were added to what you are <lb/>
            doing. Wherefore let these be the foundations of your <lb/>
            dignity. In the first place, your own integrity and modera- <lb/>
            tion ; in the next place, the modest behaviour of all who are <lb/>
            about you, joined to a very cautious and circumspect choice <lb/>
            of your acquaintance, whether they be provincials or Greeks; <lb/>
            and the orderly and consistent regulation of your household. <lb/>
            All which particulars are commendable in our private and <lb/>
            daily concerns, but they must appear divine amidst such <lb/>
            great power, such depraved manners, and so corrupting a <lb/>
            province.</p>
          <p>Such a plan, and such regulations, will be sufficient to <lb/>
            support that severity in all your resolutions, and all your <lb/>
            decrees, which you exercised in those matters, and by which, <lb/>
            to my great pleasure, we have incurred some enmities, unless, <lb/>
            indeed, you imagine that I was influenced by the complaints <lb/>
            of an individual—I know not whom-of the name of <lb/>
            Paconius, who is not even a Greek, but is some Mysian, or <lb/>
            rather Phrygian; or that I was moved by the vociferations <lb/>
            of Tuscenius, that frantic, mean-spirited wretch, from whose <lb/>
            polluted maw you, with the utmost equity, rescued a dis- <lb/>
            honest prey. Wherefore we could not easily maintain those <lb/>
            and the other instances of severity which you have practised <lb/>
            in that province, without the most perfect integrity.</p>
          <p>There should therefore be the utmost rigour in your ad- <lb/>
            ministration of justice, so that it should not be affected by <lb/>
            favour, but maintained without variation.* It is, however, <note type="footnote"> * So impressed was Godwin with the supreme importance of uniformity <lb/>
            and certainty in the awards and inflictions of the law, that he thus treats of <lb/>
            the subject of pardons as interfering with this certainty. “ The very word <lb/>
            pardon, to a reflecting mind, is fraught with absurdity. What is the rule <lb/>
            that ought in all cases to direct my conduct ? What then is clemency ? <lb/>
            It can be nothing but the pitiable egotism of him who imagines he can do <lb/>
            something better than justice." Is it right that I should suffer constraint </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            of no great consequence that justice should be impartially and <lb/>
            diligently administered by yourself, unless the same is done <lb/>
            'by those to whom you have delegated some part of your <lb/>
            functions. Now it appears to me that in the government of <lb/>
            Asia there is no great variety of business, but that it is chiefly <lb/>
            employed in judicial administration, the method of which <lb/>
            especially in provinces is simple. Constancy and gravity <lb/>
            must indeed be exercised, which may be not only above <lb/>
            partiality, but even above the suspicion of it. To this <lb/>
            must be added affability in hearing, calmness in determining, <lb/>
            and carefulness in discussing the case and making restitu- <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>By reason of these qualities, Octavius* lately became most <lb/>
            popular, before whom, for the first time, the lictor had <note type="footnote"> for a certain offence ? The reasonableness of my suffering must be founded <lb/>
            in its consonance with the general welfare. He, therefore, that pardons me, <lb/>
            iniquitously prefers the supposed interest of an individual, and utterly <lb/>
            neglects what he owes to the whole. He bestows that which I ought not <lb/>
            to receive, and which he has no right to give. Is it right, on the con- <lb/>
            trary, that I should not undergo the suffering in question ? Will he by <lb/>
            rescuing me from suffering, confer a benefit on me, and inflict no injury on <lb/>
            others ? He will then be a notorious delinquent if he allow me to suffer. <lb/>
            There is indeed a considerable defect in this last supposition. If, while he <lb/>
            benefits me, he inflicts no injury upon others, he is infallibly performing a <lb/>
            public service. If I suffered in the arbitrary manner which the supposition <lb/>
            includes, the public would sustain an unquestionable injury in the injustice <lb/>
            that was perpetrated : and yet the man who prevents this serious injustice, <lb/>
            has been accustomed to arrogate to himself the attribute of clement, and <lb/>
            the apparently sublime, but in reality tyrannical, name of forgiveness. For <lb/>
            if he do, man has been here described instead of glory ; he ought to take <lb/>
            .shame to himself as an enemy to human kind. If every action, and <lb/>
            especially every action in which the happiness of a rational being is con- <lb/>
            cerned, be susceptible of a certain rule, mere caprice must be in all cases <lb/>
            excluded. There can be no action which, if I neglect, I shall have dis- <lb/>
            charged my duty, and if I perform, I shall be entitled to applause. From <lb/>
            the manner in which pardons are dispensed, inevitably flows the uncertainty <lb/>
            of punishment. It is too evident that punishment is inflicted by no certain <lb/>
            rules, and therefore creates no uniformity of expectation. Uniformity of <lb/>
            treatment, and constancy of expectation, form the sole basis of a genuine <lb/>
            morality. In a just form of society, this would never go beyond the sober <lb/>
            expression of those sentiments of approbation or disapprobation, with which <lb/>
            .different modes of conduct inevitably impress us. But if we at present <lb/>
            exceed this line, it is surely an execrable refinement of injustice that should <lb/>
            exhibit the perpetual menace of suffering unaccompanied with any certain <lb/>
            rule for telling its application.”—Godwin’s Political Justice, book vii. ch.ix. </note><note type="footnote"> • Octavius. IIe was father to Augustus Cæsar, and had been about this <lb/>

            nothing to do, and the crier had nothing to say; for every <lb/>
            one spoke when he pleased and as long as he pleased. In <lb/>
            this matter he might, perhaps, seem too compliant, were it not <lb/>
            that this gentleness was the warrant of his inflexibility. The <lb/>
            men of Sylla's party were compelled to restore what they had <lb/>
            seized by force and terror. Such of the magistrates as had <lb/>
            made unjust decisions were obliged themselves to submit, as <lb/>
            private men, to similar inflictions. Now this severity on his <lb/>
            part would have seemed cruel, had it not been tempered <lb/>
            with many ingredients of humanity.</p>
          <p>If this gentleness is agreeable at Rome, where there is so <lb/>
            much arrogance, such unbounded liberty, such unrestrained <lb/>
            licentiousness, where there are such numerous magistracies, <lb/>
            so many auxiliaries, so great force, and so much authority in <lb/>
            the senate, how agreeable must the affability of a prætor be <lb/>
            in Asia, where so great a number of our countrymen and <lb/>
            allies, where so many cities and so many states, are observant <lb/>
            ofone man's nod ? where they have no resource, no tribunal, <lb/>
            no senate, and no assembly of the people ? It belongs there- <lb/>
            fore to the character of a great man, and of a man as well <lb/>
            humane by nature, as improved by learning and the study <lb/>
            of the noblest arts, so to conduct himself in the use of such <lb/>
            great power as that no other authority should be desired by <lb/>
            those over whom he rules.</p>
          <p>The great Cyrus is represented by Xenophon (not accord- <lb/>
            ing to the truth of history, but as the ideal model of right <lb/>
            government*), whose extreme gravity is combined by that <lb/>
            philosopher with singular sweetness of manners; which books <lb/>
            our countryman, Scipio Africanus, was accustomed, and not <lb/>
            without reason, always to have in his hands, for in them no <lb/>
            duty of active, well-tempered government has been passed <lb/>
            over; and if Cyrus, who could never be reduced to a private <lb/>
            station, so diligently cultivated those duties, what ought they <lb/>
            to be held by those to whom power has been given on con- <lb/>
            dition of their surrendering it, and given by those laws to <lb/>
            which they must be amenable ?</p>
          <p>Now it seems to me that all the considerations of those <lb/>
            who rule over others should be referred to this object, that <lb/>
            those who are under their government should be as happy as <lb/>
            possible; and by constant report, and the acknowledgment <note type="footnote"> * See note p. 257. </note> <lb/>

            of all, it has become no honour that this both is, and <lb/>
            ever has been your most settled principle ever since you <lb/>
            first landed in Asia; nay, that it is the duty, not only <lb/>
            of those who govern the allies and the subjects of Rome, but <lb/>
            of those who have the care of slaves and dumb cattle, to con- <lb/>
            tribute to the interests and welfare of all committed to their <lb/>
            charge. In this respect I perceive it is universally allowed <lb/>
            that the utmost diligence has been used by you; that no new <lb/>
            debts have been contracted by the states; that you have dis- <lb/>
            charged many old ones with which many of the cities were <lb/>
            burdened and oppressed; that you have repaired many ruin- <lb/>
            ous and almost abandoned towns; amongst others Samus <lb/>
            the capital of Ionia, and Halicarnassus the capital of Caria; <lb/>
            that there are no seditions, no discords in your towns; that <lb/>
            it has been seen to by you that the states are governed by <lb/>
            the counsels of the best men; that you have suppressed <lb/>
            rapine in Mysia, and bloodshed in many places; that peace <lb/>
            has been established all over your province; that you have <lb/>
            chased thieves and robbers, not only from the highways and <lb/>
            country places, but from towns and temples, where they <lb/>
            were more numerous and more dangerous; that calumny, <lb/>
            that most cruel minister to the avarice of prætors, has been <lb/>
            removed from the reputation, the fortunes, and the retire- <lb/>
            ment of the rich; that the funds and taxes of the states are <lb/>
            equally borne by all who inhabit the borders of those states; <lb/>
            that access to you is most easy; that your ears are open to <lb/>
            the complaints of all men; that the poor and the helpless <lb/>
            always find admittance, not only to your public audiences <lb/>
            and tribunals, but even to your house and your bed-chamber; <lb/>
            and that in short, in the whole of your government there is <lb/>
            nothing that is spiteful, nothing that is merciless, but that it <lb/>
            is filled with clemency, gentleness, and humanity.</p>
          <p>How important was that public service you performed <lb/>
            when you freed Asia from the unjust and burdensome tax <lb/>
            imposed upon them by the ædiles, with great odium to us; <lb/>
            for if one man of quality publicly complains that you have <lb/>
            deprived him of almost £100,000, by ordering that money <lb/>
            should not be levied for public exhibitions, what vast sums <lb/>
            must have been raised, had the custom continued for raising <lb/>
            money in the name of all who exhibited public shows at <lb/>
            Rome. I stifled these complaints of our people, by a method <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            which, however it may be regarded in Asia, is highly ap- <lb/>
            plauded at Rome ; for when the states of ray province had <lb/>
            voted a sum of money for erecting a temple and a monument <lb/>
            to me, and when on account of my great deserts and your <lb/>
            extraordinary services, they did it voluntarily and cheer- <lb/>
            fully, and though the law has expressly provided, " That <lb/>
            governors may receive money for erecting a temple or a <lb/>
            monument," nay, though the money which was granted was <lb/>
            not to perish, but to be laid out upon the ornaments of a <lb/>
            temple, that was to appear to future times, not more a pre- <lb/>
            sent to me than to the people of Rome, and to the immortal <lb/>
            gods; and yet I thought that the offer should be rejected <lb/>
            though warranted by dignity, by law, and by the good will <lb/>
            of those who made it; and this I did for this reason, amongst <lb/>
            others, that those magistrates to whom such sums are not <lb/>
            due, nor permitted by law, might bear (the refusal of them) <lb/>
            with a more resigned temper.</p>
          <p>Apply yourself, therefore, with all your spirit and all your <lb/>
            zeal, to that plan which you have already practised, that of <lb/>
            loving the people which your country has committed and en- <lb/>
            trusted to your faithful care ; protecting them in every way, <lb/>
            and desiring that they should be as happy as possible.*</p>
          <p>But if fortune had set you over the Africans, the <lb/>
            Spaniards, or the Gauls, those fierce and barbarous nations, <lb/>
            yet still it would have been the dictate of your humanity to <lb/>
            study their interests, and to have promoted their advantage <lb/>
            and welfare. But when we govern a set of men, among <lb/>
            whom civilization not only exists, but from whom it may be <lb/>
            supposed even to have extended to others, surely we are <lb/>
            most especially bound to repay them what we have received <lb/>
            from them ; for I am not ashamed to acknowledge, especially <note type="footnote"> * " The only legitimate object of political institution, is the advantage o <lb/>
            individuals. All that cannot be brought home to them, national wealth, <lb/>
            prosperity, and glory, can be advantageous only to those self-interested <lb/>
            impostors who from the earliest accounts of time have confounded the <lb/>
            understandings of mankind, the more securely to sink them in debasement <lb/>
            and misery. The desire to gain a more extensive territory, to conquer or to <lb/>
            hold in awe our neighbouring states, to surpass them in arts or arms, is a <lb/>
            desire founded in prejudice and error. Usurped authority is a spurious <lb/>

            in my position in life, and with the deeds which I have per- <lb/>
            formed, which can involve no suspicion of indolence or un- <lb/>
            steadiness ; that I have arrived at all those accomplishments <lb/>
            to which I have attained, by means of those studies and arts <lb/>
            which have been handed down to us in the remains and sys- <lb/>
            tems of Greece. Therefore, besides the common faith <lb/>
            which we owe to all mankind, we seem to be especially in- <lb/>
            debted to this race of men,* so that we should be desirous of <lb/>
            offering to those, by whose precepts we have been instructed, <lb/>
            that which we learned from them. Plato, that philosopher, <lb/>
            so distinguished by his genius and learning, thought that <lb/>
            states would then at length be happy, when either wise and <lb/>
            learned men should begin to be their rulers, or when their <lb/>
            governors should apply themselves wholly to the study of <lb/>
            learning and wisdom ; that is, he thought that this union of <lb/>
            power and wisdom would constitute the safety of states. <lb/>
            This may possibly, at some time, be the case of our whole <lb/>
            empire, but at present it is the case of one province, that an <lb/>
            individual possesses the supreme power in it, who has de- <lb/>
            voted, from his childhood, the largest amount of time and <lb/>
            study to the pursuit of learning, of virtue, and humanity.</p>
          <p>Take care, therefore, my Quintus, that this year which is <lb/>
            added to your government, prove to be a year that is added <lb/>
            to the welfare of Asia ; and because Asia has been more <lb/>
            successful in detaining you than I was in procuring your <lb/>
            recall, do you behave so as that my regret may receive some <lb/>
            mitigation from the joy of the province. For if you have so <lb/>
            indefatigably applied yourself to deserve greater honours <lb/>
            than perhaps ever man did, you ought to exert much greater <lb/>
            diligence in maintaining them. I have already given you my <lb/>
            sentiments concerning that kind of honours. I have always <lb/>
            been of opinion, that if they are commonly accessible they <lb/>
            are worthless ; if bestowed to serve a purpose, they are con- <lb/>
            temptible; but if they are offered (as has been done) as a <lb/>
            t ibute to your merits, I think you cannot bestow too much <lb/>
            pains upon their preservation.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, you are invested with the highest command <note type="footnote"> * Horace tacitly acknowledges the same obligations to Greek literature <lb/>

            and power in those cities where you see your virtues are <lb/>
            consecrated and deified, think, in all that you arrange, and <lb/>
            decree, and perform, what you owe to such opinions on the <lb/>
            part of mankind, to such flattering decisions, and such ex- <lb/>
            alted honours. The result of this will be, that you will pro- <lb/>
            vide for all, that you will remedy the ills of your subjects, <lb/>
            provide for their welfare, and desire to be designated and <lb/>
            regarded as the parent of Asia.</p>
          <p>To this zeal and assiduity the farmers of the revenue offer <lb/>
            a great obstruction. If we oppose them, we shall separate <lb/>
            from ourselves and from the state an order of men who have <lb/>
            the highest claims upon us, and who by me were attached <lb/>
            to the service of our government. If, on the other hand, we <lb/>
            should indulge them in every respect, we must suffer those <lb/>
            to be utterly ruined, whose welfare, nay, whose convenience, <lb/>
            we are bound to consult. This, if we will view the case <lb/>
            aright, is the sole difficulty in all your administration. For <lb/>
            to practise self-control, to subdue all inordinate desires, to <lb/>
            regulate your family, to practise the impartial administra- <lb/>
            tion of justice, to show yourself ready to acquaint yourself <lb/>
            with cases, and to admit and grant a hearing to individuals, <lb/>
            are things more glorious than difficult, for they consist not <lb/>
            in any laborious application, but in the bent of the mind and <lb/>
            of the affections.</p>
          <p>We learned how much bitterness of feeling this matter of <lb/>
            the farmers of the revenue occasioned to our allies from our <lb/>
            own fellow countrymen ; who, when the tolls of Italy were <lb/>
            lately abolished, complained not so much of the heaviness of <lb/>
            the tolls as of the insolence of the toll-gatherers, from which <lb/>
            I am sensible of what must befall our allies in remote coun- <lb/>
            tries, when I have heard such complaints from our fellow <lb/>
            citizens in Italy. It seems to require a superhuman virtue, <lb/>
            that is, one like your own, in this situation of things, to give <lb/>
            satisfaction to the farmers of the public revenue, especially <lb/>
            when the taxes have been disadvantageously contracted for, <lb/>
            and at the same time not to suffer our allies to be ruined.</p>
          <p>But, in the first place, as to the Greeks, the hardship <lb/>
            which they most bitterly complain of, that of their being <lb/>
            taxed, is, in my opinion, no great hardship, because by their <lb/>
            own constitutions, apart from the government of the Roman <lb/>
            people, they were in the same condition with their own cou- <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            sent. As to the name of a farmer of the revenue, the Greeks- <lb/>
            ought not to hold it in such contempt, because, without their <lb/>
            assistance, they could not have paid the tax indiscriminately <lb/>
            imposed upon them by Sylla. Now that the Greeks are fully <lb/>
            as severe as our farmers are, in the collection of the public <lb/>
            revenue, may be concluded from this, that the Caunians* <lb/>
            some time ago, who inhabit the islands that were annexed <lb/>
            by Sylla to the division of Rhodes, petitioned the senate that <lb/>
            they might pay their taxes to us, rather than to the Rho- <lb/>
            dians. They therefore who always have been taxed, ought <lb/>
            not to hold the name of a tax-gatherer with horror, nor <lb/>
            ought they to despise him, without whom they cannot pay <lb/>
            their taxes ; nor ought they who have petitioned for him to <lb/>
            reject him. The Asiatics ought at the same time to reflect, <lb/>
            that were they not under our government, no calamity of <lb/>
            foreign war and domestic dissension would ever have been <lb/>
            absent from them. And since this government cannot be <lb/>
            supported without taxes, they ought cheerfully to purchase <lb/>
            for themselves, with some part of their incomes, an uninter- <lb/>
            rupted peace and tranquillity. When once they come to en- <lb/>
            dure with patience the profession and name of a farmer of <lb/>
            the revenue, your prudent measures and conduct will be able <lb/>
            to make other annoyances seem lighter to them. They will <lb/>
            come, not to reflect so much in making their compositions <lb/>
            upon the Censorian Law, but rather upon the advantage of <lb/>
            settling the business, and upon their freedom from molesta- <lb/>
            tion. You can likewise continue what you have always so <lb/>
            admirably done, to put them in mind how much dignity <lb/>
            there is in the office of a farmer of the revenue, and<unclear>how</unclear> <lb/>
            much we owe to that order. So that, apart from force and <lb/>
            the influence of authority, and of the fasces, you will bring <lb/>
            the publicans into favour and credit with the Greeks. You <lb/>
            may even entreat those whom you have so highly obliged, <lb/>

            structions of any one, but which in a great degree you <lb/>
            already have happily executed. For the most honourable <lb/>
            and considerable bodies of our empire never cease to pay me <lb/>
            their daily thanks, which are the more agreeable, because <lb/>
            the Greeks do the same. Now it is a matter of great <lb/>
            difficulty to bring together in good will those whose in- <lb/>
            terests, whose advantages, and whose natures, I had almost <lb/>
            said, are repugnant. But what I have here written, I have <lb/>
            written not for your instruction (for wisdom such as yours <lb/>
            stands in need of no man's instructions), but the recording of <lb/>
            yeur merits delights me as I write. In this letter, how- <lb/>
            ever, I have been longer than I intended or supposed that I <lb/>
            should be.</p>
          <p>There is one thing which I shall not cease to recommend <lb/>
            to you, for so far as in me lies I will not suffer an exception <lb/>
            to your praises. All who come from that region, while they <lb/>
            praise your virtue, your integrity, and your humanity, even in <lb/>
            their highest commendations make one exception, your <lb/>
            anger; a vice, which in private and every day life seems to <lb/>
            be the defect of an inconstant and weak mind ; but when a <lb/>
            passionate behaviour is joined to sovereign power, nothing <lb/>
            can be more monstrous.* I shall not, however, endeavour to <note type="footnote"> * " Anger is so uneasy a guest in the heart, that he may be said to be born <lb/>
            unhappy who is of a rough and choleric disposition. The moralists have <lb/>
            defined it to be a desire of revenge for some injury offered. Men of hot <lb/>
            and heady tempers are eagerly desirous of vengeance, the very moment they <lb/>
            apprehend themselves injured ; whereas the cool and sedate watch proper <lb/>
            opportunities to return grief for grief to their enemy. By this means it <lb/>
            often happens that the choleric inflicts disproportionate punishments upon <lb/>
            slight and sometimes imaginary offences, but the temperately revengeful, <lb/>
            have leisure to weigh the merits of the cause, and thereby either to smother <lb/>
            their secret resentments or to seek proper and adequate reparations for the <lb/>
            damages they have sustained. Weak minds are apt to speak well of the <lb/>
            man of fury, because when the storm is over he is full of sorrow and <lb/>
            repentance, but the truth is, he is apt to commit such ravages during his <lb/>
            madness, that when he comes to himself, he becomes tame, then for the <lb/>
            same reason that he ran wild before, ‘only to give himself ease,' and is a <lb/>
            friend only to himself in both extremities. Men of this unhappy make, <lb/>
            more frequently than any others, expect that their friends should bear with <lb/>
            their infirmities. Their friends should in return desire them to correct their <lb/>
            infirmities. The common excuses that 'heN, cannot help it, that it was soon <lb/>
            over, that they harbour no malice in their hearts, are arguments for <lb/>
            pardoning a bull or a mastiff, but shall never reconcile me to an intellectual <lb/>
            savage. Why indeed should any one imagine, that persons independent <lb/>

            give you the sentiments of the best instructed men, concern- <lb/>
            ing the passion of anger, both because I am unwilling thia. <lb/>
            this letter should be too long, and because you can easily <lb/>
            learn them from the writings of many men. Still I do not <lb/>
            think that one thing which is proper to a letter should be <lb/>
            neglected, namely, that he to whom we write should be <lb/>
            made acquainted with those things of which he is ignorant. <lb/>
            Now I am told almost by every body, that when you are <lb/>
            free from anger, nothing can be more agreeable than you <lb/>
            are ; <unclear>ut</unclear> when the impudence or perverseness of another has <lb/>
            excited you, you are under such violent agitations that your <lb/>
            kindly disposition is sought for in vain.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, a certain desire of glory as well as interest, <lb/>
            and fortune, have concurred to lead us into that walk of life, <lb/>
            by which we become the perpetual subject of conversation <lb/>
            amongst mankind, we ought to do and to strive all we can <lb/>

            he may be pitied, but he cannot be loved.”—Dr. Johnson, Rambler, No. <lb/>

            seems to be at present, be confined to a certain order of men and be attainable <lb/>
            by none but those whom fortune has elevated to the most conspicuous <lb/>
            stations. I would have every thing to be esteemed as heroic which is great <lb/>
            and uncommon in the circumstances of the man who performs it. Thus <lb/>
            there would be no virtue in human life, which every one of the species <lb/>
            would not have a pretence to arrive at, and an ardency to exert. Since <lb/>
            fortune is not in our power, let us be as little as possible in hers. Why <lb/>
            should it be neceesary that a man should be rich to be generous ? If we <lb/>
            measured by the quality and not the quantity of things, the particulars <lb/>
            which accompany an action is what should denominate it mean or great. </note><note type="footnote"> "The highest station of human life is to be attained by each man that <lb/>
            pretends to it; for every man can be as valiant, as generous, as wise, and as <lb/>
            merciful, as the faculties and opportunities which he has from Heaven and <lb/>
            fortune will permit. He that can say to himself, I do as much good, and <lb/>
            am as virtuous as my most earnest endeavours will allow me, whatever is his <lb/>
            station in the world, is to himself possessed of the highest honour. </note><note type="footnote"> "If ambition is not thus turned, it is no other than a continual succession <lb/>
            of anxiety and vexation. But when it has this cast, it invigorates the mind <lb/>
            and the consciousness of its own worth is a reward, which <unclear>t</unclear> is not in the <lb/>
            power of envy, reproach, or detraction, to take from it. Thus the seat of <lb/>
            solid honour is in a man's own bosom, and no one can want support who is <lb/>
            in possession of an honest conscience, but he who would suffer tho <lb/>

            not now insist on this consideration, that in human nature at <lb/>
            large, and especially at our time of life, it is very difficult for <lb/>
            a man to alter his disposition, or suddenly to pluck out a fail- <lb/>
            in-, that has settled into a habit. But my advice to you is <lb/>
            this, if you cannot altogether avoid this, but passion takes <lb/>
            possession of your mind before reason can take precautions <lb/>
            that it should not invade it, you should undergo a course of <lb/>
            preparation, and be every day meditating that resistance <lb/>
            must be offered to anger, and the more violently it affects <lb/>
            the mind, the more diligently must you restrain your tongue ; <lb/>
            which merit sometimes appears to me not less than that of <lb/>
            never being angry at all; because the latter virtue is not <lb/>
            solely the proof of self-respect, but sometimes of a lethargic <lb/>
            temperament. But when you are touched with anger, to <lb/>
            control both your temper and your language, even to hold <lb/>
            your peace, and to keep under command all excitement and <lb/>
            irritation of mind ; these are the properties, if not of con- <lb/>
            summate wisdom, yet of extraordinary understanding.</p>
          <p>They say that in this respect you are become much more <lb/>
            pliable and gentle. None of your violent emotions of passion <lb/>
            are stated to me ; none of your imprecating expressions, <lb/>
            and opprobious behaviour, all which are as repugnant to <lb/>
            authority and dignity, as they are reproachful to learning <lb/>
            and good breeding. For if angry passions are implacable, <lb/>
            the utmost cruelty is involved, and if placable,* an excess of <lb/>
            weakness; which, however, as a comparison of evils, is pre- <lb/>
            ferable to the cruelty.</p>
          <p>That the first year of your government gave rise to a <lb/>
            great deal of talk upon this subject might be owing to your un- <lb/>
            expectedly encountering that injustice, avarice, and insolence <lb/>
            of individuals, which seemed intolerable. The second year, <note type="footnote"> * " Another form of a passionate disposition arising indeed from the same <lb/>
            cause, is that which involves the next error which I have stated with respect <lb/>
            to resentment-the disproportion of the anger and the offence. He who does <lb/>
            not pause even to weigh the circumstances, cannot be supposed to pause to <lb/>
            measure the extent of injury. He feels that he is injured, and all his anger <lb/>
            bursts out instantly on the offender. It is this disproportion, indeed, which <lb/>
            is the chief evil of what is commonly termed passion. Some cause of slight <lb/>
            displeasure there may be even where anger in its violence would be immoral <lb/>
            and absurd. Yet such is the infirmity of our nature, that it is often no <lb/>
            slight triumph over our weakness to forgive a trifle with as much magna- <lb/>
            nimity as that with which we have forgiven greater injuries.”—Dr. Brown's <lb/>
            Moral Philosophy, Lect. 63. </note> <lb/>

            however, was more gentle ; because both habit and reason, <lb/>
            and, if I mistake not, my letters rendered you more mild <lb/>
            and patient. Now your third year ought to admit of such <lb/>
            amendment, as that no person may be able to utter the <lb/>
            slightest reproach.</p>
          <p>And on this subject I address you in the terms neither of <lb/>
            exhortation nor precept, but of brotherly entreaty, that you <lb/>
            employ your whole abilities, care, and concern, in accumu- <lb/>
            latin- praise from all quarters.* If our situation were one <lb/>
            of mediocrity as to public conversation and discourse, <lb/>
            nothing pre-eminent would be required of you, nothing <lb/>
            beyond the ordinary conduct of others. But by reason of <lb/>
            the splendour and magnitude of the concerns in which we <lb/>
            are engaged, unless we derive the highest glory from these <lb/>
            functions, we seem scarcely capable of avoiding the deepest <lb/>
            condemnation. We are so situated, that while all good <lb/>
            men arc our friends, they also require and expect from us, <lb/>
            all application and virtue; in the meanwhile, all the repro- <lb/>
            bate part of mankind, because with them we have declared <lb/>
            eternal war, seem to be satisfied with the slightest ground for <lb/>
            condemning us.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, since such a theatre as Asia has been assigned <lb/>
            you for the display of your virtues, a theatre most celebrated <lb/>
            by fame, most ample in extent, most distinguished by dis- <lb/>
            cernment, but. naturally so noisy that its expressions and <lb/>
            intimations reach even to Rome, I pray you to strive and <lb/>
            labour to appear, not only adequate to these conditions, but <lb/>
            by your merits to have surpassed them all ; and as fortune <lb/>
            has fixed my share of the public administration in Rome, and <lb/>
            yours in Asia, while I yield to none in my conduct, do you <lb/>
            excel all in yours.</p>
          <p>At the same time reflect, that we are not now labouring <lb/>
            for a glory that is in expectation and reversion ; but we are <note type="footnote"> † “Make not the consequence of virtue the ends thereof. Be not <lb/>
            beneficent for a name or cymbal of applause, nor exact and just in com- <lb/>

            of true and punctual dealing. For these rewards, though unsought for, <lb/>
            plain virtue will bring with her. To have other objects in good actions <lb/>

            struggling for what has been attained, a glory that we are <lb/>
            not so much to covet as to preserve. Indeed, had I any <lb/>
            interest that is distinct from yours, I could desire nothing <lb/>
            more than that situation of life which has actually been <lb/>
            assigned to me ; but as the case is, that unless all your words <lb/>
            and actions are answerable to my conduct here, I shall think <lb/>
            that I have gained nothing by all those mighty toils and <lb/>
            dangers in all which you have been a sharer. Now if you <lb/>
            were my chief fellow labourer in working my way to this <lb/>
            splendid reputation, you ought to labour beyond others that <lb/>
            I may maintain it.</p>
          <p>You are not to regard the opinion and the judgment of <lb/>
            those who are now living, but also of those who shall here- <lb/>
            after exist, whose verdict will be the more just as it will be <lb/>
            free from detraction and malevolence. In the next place, <lb/>
            you are to reflect, that you are not seeking glory for yourself <lb/>
            alone ; and, if you were, you would not be indifferent about <lb/>
            it, especially as you have thought proper to consecrate the <lb/>
            memory of your name by the noblest memorials, but you are <lb/>
            to share it with me, and it is to descend to our posterity <lb/>
            You are therefore to beware, lest if you should be careless <lb/>
            you should seem not only to have neglected your own <lb/>
            interests, but to have acted grudgingly even to your de- <lb/>
            scendants.</p>
          <p>And these things are said, not that my words may seem to <lb/>
            have aroused you when slumbering, but that they may en- <lb/>
            courage you in your career ; for you will continually act as <lb/>
            you have acted, so that all may praise your equity, your <lb/>
            moderation, your inflexibility, and your integrity. But <lb/>
            through my excessive affection for you, I am possessed with <lb/>
            an insatiable passion for your glory. In the meanwhile I <lb/>
            am of opinion, that as you must be now as well acquainted <lb/>
            with Asia as any man is with his own house ;* and as so <lb/>
            great experience has been added to your great wisdom, there <lb/>
            is nothing that pertains to glory of which you are not fully <lb/>
            sensible, and which does not daily occur to your mind, <lb/>
            without the exhortation of any. But I who, when I read <note type="footnote"> * This would seem to have been a proverbial simile. Juvenal has the <lb/>

            letters the longer they are, and for the same reason I myself <lb/>
            also am more prolix in writing.</p>
          <p>In conclusion I exhort and entreat you, that just as good <lb/>
            poets and skilful actors are wont to do, so you will redouble <lb/>
            your attention at this the latter part and conclusion of your <lb/>

            like the last act of a play, may appear the most elaborate and <lb/>
            perfect. This you will most easily do, if you think that I, <lb/>
