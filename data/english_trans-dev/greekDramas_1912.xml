            <title type="main">THE GREEK DRAMA</title>
          </head>
          <p>F <lb/>
            REQUENT experiments have shown that Greek <lb/>
            dramas, in English version, or even in the original <lb/>
            Greek, still have power to hold and impress a mod­ <lb/>
            ern English-speaking audience. But these dramas gain <lb/>
            in power, whether acted or read, as hearer or reader suc­ <lb/>
            ceeds in realizing the peculiar conditions under which <lb/>
            they were originally produced. And it is not enough to <lb/>
            remind the modern hearer or reader of the merely exter­ <lb/>
            nal features of dramatic representation at Athens-of the <lb/>
            vast open-air theatre, the national audiences, the competi­ <lb/>
            tion for state recognition after state support, of the masks, <lb/>
            costumes, and other accessories that distinguish ancient <lb/>
            from modern dramatic art. The modern hearer or reader <lb/>
            of an ancient Greek play must, above all else, press back to <lb/>
            as full a realization as possible of the religious origin and <lb/>
            the abiding religious associations of Greek tragedy and <lb/>
            comedy. Even after the sense of the religious origin and <lb/>
            significance of the drama became vague in the Athenian <lb/>
            mind, the representations were part of a fixed religious <lb/>
            festival of annual recurrence. In the great days of Athe­ <lb/>
            nian drama, when the plays included in this volume were <lb/>
            first brought out, there was no such thing as a play hav­ <lb/>
            ing a " run." Indeed, repetition of a successful play was <lb/>
            rare. It was given once for all, as a religious offering at <lb/>
            an annual religious celebration. The spectator was more <lb/>
            or less consciously a worshipper. The theatre adjoined <lb/>
            a temple, and was within the temple precinct. The Ober­ <lb/>
            ammergau passion-play is a helpful modern parallel; <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            but no such parallel can be more than slightly suggestive <lb/>
            of the ancient conditions. To construct one that is really <lb/>
            helpful would require large play of imagination. Sup­ <lb/>
            pose that the Roman Catholic Church, out of whose <lb/>
            bosom, out of whose liturgy, with its epic and choral <lb/>
            elements, the modern drama sprang, had succeeded in <lb/>
            retaining that complete control of the religious drama <lb/>
            which it had down to the thirteenth century, and that the <lb/>
            secular drama also had developed under such control; <lb/>
            suppose the Roman Catholic to be a state religion in a <lb/>
            small but independent city-state of the size of Hartford <lb/>
            or New Haven, the sole capital, the focus, the “eye " of a <lb/>
            territory smaller than Rhode Island, in which there were <lb/>
            more than a hundred rural Roman Catholic churches, all <lb/>
            recognising a central cathedral leader and head ; suppose <lb/>
            the rural churches conducted religious plays for their <lb/>
            respective communities at annual harvest festivals, and <lb/>
            that the great cathedral head-church gave at Christmas <lb/>
            and Easter a series of plays by three poets who had sur­ <lb/>
            passed all competitors, and who then contended for first, <lb/>
            second, and third rank before immense audiences com­ <lb/>
            prising most of the male citizens of the city-state and <lb/>
            many visitors from all parts of the United States—sup­ <lb/>
            pose all this, and we have only a reasonably adequate <lb/>
            modern parallel.</p>
          <p>The Greek drama was such an integral part of the <lb/>
            religion and cultus of Dionysus. This god was not a <lb/>
            genius of vines and wines merely, though even in that <lb/>
            case the scope of the personification would be no less <lb/>
            broad and dignified than that of Demeter. For the <lb/>
            Greek, the grape and wine were just as truly gifts of God <lb/>
            as grain and bread, just as intimately associated with <lb/>
            daily and yearly human toil, weariness, and refreshment. <lb/>
            But Dionysus represents far more than this. He is origi­ <lb/>
            nally the germinal or male principle in universal life, that <lb/>
            principle which, in spite of the universal law of decay <lb/>
            and death, keeps the universe teeming with exuberant <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            life. He is the Father-principle in the universe, as De­ <lb/>
            meter is the Mother-principle. These two great princi­ <lb/>
            ples, aided by the principle of light and heat personated <lb/>
            in Apollo, wage perpetual warfare against the principles <lb/>
            of darkness and death. Death triumphs for the winter <lb/>
            season, but Life triumphs in the great resurrection of <lb/>
            spring. Here is the basis for the exquisite myth of De­ <lb/>
            meter and Persephone. But Dionysus also, as life-prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, has his passion, death, and resurrection, and on <lb/>
            these themes early Greek folk-song expressed itself in <lb/>
            tones of sympathy, despair, and triumph. The strains of <lb/>
            such song would naturally sweep the whole range of hu­ <lb/>
            man emotion.</p>
          <p>According to Herodotus, Dionysus is comparatively a <lb/>
            late god in the Hellenic pantheon. His cultus was intro­ <lb/>
            duced from the Orient by way of Phrygia and Thrace. <lb/>
            Like the life-principle which the god personated, his <lb/>
            cultus was aggressive, struggling, often temporarily de­ <lb/>
            feated, but finally victorious. The desperate conflicts of <lb/>
            the new religion with older religions also gave themes <lb/>
            for the choral songs of its votaries. Homer knows Dio­ <lb/>
            nysus only as this aggressive new religious principle, re­ <lb/>
            fused admittance by Lycurgus, king of the Thracian <lb/>
            Edonians, and bringing down on his enemy blindness and <lb/>
            death. His cultus fought its way from Thrace to Thebes, <lb/>
            and the awful myth of Pentheus, torn by his own mother <lb/>
            in an ecstasy of the Dionysiac inspiration, embodies the <lb/>
            cruelties of religious war, where a man's foes are they of <lb/>
            his own household.</p>
          <p>As Lord of Life, subject to death in life and life after <lb/>
            death, Dionysus is closely associated with the souls of <lb/>
            the departed and their worship ; with prophecy as based <lb/>
            on communion with departed spirits; with Apollo and <lb/>
            Demeter at Delphi and Eleusis. Under the name Za­ <lb/>
            greus he is almost blended with Hades, Lord of Death. <lb/>
            As great Inspires he is closely associated with the cultus <lb/>
            of the Muses. He is, therefore, to be thought of as the <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            source of every aspiration and inspiration, higher and <lb/>
            lower—of battle rage, madness, joyful song and dance, <lb/>
            mysterious nightly revels, ecstasies, rhapsodies, visions, <lb/>
            unutterable longings and fancies. His office might in no <lb/>
            irreverent spirit be compared to that of the Holy Spirit <lb/>
            in the belief of the primitive Christian Church. St. <lb/>
            Paul's first letter to the Corinthians shows plainly that <lb/>
            the supposed gifts of the Spirit-prophecy, tongues, heal­ <lb/>
            ing—were often abused and allowed to run into orgiastic <lb/>
            excesses.</p>
          <p>The impulse to give expression to strong feeling in <lb/>
            song or dance or imitative action, or combinations of <lb/>
            these, is universal. Choral song and dance flourished <lb/>
            long among Greekcountry people before city poets de­ <lb/>
            veloped and perfected them. Rude folk-songs may be <lb/>
            heard to-day among the peasantry or labouring classes of <lb/>
            all lands. The choral folk-songs in honour of Dionysus <lb/>
            were most naturally sung at the vintage festivals in <lb/>
            autumn, and one may hear such rude vintage songs now <lb/>
            among the Swabians or the Bavarians. The Dionysiac <lb/>
            vintage hymns were rude, turbulent, passionate, but rich <lb/>
            in tragic contents; for the great Giver and Inspirer was <lb/>
            soon to succumb to the law of ever-recurring death. As <lb/>
            in the Christian mass, so here in rude folk version was an <lb/>
            Incarnatus movement, a Passus et sepultus est. There <lb/>
            was not wanting an attendant sacrifice of propitiation. <lb/>
            Such deep themes combined, of course, with the lower <lb/>
            excesses naturally attendant on a popular vintage fes­ <lb/>
            tival.</p>
          <p>Popular choral hymns to Apollo, on the other hand, <lb/>
            the god of light, warmth, and victory, were joyful, and <lb/>
            less charged with deep passion. The Apollinic choral <lb/>
            was more intellectual and less emotional than the Di­ <lb/>
            onysiac. Both styles of poetry were especially culti­ <lb/>
            vated by the Dorians of Peloponnesus. It was poetry to <lb/>
            be sung by masses of singers, in distinction from lyric or <lb/>
            epic poetry intended for solo performers. The early <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            tyrants therefore favoured it as a popular diversion. <lb/>
            Court poets elaborated its structure. Into the wild and <lb/>
            turbulent measures of the Dionysiac choral they infused <lb/>
            the purer and more intellectual features of Apollinic <lb/>
            song. The resurrection motive in the myth was empha­ <lb/>
            sized more, and the literary, as distinguished from the <lb/>
            folk Dionysiac dithyramb, was the result. This was a <lb/>
            hymn in praise of Dionysus for a trained chorus of fifty <lb/>
            voices, composed with elaborate responsive structure of <lb/>
            strophe and antistrophe by a trained and successful poet <lb/>
            for the spring festival of the god. According to the best <lb/>
            Greek tradition, it was perfected at Corinth, a Dorian <lb/>
            city, toward the end of the seventh century B.C., by <lb/>
            Arion the Lesbian­ <lb/>
            " Arion, whose melodic soul <lb/>
            Taught the dithyramb to roll." <lb/>
            This Dorian origin of the Dionysiac dithyramb accounts <lb/>
            for the persistence of Doric dialectic forms in the choral <lb/>
            parts of Athenian drama, though composed by Ionian <lb/>
            poets. These dialectic forms-broad, long a-sounds, wel­ <lb/>
            come to singers-can not be represented in translation.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the cultus of Dionysus had made its way <lb/>
            from Thebes in Bœotia down into Attica, where the little <lb/>
            mountain hamlet of Icaria seems to have been its first con­ <lb/>
            quest-no peaceful conquest either, as the sad myth of <lb/>
            Icarius indicates. Here it was that the Dionysiac dithy­ <lb/>
            ramb slowly developed into tragedy.</p>
          <p>Guided by the best Greek tradition, and by careful and <lb/>
            chronological analysis of extant Greek dramas, one may <lb/>
            trace the successive steps in this remarkable evolution <lb/>
            with reasonable certainty. The Dionysiac choral had from <lb/>
            the very start, and always retained, mimetic or imitative <lb/>
            germs-latent drama. And the evolution of the drama <lb/>
            of Hellas was from this lyric form with latent drama to <lb/>
            dramatic form with lingering lyric features. In other <lb/>
            words, the choral songs of a Greek play are not musical <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            interludes put between original dialogues, but the original <lb/>
            nucleus out of which the dialogues grew.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the origin of the drama was distinctly rural. <lb/>
            The city ultimately adopted it from the country, but <lb/>
            never succeeded in refining away all traces of this rustic <lb/>
            origin. The rustic singers, untrained and of irregular <lb/>
            number, who sang rude chorals in praise of Dionysus at <lb/>
            vintage festivals, were from the start imitative to a certain <lb/>
            extent, in that they assumed the role of satyrs, or rustic <lb/>
            attendants on the vegetation genius Dionysus. As satyrs <lb/>
            they wore goat skins, and were called tragoi ; their song <lb/>
            tragoidia, the song of goat-skin wearers.</p>
          <p>At Icaria, a secluded hill town halfway between <lb/>
            Athens and Marathon, this rustic tragedy, first brought <lb/>
            to high lyric level, no doubt, by influences from Corinth, <lb/>
            the home of the artistic dithyramb, budded into drama. <lb/>
            Here excavations of the American School at Athens, con­ <lb/>
            ducted by the late Professor Merriam, of Columbia, in <lb/>
            the spring of 1888, brought to light sure traces of an <lb/>
            active and persistent worship of Dionysus, closely asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with dramatic performances under state support. <lb/>
            “The scenery,” says Professor Merriam, in his Annual <lb/>
            Report, " is in harmony with the twofold side of the <lb/>
            worship of Dionysus—the gay and joyous, the sad and <lb/>
            mournful-and aptly fitted to inspire a Thespis and a <lb/>
            Susarion to further advances on the trodden path." Here <lb/>
            we may imagine rustic tragedy—i. e., Dionysiac choral <lb/>
            song, becoming more and more mimetic as the singers, <lb/>
            impersonating satyrs, threw themselves more and more <lb/>
            into their roles. The art of Dionysiac choral song may <lb/>
            have become patrial in the place-handed down from <lb/>
            generation to generation in certain families-like the roles <lb/>
            in the great passion-play at Oberammergau.. A local <lb/>
            chorus of fifty voices, the conventional number for the <lb/>
            literary form, would soon establish a style, to be handed <lb/>
            on and improved. As the local art became famous, vis­ <lb/>
            itors would be attracted—lay visitors and poets. And <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            so tradition has it-and good tradition, as Greek tradi­ <lb/>
            tion goes-that Susarion of Megara, the father of Greek <lb/>
            comedy, visited Icaria about the middle of the sixth <lb/>
            century. He may have come to be seen and heard, as <lb/>
            well as to see and hear. He found a local artist there <lb/>
            under whose name-and he is little more than a name­ <lb/>
            we place the two most important steps in the evolution <lb/>
            of the drama out of lyric song. This artist was Thespis, <lb/>
            and the two great inventions that justify us in calling <lb/>
            him the father of Greek tragedy were the rhesis or <lb/>
            recital-part, and the impersonating actor.</p>
          <p>Even a choral song by fifty voices can be dramatic as <lb/>
            the singers lose themselves more and more in their themes. <lb/>
            Divide the chorus, and the antiphonal effect, so prominent <lb/>
            in the Hebrew psalms, and in itself so dramatic, is secured. <lb/>
            Let one of the choreutæ or tragoi, say the leader, sing, in <lb/>
            recitative solo, the goodness, joys, or sufferings of Diony­ <lb/>
            sus, while the rest of the chorus, either all together or in <lb/>
            groups, respond in choral song to these recitals, and a <lb/>
            dramatic result is obtained as vivid, certainly, as that <lb/>
            produced by modern oratorio. Of this recital-role, with <lb/>
            good reason attributed to Thespis, the great narrative <lb/>
            roles of extant Greek drama are a logical development <lb/>
            and survival. The history of civilization which Æschylus <lb/>
            puts into the mouth of his Prometheus, the story of lo's <lb/>
            wanderings in the same play, the narratives of Guard and <lb/>
            Messenger in the " Antigone" of Sophocles, of Nurse <lb/>
            and Messenger in the " Medea " of Euripides, of the Serv­ <lb/>
            ants, male and female, in his “ Alcestis," are features <lb/>
            due, in the first instance, to this advance of Thespis.</p>
          <p>Without further step a simple drama is possible. The <lb/>
            second step, however, was still more fruitful. Delegating <lb/>
            the recital-role to a second member of the chorus, the <lb/>
            leader now personated Dionysus, pretended to be Dio­ <lb/>
            nysus himself, acted out his joys and sufferings, while the <lb/>
            reciter still told of others, and the chorus sang response <lb/>
            to both actor and reciter. With one member of the <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            chorus to relate thus certain episodes of joy or sorrow in <lb/>
            the god's career, and the leader of the chorus to act out <lb/>
            related episodes, and with the dialogue naturally develop­ <lb/>
            ing between reciter, actor, and chorus, a definite plot, <lb/>
            with beginning, culmination, and ending, could readily <lb/>
            have been presented. And when, next, both reciter and <lb/>
            actor assumed two or more roles, both dialogue and <lb/>
            action would be diversified and enriched. All the per­ <lb/>
            sonages of the Dionysiac story could be brought into the <lb/>
            action-the relatives, friends, and foes of the god—and <lb/>
            dialogue would come more and more to the fore, while <lb/>
            the lyric parts of the play would recede.</p>
          <p>Soon the theme of tragedy was widened as its re­ <lb/>
            sources increased. The actor passed from personations <lb/>
            of Dionysus or his relatives, friends, and foes, to those of <lb/>
            any gods or heroes whatever. For there were seeds of <lb/>
            drama in many other myths and cults besides those of <lb/>
            Dionysus, and Herodotus tells us (v, 67) of tragic choruses <lb/>
            that sang the sufferings of Adrastus. This advance threw <lb/>
            open the whole domain of heroic and sacred legend for <lb/>
            dramatic representation, though the drama's special rela­ <lb/>
            tion to Dionysus never entirely disappeared from popular <lb/>
            consciousness, and the priest of Dionysus had the place <lb/>
            of honour in theatres of later centuries.</p>
          <p>We may fairly suppose that the visit of Susarion to <lb/>
            Icaria quickened the invention of Thespis. As a result of <lb/>
            his improvements in the local Icarian drama, it attracted <lb/>
            the notice of artists and statesmen at Athens. Solon is <lb/>
            said to have gone to see Thespis acting in his own play,! <lb/>
            and Pisistratus the tyrant, anxious to enrich the literary <lb/>
            atmosphere of his court at Athens, induced him to bring <lb/>
            his dramas for representation to the city. Here they <lb/>
            secured state patronage, and the Parian Marble assigns <lb/>
            the first competitive victory of Thespis to the year 536 <lb/>
            B. c. One of the four titles of plays thus brought out at <lb/>
            Athens by Thespis was “ Pentheus," wherein the story <lb/>
            of Dionysus was still material for tragic plot, but other <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            titles betoken that emancipation from purely Dionysiac <lb/>
            themes alluded to above. At last the drama is a promi­ <lb/>
            nent part of a brilliant city's great annual festivals.</p>
          <p>To trace the growth of the Greek drama further does <lb/>
            not require so much imagination, for tradition becomes <lb/>
            surer, and authentic titles of plays presented more numer­ <lb/>
            ous and suggestive. No play of Phrynichus, the successor <lb/>
            of Thespis, has come down to us, but he is said to have <lb/>
            written nine tragedies, and among them an " Alcestis." <lb/>
            Of course competition, in the careers of Thespis and <lb/>
            Phrynichus, means that they had rivals, and sometimes <lb/>
            victorious rivals. But for purposes of brief introduction <lb/>
            only the greater names and surer traditions need to be <lb/>
            reviewed. Phrynichus worked with the dramatic appa­ <lb/>
            ratus that he inherited from Thespis, though sundry in­ <lb/>
            novations are ascribed to him, such as the female part <lb/>
            carried by male singers or actors. In the nature of <lb/>
            things, the dialogue was continually developing at the <lb/>
            expense of the choral parts, and yet the lyric songs of <lb/>
            Phrynichus are extolled almost beyond measure by so <lb/>
            great a master of song as Aristophanes. They were the <lb/>
            elderly Athenian's favourites even after a Sophocles had <lb/>
            arisen.</p>
          <p>But the most startling innovation made by Phrynichus <lb/>
            was his selection of recent historical events for dramatiza­ <lb/>
            tion. His first dramatic victory is set at 512 B. c., and no <lb/>
            later than 494 the great city of Miletus—daughter city of <lb/>
            Athens, according to tradition, and encouraged by her <lb/>
            to withstand the Persian might-was abandoned to an <lb/>
            awful destruction. " The Athenians,” says Herodotus <lb/>
            (vi, 21), "showed themselves beyond measure afflicted at <lb/>
            the fall of Miletus, in many ways expressing their sym­ <lb/>
            pathy, and especially by their treatment of Phrynichus. <lb/>
            For when this poet brought out his drama of the capture <lb/>
            of Miletus, the whole theatre burst into tears, and the <lb/>
            people sentenced him to pay a fine of a thousand drachmas <lb/>
            for recalling to them their own misfortunes. They like­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            wise made a law that no one should ever again exhibit <lb/>
            that piece." Whatever the aesthetic bearing and value of <lb/>
            this famous sentence, it is clear that Phrynichus changed <lb/>
            his method of handling contemporary history, if we may <lb/>
            trust an item of dramatic information preserved by Plu­ <lb/>
            tarch in his " Themistocles." Four years after the glo­ <lb/>
            rious victory of Salamis, Themistocles defrayed the ex­ <lb/>
            penses of representing a play of Phrynichus. This play <lb/>
            was probably the " Phoenician Women," and its theme <lb/>
            . was the victory of Salamis, for which Themistocles won <lb/>
            the greatest credit. The title shows the composition of <lb/>
            the chorus of the play, and that makes it plain that the <lb/>
            scene was transferred to the enemy's country, where the <lb/>
            necessary idealization could be better secured, and that <lb/>
            the grief of the enemy was depicted in order to enhance <lb/>
            the triumph of the victor. An inspiring instead of <unclear/> <lb/>
            rebuking theme, an ideal instead of a familiar scene, made <lb/>
            the play a success-so much of a success that Æschylus, <lb/>
            the great follower of Phrynichus, tried to secure for his <lb/>
            favourite Aristides a larger credit for Salamis than the <lb/>
            popularity of Themistocles allowed. This correction of <lb/>
            popular sentiment Æschylus attempted in his " Persians, <lb/>
            which celebrated Salamis, and was brought out in 4721 <lb/>
            To make the story of dramatic and political rivalry com­ <lb/>
            plete, Aristides should have defrayed the expenses of this <lb/>
            controversial play of Æschylus; but so attractive a con­ <lb/>
            clusion has no definite authority, though Plutarch plainly <lb/>
            shows, in the opening chapter of his "Aristides," that <lb/>
            there was plenty of dubious tradition about plays pro­ <lb/>
            duced at the charges of that ardent rival of Themistocles</p>
          <p>Fortunately, the " Persians " has come down to us, and <lb/>
            a brief description of its action and structure will best <lb/>
            show the development now reached by the drama, and <lb/>
            also serve as a transition to the briefer account of the <lb/>
            careers of the four Greek dramatists of whose work we <lb/>
            have entire specimens-briefer, because the specimens tell <lb/>
            their The play was given by two actors, ana <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            achorus with its leader or representative. One of the <lb/>
            two actors took the parts of Atossa, widowed queen- <lb/>
            mother of Xerxes, and also of Xerxes, for mother and <lb/>
            son are not brought together in the action; the other <lb/>
            actor took the parts of the messenger, and of the Darius- <lb/>
            ghost. The scene is in front of the royal palace at Susa, <lb/>
            the tomb of Darius being in the foreground. The action, <lb/>
            to give the barest outline, moves as follows: Enter chorus <lb/>
            of Persian elders, singing their anxious solicitude for the <lb/>
            great hosts of Xerxes in their distant campaign; enter <lb/>
            Atossa, who shares her own forebodings of disaster with <lb/>
            the chorus, till both are overwhelmed by the announce­ <lb/>
            ment of an in-rushing messenger that the whole Persian <lb/>
            host has perished; choral lamentations at the messenger's <lb/>
            brief announcements; Atossa hears the detailed story of <lb/>
            the messenger (description of Salamis); choral hymn of <lb/>
            lament; Atossa invokes with offerings the spirit of Darius, <lb/>
            the chorus joining with an invocation hymn ; the ghost <lb/>
            of Darius appears with rebukes for Persian pride, and <lb/>
            prophecies of further disaster (Platæa); choral lament; <lb/>
            enter Xerxes, a fugitive, who with the chorus respon­ <lb/>
            sively bewails his doom, and is at last escorted into the <lb/>
            palace, where Atossa had gone after the vision of Darius. <lb/>
            With this simple scheme, all the swelling exultations over <lb/>
            Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa are given voice, and in the <lb/>
            long description of the battle of Salamis, where Æschylus <lb/>
            was an eyewitness, Aristides is given his due meed of <lb/>
            praise.</p>
          <p>The play is, of course, full of wars and fightings, as is <lb/>
            even to greater degree the same poet's " Seven against <lb/>
            Thebes," which, as Aristophanes testifies, made every <lb/>
            hearer long to go out to battle. Æschylus is a warrior <lb/>
            poet, Miltonic in style, Cromwellian in military spirit. <lb/>
            His first dramatic victory falls in 485, halfway between <lb/>
            Marathon and Salamis, at both of which he fought. His <lb/>
            life, from 525 to 456 B. c., covers the militant upward <lb/>
            career of Athens, and has no lessons of defeat and hu­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            miliation, except as he saw political principles which he <lb/>
            disliked coming into control, and the dramatic tastes of <lb/>
            the city where he had been easily supreme inclining <lb/>
            toward the new ideals of a younger rival in the field.</p>
          <p>A dramatic defeat by Sophocles may have disap­ <lb/>
            pointed Æschylus, but need not have embittered him, <lb/>
            in spite of the romantic story given by Plutarch in his <lb/>
            "Cimon." It was the national fame of Æschylus that <lb/>
            took him to the brilliant courts of Sicily, from which <lb/>
            he returned to Athens to vanquish Sophocles with his <lb/>
            incomparable Urestes plays, whither he returned again <lb/>
            and where, as fate would have it, he died.</p>
          <p>The “Prometheus Bound” was perhaps brought out <lb/>
            in Athens shortly after the poet's return from Sicily, <lb/>
            while the impressions of an eruption of Mount Ætna <lb/>
            were still fresh in men's minds (page 18). Only two <lb/>
            actors were at this time assigned by the state, and the <lb/>
            play conforms to this restriction in a manner that makes <lb/>
            one forget the restriction entirely. The first actor took <lb/>
            the parts of Hephræstus and Prometheus, the silent Titan <lb/>
            being represented by a huge effigy during the first part <lb/>
            of the prologue, and the second actor the parts of Kratos <lb/>
            (Strength), Oceanus, to, and Hermes, the choral songs <lb/>
            giving this apparently overburdened actor time for <unclear>res</unclear> <lb/>
            and change of costumes. The chorus of twelve Ocean <lb/>
            nymphs makes a most spectacular entry in their winged <lb/>
            car, as does their Father Oceanus on his winged quadru­ <lb/>
            ped. The scene is laid among desolate cliffs of Scythia, <lb/>
            and after the narrative and prophecy of Prometheus <lb/>
            have carried the imagination of the audience through <lb/>
            the manifold fascinations of unknown geographies, the <lb/>
            play closes with a convulsion of nature. Its theme is <lb/>
            sublime-the conflict between a noble but short-sighted <lb/>
            beneficence, and a beneficence that is omniscient and in <lb/>
            league with destiny. The disastrous conflict alone is <lb/>
            presented in this play, the reconciliation by atonement <lb/>
            in the play that followed, the “ Prometheus Loosed," of <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            which only significant fragments are preserved, and the <lb/>
            glorious reward of suffering after penitence in the final <lb/>
            play of the trilogy, the " Prometheus Fire-bearer." Of <lb/>
            this play hardly more than the name has reached us, but <lb/>
            we imagine it to have been a great cultus-drama, like the <lb/>
            extant “Eumenides." Still a fourth play followed imme­ <lb/>
            diately in the original representation, a satyr-play, prob­ <lb/>
            ably some grotesque mythical farce. In such groups of <lb/>
            four were the dramas of Æschylus presented, organic <lb/>
            tetralogies, four dramatic chapters of a single myth.</p>
          <p>Sophocles also presented his tragedies in groups of <lb/>
            four, but freed himself from the restriction of a single <lb/>
            myth for all. Each play was independent of the other <lb/>
            three. The tetralogy was inorganic. Hence each play <lb/>
            of Sophocles is larger and more complete in its unity <lb/>
            than any single play of Æschylus. His resources, too, <lb/>
            were increased by the state. He had three actors at <lb/>
            his disposition, at least in all his plays that have come <lb/>
            down to us. This made it possible for him to enrich his <lb/>
            characterizations, enliven his dialogues, and quicken his <lb/>
            action. It is thus we get such delicate character-foils as <lb/>
            Ismene to Antigone, Chrysothemis to Electra, with ini­ <lb/>
            tial stages of a secondary plot. The state also enlarged <lb/>
            the chorus for Sophocles to fifteen, a decided gain in <lb/>
            musical and spectacular resources. All these resources <lb/>
            Æschylus also enjoyed in his later contests with his <lb/>
            rivals, but he was unable to emancipate himself from <lb/>
            the influences of the old restrictions.</p>
          <p>Sophocles is the poet-laureate of the Athenian empire, <lb/>
            of the golden Periclean age. He celebrated Salamis as a <lb/>
            youth of sixteen and died two years before the fall of <lb/>
            Athens. We get distinct glimpses of his pre-eminence <lb/>
            in physical vigour and beauty, in wealth and culture, in <lb/>
            state finance, diplomacy, and legislation; while the rec­ <lb/>
            ord of his dramatic victories is long-almost unbroken. <lb/>
            At his death a contemporary comic poet—and the comic <lb/>
            poets spared not Pericles—passed this encomium on him : <note type="footnote">B</note><lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            " Blessed Sophocles! He lived out a long life, a prosper­ <lb/>
            ous, fortunate, and gifted man; he wrote many beautiful <lb/>
            tragedies, he died a beautiful death, and he never had a <lb/>
            sorrow.”From a career so rich and tranquil we may <lb/>
            well expect to get a rich and tranquil, well-poised art, <lb/>
            and we are not disappointed. His themes may not be so <lb/>
            grand, nor his diction so grandiose, as those of Æschylus; <lb/>
            but he brings the great heroic strifes and figures down <lb/>
            from a superhuman to a beautifully idealized human level. <lb/>
            " The impression of unity conveyed by one of his plays is <lb/>
            prodigious. Probably no other dramatist in any age has <lb/>
            been able to move a tragedy forward with such unswerv­ <lb/>
            ing ethical relentlessness."</p>
          <p>As in the still greater tragedy of " CEdipus the King ” <lb/>
            its author is not to be held accountable for the savage <lb/>
            and bloody features of the myth, so in the " Antigone.” <lb/>
            It is a myth crowded with ghastly features. “Its hor­ <lb/>
            rors reach their height in the special subject of the pres­ <lb/>
            ent play, the indignities offered to a dead body." But <lb/>
            back of all gruesome detail, the sure mark of popular <lb/>
            legend, lies the constant human element, the struggle <lb/>
            between the higher and the lower impulses of the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual human soul. For Antigone the question is: Shall <lb/>
            I allow the lower impulses of retributive vengeance, even <lb/>
            when sanctioned by the formal authority of the state, to <lb/>
            triumph over the higher impulses of brotherly love, im­ <lb/>
            planted in the soul by Heaven ? She answers in the nobler <lb/>
            way, and pays her life for the privilege.</p>
          <p>From the playwright's point of view the play differs <lb/>
            from the “Prometheus " not only in its deeper psychol­ <lb/>
            ogy, its increase in action and vivacious dialogue, its <lb/>
            greater subordination of the epic and lyric elements, but <lb/>
            also in its greatest oratorical feature, the forensic scene— <lb/>
            the high debate on the issue at stake between father and <lb/>
            son, king and lover. This marks the advent of an ele­ <lb/>
            ment of public debate in public life, which was unknown <lb/>
            in the career of AEschylus. In just so far as the poet <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            allows his work to mirror the peculiar and transitory fea­ <lb/>
            tures of the life of his day he ceases to be the perfect <lb/>
            artist for all times, though he has " brought the afflictive <lb/>
            and fatalistic elements of the story into such exquisite <lb/>
            balance with the heroic and intentional as most fully to <lb/>
            hold the reader's interest, admiration, and awe."</p>
          <p>The plays of Euripides are much more a reflex of the <lb/>
            spiritual, social, and political upheavals and perplexities <lb/>
            of his generation, a generation later than that of Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles, although much of their lives coincided. Sophocles <lb/>
            represents the poise and full glory of Athenian power <lb/>
            and culture; Euripides their disintegration and confusion. <lb/>
            Himself a restless, introspective, unhappy, but fearlessly <lb/>
            inquiring spirit, his plays reflect the unrest and the fore­ <lb/>
            bodings of a changing order of things. For this reason <lb/>
            he comes nearer to the modern heart than either of his <lb/>
            great predecessors —" Euripides the Human, with his <lb/>
            droppings of warm tears." He has infused into the old <lb/>
            mythical framework of his dramas the hot, human pas­ <lb/>
            sions of himself and his fellow-men, with no shielding <lb/>
            cloak of idealism. An ancient verdict clearly declares <lb/>
            that the heroes and heroines of Sophocles are men and <lb/>
            women as they should be; those of Euripides, men and <lb/>
            women as they are.</p>
          <p>His " Medea " conforms in story and in construction <lb/>
            to tradition, but the jealous wife in this “Medea,”to <lb/>
            which she sacrifices mother love, and the mother love <lb/>
            that struggles with jealousy, are no more Athenian than <lb/>
            English, no more Asiatic than Athenian. Mother love <lb/>
            succumbs in " Medea," but wife love triumphs over <lb/>
            mother love and death in the “Alcestis," " that strangest, <lb/>
            saddest, sweetest song of his." Self-sacrifice submits to <lb/>
            death to save selfishness (Admetus); selfishness is con­ <lb/>
            verted by this death, and then self sacrifice is restored to <lb/>
            life by the great self-sacrificer (Heracles), and bestowed <lb/>
            once more upon converted selfishness. As Euripides in­ <lb/>
            fused into the skeleton of the old legend all the warmth <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            and pathos of the lives of loving women and selfish men <lb/>
            about him, so Browning infuses into the drama of Eurip­ <lb/>
            ides the richer warmth and deeper pathos of modern <lb/>
            lives. His paraphrase of the “Alcestis," in " Balaustion's <lb/>
            Adventure," is shining testimony to the increasing dig­ <lb/>
            nity and depth of human life.</p>
          <p>All these great plays are constructed on this general <lb/>
            scheme: I. Prologue; II. Chorus Entry; III. Episode <lb/>
            (dialogue); IV. Choral Song; V. Episode: VI. Chord <lb/>
            Song; VII. Episode; VIII. Choral Song; IX. Exodus. <lb/>
            There may be slight variations in the number of the di­ <lb/>
            visions, the lyric element may be increased by duetts be­ <lb/>
            tween actor and chorus, or by solos from the actors, but <lb/>
            the general scheme remains the same, the very nomen­ <lb/>
            clature testifying to the original predominance of the <lb/>
             <lb/>
            chorus.</p>
          <p>In this original choral element there was much <unclear>mi</unclear> <lb/>
            icry and mummery. There were also excesses in th <lb/>
            original rustic worship of Dionysus, which found repr <lb/>
            sentation in the satyr-play or farce that once closed th <lb/>
            tetralogy. As the satyr-play disappears from the tragic* <lb/>
            tetralogy, we find comedy coming into prominence, and<lb/>
            at last, long afdter its elder sister, receiving state support.<lb/>
            It had remmained a country festival of the vintage long<lb/>
            after tragedy had been made a city rite. It slowly con-<lb/>
            quered its way up to state recgnition as it took on more<lb/>
            and more artistic form. Andit was me form 01 tne <lb/>
            reigning tragedy, naturally, which imposed itself on the <lb/>
            somewhat chaotic materials for artistic comedy that were <lb/>
            latent in every vintage festival all over Hellas, though a <lb/>
            more distinct impulse toward artistic form seems to have <lb/>
            come from Sicily. So much Aristotle knew, but not who <lb/>
            gave comedy its distinct artistic being. Before men were <lb/>
            aware of her claim to distinct and beautiful personality, <lb/>
            Thalia stood full grown by the side of grave Melpomene.</p>
          <p>About 460 B. c. comedy had its first chorus assigned it <lb/>
            by the state, and the years 460-430 knew the work of the <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            comic artists who made Aristophanes possible. He him­ <lb/>
            self gives us their names and artistic traits and poetic <lb/>
            careers in the marvellous " parabasis " of the " Knights.” <lb/>
            The para basis is the dramatic feature that most distin­ <lb/>
            guishes comedy from tragedy. The rest of a comedy of <lb/>
            Aristophanes—and we must judge of old Athenian com­ <lb/>
            edy almost solely by him—can easily be brought under <lb/>
            the prevalent form of tragedy. The choral parts are <lb/>
            more freely distributed, and are, of course, in lighter vein, <lb/>
            often in the lightest vein of personal satire or jolly con­ <lb/>
            ceit ; but the ruling form, after all, is: Prologue, chorus, <lb/>
            episode, chorus, alternating episodes and choruses, exo­ <lb/>
            dus. The material of the dialogue is an indiscriminate <lb/>
            blending of caricature, personal satire, broad farce, and <lb/>
            genuine character-comedy, though the last element is <lb/>
            scarce. Athens was a great city, but a city-state, and <lb/>
            a city where everybody knew everybody else. Corn. <lb/>
            edy dramatized that city's morals, politics, arts, and let­ <lb/>
            ters. Comedies were political and social pamphlets, al­ <lb/>
            ways in opposition to the new because it was new, and <lb/>
            always giving full contrasts between old and new; <lb/>
            whence the value of these comedies for the study of the <lb/>
            life of their day.</p>
          <p>But the parabasis is so distinct a feature of the old <lb/>
            Athenian comedy that it needs to be fully described and <lb/>
            understood. In its performance all dramatic illusion is <lb/>
            boldly abandoned or deftly played with, and yet in its <lb/>
            formal structure the original germs from which the whole <lb/>
            organism of the comedy grew are plainly to be seen. <lb/>
            The para basis of the " Clouds" lacks one of the seven <lb/>
            technical divisions that go to make up the full structure <lb/>
            as elsewhere seen, but otherwise it is an admirable speci­ <lb/>
            men of its kind. After the actors have been carefully <lb/>
            taken from the scene by the natural progress of the <lb/>
            action, the coryphæus or leader of the chorus of twenty­ <lb/>
            four female shapes, fantastically draped to represent <lb/>
            clouds, chants an accompaniment to their departure, <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            wishing them success in their undertaking (p. 312, 1. 15- <lb/>
            18). This division is called the Kommation.Then, the <lb/>
            chorus wheeling about and advancing to face the audi­ <lb/>
            ence, whence the name para basis, the coryphæus chants <lb/>
            what may be called the Poet's Manifesto (p. 312, 1. 20-p. <lb/>
            313, 1. 32). The poet himself was the coryphæus. He <lb/>
            complains bitterly of the audience because when the <lb/>
            " Clouds " was presented first they did not award it the <lb/>
            first prize. He now presents it in an improved shape, <lb/>
            and counts on its complete success. This division is <lb/>
            technically named the Parabasis (proper), and usually <lb/>
            ends in a series of short verses to be recited all in one <lb/>
            breath, the Pnigos, or choker-passage, omitted here for <lb/>
            metrical reasons. The thought never is specialized in <lb/>
            it. It is merely a bit of metrical and elocutional farce. <lb/>
            Then the chorus unite in singing a lyric invocation to <lb/>
            sundry gods—Zeus, Poseidon, and, very appropriately <lb/>
            for clouds, Æther and Helios (air and sun). This is <lb/>
            technically the Ode, a relic of the original choral song, <lb/>
            from which both tragedy and comedy sprang (p. 313, 1. <lb/>
            33-37). Then follows, chanted or recited by the cory­ <lb/>
            phaeus, the Epirrhemaor Address, a manifesto of the <lb/>
            chorus as such—i. e., as clouds, directed at the audience. <lb/>
            The Athenians make bad return for the kindly attentions <lb/>
            of the clouds to them, since they have elected the rascally <lb/>
            Cleon to military office (p. 314, l. 3-24). Then the Re­ <lb/>
            sponsive Ode (p. 314, 1. 25-32) is sung by the united cho­ <lb/>
            rus, invoking Apollo, Artemis, Athena, and Dionysus to <lb/>
            come to the great dramatic function, once a purely re­ <lb/>
            ligious service. Last comes the Responsive Address, the <lb/>
            Antepirrhema, a second manifesto of the Clouds as such <lb/>
            (p. 314,1. 33-p. 315,1. 17). The Clouds bring an aggrieved <lb/>
            message to the Athenians from the Moon, who met them <lb/>
            as they were getting ready to go to Athens. She says <lb/>
            the Athenian calendar is all topsy-turvy.</p>
          <p>After this singular mixture of personal appeal, reli­ <lb/>
            gious song, political and social protest and satire, the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            actors reappear and the burlesque resumes its sway. It <lb/>
            is surely a high tribute to the artistic sense of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian public that the rude, comic elements of cultus hymn <lb/>
            and travelling gibe and satire should have to assume <lb/>
            such elaborate structural dress as this in order to win <lb/>
            public support and favour. It is perhaps also a tribute <lb/>
            to the keen discernment of the same public that it refused <lb/>
            to confound Socrates with the common run of formal <lb/>
            rhetoricians or Sophists, as Aristophanes wilfully or ig­ <lb/>
            norantly did in his coarse caricature of the great teacher; <lb/>
            at least the comedy in which he did so, by its failure, <lb/>
            broke the poet's long line of brilliant successes, and <lb/>
            apparently almost broke the poet's heart.</p>
          <p>As the choral hymns of tragedy by their relative <lb/>
            prominence are a sure index of the age of the play, so is <lb/>
            the para basis in comedy. A complete parabasis in the <lb/>
            first part of the play, and a short parabasis in the second <lb/>
            part, mark the earlier work of the poet; a single para­ <lb/>
            basis, even incomplete, his later manner ; and the absence <lb/>
            of any parabasis at all his latest. And his latest manner, <lb/>
            represented by the “ Plutus," is an entirely new manner. <lb/>
            The Athens of 388 B. c. is no longer an imperial centre, <lb/>
            but, politically, a provincial city. Character-types take <lb/>
            the place of flesh-and-blood politicians; social evils the <lb/>
            place of great national policies. It is wealth now, not <lb/>
            imperial sway, which needs fresh allotment under the <lb/>
            comic lash. The comedy of character-types, Middle <lb/>
            Comedy as it is called for convenience, soon and readily <lb/>
            passes into New Comedy, the comedy of manners. But <lb/>
            in the Greek original time has spared us complete speci­ <lb/>
            mens only of Old and Middle Comedy.</p>
          <p>For all the plays here presented no stage was needed. <lb/>
            That, with permanent stone theatre and stage structures, <lb/>
            came in far later times. Actors issue from a typical struc­ <lb/>
            ture or scene, temporarily brought to adjoin the circular <lb/>
            orchestra, into the orchestra itself, where they mingle <lb/>
            freely with the chorus, and where the coryphæus takes <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            part in the action. The chorus and actors, as circum­ <lb/>
            stances require, enter and leave the orchestra by pas­ <lb/>
            sages on either side the central scene. The orchestra is <lb/>
            almost surrounded by the rising tiers of rude and tern­ <lb/>
            porary seats for the spectators. <lb/>

          <p>ÆSCHYLUS, the first in time and strength of the three great Greek <lb/>
            tragedians, was born in Eleusis, Attic..!, in 525 B. c. His father, Eupho­ <lb/>
            rion, is supposed to have been a priest in the old temple of Demeter, <lb/>
            which was destroyed by the Persians, 484 it. c.: and the son was undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly an initiate into hefamous mysteries of his native town, and was <lb/>
            accused before the council of the Areopagus (468 B.c.), according to some <lb/>
            authorities, for having revealed them in one of his plays. The latter <lb/>
            part of his life was lived in the stirring days of the Persian wars, and <lb/>
            when thirty-five years old he tought with distinction and was wounded <lb/>
            at the battle of Marathon. He was also at Salamis and Platea, and <lb/>
            appears himself to have been prouder of his record as a soldier than of <lb/>
            his reputation as a writer. Fable relates that when Æschylus was a boy <lb/>
            he fell asleep while watching a vineyard, and Dionysus came to him in <lb/>
            a dream and told him to write tragedy. He awoke and wrote his first <lb/>
            verses. He was twenty-five years old when he made his first appearance <lb/>
            as a writer of tragedy at Athens ; but it was not until he was forty-one <lb/>
            that he stood first in the competition. He wrote more than seventy plays, <lb/>
            seven of which have come down to us in their entirety : " The Suppli­ <lb/>
            cants," .. The Persians," "The Seven against Thebes," “Prometheus <lb/>
            Hound," and the trilogy known as the "Oresteia," including "Agamem­ <lb/>
            non,” .. The Choephori,” and The Eumenides.”He was fifty-three <lb/>
            when he produced the trilogy of which The Persians" was the first <lb/>
            member and is the only surviving one. It is probably also the earliest <lb/>
            of his works that we possess. In 468 B. c. he was defeated in the compe­ <lb/>
            tition by his young rival, Sophocles. Soon afterward, either from chagrin <lb/>
            at this defeat or under banishment by the Areopagus, he went to the <lb/>
            court of Hiero of Syracuse, where he again produced The Persians." <lb/>
            In 467 It. c. Hierodied, and nine years later Æschylus returned to Athens <lb/>
            to put the "Oresteia" on the stage. An unpopular chorus in "The <lb/>
            Eumenides" again forced him to leave Athens, to die, two years after­ <lb/>
            ward (456 B. C.), at Gela, in Sicily. An oracle had foretold that Æschylus <lb/>
            should die by a blow from heaven, and the prediction was in a manner <lb/>
            fulfilled by the way in which he met his death. An eagle, wishing to <lb/>
            crack the shell of a tortoise, carried it high in the air, and mistaking the <lb/>
            bald head of the poet for a stone, dropped it upon that. Æschylus wrote <lb/>
            three tragedies on the subject of Prometheus ; the first pictured him <lb/>

            The Scythian track, the desert without man. <lb/>
            And now, Hephaestus, thou must needs fulfil <lb/>
            The mandate of our Father, and with links <lb/>
            Indissoluble of adamantine chains <lb/>
            Fasten against this beetling precipice <lb/>
            This guilty god. Because he filched away <lb/>
            Thine own bright flower, the glory of plastic fire, <lb/>

            It doth behoove he expiate to the gods, <lb/>

            I lack your daring, up this storm-rent chasm <lb/>
            To fix with violent hands a kindred god, <lb/>
            Howbeit necessity compels me so <lb/>
            That I must dare it, and our Zeus commands <lb/>
            With a most inevitable word. Ho, thou ! <lb/>
            High-thoughted son of Themis, who is sage! <lb/>
            Thee loath, I loath must rivet fast in chains <lb/>

            Night shall come up with garniture of stars <lb/>
            To comfort thee with shadow, and the sun <lb/>
            Disperse with retrickt beams the morning-frosts ; <lb/>
            But through all changes, sense of present woe <lb/>
            Shall vex thee sore, because with none of them <lb/>
            There comes a hand to free. Such fruit is plucked <lb/>
            From love of man ! And in that thou, a god, <lb/>
            Didst brave the wrath of gods, and give away <lb/>
            Undue respect to mortals, for that crime <lb/>
            Thou art adjudged to guard this joyless rock, <lb/>

            To utter on the air. For Zeus is stern, <lb/>
            And new-made kings are cruel.</p>
          <p>Strength. Be it so. <lb/>
            Why loiter in vain pity ? Why not hate <lb/>
            A god the gods hate ?-one, too, who betrayed <lb/>
            Thy glory unto men?</p>
          <p>Hep hast us. An awful thing <lb/>
            Is kinship joined to friendship.</p>
          <p>Strength. Grant it be: <lb/>
            Is disobedience to the Father's word <lb/>
            A possible thing ? Dost quail not more for that ?</p>

            Except to rule the gods. There is none free <lb/>
            Except King Zeus.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. I know it very well; <lb/>
            I argue not against it.</p>
          <p>Strength. Why not, then, <lb/>
            Make haste and lock the fetters over him, <lb/>
            Lest Zeus behold thee lagging?</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Here be chains. <lb/>
            Zeus may behold these.</p>
          <p>Strength. Seize him ; strike amain ; <lb/>
            Strike with the hammer on each side his hands; <lb/>
            Rivet him to the rock.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. The work is done, <lb/>
            And thoroughly done.</p>
          <p>Strength. Still faster grapple him ; <lb/>
            Wedge him in deeper; leave no inch to stir. <lb/>
            He's terrible for finding a way out <lb/>
            From the irremediable.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Here's an arm, at least, <lb/>
            Grappled past freeing.</p>
          <p>Strength. Now, then, buckle me <lb/>
            The other securely. Let this wise one learn <lb/>
            He's duller than our Zeus.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Oh, none but he <lb/>
            Accuse me justly.</p>
          <p>Strength. Now, straight through the chest, <lb/>
            Take him and bite him with the clinching tooth <lb/>
            Of the adamantine wedge, and rivet him.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Alas! Prometheus, what thou sufferest here <lb/>
            I sorrow over.</p>
          <p>Strength. Dost thou flinch again, <lb/>
            And breathe groans for the enemies of Zeus? <lb/>
            Beware lest thine own pity find thee out.</p>

            I must do. Urge no further than I must.</p>
          <p>Strength. Ay, but I will urge ! and, with shout on <lb/>
            shout, <lb/>
            Will hound thee at this quarry. Get thee down, <lb/>
            And ring amain the iron round his legs.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. That work was not long doing.</p>
          <p>Strength. Heavily now <lb/>
            Let fall the strokes upon the perforant gyves ; <lb/>
            For he who rates the work has a heavy hand.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Thy speech is savage as thy shape. <lb/>
            Strength. Be thou <lb/>
            Gentle and tender, but revile not me <lb/>
            For the firm will and the untruckling hate.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Let us go. He is netted round with chains. <lb/>
            Strength. Here, now, taunt on ! and, having spoiled the <lb/>
            gods <lb/>
            Of honours, crown withal thy mortal men <lb/>
            Who live a whole day out. Why, how could they <lb/>
            Draw off from thee one single of thy griefs? <lb/>
            Methinks the Daemons gave thee a wrong name, <lb/>
            Prometheus, which means Providence, because <lb/>
            Thou dost thyself need providence to see <lb/>

            I wrestle down the myriad years of time! <lb/>

            Woe, woe ! to-day's woe and the coming morrow's <lb/>
            I cover with one groan. And where is found me <lb/>
            A limit to these sorrows ? <lb/>
            And yet what word do I say ? I have foreknown <lb/>
            Clearly all things that should be; nothing done <lb/>
            Comes sudden to my soul; and I must bear <lb/>
            What is ordained with patience, being aware <lb/>
            Necessity doth front the universe <lb/>
            With an invincible gesture. Yet this curse <lb/>
            Which strikes me now I find it hard to brave <lb/>
            In silence or in speech. Because I gave <lb/>
            Honour to mortals, I have yoked my soul <lb/>
            To this compelling fate. Because I stole <lb/>
            The secret fount of fire, whose bubbles went <lb/>
            Over the ferule's brim, and manward sent <lb/>
            Art's mighty means and, perfect rudiment, <lb/>
            That sin I expiate in this agony, <lb/>
            Hung here in fetters, 'neath the blanching sky. <lb/>
            Ah, ah me ! what a sound ! <lb/>
            What a fragrance sweeps up from a pinion unseen <lb/>
            Of a god, or a mortal, or Nature between, <lb/>
            Sweeping up to this rock where the Earth has her <lb/>
            bound, <lb/>
            To have sight of my pangs, or some guerdon obtain. <lb/>
            Lo, a god in the anguish, a god in the chain ! <lb/>
            The god Zeus hateth sore, <lb/>
            And his gods hate again, <lb/>
            As many as tread on his glorified floor, <lb/>
            Because I love mortals too much evermore. <lb/>
            Alas me ! what a murmur and motion I hear, <lb/>
            As of birds flying near ! <lb/>
            And the air undersings <lb/>
            The light stroke of their wings, <lb/>
            And all life that approaches I wait for in fear. <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>

            Smote down the profound <lb/>
            Of my caverns of old, <lb/>

            On the high-jutting rocks of this fissure, and keep <lb/>

            I behold thee, Prometheus; yet now, yet now, <lb/>
            A terrible cloud whose rain is tears <lb/>
            Sweeps over mine eyes that witness how <lb/>
            Thy body appears <lb/>
            Hung awaste on the rocks by infrangible chains; <lb/>

            All into the dark, where there should be none, <lb/>

            But now the winds sing through and shake <lb/>
            The hurtling chains wherein I hang, <lb/>

            Thy sorrows ? who of the heaven and earth <lb/>

            Right wrathfully <lb/>
            Bears on his sceptral soul unbent, <lb/>

            Or till Another shall appear, <lb/>

          <p>Prometheus. I know that Zeus is stern; <lb/>
            Iknow he metes his justice by his will; <lb/>
            And yet his soul shall learn <lb/>
            More softness when once broken by this ill; <lb/>
            And, curbing his unconquerable vaunt, <lb/>
            He shall rush on in fear to meet with me <lb/>
            Who rush to meet with him in agony, <lb/>
            To issues of harmonious covenant.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Remove the veil from all things, and relate <lb/>
            The story to us—of what crime accused, <lb/>
            Zeus smites thee with dishonourable pangs, <lb/>
            Speak, if to teach us do not grieve thyself.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. The utterance of these things is torture <lb/>
            to me, <lb/>
            But so, too, is their silence : each way lies <lb/>
            Woe strong as fate. <lb/>
            When gods began with wrath, <lb/>

            And war rose up between their starry brows, <lb/>

            With opposite paths, that they would have no Zeus <lb/>
            To rule the gods forever—I, who brought <lb/>
            The counsel I thought meetest, could not move <lb/>
            The Titans, children of the Heaven and Earth, <lb/>
            What time, disdaining in their rugged souls <lb/>
            My subtle machinations, they assumed <lb/>
            It was an easy thing for force to take <lb/>
            The mastery of fate. My mother, then, <lb/>
            Who is called not only Themis, but Earth too <lb/>
            (Her single beauty joys in many names), <lb/>
            Did teach me with reiterant prophecy <lb/>
            What future should be, and how conquering gods <lb/>
            Should not prevail by strength and violence, <lb/>
            But by guile only. When I told them so, <lb/>
            They would not deign to contemplate the truth <lb/>
            On all sides round; whereat I deemed it best <lb/>
            To lead my willing mother upwardly, <lb/>
            And set my Themis face to face with Zeus <lb/>
            As willing to receive her. Tartarus, <lb/>
            With its abysmal cloister of the Dark, <lb/>
            Because I gave that counsel, covers up <lb/>
            The antique Chronos and his siding hosts, <lb/>
            And, by that counsel helped, the king of gods <lb/>
            Hath recompensed me with these bitter pangs; <lb/>
            For kingship wears a cancer at the heart- <lb/>
            Distrust in friendship. Do ye also ask <lb/>
            What crime it is for which he tortures me ? <lb/>
            That shall be clear before you. When at first <lb/>
            He filled his father's throne, he instantly <lb/>
            Made various gifts of glory to the gods, <lb/>
            And dealt the empire out. Alone of men, <lb/>
            Of miserable men, he took no count, <lb/>
            But yearned to sweep their track off from the world, <lb/>
            And plant a newer race there. Not a god <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            Resisted such desire, except myself. <lb/>
            I dared it! I drew mortals back to light, <lb/>
            From meditated ruin deep as hell! <lb/>
            For which wrong I am bent down in these pangs <lb/>
            Dreadful to suffer, mournful to behold, <lb/>
            And I who pitied man am thought myself <lb/>
            Unworthy of pity; while I render out <lb/>
            Deep rhythms of anguish 'neath the harping hand <lb/>
            That strikes me thus—a sight to shame your Zeus!</p>
          <p>Chorus. Hard as thy chains, and cold as all these rocks, <lb/>
            Is he, Prometheus, who withholds his heart <lb/>
            From joining in thy woe. I yearned before <lb/>
            To fly this sight; and, now I gaze on it, <lb/>
            I sicken inward.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. To my friends, indeed, <lb/>
            I must be a sad sight.</p>
          <p>Chorus. And didst thou sin <lb/>
            No more than so?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I did restrain besides <lb/>
            My mortals from premeditating death.</p>
          <p>Chorus. How didst thou medicine the plague-fear of <lb/>
            Ideath ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I set blind Hopes to inhabit in their house.</p>
          <p>Chorus. By that gift thou didst help thy mortals well.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I gave them also fire.</p>
          <p>Chorus. And have they now, <lb/>
            Those creatures of a day, the red-eyed fire?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. They have, and shall learn by it many arts</p>
          <p>Chorus. And truly for such sins Zeus tortures thee, <lb/>
            And will remit no anguish ? Is there set <lb/>
            No limit before thee to thine agony?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. No other-only what seems good to him.</p>
          <p>Chorus. And how will it seem good ? what hope re­ <lb/>
            mains ? <lb/>
            Seest thou not that thou hast sinned ? But that thou hast <lb/>
            sinned <lb/>
            It glads me not to speak of, and grieves thee; <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Then let it pass from both, and seek thyself <lb/>
            Some outlet from distress.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. It is in truth <lb/>
            An easy thing to stand aloof from pain, <lb/>
            And lavish exhortation and advice <lb/>
            On one vexed sorely by it. I have known <lb/>
            All in prevision. By my choice, my choice, <lb/>
            I freely sinned—I will confess my sin— <lb/>
            And, helping mortals, found mine own despair. <lb/>
            I did not think indeed that I should pine <lb/>
            Beneath such pangs against such skyey rocks, <lb/>
            Doomed to this drear hill, and no neighbouring <lb/>
            Of any life. But mourn not ye for griefs <lb/>
            I bear to-day : hear rather, dropping down <lb/>
            To the plain, how other, woes creep on to me, <lb/>
            And learn the consummation of my doom. <lb/>
            Beseech you, nymphs, beseech you, grieve for me <lb/>
            Who now am grieving; for Grief walks the earth, <lb/>
            And sits down at the foot of each by turns.</p>
          <p>Chorus. We hear the deep clash of thy words, <lb/>
            Prometheus, and obey. <lb/>
            And I spring with a rapid foot away <lb/>
            From the rushing car and the holy air, <lb/>
            The track of birds; <lb/>
            And I drop to the rugged ground, and there <lb/>
            Await the tale of thy despair.</p>

            And thou shalt learn my words are truth, <lb/>
            That no fair parlance of the mouth <lb/>
            Grows falsely out of mine. <lb/>
            Now give me a deed to prove my faith; <lb/>
            For no faster friend is named in breath <lb/>
            Than I, Oceanus, am thine.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Ha! what has brought thee? Hast thou <lb/>

            To look upon my woe? How hast thou dared <lb/>
            To leave the depths called after thee? the caves <lb/>
            Self-hewn, and self-roofed with spontaneous rock, <lb/>
            To visit Earth, the mother of my chain? <lb/>

            Which now affects thee fiercely, shall appear <lb/>
            A mere child's sport at vengeance. Wretched god, <lb/>
            Rather dismiss the passion which thou hast, <lb/>
            And seek a change from grief. Perhaps I seem <lb/>

            Enough so! leave these thoughts. It can not be <lb/>

            Thou lackest no good-will. But, as for deeds, <lb/>
            Do naught! 'twere all done vainly, helping naught, <lb/>

            Shouldering the column of the heaven and earth, <lb/>
            A difficult burden! I have also seen, <lb/>

            Flash out ferocious glory from his eyes <lb/>
            As if to storm the throne of Zeus. Whereat, <lb/>
            The sleepless arrow of Zeus flew straight at him, <lb/>
            The headlong bolt of thunder-breathing flame, <lb/>
            And struck him downward from his eminence <lb/>
            Of exultation; through the very soul <lb/>
            It struck him, and his strength was withered up <lb/>
            To ashes, thunder-blasted. Now he lies, <lb/>

            Hephæstus sits, and strikes the flashing ore. <lb/>
            From thence the rivers of fire shall burst away <lb/>
            Hereafter, and devour with savage jaws <lb/>
            The equal plains of fruitful Sicily, <lb/>

            By Zeus's bolted thunder. But for thee, <lb/>
            Thou art not so unlearned as to need <lb/>
            My teaching; let thy knowledge save thyself. <lb/>
            I quaff the full cup of a present doom, <lb/>
            And wait till Zeus hath quenched his will in wrath.</p>
          <p>Oceanus. Prometheus, art thou ignorant of this, <lb/>
            That words do medicine anger?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. If the word <lb/>

            And, where the parts are ulcerous, sear them not <lb/>
            By any rudeness.</p>

            To dare as nobly-is there harm in that? <lb/>

            Required to save thyself.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Hearken the rest, <lb/>
            And marvel further, what more arts and means <lb/>
            I did invent-this, greatest: if a man <lb/>
            Fell sick, there was no cure, nor esculent <lb/>
            Nor chrism nor liquid, but for lack of drugs <lb/>
            Men pined and wasted, till I showed them all <lb/>
            Those mixtures of emollient remedies <lb/>
            Whereby they might be rescued from disease. <lb/>
            I fixed the various rules of mantic art, <lb/>
            Discerned the vision from the common dream, <lb/>
            Instructed them in vocal auguries <lb/>
            Hard to interpret, and defined as plain <lb/>
            The wayside omens—flights of crook-claWed birds- <lb/>
            Showed which are by their nature fortunate, <lb/>
            And which not so, and what the food of each, <lb/>
            And what the hates, affections, social needs <lb/>
            Of all to one another-taught what sign <lb/>
            Of visceral lightness, colored to a shade, <lb/>
            May charm the genial gods, and what fair spots <lb/>
            Commend the lung and liver. Burning so <lb/>
            The limbs incased in fat, and the long chine, <lb/>
            I led my mortals on to an art abstruse, <lb/>
            And cleared their eyes to the image in the fire, <lb/>
            Erst filmed in dark. Enough said now of this. <lb/>
            For the other helps of man hid underground, <lb/>
            The iron and the brass, silver and gold, <lb/>
            Can any dare affirm he found them out <lb/>
            Before me ? None, I know ! unless he choose <lb/>
            To lie in his vaunt. In one word learn the whole- <lb/>
            That all arts came to mortals from Prometheus.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Give mortals now no inexpedient help, <lb/>

            Neglecting thine own sorrow ? I have hope still <lb/>
            To see thee, breaking from the fetter here, <lb/>
            Stand up as strong as Zeus.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. This ends not thus, <lb/>
            The oracular fate ordains. I must be bowed <lb/>
            By infinite woes and pangs to escape this chain. <lb/>
            Necessity is stronger than mine art.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Who holds the helm of that Necessity?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. The threefold Fates and the unforgetting <lb/>
            Furies.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Is Zeus less absolute than these are ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Yea, <lb/>
            And therefore can not fly what is ordained.</p>
          <p>Chorus. What is ordained for Zeus, except to be <lb/>
            A king forever?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. 'Tis too early yet <lb/>
            For thee to learn it: ask no more.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Perhaps <lb/>
            Thy secret may be something holy ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Turn <lb/>
            To another matter: this, it is not time <lb/>
            To speak abroad, but utterly to veil <lb/>
            In silence. For by that same secret kept, <lb/>
            I 'scape this chain's dishonour, and its woe.</p>

            No riddle upon my lips, but such straight words <lb/>

            Thou seest Prometheus, who gave mortals fire.</p>
          <p>Io. 0 common help of all men, known of all, <lb/>
            O miserable Prometheus, for what cause <lb/>
            Dost thou endure thus?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I have done with wail <lb/>
            For my own griefs but lately.</p>
          <p>10. Wilt thou not <lb/>
            Vouchsafe the boon to me?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Say what thou wilt, <lb/>
            For I vouchsafe all.</p>
          <p>Io. Speak, then, and reveal <lb/>
            Who shut thee in this chasm.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. The will of Zeus, <lb/>
            The hand of his Hephaestus.</p>
          <p>Io. And what crime <lb/>
            Dost expiate so ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Enough for thee I have told <lb/>
            In so much only.</p>
          <p>10. Nay, but show besides <lb/>
            The limit of my wandering, and the time <lb/>
            Which yet is lacking to fulfil my grief.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Why, not to know were better than to <lb/>
            know <lb/>
            For such as thou.</p>
          <p>10. Beseech thee, blind me not <lb/>
            To that which I must suffer.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. If I do, <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            The reason is not that I grudge a boon.</p>
          <p>A?. What reason, then, prevents thy speaking out?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. No grudging, but a fear to break thine <lb/>
            heart.</p>
          <p>Io. Less care for me, I pray thee. Certainty <lb/>
            I count for advantage.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Thou wilt have it so, <lb/>
            And therefore I must speak. Now hear-</p>
          <p>Chorus. Not yet. <lb/>
            Give half the guerdon my way. Let us learn <lb/>
            First what the curse is that befell the maid, <lb/>
            Her own voice telling her own wasting woes : <lb/>
            The sequence of that anguish shall await <lb/>
            The teaching of thy lips.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. It cloth behoove <lb/>
            That thou, maid Io, shouldst vouchsafe to these <lb/>
            The grace they pray-the more, because they are called <lb/>
            Thy father's sisters ; since to open out <lb/>
            And mourn out grief, where it is possible <lb/>
            To draw a tear from the audience, is a work <lb/>
            That pays its own price well.</p>
          <p>10. I can not choose <lb/>
            But trust you, nymphs, and tell you all ye ask, <lb/>
            In clear words, though I sob amid my speech <lb/>
            In speaking of the storm-curse sent from Zeus, <lb/>
            And of my beauty, from which height it took <lb/>
            Its swoop on me, poor wretch ! left thus deformed <lb/>
            And monstrous to your eyes. For evermore <lb/>
            Around my virgin-chamber, wandering went <lb/>
            The nightly visions which entreated me <lb/>
            With syllabled smooth sweetness : " Blessed maid, <lb/>
            Why lengthen out thy maiden hours, when fate <lb/>
            Permits the noblest spousal in the world ? <lb/>
            When Zeus burns with the arrow of thy love, <lb/>
            And fain would touch thy beauty ? Maiden, thou <lb/>
            Despise not Zeus! depart to Lerné's mead <lb/>
            That's green around thy father's flocks and stalls, <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            Until the passion of the heavenly Eye <lb/>
            Be quenched in sight." Such dreams did all night long <lb/>
            Constrain me—me, unhappy !-till I dared <lb/>
            To tell my father how they trod the dark <lb/>
            With visionary steps. Whereat he sent <lb/>
            His frequent heralds to the Pythian fane, <lb/>
            And also to Dodona, and inquired <lb/>
            How best, by act or speech, to please the gods. <lb/>
            The same returning brought back oracles <lb/>
            Of doubtful sense, indefinite response, <lb/>
            Dark to interpret; but at last there came <lb/>
            To Inachus an answer that was clear, <lb/>
            Thrown straight as any bolt, and spoken out- <lb/>
            This: " He should drive me from my home and land, <lb/>
            And bid me wander to the extreme verge <lb/>
            Of all the earth ; or, if he willed it not, <lb/>
            Should have a thunder with a fiery eye <lb/>
            Leap straight from Zeus to burn up all his race <lb/>
            To the last root of it." By which Loxian word <lb/>
            Subdued, he drove me forth, and shut me out, <lb/>
            He loath, me loath ; but Zeus's violent bit <lb/>
            Compelled him to the deed: when instantly <lb/>
            My body and soul were changed and distraught, <lb/>
            And, hornèd as ye see, and spurred along <lb/>
            By the fanged insect, with a maniac leap <lb/>
            I rushed on to Cenchrea's limpid stream, <lb/>
            And Lern6's fountain-water. There, the earth-born, <lb/>
            The herdsman Argus, most immitigable <lb/>
            Of wrath, did find me out, and track me out <lb/>
            With countless eyes set staring at my steps; <lb/>
            And though an unexpected sudden doom <lb/>
            Drew him from life, I, curse-tormented still, <lb/>
            Am driven from land to land before the scourge <lb/>
            The gods hold o'er me. So thou hast heard the past; <lb/>
            And, if a bitter future thou canst tell, <lb/>
            Speak on. I charge thee, do not flatter me, <lb/>
            Through pity, with .false words; for in my mind <lb/>
            Deceiving works more shame than torturing doth.</p><pb n="30"/>

            Depart that country. On the left hand dwell <lb/>
            The iron<unclear/> orkers, called the Chalybes, <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            Of whom beware, for certes they are uncouth, <lb/>
            And nowise bland to strangers. Reaching so <lb/>
            The stream Hybristes (well the scorner called), <lb/>
            Attempt no passage-it is hard to pass- <lb/>
            Or ere thou come to Caucasus itself, <lb/>
            That highest of mountains, where the river leaps <lb/>
            The precipice in his strength. Thou must toil up <lb/>
            Those mountain-tops that neighbour with the stars, <lb/>
            And tread the south way, and draw near, at last, <lb/>
            The Amazonian host that hateth man, <lb/>
            Inhabitants of Themiscyra, close <lb/>
            Upon Thermodon, where the sea's rough jaw <lb/>
            Doth gnash at Salmydessa, and provide <lb/>
            A cruel host to seamen, and to ships <lb/>
            A stepdame. They, with unreluctant hand, <lb/>
            Shall lead thee on and on till thou arrive <lb/>
            Just where the ocean-gates show narrowest <lb/>
            On the Cimmerian isthmus. Leaving which, <lb/>
            Behooves thee swim with fortitude of soul <lb/>
            The strait Mæotis. Ay, and evermore <lb/>
            That traverse shall be famous on men's lips, <lb/>
            That strait called Bosporus, the horned one's road, <lb/>
            So named because of thee, who so wilt pass <lb/>
            From Europe's plain to Asia's continent. <lb/>
            How think ye, nymphs ? the king of gods appears <lb/>
            Impartial in ferocious deeds? Behold ! <lb/>
            The god desirous of this mortal's love <lb/>
            Hath cursed her with these wanderings. Ah, fair child, <lb/>
            Thou hast met a bitter groom for bridal troth ! <lb/>
            For all thou yet hast heard can only prove <lb/>
            The incompleted prelude of thy doom.</p>
          <p>Io. Ah, ah !</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Is't thy turn now to shriek and moan ? <lb/>
            How wilt thou, when thou hast hearkened what remains?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Besides the grief thou hast told, can aught <lb/>
            remain?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. A sea of foredoomed evil worked to storm.</p><pb n="32"/>
            
          <p>Io. What boots my life, then ? why not cast myself <lb/>
            Down headlong from this miserable rock, <lb/>
            That, dashed against the flats, I may redeem <lb/>
            My soul from sorrow ? Better once to die <lb/>
            Than day by day to suffer.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Verily, <lb/>
            It would be hard for thee to bear my woe <lb/>
            For whom it is appointed not to die. <lb/>
            Death frees from woe; but I before me see <lb/>
            In all my far prevision not a bound <lb/>
            To all I suffer, ere that Zeus shall fall <lb/>
            From being a king.</p>
          <p>Io. And can it ever be <lb/>
            That Zeus shall fall from empire ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Thou, methinks, <lb/>
            Wouldst take some joy to see it.</p>
          <p>Io. Could I choose? <lb/>
            I who endure such pangs now, by that god!</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Learn from me, therefore, that the event <lb/>
            shall be.</p>
          <p>Io. By whom shall his imperial sceptred hand <lb/>
            Be emptied so ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Himself shall spoil himself, <lb/>
            Through his idiotic counsels.</p>
          <p>Io. How? declare, <lb/>
            Unless the word bring evil.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. He shall wed, <lb/>
            And in the marriage-bond be joined to grief.</p>
          <p>Io. A heavenly bride, or human ? Speak it out, <lb/>
            If it be utterable.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Why should I say which? <lb/>
            It ought not to be uttered, verily.</p>
          <p>Io. Then <lb/>
            It is his wife shall tear him from his throne ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. It is his wife shall bear a son to him <lb/>
            More mighty than the father.</p>
          <p>Io. <lb/>
            From this doom <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            Hath he no refuge ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. None : or ere that I <lb/>
            Loosed from these fetters­</p>
          <p>Io. Yea: but who shall loose <lb/>
            While Zeus is adverse?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. One who is born of thee: <lb/>
            It is ordained so.</p>
          <p>Io.What is this thou sayest? <lb/>
            A son of mine shall liberate thee from woe ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. After ten generations count three more, <lb/>
            And find him in the third.</p>
          <p>Io. The oracle <lb/>
            Remains obscure.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. And search it not to learn <lb/>
            Thine own griefs from it.</p>
          <p>Io. Point me not to. a good <lb/>
            To leave me straight bereaved.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I am prepared <lb/>
            To grant thee one of two things.</p>
          <p>I Io. But which two? <lb/>
            Set them before me; grant me power to choose.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I grant it; choose now! Shall I name <lb/>
            aloud <lb/>
            What griefs remain to wound thee, or what hand <lb/>
            Shall save me out of mine ?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Vouchsafe, 0 god, <lb/>
            The one grace of the twain to her who prays, <lb/>
            The next to me, and turn back neither prayer <lb/>
            Dishonoured by denial. To herself <lb/>
            Recount the future wandering of her feet; <lb/>
            Then point me to the looser of thy chain, <lb/>
            Because I yearn to know him.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Since ye will, <lb/>
            Of absolute will, this knowledge, I will set <lb/>
            No contrary against it, nor keep back <lb/>
            A word of all ye ask for. Io, first <lb/>
            To thee I must relate thy wandering course <note type="footnote"> 3 </note> <lb/>

            Far winding. As I tell it, write it down <lb/>
            In thy soul's book of memories. When thou hast passed <lb/>
            The refluent bound that parts two continents, <lb/>
            Track on the footsteps of the orient sun <lb/>
            In his own fire across the roar of seas- <lb/>
            Fly till thou hast reached the Gorgonæan flats <lb/>
            Beside Cisthen6. There the Phorcides, <lb/>
            Three ancient maidens, live, with shape of swan, <lb/>
            One tooth between them, and one common eye, <lb/>
            On whom the sun doth never look at all <lb/>
            With all his rays, nor evermore the moon <lb/>
            When she looks through the night. Anear to whom <lb/>
            Are the Gorgon sisters three, enclothed with wings, <lb/>
            With twisted snakes for ringlets, man-abhorred: <lb/>
            There is no mortal gazes in their face, <lb/>
            And gazing can breathe on. I speak of such <lb/>
            To guard thee from their horror. Ay, and list <lb/>
            Another tale of a dreadful sight: beware <lb/>
            The Griffins, those unbarking dogs of Zeus, <lb/>
            Those sharp-mouthed dogs !-and the Arimaspian host <lb/>
            Of one-eyed horsemen, habiting beside <lb/>
            The river of Pluto that runs bright with gold: <lb/>
            Approach them not, beseech thee. Presently <lb/>
            Thou'lt come to a distant land, a dusky tribe <lb/>
            Of dwellers at the fountain of the Sun, <lb/>
            Whence flows the River Æthiops; wind along <lb/>
            Its banks, and turn off at the cataracts, <lb/>
            Just as the Nile pours from the Bybline hills <lb/>
            His holy and sweet wave : his course shall guide <lb/>
            Thine own to that triangular Nile-ground <lb/>
            Where, Io, is ordained for thee and thine <lb/>
            A lengthened exile. Have I said in this <lb/>
            Aught darkly or incompletely ?-now repeat <lb/>
            The question, make the knowledge fuller! Lo, <lb/>
            I have more leisure than I covet here.</p>
          <p>Chorus. If thou canst tell us aught that's left untold, <lb/>
            Or loosely told, of her most dreary flight, <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            Declare it straight; but, if thou hast uttered all, <lb/>
            Grant us that latter grace for which we prayed, <lb/>
            Remembering how we prayed it.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. She has heard <lb/>
            The uttermost of her wandering. There it ends. <lb/>
            But, that she may be certain not to have heard <lb/>
            All vainly, I will speak what she endured <lb/>
            Ere coming hither, and invoke the past <lb/>
            To prove my prescience true. And so-to leave <lb/>
            A multitude of words, and pass at once <lb/>
            To the subject of thy course-when thou hadst gone <lb/>
            To those Molossian plains which sweep around <lb/>
            Dodona shouldering Heaven, whereby the fane <lb/>
            Of Zeus Thesprotian keepeth oracle, <lb/>
            And, wonder past belief, where oaks do wave <lb/>
            Articulate adjurations—(ay, the same <lb/>
            Saluted thee in no perplexed phrase, <lb/>
            But clear with glory, noble wife of Zeus <lb/>
            That shouldst be, there some sweetness took thy sense !) <lb/>
            Thou didst rush farther onward, stung along <lb/>
            The ocean-shore, toward Rhea's mighty bay, <lb/>
            And, tossed back from it, wast tossed to it again <lb/>
            In stormy evolution: and know well, <lb/>
            In coming time that hollow of the sea <lb/>
            Shall bear the name Ionian, and present <lb/>
            A monument of lo's passage through, <lb/>
            Unto all mortals. Be these words the signs <lb/>
            Of my soul's power to look beyond the veil <lb/>
            Of visible things. The rest to you and her <lb/>
            I will declare in common audience, nymphs, <lb/>
            Returning thither where my speech brake off. <lb/>
            There is a town, Canobus, built upon <lb/>
            The earth's fair margin, at the mouth of the Nile, <lb/>
            And on the mound washed up by it: Io, there <lb/>
            Shall Zeus give back to thee thy perfect mind, <lb/>
            And only by the pressure and the touch <lb/>
            Of a hand not terrible; and thou to Zeus <lb/>

            Shalt bear a dusky son who shall be called <lb/>
            Thence Epaphus, Touched. That son shall pluck the fruit <lb/>
            Of all that land wide-watered by the flow <lb/>
            Of Nile ; but after him, when counting out <lb/>
            As far as the fifth full generation, then <lb/>
            Full fifty maidens, a fair woman-race, <lb/>
            Shall back to Argos turn reluctantly, <lb/>
            To fly the proffered nuptials of their kin, <lb/>
            Their father's brothers. These being passion-struck, <lb/>
            Like falcons bearing hard on flying doves, <lb/>
            Shall follow hunting at a quarry of love <lb/>
            They should not hunt; till envious Heaven maintain <lb/>
            A curse betwixt that beauty and their desire, <lb/>
            And Greece receive them, to be overcome <lb/>
            In murtherous woman-war by fierce red hands <lb/>
            Kept savage by the night. For every wife <lb/>
            Shall slay a husband, dyeing deep in blood <lb/>
            The sword of a double edge—(I wish indeed <lb/>
            As fair a marriage-joy to all my foes!) <lb/>
            One bride alone shall fail to smite to death <lb/>
            The head upon her pillow, touched with love <lb/>
            Made impotent of purpose, and impelled <lb/>
            To choose the lesser evil-shame on her cheeks, <lb/>
            Than blood-guilt on her hands; which bride shall bear <lb/>
            A royal race in Argos. Tedious speech <lb/>
            Were needed to relate particulars <lb/>
            Of these things; 'tis enough that from her seed <lb/>
            Shall spring the strong He, famous with the bow, <lb/>
            Whose arm shall break my fetters off. Behold, <lb/>
            My mother Themis, that old Titaness, <lb/>
            Delivered to me such an oracle; <lb/>

            And my eyes like the wheels of a chariot roll round! <lb/>
            I am whirled from my course, to the east, to the west, <lb/>

            And my mouth is unbridled for anguish and hate, <lb/>
            And my words beat in vain, in wild storms of unrest, <lb/>

          <p>Prometheus. Why, let him do it! I am here, prepared <lb/>
            For all things and their pangs.</p>
          <p>Chorus. The wise are they <lb/>
            Who reverence Adrasteia.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Reverence thou, <lb/>
            Adore thou, flatter thou, whomever reigns, <lb/>
            Whenever reigning ! But for me, your Zeus <lb/>
            Is less than nothing. Let him act and reign <lb/>
            His brief hour out according to his will: <lb/>
            He will not, therefore, rule the gods too long. <lb/>
            But lo! I see that courier-god of Zeus, <lb/>
            That new-made menial of the new-crowned king: <lb/>
            He; doubtless, comes to announce to us something new.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">HERMES enters</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Hermes. I speak to thee, the sophist, the talker-down <lb/>
            Of scorn by scorn, the sinner against gods, <lb/>
            The reverencer of men, the thief of fire— <lb/>
            I speak to thee and adjure thee: Zeus requires <lb/>
            Thy declaration of what marriage-rite <lb/>
            Thus moves thy vaunt, and shall hereafter cause <lb/>
            His fall from empire. Do not wrap thy speech <lb/>
            In riddles, but speak clearly. Never cast <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            Ambiguous paths, Prometheus, for my feet, <lb/>
            Since Zeus, thou mayst perceive, is scarcely won <lb/>
            To mercy by such means.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. A speech well-mouthed <lb/>
            In the utterance, and full-minded in the sense, <lb/>
            As doth befit a servant of the gods! <lb/>
            New gods, ye newly reign, and think, forsooth, <lb/>
            Ye dwell in towers too high for any dart <lb/>
            To carry a wound there! Have I not stood by <lb/>
            While two kings fell from thence? and shall I not <lb/>
            Behold the third, the same who rules you now, <lb/>
            Fall, shamed to sudden ruin? Do I seem <lb/>
            To tremble and quail before your modern gods? <lb/>
            Far be it from me ! For thyself depart; <lb/>
            Retread thy steps in haste. To all thou hast asked <lb/>
            I answer nothing.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Such a wind of pride <lb/>
            Impelled thee of yore full sail upon these rocks.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I would not barter-learn thou soothly <lb/>
            that !- <lb/>
            My suffering for thy service. I maintain <lb/>
            It is a nobler thing to serve these rocks <lb/>
            Than live a faithful slave to Father Zeus. <lb/>
            Thus upon scorners I retort their scorn.</p>
          <p>Hermes. It seems that thou dost glory in thy despair.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I glory ? Would my foes did glory so, <lb/>
            And I stood by to see them !-naming whom, <lb/>
            Thou art not unremembered.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Dost thou charge <lb/>
            Me also with the blame of thy mischance ?</p>
          <p>Prometheus. I tell thee I loathe the universal gods, <lb/>
            Who, for the good I gave them, rendered back <lb/>
            The ill of their injustice.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Thou art mad, <lb/>
            Thou art raving, Titan, at the fever-height.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. If it be madness to abhor my foes, <lb/>
            May I be mad !</p><pb n="41"/>
            
          <p>Hermes. If thou wert prosperous, <lb/>
            Thou wouldst be unendurable.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Alas!</p>
          <p>Hermes. Zeus knows not that word.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. But maturing Time <lb/>
            Teaches all things.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Howbeit, thou hast not learned <lb/>
            The wisdom yet, thou needest.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. If I had, <lb/>
            I should not talk thus with a slave like thee.</p>
          <p>Hermes. No answer thou vouchsafes!, I believe, <lb/>
            To the great Sire's requirement.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Verily <lb/>
            I owe him grateful service, and should pay it.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Why, thou dost mock me, Titan, as I stood <lb/>
            A child before thy face.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. No child, forsooth, <lb/>
            But yet more foolish than a foolish child, <lb/>
            If thou expect that I should answer aught <lb/>
            Thy Zeus can ask. No torture from his hand, <lb/>
            Nor any machination in the world, <lb/>
            Shall force mine utterance ere he loose, himself, <lb/>
            These cankerous fetters from me. For the rest, <lb/>
            Let him now hurl his blanching lightnings down, <lb/>
            And with his white-winged snows, and mutterings deep <lb/>
            Of subterranean thunders, mix all things, <lb/>
            Confound them in disorder. None of this <lb/>
            Shall bend my sturdy will, and make me speak <lb/>
            The name of his dethroner who shall come.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Can this avail thee ? Look to it!</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Long ago <lb/>
            It was looked forward to, precounselled of.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Vain god, take righteous courage ! Dare for <lb/>
            once <lb/>
            To apprehend and front thine agonies <lb/>
            With a just prudence.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Vainly dost thou chafe <note type="footnote"> 3 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            My soul with exhortation, as yonder sea <lb/>
            Goes beating on the rock. Oh ! think no more <lb/>
            That I, fear-struck by Zeus to a woman's mind. <lb/>
            Will supplicate him, loathed as he is, <lb/>
            With feminine upliftings of my hands, <lb/>
            To break these chains. Far from me be the thought!</p>
          <p>Hermes. I have, indeed, methinks, said much in vain, <lb/>
            For still thy heart beneath my showers of prayers <lb/>
            Lies dry and hard, nay, leaps like a young horse <lb/>
            Who bites against the new bit in his teeth, <lb/>
            And tugs and struggles against the new-tried rein, <lb/>
            Still fiercest in the feeblest thing of all, <lb/>
            Which sophism is ; since absolute will disjoined <lb/>
            From perfect mind is worse than weak. Behold, <lb/>
            Unless my words persuade thee, what a blast <lb/>
            And whirlwind of inevitable woe <lb/>
            Must sweep persuasion through thee ! For at first <lb/>
            The Father will split up this jut of rock <lb/>
            With the great thunder and the bolted flame, <lb/>
            And hide thy body where a hinge of stone <lb/>
            Shall catch it like an arm ; and when thou hast passed <lb/>
            A long black time within, thou shalt come out <lb/>
            To front the sun while Zeus's wingèd hound, <lb/>
            The strong, carnivorous eagle, shall wheel down <lb/>
            To meet thee, self-called to a daily feast, <lb/>
            And set his fierce beak in thee, and tear off <lb/>
            The long rags of thy flesh, and batten deep <lb/>
            Upon thy dusky liver. Do not look <lb/>
            For any end, moreover, to this curse, <lb/>
            Or ere some god appear to accept thy pangs <lb/>
            On his own head vicarious, and descend <lb/>
            With unreluctant step the darks of hell <lb/>
            And gloomy abysses around Tartarus. <lb/>
            Then ponder this-this threat is not a growth <lb/>
            Of vain invention ; it is spoken and meant: <lb/>
            King Zeus's mouth is impotent to lie, <lb/>
            Consummating the utterance by the act. <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            So, look to it, thou ! take heed, and nevermore <lb/>
            Forget good counsel to indulge self-will.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Our Hermes suits his reasons to the times, <lb/>
            At least I think so, since he bids thee drop <lb/>
            Self-will for prudent counsel. Yield to him ! <lb/>
            When the wise err, their wisdom makes their shame.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Unto me the foreknower, this mandate of <lb/>
            power <lb/>
            He cries, to reveal it. <lb/>
            What's strange in my fate, if I suffer from hate <lb/>
            At the hour that I feel it ? <lb/>
            Let the locks of the lightning, all bristling and whitening, <lb/>
            Flash, coiling me round, <lb/>
            While the ether goes surging 'neath thunder and <lb/>
            scourging <lb/>
            Of wild winds unbound ! <lb/>
            Let the blast of the firmament whirl from its place <lb/>
            The earth rooted below, <lb/>
            And the brine of the ocean, in rapid emotion, <lb/>
            Be driven in the face <lb/>
            Of the stars up in heaven, as they walk to and fro ! <lb/>
            Let him hurl me anon into Tartarus—on— <lb/>
            To the blackest degree, <lb/>
            With Necessity's vortices strangling me down ! <lb/>
            But he can not join death to a fate,meant for me!</p>
          <p>Hermes. Why, the words that he speaks and the <lb/>
            thoughts that he thinks <lb/>
            Are maniacal !-add, <lb/>
            If the Fate who hath bound him should loose not the links, <lb/>
            He were utterly mad. <lb/>
            Then depart ye who groan with him, <lb/>
            Leaving to moan with him ; <lb/>
            Go in haste ! lest the roar of the thunder anearing <lb/>
            Should blast you to idiocy, living and hearing.</p>
          <p>j Chorus. Change thy speech for another, thy thought <lb/>
            for a new, <lb/>
            If to move me and teach me indeed be thy care ; <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            For thy words swerve so far from the loyal and true <lb/>
            That the thunder of Zeus seems more easy to bear. <lb/>
            How ! couldst teach me to venture such vileness ? behold ! <lb/>
            I choose with this victim this anguish foretold! <lb/>
            I recoil from the traitor in haste and disdain, <lb/>
            And I know that the curse of the treason is worse <lb/>
            Than the pang of the chain.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Then remember, 0 nymphs, what I tell you <lb/>
            before, <lb/>
            Nor, when pierced by the arrows that At6 will throw <lb/>
            you, <lb/>
            Cast blame on your fate, and declare evermore <lb/>
            That Zeus thrust you on anguish he did not foreshow <lb/>
            you. <lb/>
            Nay, verily, nay! for ye perish anon <lb/>
            For your deed, by your choice. By no blindness of <lb/>
            doubt, <lb/>
            No abruptness of doom, but by madness alone, <lb/>
            In the great net of Até, whence none cometh out, <lb/>
            Ye are wound and undone.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. Ay ! in act now, in word now no more, <lb/>
            Earth is rocking in space. <lb/>
            And the thunders crash up with a roar upon roar, <lb/>
            And the eddying lightnings flash fire in my face, <lb/>
            And the whirlwinds are whirling the dust round and <lb/>
            round, <lb/>
            And the blasts of the winds universal leap free, <lb/>
            And blow each upon each with a passion of sound, <lb/>
            And ether goes mingling in storm with the sea. <lb/>
            Such a curse on my head, in a manifest dread, <lb/>
            From the hand of your Zeus has been hurtled along. <lb/>
            Oh, my mother's fair glory ! O Æther, enringing <lb/>
            All eyes with the sweet common light of thy bringing! <lb/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE WATCHMAN. Ye fav'ring gods, relieve me <lb/>
            from this toil: <lb/>
            Fixed, as a dog, on Agamemnon's roof</p>
          <p>I watch the livelong year, observing hence <lb/>
            The host of stars, that in the spangled skies <lb/>
            Take their bright stations, and to mortals bring <lb/>
            Winter and summer; radiant rulers, when <lb/>
            They set, or rising, glitter through the night. <lb/>
            Here now I watch, if haply I may see <lb/>
            The blazing torch, whose flame brings news from Troy, <lb/>
            The signal of its ruin: these high hopes <lb/>
            My royal mistress, thinking on her lord, <lb/>
            Feeds in her heart. Meanwhile the dews of night <lb/>
            Fall on my couch, unvisited by dreams; <lb/>
            For fear, lest sleep should close my eyes, repels <lb/>
            The soft intruder. When my spirits prompt me <lb/>
            To raise the song, or hum the sullen notes <lb/>
            Preventing slumber, then I sigh, and wail <lb/>
            The state of this unhappy house, no more <lb/>
            Well-ordered as of old. But may my toils <lb/>
            Be happily relieved ! Blaze, thou bright flame, <lb/>
            Herald of joy, blaze through the gloomy shades- <lb/>
            And it does blaze. Hail, thou auspicious flame, <lb/>
            That streaming through the night denounces! joy, <lb/>
            Welcomed with many a festal dance in Argos! <lb/>
            In the queen's ear I'll holloa this, and rouse her <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            From her soft couch with speed, that she may teach <lb/>
            The royal dome to echo with the strains <lb/>
            Of choral warblings greeting this blest fire, <lb/>
            Bright sign that Troy is taken. Nor shall I <lb/>
            Forbear the prelude to the dance before her: <lb/>
            For by this watch, so prosperously concluded, <lb/>
            I to my masters shall assure good fortune. <lb/>
            Shall I then see my king returned, once more <lb/>
            To grace this house? and shall this hand once more <lb/>
            Hang on his friendly hand ? I could unfold <lb/>
            A tale. But, hush ; my tongue is chained : these walls, <lb/>
            Could they but speak, would make discoveries. <lb/>
            There are who know this ; and to them this hint <lb/>
            Were plain: to those that know it not, mysterious.</p>
          <p>Chorus. The tenth slow year rolls on, since great in <lb/>
            arms <lb/>
            The noble sons of Atreus, each exalted <lb/>
            To majesty and empire, royal brothers, <lb/>
            Led hence a thousand ships, the Arrive fleet, <lb/>
            Big with the fate of Priam and of Troy; <lb/>
            A warlike preparation ; their bold breasts <lb/>
            Breathing heroic ardour to high deeds; <lb/>
            Like vultures, which, their unplumed offspring lost, <lb/>
            Whirl many a rapid flight, for that their toil <lb/>
            To guard their young was vain : till some high power, <lb/>
            For they are dear to Phœbus, dear to Pan, <lb/>
            And Jove with pity hears their shrill-voiced grief, <lb/>
            And sends, though late, the fury to avenge <lb/>
            Their plundered nests on the unpitying spoilers. <lb/>
            So now the power of hospitable Jove <lb/>
            Arms against Paris, for th' oft-wedded dame, <lb/>
            The sons of Atreus, bent to plunge the hosts <lb/>
            Of Greece and Troy in all the toils, that sink <lb/>
            The body down, the firm knee bowed in dust, <lb/>
            And the strong spear, ere conquest crowns their helms, <lb/>
            Shivered in battle. These are what they are, <lb/>
            And fate directs th' event: nor the bent knee, <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            Libation pure, or supplicating tear, <lb/>
            Can soothe the stern rage of those merciless powers <lb/>
            In whose cold shrine no hallowed flame ascends. <lb/>
            But we, our age-enfeebled limbs unfit <lb/>
            For martial toils, inglorious here remain, <lb/>
            The staff supporting our weak steps, like children : <lb/>
            For as the infant years have not attained <lb/>
            The military vigour, withered age <lb/>
            Crawls through the streets like helpless infancy, <lb/>
            And passes as a day-dream. But what tidings, <lb/>
            What circumstances of fair event hath reached <lb/>
            Thy royal ears, daughter of Tyndarus, <lb/>
            Inducing thee to send the victims round ? <lb/>
            The shrines of all the gods, whose guardian cares <lb/>
            Watch o'er this state, be they enthroned in heaven, <lb/>
            Or rule beneath the earth, blaze with thy presents; <lb/>
            And from th' imperial dome a lengthened line <lb/>
            Of torches shoot their lustre to the skies. <lb/>
            O tell me what is fit for me to know, <lb/>
            And prudence suffers to be told : speak peace <lb/>
            To this anxiety, which one while swells <lb/>

            From the fierce toils of war, who through the gloom <lb/>
            Of night ranged wide, fly on the spoils, as chance, <lb/>
            Not order, leads them ; in the Trojan houses, <lb/>
            Won by their spears, they walk at large, relieved <lb/>
            From the cold dews dropped from th' unsheltered sky; <lb/>
            And at th' approach of eve, like those whose power <lb/>
            Commands security, the easy night <lb/>
            Shall sleep unguarded. If with hallowed rites <lb/>

            Their glories by no rude mischance depressed, <lb/>
            To cull from many blessings the most precious.</p>
          <p>Chor. With manly sentiment thy wisdom, lady, <lb/>
            Speaks well. Confiding in thy suasive signs, <lb/>

            This one I save; saved from despair e'en this; <lb/>

            To share in death the portion of a tomb. <lb/>
            Hail then, loved earth; hail, thou bright sun; and thou, <lb/>
            Great guardian of my country, supreme Jove; <lb/>
            Thou, Pythian king, thy shafts no longer winged <lb/>
            For our destruction ; on Scamander's banks <lb/>
            Enough we mourned thy wrath; propitious now <lb/>
            Come, King Apollo, our defence. And all <lb/>
            Ye gods, that o'er the works of war preside, <lb/>
            I now invoke ; thee, Mercury, my avenger, <lb/>

            The debt of justice for his thefts, his rapines, <lb/>

          <p>Her. Beyond the power of language have I felt it.</p>

          <p>Her. This of the army sayst thou, whose warm love <lb/>

            Through life's whole course an unmixed happiness? <lb/>

            Each irksome hour was loaded with fatigues. <lb/>
            Yet these were slight assays to those worse hardships <lb/>
            We suffered on the shore: our lodging near <lb/>
            The walls of the enemy, the dews of heaven <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            Fell on us from above, the damps beneath <lb/>
            From the moist marsh annoyed us, shrouded ill <lb/>
            In shaggy coverings. Or should one relate <lb/>
            The winters keen blasts, which from Ida's snows <lb/>
            Breathe frore, that, pierced through all their plumes, the <lb/>
            birds <lb/>
            Shiver and die ; or th'extreme heat that scalds, <lb/>
            When in his midday caves the sea reclines, <lb/>
            And not a breeze disturbs his calm repose. <lb/>
            But why lament these sufferings? They are past; <lb/>
            Past to the dead indeed ; they lie, no more <lb/>
            Anxious to rise. What then avails to count <lb/>
            Those whom the wasteful war hath swept away, <lb/>
            And with their loss afflict the living ? Rather <lb/>
            Bid we farewell to misery : in our scale, <lb/>
            Who haply of the Grecian host remain, <lb/>
            The good preponderates, and in counterpoise <lb/>
            Our loss is light; and, after all our toils <lb/>
            By sea and land, before yon golden sun <lb/>
            It is our glorious privilege to boast, <lb/>
            it At length from vanquished Troy our warlike troops <lb/>
            Have to the gods of Greece brought home these spoils, <lb/>
            And in their temples, to record our conquests, <lb/>
            Fixed these proud trophies." Those that hear this boast <lb/>
            It well becomes to gratulate the state, <lb/>
            And the brave chiefs; revering Jove's high power <lb/>
            That grace our conquering arms. Thou hast my message.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thy words convince me; all my doubts are <lb/>
            vanished : <lb/>
            But scrupulous inquiry grows with age. <lb/>

            With the fond hope that Ilion's haughty towers <lb/>
            Were humbled in the dust. At this rebuke, <lb/>
            Though somewhat shaken, yet I sacrificed; <lb/>
            And, as weak woman wont, one voice of joy <lb/>
            Awoke another, till the city rang <lb/>
            Through all its streets ; and at the hallowed shrines <lb/>
            Each raised the pious strains of gratitude, <lb/>
            And fanned the altar's incense-breathing flame. <lb/>
            But it is needless to detain thee longer, <lb/>
            Soon from the king's own lips shall I learn all. <lb/>
            How best I may receive my honoured lord, <lb/>
            And grace his wished return, now claims my speed. <lb/>
            Can heaven's fair beam show a fond wife a sight <lb/>
            More grateful than her husband from his wars <lb/>
            Returned with glory, when she opes the gate, <lb/>
            And springs to welcome him ? Tell my lord this, <lb/>
            That he may hasten his desired return : <lb/>
            And tell him he will find his faithful wife, <lb/>
            Such as he left her, a domestic creature, <lb/>
            To him all fondness, to his enemies <lb/>
            Irreconcilable ; and tell him too <lb/>
            That ten long years have not effaced the seal <lb/>
            Of constancy ; that never knew I pleasure <lb/>
            In the blamed converse of another man, <lb/>
            More than the virgin metal in the mines <lb/>

          <p>Her. This high boast, lady, sanctified by truth, <lb/>
            Is not unseemly in thy princely rank.</p>

          <p>Chorus. This, for thy information, hath she spoken <lb/>
            With dignity and truth. Now tell me, herald, <lb/>
            Of Sparta's king wish I to question thee, <lb/>
            The pride of Greece : returns he safe with you ?</p>
          <p>Her. Never can I esteem a falsehood honest, <lb/>
            Though my friends long enjoy the sweet delusion.</p>
          <p>Chor. What then if thou relate an honest truth? <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            From this distinction the conjecture's easy.</p>
          <p>Her. Him from the Grecian fleet our eyes have lost, <lb/>
            The hero and his ship. This is the truth.</p>
          <p>Chor. Chanced this when in your sight he weighed <lb/>
            from Troy; <lb/>
            Or in a storm that rent him from the fleet ?</p>
          <p>Her. Rightly is thy conjecture aimed, in brief <lb/>
            Touching the long recital of our loss.</p>
          <p>Chor. How deemed the other mariners of this ; <lb/>
            That the ship perished or rode out the storm ?</p>
          <p>Her. Who, save yon sun, the regent of the earth, <lb/>
            Can give a clear and certain information ?</p>
          <p>Chor. How saidst thou then a storm, not without loss, <lb/>
            Winged with Heaven's fury, tossed the shattered fleet?</p>
          <p>Her. It is not meet, with inauspicious tongue <lb/>
            Spreading ill tidings, to profane a day <lb/>
            Sacred to festal joy : the gods require <lb/>
            Their pure rites undisturbed. When with a brow <lb/>
            Witness of woe, the messenger relates <lb/>
            Unwelcome news, defeats, and slaughtered armies, <lb/>
            The wound with general grief affects the state; <lb/>
            And with particular and private sorrow <lb/>
            Full many a house, for many that have fall'n <lb/>
            Victims to Mars, who to his bloody car <lb/>
            Delights to yoke his terrors, sword and spear. <lb/>
            A paean to the Furies would become <lb/>
            The bearer of such pond'rous heap of ills. <lb/>
            My tidings are of conquest and success, <lb/>
            Diffusing joy: with these glad sounds how mix <lb/>
            Distress, and speak of storm and angry gods? <lb/>
            The powers, before most hostile, now conspired, <lb/>
            Fire and the sea, in ruin reconciled: <lb/>
            And in a night of tempest wild from Thrace <lb/>
            In all their fury rushed the howling winds; <lb/>
            Tossed by the forceful blasts ship against ship <lb/>
            In hideous conflict dashed, or disappeared, <lb/>
            Driven at the boist'rous whirlwind's dreadful will; <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            1 <lb/>
            But when the sun's fair light returned, we see <lb/>
            Bodies of Grecians, and the wreck of ships <lb/>
            Float on the chafed foam of th' Ægean Sea. <lb/>
            Us and our ship some god, the power of man <lb/>
            Were all too weak holding the helm preserved <lb/>
            Unhurt, or interceding for our safety ; <lb/>
            And fortune, the deliverer, steered our course <lb/>
            To shun the waves, that near the harbour's mouth <lb/>
            Boil high, or break upon the rocky shore. <lb/>
            Escaped th' ingulfing sea, yet scarce secure <lb/>
            Of our escape, through the fair day we view <lb/>
            With sighs the recent sufferings of the host, <lb/>
            Cov'ring the sea with wrecks. If any breathe <lb/>
            This vital air, they deem us lost, as we <lb/>
            Think the same ruin theirs. Fair fall th' event! <lb/>
            But first and chief expect the Spartan king <lb/>
            T' arrive; if yet one ray of yon bright sun <lb/>
            Beholds him living, through the care of Jove, <lb/>
            Who wills not to destroy that royal race, <lb/>
            Well may we hope to joy in his return. <lb/>
            Having heard this, know thou hast heard the truth.</p>

          <p>To Troy the shining mischief came; <lb/>

            Grim-visaged Vengeance marks his prey, <lb/>
            Waiting the dreadful hour <lb/>
            The terrors of offended Heaven to pour <lb/>

            The rites of hospitable Jove profane; <lb/>
            Nor revered that sacred song, <lb/>
            Whose melting strains the bride's approach declare, <lb/>
            As Hymen wakes the rapture-breathing air. <lb/>
            Far other notes belong, <lb/>
            The voice of mirth now heard no more, <lb/>
            To Priam's state; its ruins o'er <lb/>
            Wailing instead, distress, and loud lament; <lb/>
            Long sorrows sprung from that unholy bed, <lb/>
            And many a curse in heart-felt anguish sent <lb/>
            On its woe-wedded Paris' hated head.</p>

          <p>The woodman, from his thirsty lair, <lb/>
            Reft of his dam, a lion bore; <lb/>
            Fostered his future foe with care <lb/>
            To mischiefs he must soon deplore: <lb/>
            Gentle and tame, while young, <lb/>
            Harmless he frisked the fondling babes among; <lb/>
            Oft in the father's bosom lay, <lb/>
            Oft licked his feeding hand in fawning play; <lb/>
            Till, conscious of his firmer age, <lb/>
            His lion-race the lordly savage shows; <lb/>
            No more his youth-protecting cottage knows, <lb/>

            While through his mangled folds the hapless swain <lb/>

          <p>To Ilion's towers in wanton state <lb/>
            With speed she wings her easy way; <lb/>

            And pant on the delighted sea. <lb/>
            Attendant on her side <lb/>
            The richest ornaments of splendid pride: <lb/>
            The darts, whose golden points inspire, <lb/>
            Shot from her eyes the flames of soft desire ; <lb/>

          <p>From ev'ry mouth we oft have heard <lb/>
            This saying, for its age revered: <lb/>
            “With joy we see our offspring rise, <lb/>
            And happy, who not childless dies: <lb/>
            But Fortune, when her flow'rets blow, <lb/>
            Oft bears the bitter fruit of woe." <lb/>
            Though these saws are as truths allowed, <lb/>
            Thus I dare differ from the crowd: <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            “One base deed, with prolific power, <lb/>
            Like its cursed stock engenders more: <lb/>
            But to the just, with blooming grace <lb/>
            Still flourishes, a beauteous race." <lb/>
            The old Injustice joys to breed <lb/>
            Her young, instinct with villanous deed ; <lb/>
            The young her destined hour will find <lb/>
            To rush in mischief on mankind: <lb/>
            She too in At6's murky cell, <lb/>
            Brings forth the hideous child of hell, <lb/>
            A burden to th' offended sky, <lb/>
            The power of bold impiety. <lb/>
            But Justice bids her ray divine <lb/>
            E'en on the low-roofed cottage shine; <lb/>
            And beams her glories on the life, <lb/>
            That knows not fraud, nor ruffian strife. <lb/>
            The gorgeous glare of gold, obtained <lb/>
            By foul polluted hands, disdained <lb/>
            She leaves, and with averted eyes <lb/>
            To humbler, holier mansions flies; <lb/>
            And looking through the times to come <lb/>
            Assigns each deed its righteous doom.</p>

          <p>Chorus. My royal lord, by whose victorious hand <lb/>
            The towers of Troy are fall'n, illustrious son <lb/>
            Of Atreus, with what words, what reverence <lb/>
            Shall I address thee, not t' o'erleap the bounds <lb/>
            Of modest duty, nor to sink beneath <lb/>
            An honourable welcome ? Some there are, <lb/>
            That form themselves to seem, more than to be, <lb/>
            Transgressing honesty: to him that feels <lb/>
            Misfortune's rugged hand, full many a tongue <lb/>
            Shall drop condolence, though th' unfeeling heart <lb/>
            Knows not the touch of sorrow ; these again <note type="footnote"> 4 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            In fortune's summer gale, with the like art, <lb/>
            Shall dress in forced smiles th' unwilling face: <lb/>
            But him the penetrating eye soon marks, <lb/>
            That in the seemly garb of honest zeal <lb/>
            Attempts to clothe his meagre blandishments. <lb/>
            When first in Helen's cause my royal lord <lb/>
            Levied his host, let me not hide the truth, <lb/>
            Notes, other than music, echoed wide <lb/>
            In loud complaints from such as deemed him rash, <lb/>
            And void of reason, by constraint to plant <lb/>
            In breast averse the martial soul, that glows <lb/>
            Despising death. But now their eager zeal <lb/>
            Streams friendly to those chiefs, whose prosperous valour <lb/>
            Is crowned with conquest. Soon then shalt thou learn, <lb/>
            As each supports the state, or strives to rend it <lb/>
            With faction, who reveres thy dignity.</p>
          <p>Aga. To Argos first, and to my country's gods, <lb/>
            I bow with reverence, by whose holy guidance <lb/>
            On Troy's proud towers I poured their righteous venge­ <lb/>
            ance, <lb/>
            And now revisit safe my native soil. <lb/>
            No loud-tongued pleader heard, they judged the cause, <lb/>
            And in the bloody urn, without one vote <lb/>
            Dissentient, cast the lots that fixed the fate <lb/>
            Of Ilion and its sons: the other vase <lb/>
            Left empty, save of widowed hope. The smoke, <lb/>
            Rolling in dusky wreaths, shows that the town <lb/>
            Is fall'n; the fiery storm yet lives, and high <lb/>
            The dying ashes toss rich clouds of wealth <lb/>
            Consumed. For this behooves us to the gods <lb/>
            Render our grateful thanks, and that they spread <lb/>
            The net of fate sweeping with angry ruin. <lb/>
            In beauty's cause the Argive monster reared <lb/>
            Its bulk enormous, to th' affrighted town <lb/>
            Portending devastation ; in its womb <lb/>
            Hiding embattled hosts, rushed furious forth, <lb/>
            About the setting of the Pleiades, <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            And, as a lion rav'ning for its prey, <lb/>
            Ramped o'er their walls, and lapped the blood of kings. <lb/>
            This to the gods addressed, I turn me now <lb/>
            Attentive to thy caution: I approve <lb/>
            Thy just remark, and with my voice confirm it. <lb/>
            Few have the fortitude of soul to honour <lb/>
            A friend's success, without a touch of envy ; <lb/>
            For that malignant passion to the heart <lb/>
            Cleaves close, and with a double burden loads <lb/>
            The man infected with it; first he feels <lb/>
            In all their weight his own calamities, <lb/>
            Then sighs to see the happiness of others. <lb/>
            This of my own experience have I learned ; <lb/>
            And this I know, that many, who in public <lb/>
            Have borne the semblance of my firmest friends, <lb/>
            Are but the flatt'ring image of a shadow <lb/>
            Reflected from a mirror; save Ulysses <lb/>
            Alone, who, though averse to join our arms, <lb/>
            Yoked in his martial harness from my side <lb/>
            Swerved not; living or dead be this his praise. <lb/>
            But what concerns our kingdom and the gods, <lb/>
            Holding a general council of the state, <lb/>
            We will consult; that what is well may keep <lb/>
            Its goodness permanent, and what requires <lb/>
            Our healing hand, with mild severity <lb/>
            May be corrected. But my royal roof <lb/>
            Now will I visit, and before its hearths <lb/>
            Offer libations to the gods, who sent me <lb/>
            To this far-distant war, and led me back. <lb/>
            Firm stands the victory that attends our arms.</p>

          <p>Clytemnestra. Friends, fellow-citizens, whose counsels <lb/>
            guide <lb/>
            The state of Argos, in your reverend presence <lb/>
            A wife's fond love I blush not to disclose : <lb/>
            Thus habit softens dread. From my full heart <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            Will I recount my melancholy life <lb/>
            Through the long stay of my loved lord at Troy: <lb/>
            For a weak woman, in her husband's absence, <lb/>
            Pensive to sit and lonely in her house, <lb/>
            'Tis dismal, list'ning to each frightful tale: <lb/>
            First one alarms her, then another comes <lb/>
            Charged with worse tidings. Had my poor lord here <lb/>
            Suffered as many wounds as common fame <lb/>
            Reported, like a net he had been pierced ; <lb/>
            Had he been slain oft as the loud-tongued rumour <lb/>
            Was noised abroad, this triple-formed Geryon, <lb/>
            A second of the name, while yet alive, <lb/>
            For of the dead I speak not, well might boast <lb/>
            To have received his triple mail, to die <lb/>
            In each form singly. Such reports oppressed me, <lb/>
            Till life became distasteful, and my hands <lb/>
            Were prompted oft to deeds of desperation. <lb/>
            Nor is thy son Orestes, the dear tie <lb/>
            That binds us each to th' other, present here <lb/>
            To aid me, as he ought: nay, marvel not, <lb/>
            The friendly Strophius with a right strong arm <lb/>
            Protects him in Phocæa; while his care <lb/>
            Saw danger threat'me in a double form, <lb/>
            The loss of thee at Troy, the anarchy <lb/>
            That might ensue, should madness drive the people <lb/>
            To deeds of violence, as men are prompt <lb/>
            Insultingly to trample on the fall'n: <lb/>
            Such care dwells not with fraud. At thy return <lb/>
            The gushing fountains of my tears are dried, <lb/>
            Save that my eyes are weak with midnight watchings, <lb/>
            Straining, through tears, if haply they might see <lb/>
            Thy signal fires, that claimed my fixed attention. <lb/>
            If they were closed in sleep, a silly fly <lb/>
            Would, with its slightest murm'rings, make me start, <lb/>
            And wake me to more fears. For thy dear sake <lb/>
            All this I suffered : but my jocund heart <lb/>
            Forgets it all, while I behold my lord, <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            My guardian, the strong anchor of my hope, <lb/>
            The stately column that supports my house, <lb/>

            Welcome as land, which the tossed mariner <lb/>
            Beyond his hope descries; welcome as day <lb/>
            After a night of storms with fairer beams <lb/>
            Returning ; welcome as the liquid lapse <lb/>
            Of fountain to the thirsty traveller: <lb/>
            So pleasant is it to escape the chain <lb/>
            Of hard constraint. Such greeting I esteem <lb/>
            Due to thy honour: let it not offend, <lb/>
            For I have suffered much. But, my loved lord, <lb/>
            Leave now that car; nor on the bare ground set <lb/>
            That royal foot, beneath whose mighty tread <lb/>
            Troy trembled.-Haste, ye virgins, to whose care <lb/>
            This pleasing office is intrusted, spread <lb/>
            The streets with tapestry ; let the ground be covered <lb/>
            With richest purple, leading to the palace ; <lb/>
            That honour with just state may grace his entry, <lb/>
            Though unexpected. My attentive care <lb/>
            Shall, if the gods permit, dispose the rest <lb/>
            To welcome his high glories, as I ought.</p>
          <p>Aga. Daughter of Leda, guardian of my house, <lb/>
            Thy words are correspondent to my absence, <lb/>
            Of no small length. With better grace my praise <lb/>
            Would come from others: soothe me not with strains <lb/>
            Of adulation, as a girl; nor raise, <lb/>
            As to some proud barbaric king, that loves <lb/>
            Loud acclamations echoed from the mouths <lb/>
            Of prostrate worshippers, a clamorous welcome: <lb/>
            Nor spread the streets with tapestry ; 'tis invidious ; <lb/>
            These are the honours we should pay the gods. <lb/>
            For mortal man to tread on ornaments <lb/>
            Of rich embroidery—— No : I dare not do it: <lb/>
            Respect me as a man, not as a god. <lb/>
            Why should my foot pollute these vests, that glow <lb/>
            With various tinctured radiance ? My full fame <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            Swells high without it; and the temperate rule <lb/>
            Of cool discretion is the choicest gift <lb/>
            Of favouring Heaven. Happy the man, whose life <lb/>
            Is spent in friendship's calm security. <lb/>
            These sober joys be mine, I ask no more.</p>
          <p>Cly. Do not thou thwart the purpose of my mind.</p>
          <p>Aga. My mind, be well assured, shall not be tainted.</p>
          <p>Cly. Hast thou in fear made to the gods this vow?</p>
          <p>Aga. Free, from my soul in prudence have I said it.</p>
          <p>Cly. Had Priam's arms prevailed, how had he acted ?</p>
          <p>Aga. On rich embroidery he had proudly trod.</p>
          <p>Cly. Then dread not thou th' invidious tongues of men.</p>
          <p>Aga. Yet has the popular voice much potency.</p>
          <p>Cly. But the unenvied is not of the happy.</p>
          <p>Aga. Ill suits it thy soft sex to love contention.</p>
          <p>Cly. To yield sometimes adds honour to the mighty.</p>
          <p>Aga. Art thou so earnest to obtain thy wish ?</p>
          <p>Cly. Let me prevail: indulge me with this conquest.</p>
          <p>Aga. If such thy will, haste some one, from my feet <lb/>
            Unloose these high-bound buskins, lest some god <lb/>
            Look down indignant, if with them I press <lb/>
            These vests sea-tinctured : shame it were to spoil <lb/>
            With unclean tread their rich and costly texture. <lb/>
            Of these enough.- This stranger, let her find <lb/>
            A gentle treatment: from high heaven the god <lb/>
            Looks with an eye of favour on the victor <lb/>
            That bears his high state meekly ; for none wears <lb/>
            Of his free choice the yoke of slavery. <lb/>
            And she, of many treasures the prime flower <lb/>
            Selected by the troops, has followed me. <lb/>
            Well, since I yield me vanquished by thy voice, <lb/>
            I go, treading on purple, to my house.</p>
          <p>Cly. Does not the sea, and who shall drain it, yield <lb/>
            Unfailing stores of these rich tints, that glow <lb/>
            With purple radiance? These this lordly house <lb/>
            Commands, blest with abundance, but to want <lb/>
            A stranger. I had vowed his foot should tread <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            On many a vestment, when the victims bled, <lb/>
            The hallowed pledge which this fond breast devised <lb/>
            For his return. For while the vig'rous root <lb/>
            Maintains its grasp, the stately head shall rise, <lb/>
            And with its waving foliage screen the house <lb/>
            From the fierce dog-star's fiery pestilence. <lb/>
            And on thy presence at thy household hearth, <lb/>
            Ev'n the cold winter feels a genial warmth. <lb/>
            But when the hot sun in the unripe grape <lb/>
            Matures the wine, the husband's perfect virtues <lb/>
            Spread a refreshing coolness. Thou, 0 Jove, <lb/>
            Source of perfection, perfect all my vows, <lb/>
            And with thy influence favour my intents!</p>

            Jove, <lb/>
            Gracious to thee, hath placed thee in this house, <lb/>
            With many slaves to share the common rites, <lb/>
            And deck the altar of the fav'ring god. <lb/>
            Come from that chariot, and let temperance rule <lb/>
            Thy lofty spirit: ev'n Alcmena's son, <lb/>
            Sold as a slave, submitted to the yoke <lb/>
            Perforce; and if necessity's hard hand <lb/>
            Hath sunk thee to this fortune, our high rank, <lb/>
            With greatness long acquainted, knows to use <lb/>
            Its power with gentleness: the low-born wretch, <lb/>
            That from his mean degree rises at once <lb/>
            To unexpected riches, treats his slaves <lb/>
            With barbarous and unbounded insolence. <lb/>
            From us thou wilt receive a juster treatment.</p>
          <p>Chor. These are plain truths: since in the toils of fate <lb/>
            Thou art inclosed, submit, if thou canst brook <lb/>
            Submission ; haply I advise in vain.</p>
          <p>Cly. If that her language, like the twittering swallow's, <lb/>
            Be not all barbarous and unknown, my words <lb/>
            Within shall with persuasion move her mind.</p>
          <p>Chor. She speaks what best beseems thy present state; <lb/>
            Follow, submit, and leave that lofty car.</p>
          <p>Cly. I have not leisure here before the gates <lb/>
            T' attend on her; for at the inmost altar, <lb/>
            Blazing with sacred fires, the victims stand <lb/>
            Devoted to the gods for his return <lb/>
            So much beyond our hopes. If to comply <lb/>
            Thou form thy mind, delay not: if thy tongue <lb/>
            Knows not to sound our language, let thy signs <lb/>
            Supply the place of words, speak with thy hand.</p><pb n="82"/>
            
          <p>Chor. Of foreign birth she understands us not: <lb/>
            But as new-taken struggles in the net.</p>
          <p>Cly. 'Tis frenzy this, the impulse of a mind <lb/>
            Disordered ; from a city lately taken <lb/>
            She comes, and knows not how to bear the curb, <lb/>
            Till she has spent her rage in bloody foam. <lb/>
            But I no more waste words to be disdained.</p>
          <p>Chor. My words, for much I pity her, shall bear <lb/>
            No mark of anger. Go, unhappy fair one, <lb/>
            Forsake thy chariot, unreluctant learn <lb/>
            To bear this new yoke of necessity.</p>
          <p>Cas. Woe, woe! 0 Earth! Apollo, 0 Apollo!</p>
          <p>Chor. Why with that voice of woe invoke Apollo? <lb/>
            Illdo these notes of grief accord with him.</p>
          <p>Cas. Woe, woe! 0 Earth! Apollo, 0 Apollo!</p>
          <p>Chor. Again her inauspicious voice invokes <lb/>
            The god, whose ears are not attuned to woe.</p>
          <p>Cas. Apollo, 0 Apollo, fatal leader, <lb/>
            Yet once more, god, thou leadest me to ruin!</p>
          <p>Chor. She seems prophetic of her own misfortunes, <lb/>
            Retaining, though a slave, the divine spirit.</p>
          <p>Cas. Apollo, 0 Apollo, fatal leader, <lb/>
            Ah, whither hast thou led me? to what house?</p>
          <p>Chor. Is that unknown? Let me declare it then; <lb/>
            This is the royal mansion of th' Atridæ.</p>
          <p>Cas. It is a mansion hated by the gods, <lb/>
            Conscious to many a foul and horrid deed; <lb/>
            A slaughter-house, that reeks with human gore.</p>
          <p>Chor. This stranger seems, like the nice-scented hound, <lb/>
            Quick in the trace of blood, which she will find.</p>
          <p>Cas. These are convincing proofs. Look there, look <lb/>
            there, <lb/>
            While pity drops a tear, the children butchered, <lb/>
            The father feasting on their roasted flesh!</p>
          <p>Chor. Thy fame, prophetic virgin, we have heard ; <lb/>
            We know thy skill; but wish no prophets now.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ye powers of Heaven, what does she now design ? <lb/>

            What new and dreadful deed of woe is this ? <lb/>
            What dreadful ill designs she in the house, <lb/>
            Intolerable, irreparable mischief, <lb/>
            While far she sends the succouring power away ?</p>
          <p>Chor. These prophecies surpass my apprehension ; <lb/>
            The first I knew, they echo through the city.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah ! daring wretch, dost thou achieve this deed, <lb/>
            Thus in the bath the partner of thy bed <lb/>
            Refreshing? How shall I relate th' event? <lb/>
            Yet speedy shall it be. Ev'n now advanced <lb/>
            Hand above hand extended threatens high.</p>
          <p>Chor. I comprehend her not; her words are dark, <lb/>
            Perplexing me like abstruse oracles.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah ! What is this, that I see here before me ? <lb/>
            Is it the net of hell ? Or rather hers, <lb/>
            Who shares the bed and plans the murderous deed. <lb/>
            Let discord, whose insatiable rage <lb/>
            Pursues this race, howl through the royal rooms <lb/>
            Against the victim destined to destruction.</p>
          <p>Chor. What fury dost thou call within this house <lb/>
            To hold her orgies? The dread invocation <lb/>
            Appals me ; to my heart the purple drops <lb/>
            Flow back; a deathlike mist covers my eyes, <lb/>
            With expectation of some sudden ruin.</p>
          <p>Cas. See, see there : from the heifer keep the bull! <lb/>
            O'er his black brows she throws th' entangling vest, <lb/>
            And smites him with her huge two-handed engine. <lb/>
            He falls, amid the cleansing laver falls: <lb/>
            I tell thee of the bath, the treacherous bath.</p>
          <p>Chor. T' unfold the obscure oracles of Heaven <lb/>
            Is not my boast; beneath the shadowing veil <lb/>
            Misfortune lies; when did th' inquirer learn <lb/>
            From the dark sentence an event of joy? <lb/>
            From time's first records the diviner's voice <lb/>
            Gives the sad heart a sense of misery.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah me, unhappy! Wretched, wretched fate! <lb/>
            For my own sufferings joined call forth these wailings. <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            Why hast thou brought me hither? Wretched me! <lb/>
            Is it for this, that I may die with him ?</p>
          <p>Chor. This is the frenzy of a mind possessed <lb/>
            With wildest ravings. Thy own woes thou wailest <lb/>
            In mournful melody ; like the sweet bird, <lb/>
            That darkling pours her never-ceasing plaint; <lb/>
            And for her Itys, her lost Itys, wastes <lb/>
            In sweetest woe her melancholy life.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah me! the fortune of the nightingale <lb/>
            Is to be envied : on her light-poised plumes <lb/>
            She wings at will her easy way, nor knows <lb/>
            The anguish of a tear, while o'er my head <lb/>
            Th' impending sword threatens the fatal wound.</p>
          <p>Chor. Whence is this violent, this wild presage <lb/>
            Of ill? Thy fears are vain ; yet with a voice <lb/>
            That terrifies, though sweet, aloud thou speakest <lb/>
            Thy sorrows. Whence hast thou derived these omens, <lb/>
            Thus deeply marked with characters of death ?</p>
          <p>Cas. Alas! the bed, the bridal bed of Paris, <lb/>
            Destructive to his friends! Paternal stream, <lb/>
            Scamander, on thy banks with careless steps <lb/>
            My childhood strayed: but now methinks I go, <lb/>
            Alas, how soon ! to prophesy around <lb/>
            Cocytus, and the banks of Acheron!</p>
          <p>Chor. Perspicuous this, and clear! the new-born babe <lb/>
            Might comprehend it; but thy piercing griefs, <lb/>
            Bewailing thus the miseries of thy fate, <lb/>
            Strike deep; they wound me to my very soul.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah, my poor country, my poor bleeding country, <lb/>
            Fall'n, fall'n forever! And you, sacred altars, <lb/>
            That blazed before my father's towered palace, <lb/>
            Not all your victims could avert your doom ! <lb/>
            And on the earth soon shall my warm blood flow.</p>
          <p>Chor. This is consistent with thy former ravings. <lb/>
            Or does some god indeed incumbent press <lb/>
            Thy soul, and modulate thy voice to utter <lb/>
            These lamentable notes of woe and death ? <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            What th' event shall be, exceeds my knowledge.</p>
          <p>Cas. The oracle no more shall shroud its visage <lb/>
            Beneath a veil, asa new bride that blushes <lb/>
            To meet the gazing eye; but like the sun, <lb/>
            When with his orient ray he gilds the east, <lb/>
            Shall burst upon you in a flood of light, <lb/>
            Disclosing deeds of deeper dread. Away, <lb/>
            Ye mystic coverings! And you, reverend men, <lb/>
            Bear witness to me, that with steady step <lb/>
            I trace foul deeds that smell above the earth. <lb/>
            For never shall that band, whose yelling notes <lb/>
            In dismal accord pierce th' affrighted ear, <lb/>
            Forsake this house. The genius of the feast, <lb/>
            Drunk with the blood of men, and fired from thence <lb/>
            To bolder daring, ranges through the rooms <lb/>
            Linked with his kindred Furies: these possess <lb/>
            The mansion, and in horrid measures chant <lb/>
            The first base deed ; recording with abhorrence <lb/>
            Th'adulterous lust, that stained a brother's bed. <lb/>
            What, like a skilful archer, have I lodged <lb/>
            My arrow in the mark? No trifling this, <lb/>
            T' alarm you with false sounds. But swear to me, <lb/>
            In solemn attestation, that I know, <lb/>
            And speak the old offences of this house.</p>
          <p>Chor. In such a rooted ill what healing power <lb/>
            Resides there in an oath ? But much I marvel <lb/>
            That thou, the native of a foreign realm, <lb/>
            Of foreign tongue, canst speak our language freely, <lb/>
            As Greece had been thy constant residence.</p>
          <p>Cas. Apollo raced me with this skill. At first <lb/>
            The curb of modesty was on my tongue.</p>
          <p>Chor. Did the god feel the force of young desire ? <lb/>
            In each gay breast ease fans the wanton flame.</p>
          <p>Cas. With all the fervour of impatient love <lb/>
            He strove to gratify my utmost wish.</p>
          <p>Chor. And didst thou listen to his tempting lures ?</p>
          <p>Cas. First I assented, then deceived the god.</p><pb n="86"/>
            
          <p>Chor. Wast thou then fraught with these prophetic arts?</p>
          <p>Cas. Even then I told my country all its woes.</p>
          <p>Chor. The anger of the god fell heavy on thee?</p>
          <p>Cas. My voice, for this offence, lost all persuasion.</p>
          <p>Chor. To us it seems a voice of truth divine.</p>
          <p>Cas. Woe, woe is me ! Again the furious power <lb/>
            Swells in my lab'ring breast; again commands <lb/>
            My bursting voice; and what I speak is fate. <lb/>
            Look, look, behold those children. There they sit; <lb/>
            Such are the forms, that in the troubled night <lb/>
            Distract our sleep. By a friend's hands they died: <lb/>
            Are these the ties of blood ? See, in their hands <lb/>
            Their mangled limbs, horrid repast, they bear: <lb/>
            Th' invited father shares th' accursed feast. <lb/>
            For this the sluggard savage, that at ease <lb/>
            Rolls on his bed, nor rouses from his lair, <lb/>
            'Gainst my returning lord, for I must wear <lb/>
            The yoke of slavery, plans the dark design <lb/>
            Of death. Ah me! the chieftain of the fleet, <lb/>
            The vanquisher of Troy, but little knows <lb/>
            What the smooth tongue of mischief, filed to words <lb/>
            Of glozing courtesy, with fate her friend, <lb/>
            Like Até ranging in the dark can do <lb/>
            Calmly : such deeds a woman dares: she dares <lb/>
            Murder a man. What shall I call this mischief? <lb/>
            An Amphisbæna ? or a Scylla rather, <lb/>
            That in the vexed rocks holds her residence, <lb/>
            And meditates the mariner's destruction ? <lb/>
            Mother of hell, midst friends enkindling discord <lb/>
            And hate implacable! With dreadful daring <lb/>
            How did she shout, as if the battle swerved ? <lb/>
            Yet with feigned joy she welcomes his return. <lb/>
            These words may want persuasion. What of that ? <lb/>
            What must come, will come: and ere long with grief <lb/>
            Thou shalt confess my prophecies are true.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thyestes' bloody feast oft have I heard of, <lb/>
            Always with horror; and I tremble now <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Hearing th' unaggravated truth. What else <lb/>
            She utters, leads my wand'ring thoughts astray <lb/>
            In wild uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Cas. Then mark me well, <lb/>
            Thou shalt behold the death of Agamemnon.</p>
          <p>Chor. To better omens tune that voice unblessed, <lb/>
            Or in eternal silence be it sunk.</p>
          <p>Cas. This is an ill no medicine can heal.</p>
          <p>Chor. Not if it happens: but avert it, Heaven !</p>
          <p>Cas. To pray be thine ; the murd'rous deed is theirs.</p>
          <p>Chor. What man dares perpetrate this dreadful act?</p>
          <p>Cas. How widely dost thou wander from my words!</p>
          <p>Chor. I heard not whose bold hand should do the deed.</p>
          <p>Cas. Yet speak I well the language of your Greece.</p>
          <p>Chor. The gift of Phoebus this; no trivial grace.</p>
          <p>Cas. Ah, what a sudden flame comes rushing on me! <lb/>
            I burn, I burn. Apollo, 0 Apollo! <lb/>
            This lioness, that in a sensual sty <lb/>
            Rolled with the wolf, the generous lion absent, <lb/>
            Will kill me. And the sorc'ress, as she brews <lb/>
            Her philtred cup, will drug it with my blood. <lb/>
            She glories, as against her husband's life <lb/>
            She whets the axe, her vengeance falls on him <lb/>
            For that he came accompanied by me. <lb/>
            Why do I longer wear these useless honours, <lb/>
            This laurel wand, and these prophetic wreaths? <lb/>
            Away! before I die I cast you from me; <lb/>
            Lie there and perish ; I am rid of you ; <lb/>
            Or deck the splendid ruin of some other. <lb/>
            Apollo rends from me these sacred vestments, <lb/>
            Who saw me in his rich habiliments <lb/>
            Mocked 'midst my friends, doubtless without a cause. <lb/>
            When in opprobrious terms they jeered my skill, <lb/>
            And treated me as a poor vagrant wretch, <lb/>
            That told events from door to door for bread, <lb/>
            I bore it all: but now the prophet god, <lb/>
            That with his own arts graced me, sinks me down <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            To this low ruin. As my father fell <lb/>
            Butchered ev'n at the altar, like the victim's <lb/>
            My warm blood at the altar shall be shed: <lb/>
            Nor shall we die unhonoured by the gods. <lb/>
            He comes, dreadful in punishment, the son <lb/>
            Of this bad mother, by her death t' avenge <lb/>
            His murdered father : distant though he roams <lb/>
            An outcast and an exile, by his friends <lb/>
            Fenced from these deeds of violence, he comes <lb/>
            In solemn vengeance for his father laid <lb/>
            Thus low. But why for foreign miseries <lb/>
            Does the tear darken in my eye, that saw <lb/>
            The fall of Ilium, and its haughty conquerors <lb/>
            In righteous judgment thus received their meed? <lb/>
            But forward now; I go to close the scene, <lb/>
            Nor shrink from death. I have a vow in heaven: <lb/>
            And further, I adjure these gates of hell, <lb/>
            Well may the blow be aimed, that while my blood <lb/>
            Flows in a copious stream, I may not feel <lb/>
            The fierce, convulsive agonies of death ; <lb/>
            But gently sink, and close my eyes in peace.</p>
          <p>Chor. Unhappy, in thy knowledge most unhappy, <lb/>
            Long have thy sorrows flowed. But if indeed <lb/>
            Thou dost foresee thy death, why, like the heifer <lb/>
            Led by a heavenly impulse, do thy steps <lb/>
            Advance thus boldly to the cruel altar?</p>
          <p>Cas. I could not by delay escape my fate.</p>
          <p>Chor. Yet is there some advantage in delay.</p>
          <p>Cas. The day is come : by flight I should gain little.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thy boldness adds to thy unhappiness.</p>
          <p>Cas. None of the happy shuns his destined end.</p>
          <p>Chor. True; but to die with glory crowns our praise.</p>
          <p>Cas. So died my father, so his noble sons.</p>
          <p>Chor. What may this mean? Why backward dost <lb/>
            thou start? <lb/>
            Do thy own thoughts with horror strike thy soul?</p>
          <p>Cas. The scent of blood and death breathes from this <lb/>
            house.</p><pb n="89"/>
            
          <p>Chor. The victims now are bleeding at the altar.</p>
          <p>Cas. 'Tis such a smell as issues from the tomb.</p>
          <p>Chor. This is no Syrian odour in the house.</p>
          <p>Cas. Such though it be, I enter to bewail <lb/>
            My fate, and Agamemnon's. To have lived, <lb/>
            Let it suffice. And think not, gen'rous strangers, <lb/>
            Like the poor bird that flutters o'er the bough, <lb/>
            Through fear I linger. But my dying words <lb/>
            You will remember, when her blood shall flow <lb/>
            For mine, woman's for woman's: and the man's, <lb/>
            For his that falls by his accursed wife.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thy fate, poor sufferer, fills my eyes with tears.</p>
          <p>Cas. Yet once more let me raise my mournful voice. <lb/>
            Thou sun, whose rising beams shall bless no more <lb/>
            These closing eyes ! You, whose vindictive rage <lb/>
            Hangs o'er my hated murderers, oh avenge me, <lb/>
            Though, a poor slave, I fall an easy prey ! <lb/>
            This is the state of man: in prosperous fortune <lb/>
            A shadow, passing light, throws to the ground <lb/>
            Joy's baseless fabric : in adversity <lb/>
            Comes Malice with a sponge moistened in gall, <lb/>
            And wipes each beauteous character away ; <lb/>
            More than the first this melts my soul to pity.</p>
          <p>Chor. By nature man is formed with boundless wishes <lb/>
            For prosperous fortune ; and the great man's door <lb/>
            Stands ever open to that envied person, <lb/>
            On whom she smiles; but enter not with words, <lb/>
            Like this poor sufferer, of such dreadful import. <lb/>
            His arms the powers of Heaven have graced with con­ <lb/>
            quest ; <lb/>
            Troy's proud walls lie in dust; and he returns <lb/>
            Crowned by the gods with glory : but if now <lb/>
            His blood must for the blood there shed atone, <lb/>
            If he must die for those that died, too dearly <lb/>
            He buys his triumph. Who of mortal men <lb/>
            Hears this, and dares to think his state secure?</p>
          <p>Aga. [within] Oh ! I am wounded with a deadly blow.</p><pb n="90"/>

          <p>'Tis the king's cry ; the dreadful deed is doing. <lb/>
            What shall we do? What measures shall we form?</p>
          <p>What if we spread th' alarm, and with our outcries <lb/>
            Call at the palace gates the citizens ?</p>
          <p>Nay, rather rush we in, and prove the deed, <lb/>
            While the fresh blood is reeking on the sword.</p>
          <p>I readily concur; determine then; <lb/>
            For something must be done, and instantly.</p>
          <p>That's evident. This bloody prelude threatens <lb/>
            More deeds of violence and tyranny.</p>
          <p>We linger: those that tread the paths of honour, <lb/>
            Late though she meets them, sleep not in their task.</p>
          <p>Perplexity and doubt distract my thoughts: <lb/>
            Deeds of high import ask matures! counsel.</p>
          <p>Such are my thoughts, since fruitless were th' attempt <lb/>
            By all our pleas to raise the dead to life.</p>
          <p>To save our wretched lives then shall we bow <lb/>
            To these imperious lords, these stains of honour?</p>
          <p>That were a shame indeed ! No ; let us die : <lb/>
            Death is more welcome than such tyranny.</p>
          <p>Shall we then take these outcries, which we heard, <lb/>
            For proofs, and thence conclude the king is slain?</p>
          <p>We should be well assured ere we pronounce : <lb/>
            To know, and to conjecture, differ widely.</p>
          <p>There's reason in thy words. Best enter then, <lb/>

          <p>Clytemnestra. To many a fair speech suited to the times, <lb/>
            If my words now be found at variance, <lb/>
            I shall not blush. For when the heart conceives <lb/>
            Thoughts of deep vengeance on a foe, what means <lb/>
            T' achieve the deed more certain, than to wear <lb/>
            The form of friendship, and with circling wiles <lb/>
            Inclose him in th' insuperable net? <lb/>
            This was no hasty, rash-conceived design ; <lb/>
            But formed with deep, premeditated thought, <lb/>
            Incensed with wrongs; and often have I stood, <lb/>
            T' assay the execution, where he fell; <lb/>
            And planned it so, for I with pride avow it, <lb/>
            He had no power t' escape, or to resist, <lb/>
            Entangled in the gorgeous robe, that shone <lb/>
            Fatally rich. I struck him twice, and twice <lb/>
            He groaned, then died. A third time as he lay <lb/>
            I gored him with a wound, a grateful present <lb/>
            To the stern god, that in the realms below <lb/>
            Reigns o'er the dead: there let him take his seat. <lb/>
            He lay ; and spouting from his wounds a stream <lb/>
            Of blood, bedewed me with these crimson drops. <lb/>
            I glory in them, like the genial earth, <lb/>
            When the warm showers of heaven descend, and wake <lb/>
            The flow'rets to unfold their vermeil leaves. <lb/>
            Come then, ye reverend senators of Argos, <lb/>
            Joy with me, if your hearts be tuned to joy ; <lb/>
            And such I wish them. Were it decent now <lb/>
            To pour libations o'er the dead, with justice <lb/>
            It might be done ; for his injurious pride <lb/>
            Filled for this house the cup of desolation, <lb/>
            Fated himself to drain it to the dregs.</p>

            Adjudge this man to exile, in just vengeance <lb/>
            For such unholy deeds? Scarce hast thou heard <lb/>
            What I have done, but sentence is pronounced, <lb/>
            And that with rigour too. But mark me well, <lb/>

            Be stronger, use thy power: but if the gods <lb/>

            Thou shalt be taught a lesson of discretion.</p>

            Have they received. See where he lies; and she, <lb/>
            That like the swan warbled her dying notes, <lb/>

            Whose foul stains never can be purged. This ruin <lb/>
            Hathdiscord, raging in the house, effected.</p>
          <p>Cly. Wish not for death ; nor bow beneath thy griefs; <lb/>
            Nor turn thy rage on Helen, as if she <lb/>
            Had drenched the fields with blood, as she alone <lb/>
            Fatal to Greece had caused these dreadful ills.</p>
          <p>Chor. Tremendous fiend, that breathest through this <lb/>
            house <lb/>
            Thy baleful spirit, and with equal daring <lb/>
            Hast steeled these royal sisters to fierce deeds <lb/>
            That rend my soul, now, like the baleful raven, <lb/>
            Incumbent o'er the body dost thou joy <lb/>
            T' affright us with thy harsh and dissonant notes!</p><pb n="94"/>
            
          <p>Cly. There's sense in this: now hast thou touched <lb/>
            the key, <lb/>
            Rousing the fury that from sire to son <lb/>
            Hath bade the stream of blood, first poured by her, <lb/>
            Descend: one sanguine tide scarce rolled away, <lb/>
            Another flows in terrible succession.</p>
          <p>Chor. And dost thou glory in these deeds of death, <lb/>
            This vengeance of the fury ? Thus to pride thee <lb/>
            In ruin, and the havoc of thy house, <lb/>
            Becomes thee ill. Ah ! 'tis a higher power, <lb/>
            That thus ordains: we see the hand of Jove, <lb/>
            Whose will directs the fate of mortal man. <lb/>
            My king, my royal lord, what words can show <lb/>
            My grief, my reverence for thy princely virtues! <lb/>
            Art thou thus fall'n, caught in a cobweb snare, <lb/>
            By impious murder breathing out thy life? <lb/>
            Art thou thus fall'n, ah the disloyal bed ! <lb/>
            Secretly slaughtered by a treach'rous hand ?</p>
          <p>Cly. Thou say'st, and say'st aloud, I did this deed: <lb/>
            Say not that I, that Agamemnon's wife, <lb/>
            Did it: the fury, fatal to this house, <lb/>
            In vengeance for Thyestes' horrid feast, <lb/>
            Assumed this form, and with her ancient rage <lb/>
            Hath for the children sacrificed the man.</p>
          <p>Chor. That thou art guiltless of this blood, what proof, <lb/>
            What witness? From the father, in his cause, <lb/>
            Rise an avenger! Stained with the dark streams <lb/>
            Of kindred blood fierce waves the bick'ring sword, <lb/>
            And points the ruthless boy to deeds of horror. <lb/>
            My king, my royal lord, what words can show <lb/>
            My grief, my reverence for thy princely virtues ! <lb/>
            Art thou thus fall'n, caught in a cobweb snare, <lb/>
            By impious murder breathing out thy life? <lb/>
            Art thou thus fall'n, ah the disloyal bed ! <lb/>
            Secretly slaughtered by a treach'rous hand?</p>
          <p>Cly. No: of his death far otherwise I deem, <lb/>
            Nothing disloyal. Nor with secret guile <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            Wrought he his murd'rous mischiefs on this house. <lb/>
            For my sweet flow'ret, opening from his stem, <lb/>
            My Iphigenia, my lamented child, <lb/>
            Whom he unjustly slew, he justly died. <lb/>
            Nor let him glory in the shades below ; <lb/>
            For as he taught his sword to thirst for blood, <lb/>
            So by the thirsty sword his blood was shed.</p>
          <p>Chor. Perplexed and troubled in my anxious thought, <lb/>
            Amid the ruins of this house, despair <lb/>
            Hangs heavy on me. Drop by drop no more <lb/>
            Descends the shower of blood ; but the wild storm <lb/>
            In one red torrent shakes the solid walls; <lb/>
            While vengeance, ranging through the dreadful scene, <lb/>
            For further mischief whets her fatal sword.</p>
          <p>Semichor. 0 Earth, that I had rested in thy bosom, <lb/>
            Ere I had seen him lodged with thee, and shrunk <lb/>
            To the brief compass of a silver urn ! <lb/>
            Who shall attend the rites of sepulture ? <lb/>
            Who shall lament him? Thou, whose hand has shed <lb/>
            Thy husband's blood, wilt thou dare raise the voice <lb/>
            Of mourning o'er him? Thy unhallowed hand <lb/>
            Renders these honours, should they come from thee, <lb/>
            Unwelcome to his shade. What faithful tongue, <lb/>
            Fond to recount his great and godlike acts, <lb/>
            Shall steep in tears his funeral eulogy ?</p>
          <p>Cly. This care concerns not thee : by us he fell, <lb/>
            By us he died: and we will bury him <lb/>
            With no domestic grief. But Iphigenia, <lb/>
            His daughter, as is meet, jocund and blithe <lb/>
            Shall meet him on the banks of that sad stream, <lb/>
            The flood of sorrow, and with filial duty <lb/>
            Hang fondling on her father's neck, and kiss him.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thus insult treads on insult. Of these things <lb/>
            Hard is it to decide. Th' infected stain <lb/>
            Communicates th' infection ; murder calls <lb/>
            For blood; and outrage on th' injurious head, <lb/>
            At Jove's appointed time, draws outrage down. <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            Thus, by the laws of Nature, son succeeds <lb/>
            To sire; and who shall drive him from the house?</p>
          <p>Cly. These are the oracles of truth. But hear me; <lb/>
            It likes me to the genius of the race <lb/>
            Of Plisthenes to swear that what is past, <lb/>
            Though poor the satisfaction, bounds my wishes. <lb/>
            Hither he comes no more: no, let him stain <lb/>
            Some other house with gore. For me, some poor, <lb/>
            Some scanty pittance of the goods contents me, <lb/>
            Well satisfied that from this house I've driven <lb/>
            These frantic Furies red with kindred blood.</p>

          <p>Ægisthus. Hail to this joyful day, whose welcome light <lb/>
            Brings vengeance! Now I know that the just gods <lb/>
            Look from their skies, and punish impious mortals, <lb/>
            Seeing this man rolled in the blood-wove woof, <lb/>
            The tissue of the Furies, grateful sight, <lb/>
            And suffering for his father's fraudful crimes. <lb/>
            Atreus, his father, sovereign of this land, <lb/>
            Brooking no rival in his power, drove out <lb/>
            My father and his brother, poor Thyestes, <lb/>
            A wretched exile: from his country far <lb/>
            He wandered ; but at length returned, and stood <lb/>
            A suppliant before the household gods, <lb/>
            Secure in their protection that his blood <lb/>
            Should not distain the pavement. This man's father, <lb/>
            The sacrilegious Atreus, with more show <lb/>
            Of courtesy than friendship, spread the feast; <lb/>
            Devoting, such the fair pretence, the day <lb/>
            To hospitality and genial mirth: <lb/>
            Then to my father in that feast served up <lb/>
            The flesh of his own sons: their hands and feet <lb/>
            Hacked off before, their undistinguished parts <lb/>
            He ate, without suspicion ate, a food <lb/>
            Destructive to the race. But when he knew <lb/>
            Th' unhallowed deed, he raised a mournful cry, <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            And starting up with horror spurned to the ground <lb/>
            The barb'rous banquet, utt'ring many a curse <lb/>
            Of deepest vengeance on the house of Pelops. <lb/>
            Thus perish all the race of Plisthenes! <lb/>
            And for this cause thou seest him fall'n! His death <lb/>
            With justice I devised ; for me he chased, <lb/>
            The thirteenth son, an infant in my cradle, <lb/>
            With my unhappy father. Nursed abroad, <lb/>
            Vengeance led back my steps, and taught my hand <lb/>
            From far to reach him. All this plan of ruin <lb/>
            Was mine, reckless of what ensues; ev'n death <lb/>
            Were glorious, now he lies caught in my vengeance.</p>
          <p>Chor. T' embitter ills with insult, this, Ægisthus, <lb/>
            I praise not. Thou, of thine own free accord, <lb/>
            Hast slain this man; such is thy boast; this plan <lb/>
            Of ruin, which we mourn, is thine alone. <lb/>
            But be thou well assured thou shalt not 'scape, <lb/>
            When, roused to justice, the avenging people <lb/>
            Shall hurl their stones with curses on thy head.</p>
          <p>Ægis. From thee, who labourest at the lowest oar, <lb/>
            This language, and to him that holds the helm! <lb/>
            Thou shalt be taught, old man, what at thy age <lb/>
            Is a hard lesson, prudence. Chains and hunger, <lb/>
            Besides the load of age, have sovereign virtue <lb/>

            Does it not ope thine eyes? Rest quiet then ; <lb/>
            Contend not with the strong; there's danger in it.</p>
          <p>Chor. And could thy softer sex, while the rough <lb/>
            war <lb/>
            Demands its chieftain, violate his bed, <lb/>
            And on his first return contrive his death ?</p>

          <p>Ægis. Wiles and deceit are female qualities: <lb/>

            Unman thee to this murder, that a woman, <lb/>
            Shame to her country and her country's gods, <lb/>
            Must dare the horrid deed ? But when Orestes, <lb/>
            Where'er he breathes the vital air, returns, <lb/>
            Good fortune be his guide, shall not his hand <lb/>
            Take a bold vengeance in the death of both ?</p>
          <p>Ægis. Since such thy thoughts and words, soon shalt <lb/>
            thou feel</p>
          <p>Chor. Help, ho! soldiers and friends; the danger's <lb/>

            Let no more blood be spilt. Go then, old men, <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE ANTIGONE OF SOPHOCLES TRANSLATED BY RICHARD CLAVERHOUSE JEBB</title>
          </head><pb n="102"/>
          
          <p>SOPHOCLES was born in 496 B. C. and lived to the age of ninety-one. <lb/>
            His father, Sophillus, was a wealthy citizen of Colonos, a fashionable <lb/>
            suburb of Athens, and the young dramatist received the best education <lb/>
            that Greece could afford. In music, which he studied under Lamprocles, <lb/>
            he was particularly apt, and at the age of sixteen he was chosen to lead <lb/>
            a chorus of youths in the celebration of the victory of Salamis (480 B. c.). <lb/>
            He was frequently employed as ambassador, and in other high offices in <lb/>
            the republic, and in the Samian War was given the generalship in joint <lb/>
            command with Pericles. This appointment is said to have been influ­ <lb/>
            enced by the great popular success of "Antigone." At twenty-eight he <lb/>
            competed with Æschylus, and was awarded the prize by Cimon and his <lb/>
            fellow-generals, who had just returned from Scyros and were the judges <lb/>
            for that year (468 a. c.). From that time until the death of Æschylus he <lb/>
            divided honours about equally with his great predecessor, never taking <lb/>
            less than a third prize, and continually growing in popularity. Seven of <lb/>
            the eighty or more plays that he is supposed to have written remain for <lb/>
            our study and enjoyment, together with many fragments of those less <lb/>
            fortunate in the wreck of time. The probable order of their production <lb/>
            is as follows: "Ajax," "Antigone," " Electra," "CEdipus Tyrannus," <lb/>
            " Trachiniæ,” “CEdipus Coloneus," and “ Philoctetes." Cicero voices a <lb/>
            popular tradition where he says, in his essay “On Old Age": “Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles continued in extreme old age to write tragedies. As he seemed to <lb/>
            neglect his family affairs while he was wholly intent on his dramatic <lb/>
            compositions, his sons instituted a suit against him in a court of judica­ <lb/>
            ture, suggesting that his understanding was impaired, and praying that <lb/>
            he might be removed from the management of his estate. It is said that <lb/>
            when the old bard appeared in court on this occasion he desired that he <lb/>
            might be permitted to read a play which he had lately finished, and <lb/>
            which he then held in his hand: it was his 'CEdipus Coloneus.' His <lb/>
            request being granted, after he had finished the recital he appealed to the <lb/>
            judges whether they could discover in his performance any symptoms of <lb/>
            an insane mind, and the result was that the court unanimously dismissed <lb/>
            the complainants' petition." The poet died in 405. " Philoctetes " was <lb/>
            produced in 409, and “CEdipus Coloneus" is said not to have been acted <lb/>
            until after the poet's death.</p><pb n="103"/>

            knowest thou what ill there is, of all bequeathed <lb/>
            by Œdipus, that Zeus fulfils not for us twain while <lb/>
            we live? Nothing painful is there, nothing fraught with <lb/>
            ruin, no shame, no dishonour, that I have not seen in <lb/>
            thy woes and mine.</p>
          <p>And now what new edict is this of which they tell, that <lb/>

            painful, hath come to me, since we two sisters were bereft <lb/>
            of brothers twain, killed in one day by a twofold blow; <lb/>
            and since in this last night the Argive host has fled, I <lb/>
            know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more <lb/>
            grievous.</p>
          <p>An. I knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee <lb/>
            beyond the gates of the court, that thou mightest hear <lb/>
            alone.</p>
          <p>Is. What is it? 'Tis plain that thou art brooding on <lb/>
            some dark tidings. <note type="footnote"> 5 </note> </p><pb n="106"/>
            
          <p>An. What! hath not Creon destined our brothers, the <lb/>
            one to honoured burial, the other to unburied shame? <lb/>
            Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and cus­ <lb/>
            tom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among the <lb/>
            dead below. But the hapless corpse of Polyneices—as <lb/>
            rumour saith, it bath been published to the town that, <lb/>
            none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave unwept, un­ <lb/>
            sepulchred, a welcome store for the birds, as they espy <lb/>
            him, to feast on at will.</p>
          <p>Such, 'tis said, is the edict that the good Creon hath <lb/>
            set forth for thee and for me—yes, for me—and is coming <lb/>
            hither to proclaim it clearly to those who know it not; <lb/>
            nor counts the matter light, but, whoso disobeys in aught, <lb/>
            his doom is death by stoning before all the folk. Thou <lb/>
            knowest it now ; and thou wilt soon show whether thou <lb/>
            art nobly bred, or the base daughter of a nobler line.</p>
          <p>Is. Poor sister-and if things stand thus, what could I <lb/>
            help to do or undo?</p>
          <p>An. Consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.</p>
          <p>Is. In what venture? What can be thy meaning?</p>
          <p>An. Wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead ?</p>
          <p>Is. Thou wouldst bury him—when 'tis forbidden to <lb/>
            Thebes? I</p>
          <p>An. I will do my part-and thine, if thou wilt not-to <lb/>
            a brother. False to him will I never be found.</p>
          <p>Is. Ah, over-bold ! when Creon hath forbidden ?</p>
          <p>An. Nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.</p>
          <p>Is. Ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, <lb/>
            amid hate and scorn, when sins bared by his own search <lb/>
            had moved him to strike both eyes with self-blinding <lb/>
            hand ; then the mother wife, two names in one, with <lb/>
            twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two <lb/>
            brothers in one day-each shedding, hapless one, a kins­ <lb/>
            man's blood—wrought out with mutual hands their com­ <lb/>
            mon doom. And now we in turn—we two left all alone- <lb/>
            think how we shall perish, more miserably than all the <lb/>
            rest, if, in defiance of the law, we brave a king's decree or <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            nis powers. Nay, we must remember, first, that we were <lb/>
            born women, as who should not strive with men; next, <lb/>
            that we are ruled of the stronger, so that we must obey <lb/>
            in these things, and in things yet sorer. I, therefore, ask­ <lb/>
            ing the spirits infernal to pardon, seeing that force is put <lb/>
            on me herein, will hearken to our rulers; for 'tis witless <lb/>
            to be over-busy.</p>
          <p>An. I will not urge thee-no, nor, if thou yet shouldst <lb/>
            have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with <lb/>
            me. Nay, be what thou wilt; but I will bury him : well <lb/>
            for me to die in doing that. I shall rest, a loved one with <lb/>
            him whom I have loved, sinless in my crime ; for I owe a <lb/>
            longer allegiance to the dead than to the living: in that <lb/>
            world I shall abide forever. But if thou wilt, be guilty <lb/>
            of dishonouring laws which the gods have established in <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>Is. I do them no dishonour; but to defy the state—I <lb/>
            have no strength for that.</p>
          <p>An. Such be thy plea: I, then, will go to heap the <lb/>
            earth above the brother whom I love.</p>
          <p>Is. Alas, unhappy one ! How I fear for thee !</p>
          <p>An. Fear not for me : guide thine own fate aright.</p>
          <p>Is. At least, then, disclose this plan to none, but hide <lb/>
            it closely-and so, too, will I.</p>
          <p>An. Oh, denounce it! Thou wilt be far more hateful <lb/>
            for thy silence, if thou proclaim not these things to all.</p>
          <p>Is. Thou hast a hot heart for chilling deeds.</p>
          <p>An. I know that I please where I am most bound to <lb/>
            please.</p>
          <p>Is. Ay, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou <lb/>
            canst not.</p>
          <p>An. Why, then, when my strength fails, I shall have <lb/>
            done.</p>
          <p>Is. A hopeless quest should not be made at all.</p>
          <p>An. If thus thou speakest, thou wilt have hatred from <lb/>
            me, and wilt justly be subject to the lasting hatred of the <lb/>
            dead. But leave me, and the folly that is mine alone, to <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            suffer this dread thing; for I -shall not suffer aught so <lb/>
            dreadful as an ignoble death.</p>
          <p>Is. Go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure-that, <lb/>
            though thine errand is foolish, to thy dear ones thou art <lb/>
            truly dear. <lb/>
            [Exit ANTIGONE on the spectators left. ISMENE <lb/>
            retires into the palace by one of the two side-doors.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Beam of the sun, fairest light that ever dawned <lb/>
            on Thebè of the seven gates, thou hast shone forth at last, <lb/>
            eye of golden day, arisen above Dirce's streams! The <lb/>
            warrior of the white shield, who came from Argos in his <lb/>
            panoply, hath been stirred by thee to headlong flight, in <lb/>
            swifter career; who set forth against our land by reason <lb/>
            of the vexed claims of Polyneices; and, like shrill-scream­ <lb/>
            ing eagle, he flew over into our land, in snow-white pinion <lb/>
            sheathed, with an armèd throng, and with plumage of <lb/>
            helms.</p>
          <p>He paused above our dwellings; he ravened around <lb/>
            our sevenfold portals with spears athirst for blood; but <lb/>
            he went hence, or ever his jaws were glutted with our <lb/>
            gore, or the Fire-god's pine-fed flame had seized our crown <lb/>
            of towers. So fierce was the noise of battle raised behind <lb/>
            him, a thing too hard for him to conquer, as he wrestled <lb/>
            with his dragon foe.</p>
          <p>For Zeus utterly abhors the boasts of a proud tongue; <lb/>
            and when he beheld them coming on in a great stream, in <lb/>
            the haughty pride of clanging gold, he smote with bran­ <lb/>
            dished fire one who was now hasting to shout victory at <lb/>
            his goal upon our ramparts.</p>
          <p>Swung down, he fell on the earth with a crash, torch <lb/>
            in hand, he who so lately, in the frenzy of the mad onset, <lb/>
            was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous <lb/>
            hate. But those threats fared not as he hoped ; and to <lb/>
            other foes the mighty War-god dispensed their several <lb/>
            dooms, dealing havoc around, a mighty helper at our <lb/>
            need.</p>
          <p>For seven captains at seven gates, matched against <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            seven, left the tribute of their panoplies to Zeus who turns <lb/>
            the battle; save those two of cruel fate, who, born of one <lb/>
            sire and one mother, set against each other their twain <lb/>
            conquering spears, and are sharers in a common death.</p>
          <p>But since Victory of glorious name hath come to us, <lb/>
            with joy responsive to the joy of Thebè whose chariots <lb/>
            are many, let us enjoy forgetfulness after the late wars, <lb/>
            and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance <lb/>
            and song; and may Bacchus be our leader, whose dancing <lb/>
            shakes the land of Thebè.</p>
          <p>But lo, the king of. the land comes yonder, Creon, son <lb/>
            of Menœceus, our new ruler by the new fortunes that the <lb/>
            gods have given; what counsel is he pondering, that he <lb/>
            hath proposed this special conference of elders, summoned <lb/>
            by his general mandate ?</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Enter CREON, from the central doors of the palace, in the garb of king; with two attendants</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Creon. Sirs, the vessel of our state, after being tossed on <lb/>
            wild waves, hath once more been safely steadied by the <lb/>
            gods: and ye, out of all the folk, have been called apart <lb/>
            by my summons, because I knew, first of all, how true and <lb/>
            constant was your reverence for the royal power of Laius ; <lb/>
            how, again, when CEdipus was ruler of our land, and when <lb/>
            he had perished, your steadfast loyalty still upheld their <lb/>
            children. Since, then, his sons have fallen in one day by <lb/>
            a twofold doom-each smitten by the other, each stained <lb/>
            with a brother's blood—I now possess the throne and all <lb/>
            its powers, by nearness of kinship to the dead.</p>
          <p>No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and <lb/>
            mind, until he hath been seen versed in rule and law­ <lb/>
            giving. For if any, being supreme guide of the state, <lb/>
            cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through some fear, <lb/>
            keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him <lb/>
            most base; and if any makes a friend of more account <lb/>
            than his fatherland, that man hath no place in my regard. <lb/>
            For I—be Zeus my witness, who sees all things always- <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, coming <lb/>
            to the citizens; nor would I ever deem the country's foe <lb/>
            a friend to myself; remembering this, that our country is <lb/>
            the ship that bears us safe, and that only while she pros­ <lb/>
            pers in our voyage can we make true friends.</p>
          <p>Such are the rules by which I guard this city's great­ <lb/>
            ness. And in accord with them is the edict which I have <lb/>
            now published to the folk touching the sons of Œdipus ; <lb/>
            that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting for our city, in all <lb/>
            renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned with <lb/>
            every rite that follows the noblest dead to their rest. But <lb/>
            for his brother, Polyneices—who came back from exile, <lb/>
            and sought to consume utterly with fire the city of his <lb/>
            fathers and the shrines of his fathers' gods-sought to <lb/>
            taste of kindred blood, and to lead the remnant into <lb/>
            slavery-touching this man, it hath been proclaimed to <lb/>
            our people that none shall grace him with sepulture or <lb/>
            lament, but leave him unburied, a corpse for birds and <lb/>
            dogs to eat, a ghastly sight of shame.</p>
          <p>Such the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of <lb/>
            mine, shall the wicked stand in honour before the just; <lb/>
            but whoso hath good-will to Thebes, he shall be honoured <lb/>
            of me, in his life and in his death.</p>
          <p>Ch. Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menœceus, <lb/>
            touching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast <lb/>
            power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the <lb/>
            dead and for all of us who live.</p>
          <p>Cr. See, then, that ye be guardians of the mandate.</p>
          <p>Ch. Lay the burden of this task on some younger man.</p>
          <p>Cr. Nay, watchers of the corpse have been found.</p>
          <p>Ch. What, then, is this further charge that thou <lb/>
            wouldst give?</p>
          <p>Cr. That ye side not with the breakers of these com­ <lb/>

          <p>Guard. My liege, I will not say that I come breathless <lb/>
            from speed, or that I have plied a nimble foot; for often did <lb/>
            my thoughts make me pause, and wheel round in my path, <lb/>
            to return. My mind was holding large discourse with me : <lb/>
            " Fool, why goest thou to thy certain doom ? " " Wretch, <lb/>
            tarrying again ? And if Creon hears this from another, <lb/>
            must not thou smart for it? " So debating, I went on my <lb/>
            way with lagging steps, and thus a short road was made <lb/>
            long. At last, however, it carried the day that I should <lb/>
            come hither-to thee; and, though my tale be naught, <lb/>
            yet will I tell it; for I come with a good grip on one <lb/>
            hope-that I can suffer nothing but what is my fate.</p>
          <p>Cr. And what is it that disquiets thee thus?</p>
          <p>Gu. I wish to tell thee first about myself—I did not do <lb/>
            the deed—I did not see the doer-it were not right that I <lb/>
            should come to any harm.</p>
          <p>Cr. Thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well dost <lb/>
            thou fence thyself round against the blame-clearly thou <lb/>
            hast some strange thing to tell.</p>
          <p>Gu. Ay, truly ; dread news makes one pause long.</p>
          <p>Cr. Then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone ?</p>
          <p>Gu. Well, this is it.- The corpse-some one hath just <lb/>
            given it burial, and gone away—after sprinkling thirsty <lb/>
            dust on the flesh with such other rites as piety enjoins.</p>
          <p>Cr. What sayest thou ? What living man hath dared <lb/>
            this deed ?</p>
          <p>Gu. I know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, <lb/>
            no earth thrown up by mattock ; the ground was hard <lb/>
            and dry, unbroken, without track of wheels; the doer <lb/>
            was one who had left no trace. And when the first day­ <lb/>
            watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. The <lb/>
            dead man was veiled from us; not shut within a tomb, <lb/>
            but lightly strewn with dust, as by the hand of one who <lb/>
            shunned a curse. And no sign met the eye as though <lb/>
            any beast of prey or any dog had come nigh to him, or <lb/>
            torn him.</p><pb n="112"/>
            
          <p>I <lb/>
            Then evil words flew fast and loud among us, guard <lb/>
            accusing guard ; and it would e'en have come to blows at <lb/>
            last, nor was there any to hinder. Every man was the <lb/>
            culprit, and no one was convicted, but all disclaimed <lb/>
            knowledge of the deed. And we were ready to take red­ <lb/>
            hot iron in our hands-to walk through fire—to make <lb/>
            oath by the gods that we had not done the deed-that we <lb/>
            were not privy to the planning or the doing.</p>
          <p>At last, when all our searching was fruitless, one <lb/>
            spake, who made us all bend our faces on the earth in <lb/>
            fear; for we saw not how we could gainsay him, or es­ <lb/>
            cape mischance if we obeyed. His counsel was that this <lb/>
            deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. And this <lb/>
            seemed best; and the lot doomed my hapless self to win <lb/>
            this prize. So here I stand-as unwelcome as unwilling, <lb/>
            well I wot; for no man delights in the bearer of bad news.</p>
          <p>Ch. 0 King, my thoughts have long been whispering, <lb/>
            can this deed, perchance, be e'en the work of gods ?</p>
          <p>Cr. Cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath, <lb/>
            lest thou be found at once an old man and foolish. For <lb/>
            thou sayest what is not to be borne, in saying that the <lb/>
            gods have care for this corpse. Was it for high reward <lb/>
            of trusty service that they sought to hide his nakedness, <lb/>
            who came to burn their pillared shrines and sacred treas­ <lb/>
            ures, to burn their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? <lb/>
            Or dost thou behold the gods honouring the wicked ? It <lb/>
            can not be. No! From the first there were certain in <lb/>
            the town that muttered against me, chafing at this edict, <lb/>
            wagging their heads in secret; and kept not their necks <lb/>
            duly under the yoke, like men contented with my sway.</p>
          <p>'Tis by them, well I know, that these have been be­ <lb/>
            guiled and bribed to do this deed. Nothing so evil as <lb/>
            money ever grew to be current among men. This lays <lb/>
            cities low, this drives men from their homes, this trains <lb/>
            and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works <lb/>
            of shame; this still teaches folk to practise villanies, and <lb/>
            to know every godless deed.</p><pb n="113"/>
            
          <p>But all the men who wrought this thing for hire have <lb/>
            made it sure that, soon or late, they shall pay the price. <lb/>
            Now, as Zeus still hath my reverence, know this—I tell <lb/>
            it thee on my oath: If ye find not the very author of this <lb/>
            burial, and produce him before mine eyes, death alone <lb/>
            shall not be enough for you, till first hung up alive, ye <lb/>
            have revealed this outrage-that henceforth ye may thieve <lb/>
            with better knowledge whence lucre should be won, and <lb/>
            learn that it is not well to love gain from every source. <lb/>
            For thou wilt find that ill-gotten pelf brings more men to <lb/>
            ruin than to weal.</p>
          <p>Gu. May I speak ? Or shall I just turn and go ?</p>

          <p>Gu. 0 King, against nothing should men pledge their <lb/>
            word ; for the after-thought belies the first intent. I <lb/>
            could have vowed that I should not soon be here again­ <lb/>
            scared by thy threats, with which I had just been lashed: <lb/>
            but-since the joy that surprises and transcends our hopes <lb/>
            is like in fulness to no other pleasure—I have come, <lb/>
            though 'tis in breach of my sworn oath, bringing this <lb/>
            maid ; who was taken showing grace to the dead. This <lb/>
            time there was no casting of lots; no, this luck hath fallen <lb/>
            to me, and to none else. And now, Sire, take her thyself, <lb/>
            question her, examine her, as thou wilt; but I have a <lb/>
            right to free and final quittance of this trouble.</p>
          <p>Cr. And thy prisoner here-how and whence hast <lb/>
            thou taken her?</p>
          <p>Gu. She was burying the man; thou knowest all.</p>
          <p>Cr. Dost thou mean what thou sayest ? Dost thou <lb/>
            speak aright ?</p>
          <p>Gu. I saw her burying the corpse that thou hadst for­ <lb/>
            bidden to bury. Is that plain and clear?</p>
          <p>Cr. And how was she seen ? how taken in the act ?</p>
          <p>Gu. It befell on this wise : When we had come to the <lb/>
            place-with those dread menaces of thine upon us—we <lb/>
            swept away all the dust that covered the corpse, and <lb/>
            bared the dank body well; and then sat us down on the <lb/>
            brow of the hill, to windward, heedful that the smell from <lb/>
            him should not strike us ; every man was wide awake, <lb/>
            and kept his neighbour alert with torrents of threats, if <lb/>
            any one should be careless of this task.</p>
          <p>So went it, until the sun's bright orb stood in mid <lb/>
            heaven, and the heat began to burn: and then suddenly a <lb/>
            whirlwind lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a trouble <lb/>
            in the sky, and filled the plain, marring all the leafage of <lb/>
            its woods; and the wide air was choked therewith: we <lb/>
            closed our eyes, and bore the plague from the gods.</p>
          <p>And when, after a long while, this storm had passed, <lb/>
            the maid was seen; and she cried aloud with the sharp <lb/>
            cry of a bird in its bitterness-even as when, within the <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings. So <lb/>
            she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice <lb/>
            of wailing, and called down curses on the doers of that <lb/>
            deed. And straightway she brought thirsty dust in her <lb/>
            hands ; and from a shapely ewer of bronze, held high, with <lb/>
            thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the dead.</p>
          <p>We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once closed <lb/>
            upon our quarry, who was in no wise dismayed. Then <lb/>
            we taxed her with her past and present doings; and she <lb/>
            stood not on denial of aught-at once to my joy and to my <lb/>
            pain. To have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; <lb/>
            but 'tis painful to bring friends to ill. Howbeit, all such <lb/>
            things are of less account to me than mine own safety.</p>
          <p>Cr. Thou-thou whose face is bent to earth—dost thou <lb/>
            avow, or disavow, this deed ?</p>
          <p>An. I avow it; I make no denial,</p>
          <p>Cr. (To GUARD.) Thou canst betake thee whither thou <lb/>
            wilt, free and clear of a grave charge. [Exit GUARD.</p>
          <p>(To ANTIGONE.) Now, tell me thou-not in many <lb/>
            words, but briefly—knewest thou that an edict had for­ <lb/>
            bidden this?</p>
          <p>An. I knew it: could I help it? It was public.</p>
          <p>Cr. And thou didst indeed dare to transgress that law ?</p>
          <p>An. Yes; for it was not Zeus that had published me <lb/>
            that edict; not such are the laws set among men by the <lb/>
            Justice who dwells with the gods below; nor deemed I <lb/>
            that thy decrees were of such force, that a mortal could <lb/>
            override the unwritten and unfailing statutes of Heaven. <lb/>
            For their life is not of to-day or yesterday, but from all <lb/>
            time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.</p>
          <p>Not through dread of any human pride could I answer <lb/>
            to the gods for breaking these. Die I must—I knew that <lb/>
            well (how should I not?)—even without thy edicts. But <lb/>
            if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain: for <lb/>
            when any one lives, as I do, compassed about with evils, <lb/>
            can such a one find aught but gain in death ?</p>
          <p>So for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but if I <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            had suffered my mother's son to lie in death an unburied <lb/>
            corpse, that would have grieved me; for this, I am not <lb/>
            grieved. And if my present deeds are foolish in thy <lb/>
            sight, it may be that a foolish judge arraigns my folly.</p>
          <p>Ch. The maid shows herself passionate child of pas­ <lb/>
            sionate sire, and knows not how to bend before troubles..</p>
          <p>Cr. Yet I would have thee know that o'er-stubborn <lb/>
            spirits are most often humbled ; 'tis the stiffest iron, baked <lb/>
            to hardness in the fire, that thou shalt oftenest see snapped <lb/>
            and shivered; and I have seen horses that show temper <lb/>
            brought to order by a little curb; there is no room for <lb/>
            pride, when thou art thy neighbour's slave. This girl was <lb/>
            already versed in insolence when she transgressed the <lb/>
            laws that had been set forth; and, that done, lo! a second <lb/>
            insult-to vaunt of this, and exult in her deed.</p>
          <p>Now verily I am no man, she is the man, if this victory <lb/>
            shall rest with her, and bring no penalty. No! be she <lb/>
            sister's child, or nearer to me in blood than any that wor­ <lb/>
            ships Zeus at the altar of our house—she and her kinsfolk <lb/>
            shall not avoid a doom most dire; for indeed I charge <lb/>
            that other with a like share in the plotting of this burial.</p>
          <p>And summon her-for I saw her e'en now within- <lb/>
            raving, and not mistress of her wits. So oft, before the <lb/>
            deed, the mind stands self-convicted in its treason, when <lb/>
            folks are plotting mischief in the dark. But verily this, <lb/>
            too, is hateful-when one who hath been caught in <lb/>
            wickedness then seeks to make the crime a glory.</p>
          <p>An. Wouldst thou do more than take and slay me?</p>
          <p>Cr. No more, indeed ; having that, I have all.</p>
          <p>An. Why then dost thou delay? In thy discourse <lb/>
            there is naught that pleases me—never may there be !­ <lb/>
            and so my words must needs be unpleasing to thee. And <lb/>
            yet, for glory-whence could I have won a nobler, than <lb/>
            by giving burial to mine own brother ? All here would <lb/>
            own that they thought it well, were not their lips sealed <lb/>
            by fear. But royalty, blest in so much besides, hath the <lb/>

            them ?</p>
          <p>An. No; there is nothing shameful in piety to a <lb/>
            brother.</p>
          <p>Cr. Was it not a brother, too, that died in the op­ <lb/>
            posite cause ?</p>
          <p>An. Brother by the same mother and the same sire.</p>
          <p>Cr. Why, then, dost thou render a grace that is it-a- <lb/>
            pious in his sight ?</p>
          <p>An. The dead man will not say that he so deems it.</p>
          <p>Cr. Yea, if thou makest him but equal in honour with <lb/>
            the wicked.</p>
          <p>An. It was his brother, not his slave, that perished.</p>
          <p>Cr. Wasting this land ; while he fell as its champion.</p>
          <p>An. Nevertheless, Hades desires these rites.</p>
          <p>Cr. But the good desires not a like portion with the <lb/>
            evil.</p>
          <p>An. Who knows but this seems blameless in the world <lb/>
            below ?</p>
          <p>Cr. A foe is never a friend-not even in death.</p>
          <p>An. 'Tis not my nature to join in hating, but in loving.</p>
          <p>Cr. Pass, then, to the world of the dead, and, if thou <lb/>

            the untiring months of the gods can master; but thou, a <lb/>
            ruler to whom time brings not old age, dwellest in the <lb/>
            dazzling splendour of Olympus.</p>
          <p>And through the future, near and far, as through the <lb/>
            past, shall this law hold good : Nothing that is vast enters <lb/>
            into the life of mortals without a curse.</p>
          <p>For that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to many <lb/>
            men a comfort, but to many a false lure of giddy desires; <lb/>
            and the disappointment comes on one who knoweth naught <lb/>
            till he burn his foot against the hot fire.</p>
          <p>For with wisdom hath some one given forth the fa­ <lb/>
            mous saying, that evil seems good, soon or late, to him <lb/>
            whose mind the god draws to mischief; and but for the <lb/>
            briefest space doth he fare free of woe.</p>
          <p>But lo, Hæmon, the last of thy sons--comes he griev­ <lb/>
            ing for the doom of his promised bride, Antigone, and <lb/>
            bitter for the baffled hope of his marriage ?</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Enter HÆMON</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Cr. We shall know soon, better than seers could tell <lb/>
            us.—My son, hearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed, <lb/>
            art thou come in rage against thy father? Or have I thy <lb/>
            good-will, act how I may ?</p>
          <p>Hœ. Father, I am thine; and thou, in thy wisdom, <lb/>
            tracest for me rules which I shall follow. No marriage <lb/>
            shall be deemed by me a greater gain than thy good <lb/>
            guidance.</p>
          <p>Cr. Yea, this, my son, should be thy heart's fixed law <lb/>
            -in all things to obey thy father's will. 'Tis for this that <lb/>
            men pray to see dutiful children grow up around them in <lb/>
            their homes-that such may requite their father's foe with <lb/>
            evil, and honour, as their father doth, his friend. But he <lb/>
            who begets unprofitable children-what shall we say that <lb/>
            he hath sown, but troubles for himself, and much triumph <lb/>
            for his foes? Then do not thou, my son, at pleasure's <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
             <lb/>
            beck, dethrone thy reason for a woman's sake; knowing <lb/>
            that this is a joy that soon grows cold in clasping arms­ <lb/>
            an evil woman to share thy bed and thy home. For what <lb/>
            wound could strike deeper than a false friend ? Nay, with <lb/>
            loathing, and as if she were thine enemy, let this girl go <lb/>
            to find a husband in the house of Hades. For since I <lb/>
            have taken her, alone of all the city, in open disobedi­ <lb/>
            ence, I will not make myself a liar to my people—I will <lb/>
            slay her.</p>
          <p>So let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred <lb/>
            blood. If I am to nurture mine own kindred in naughti­ <lb/>
            ness, needs must I bear with it in aliens. He who does <lb/>
            his duty in his own household will be found righteous in <lb/>
            the state also. But if any one transgresses, and does vio­ <lb/>
            lence to the laws, or thinks to dictate to his rulers, such <lb/>
            a one can win no praise from me. No, whomsoever the <lb/>
            city may appoint, that man must be obeyed, in little <lb/>
            things and great, in just things and unjust; and I should <lb/>
            feel sure that one who thus obeys would be a good ruler <lb/>
            no less than a good subject, and in the storm of spears <lb/>
            would stand his ground where he was set, loyal and <lb/>
            dauntless at his comrade's side.</p>
          <p>But disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that <lb/>
            ruins cities ; this makes homes desolate ; by this, the ranks <lb/>
            of allies are broken into headlong rout: but, of the lives <lb/>
            whose course is fair, the greater part owes safety to obe­ <lb/>
            dience. Therefore we must support the cause of order, <lb/>
            and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us. Better to <lb/>
            fall from power, if we must, by a man's hand; then we <lb/>
            should not be called weaker than a woman.</p>
          <p>Ch. To us, unless our years have stolen our wit thou <lb/>
            seemest to say wisely what thou sayest.</p>
          <p>Hœ. Father, the gods implant reason in men, the <lb/>
            highest of all things that we call our own. Not mine <lb/>
            the skill-far from me be the quest !-to say wherein thou <lb/>
            peakest not aright; and yet another man, too, might have <lb/>
            tome useful thought. At least, it is my natural office to <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            watch, on thy behalf, all that men say, or do, or find to <lb/>
            blame. For the dread of thy frown forbids the citizen to <lb/>
            speak such words as would offend thine ear; but I can <lb/>
            hear these murmurs in the dark, these meanings of the <lb/>
            city for this maiden; " No woman," they say, "ever mer­ <lb/>
            ited her doom less-none ever was to die so shamefully <lb/>
            for deeds so glorious as hers ; who, when her own brother <lb/>
            had fallen in bloody strife, would not leave him unburied, <lb/>
            to be devoured by carrion dogs, or by any bird:—de­ <lb/>
            serves not sIze the meed of golden honour?”</p>
          <p>Such is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret. <lb/>
            For me, my father, no treasure is so precious as thy wel­ <lb/>
            fare. What, indeed, is a nobler ornament for children <lb/>
            than a prospering sire's fair fame, or for sire than son's ? <lb/>
            Wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; think not that <lb/>
            thy word, and thine alone, must be right. For if any man <lb/>
            thinks that he alone is wise-that in speech, or in mind, <lb/>
            he hath no peer-such a soul, when laid open, is ever <lb/>
            found empty.</p>
          <p>No, though a man be wise, 'tis no shame for him to <lb/>
            learn many things, and to bend in season. Seest thou, <lb/>
            beside the wintry torrent's course, how the trees that <lb/>
            yield to it save every twig, while the stiff-necked perish <lb/>
            root and branch? And even thus he who keeps the sheet <lb/>
            of his sail taut, and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and <lb/>
            finishes his voyage with keel uppermost.</p>
          <p>Nay, forego thy wrath ; permit thyself to change. For <lb/>
            if I, a younger man, may offer my thought, it were far <lb/>
            best, I ween, that men should be all-wise by nature ; but, <lb/>
            otherwise-and oft the scale inclines not so—’tis good <lb/>
            also to learn from those who speak aright.</p>
          <p>Ch. Sire, 'tis meet that thou shouldst profit by his <lb/>
            words, if he speaks aught in season, and thou, Hæmon, <lb/>
            by thy father's ; for on both parts there hath been wise <lb/>
            speech.</p>
          <p>Cr. Men of my age-are we indeed to be schooled, <lb/>
            then, by men of his?</p><pb n="124"/>
            
          <p>Hœ. In nothing that is not right; but if I am young, <lb/>
            thou shouldst look to my merits, not to my years.</p>
          <p>Cr. Is it a merit to honour the unruly ?</p>
          <p>Hœ. I could wish no one to show respect for evil-doers.</p>
          <p>Cr. Then is not she tainted with that malady ?</p>
          <p>Hœ. Our Theban folk, with one voice, denies it.</p>
          <p>Cr. Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule?</p>
          <p>Hæ. See, there thou hast spoken like a youth indeed.</p>
          <p>Cr. Am I to rule this land by other judgment than <lb/>
            mine own ?</p>
          <p>Hœ. That is no city, which belongs to one man.</p>
          <p>Cr. Is not the city held to be the ruler's?</p>
          <p>Hœ. Thou wouldst make a good monarch of a desert.</p>
          <p>Cr. This boy, it seems, is the woman's champion.</p>
          <p>Hœ. If thou art a woman; indeed, my care is for thee.</p>

          <p>Cr. Do I offend, when I respect mine own preroga­ <lb/>

          <p>Hœ. Thou dost not respect them, when thou tramplest <lb/>
            on the gods' honours.</p>
          <p>Cr. 0 dastard nature, yielding place to a woman!</p>
          <p>Hœ. Thou wilt never find me. yield to baseness.</p>
          <p>Cr. All thy words, at least, plead for that girl.</p>
          <p>Hœ. And for thee, and for me, and for the gods below.</p>
          <p>Cr. Thou canst never marry her, on this side the grave.</p>
          <p>Hœ. Then she must die, and in death destroy another.</p>
          <p>Cr. How! doth thy boldness run to open threats?</p>
          <p>Hœ. What threat is it, to combat vain resolves?</p>
          <p>Cr. Thou shalt rue thy witless teaching of wisdom. <lb/>
            Hœ. Wert thou not my father, I would have called <lb/>
            thee unwise.</p>
          <p>Cr. Thou woman's slave, use not wheedling speech <lb/>
            with me.</p>
          <p>Hœ. Thou wouldst speak, and then hear no reply?</p>
          <p>Cr. Sayest thou so? Now, by the heaven above us­ <lb/>
            be sure of it-thou shalt smart for taunting me in this <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            opprobrious strain.-Bring forth that hated thing, that <lb/>
            she may die forthwith in his presence-before his eyes­ <lb/>
            at her bridegroom's side!</p>
          <p>Hce. No, not at my side-never think it-shall she per­ <lb/>
            ish ; nor shalt thou ever set eyes more upon my face :­ <lb/>
            rave, then, with such friends as can endure thee. <lb/>
            [Exit HÆMON.</p>
          <p>Ch. The man is gone, 0 King, in angry haste ; a youth­ <lb/>
            ful mind, when stung, is fierce.</p>
          <p>Cr. Let him do, or dream, more than man—good speed <lb/>
            to him!—But he shall not save these two girls from their <lb/>
            doom.</p>
          <p>Ch. Dost thou indeed purpose to slay both ?</p>
          <p>Cr. Not her whose hands are pure: thou sayest well.</p>
          <p>Ch. And by what doom mean'st thou to slay the <lb/>
            other ?</p>
          <p>Cr. I will take her where the path is loneliest, and <lb/>
            hide her, living, in a rocky vault, with so much food set <lb/>
            forth as piety prescribes, that the city may avoid a public <lb/>
            stain. And there, praying to Hades, the only god whom <lb/>
            she worships, perchance she will obtain release from <lb/>
            death; or else will learn, at last, though late, that it is <lb/>
            lost labour to revere the dead. [Exit CREON.</p>
          <p>Ch. Love, unconquered in the fight, Love, who makest <lb/>
            havoc of wealth, who keepest thy vigil on the soft cheek <lb/>
            of a maiden ; thou roamest over the sea, and among the <lb/>
            homes of dwellers in the wilds ; no immortal can escape <lb/>
            thee, nor any among men whose life is for a day; and he <lb/>
            to whom thou hast come is mad. [ANTIGONE is led in.</p>
          <p>The just themselves have their minds warped by thee <lb/>

            present strife of kinsmen; victorious is the love-kindling <lb/>
            light from the eyes of the fair bride; it is a power en­ <lb/>
            throned in sway beside the eternal laws; for there the <lb/>
            goddess Aphrodite is working her unconquerable will.</p>
          <p>But now I also am carried beyond the bounds of <lb/>
            loyalty, and can no more keep back the streaming tears, <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            when I see Antigone thus passing to the bridal chamber <lb/>
            where all are laid to rest.</p>
          <p>An. See me, citizens of my fatherland, setting forth on <lb/>
            my last way, looking my last on the sunlight that is for <lb/>
            me no more; no, Hades, who gives sleep to all, leads me <lb/>
            living to Acheron's shore; who have had no portion in <lb/>
            the chant that brings the bride, nor hath any song been <lb/>
            mine for the crowning of bridals ; whom the lord of the <lb/>
            Dark Lake shall wed.</p>
          <p>Ch. Glorious, therefore, and with praise, thou de­ <lb/>
            partest to that deep place of the dead: wasting sick­ <lb/>
            ness hath not smitten thee; thou hast not found the <lb/>
            wages of the sword ; no, mistress of thine own fate, and <lb/>
            still alive, thou shalt pass to Hades, as no other of mortal <lb/>
            kind hath passed.</p>
          <p>An. I have heard in other days how dread a doom <lb/>
            befell our Phrygian guest, the daughter of Tantalus, on <lb/>
            the Sipylian heights ; how, like clinging ivy, the growth of <lb/>
            stone subdued her ; and the rains fail not, as men tell, <lb/>
            from her wasting form, nor fails the snow, while beneath <lb/>
            her weeping lids the tears bedew her bosom ; and most <lb/>
            like to hers is the fate that brings me to my rest.</p>
          <p>Ch. Yet she was a goddess, thou knowest, and born of <lb/>
            gods; we are mortals, and of mortal race. But, 'tis great <lb/>
            renown for a woman who hath perished that she should <lb/>
            have shared the doom of the godlike, in her life, and <lb/>
            afterward in death.</p>
          <p>An. Ah, I am mocked! In the name of our fathers' <lb/>
            gods, can ye not wait till I am gone-must ye taunt me <lb/>
            to ray face, 0 my city, and ye, her wealthy sons? Ah, <lb/>
            fount of Dircè, and thou holy ground of Thebè whose <lb/>
            chariots are many ; ye, at least, will bear me witness, in <lb/>
            what sort, unwept of friends, and by what laws I pass to <lb/>
            the rock-closed prison of my strange tomb, ah me, un­ <lb/>
            happy ! who have no home on- the earth or in the shades, <lb/>
            no home with the living or with the dead.</p>
          <p>Ch. Thou hast rushed forward to the utmost verge of <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            daring ; and against that throne where Justice sits on <lb/>
            high thou hast fallen, my daughter, with a grievous <lb/>
            fall. But in this ordeal thou art paying, haply, for thy <lb/>
            father's sin.</p>
          <p>An. Thou hast touched on my bitterest thought- <lb/>
            awaking the ever-new lament for my sire and for all the <lb/>
            doom given to us, the famed house of Labdacus. Alas <lb/>
            for the horrors of the mother's bed ! alas for the wretched <lb/>
            mother's slumber at the side of her own son—and my sire! <lb/>
            From what manner of parents did I take my miserable <lb/>
            being ! And to them I go thus, accursed, unwed, to share <lb/>
            their home. Alas, my brother, ill-starred in thy marriage, <lb/>
            in thy death thou hast undone my life!</p>
          <p>Ch. Reverent action claims a certain praise for rever­ <lb/>
            ence ; but an offence against power can not be brooked <lb/>
            by him who hath power in his keeping. Thy self-willed <lb/>
            temper hath wrought thy ruin.</p>
          <p>An. Unwept, unfriended, without marriage-song, I am <lb/>
            led forth in my sorrow on this journey that can be de­ <lb/>
            layed no more. No longer, hapless one, may I behold yon <lb/>
            day-star's sacred eye; but for my fate no tear is shed, no <lb/>
            friend makes moan.</p>

            one, I go living to the vaults of death.]</p>
          <p>And what law of Heaven have I transgressed ? Why, <lb/>
            hapless one, should I look to the gods any more-what <lb/>
            ally should I invoke-when by piety I have earned the <lb/>
            name of impious? Nay, then, if these things are pleasing <lb/>
            to the gods, when I have suffered mydoom, I shall come <lb/>
            to know my sin; but if the sin is with my judges, I could <lb/>
            wish them no fuller measure of evil than they, on their <lb/>
            part, mete wrongfully to me.</p>
          <p>Ch. Still the same tempest of the soul vexes this maiden <lb/>
            with the same fierce gusts.</p>
          <p>Cr. Then for this shall her guards have cause to rue <lb/>
            their slowness.</p>
          <p>An. Ah me! that word hath come very near to death.</p>
          <p>Cr. I can cheer thee with no hope that this doom is <lb/>
            not thus to be fulfilled.</p>
          <p>An. 0 city of my fathers in the land of Theb6! 0 ve <lb/>
            gods, eldest of our race!-they lead me hence-now, now <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            -they tarry not! Behold me, princes of Thebes, the last <lb/>
            daughter of the house of your kings-see what I suffer, <lb/>
            and from whom, because I feared to cast away the fear of <lb/>
            Heaven ! [ANTIGONE is led away by the guards.</p>
          <p>Ch. Even thus endured Danaë in her beauty to change <lb/>
            the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that cham­ <lb/>
            ber, secret as the grave, she was held close prisoner; yet <lb/>
            was she of a proud lineage, 0 my daughter, and charged <lb/>
            with the keeping of the seed of Zeus, that fell in the <lb/>
            golden rain.</p>
          <p>But dreadful is the mysterious power of fate ; there is <lb/>
            no deliverance from it by wealth or by war, by fenced <lb/>
            city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.</p>
          <p>And bonds tamed the son of Dryas, swift to wrath, <lb/>
            that king of the Edonians; so paid he for his frenzied <lb/>
            taunts, when, by the will of Dionysus, he was pent in a <lb/>
            rocky prison. There the fierce exuberance of his madness <lb/>
            slowly passed away. That man learned to know the god, <lb/>
            whom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries; for <lb/>
            he had sought to quell the god-possessed women, and the <lb/>
            Bacchanalian fire; and he angered the Muses that love <lb/>
            the flute.</p>
          <p>And by the waters of the Dark Rocks, the waters of <lb/>
            the twofold sea, are the shores of Bosporus, and Thracian <lb/>
            Salmydessus; where Ares, neighbour to the city, saw the <lb/>
            accursed, blinding wound dealt to the two sons of Phineus <lb/>
            by his fierce wife-the wound that brought darkness to <lb/>
            those vengeance-craving orbs, smitten with her bloody <lb/>
            hands, smitten with her shuttle for a dagger.</p>
          <p>Pining in their misery, they bewailed their cruel doom, <lb/>
            those sons of a mother hapless in her marriage; but she <lb/>
            traced her descent from the ancient line of the Erech­ <lb/>
            theidæ; and in far-distant caves she was nursed amid her <lb/>
            father's storms, that child of Boreas, swift as a steed over <lb/>
            the steep hills, a daughter of gods; yet upon her also the <lb/>
            gray Fates bore hard, my daughter. <note type="footnote"> 9 </note></p><pb n="130"/>
            
          <p>Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy, on the spectators right</p>
          <p>Te. Princes of Thebes, we have come with linked steps, <lb/>
            both served by the eyes of one; for thus, by a guide's <lb/>
            help, the blind must walk.</p>
          <p>Cr. And what, aged Teiresias, are thy tidings?</p>
          <p>Te. I will tell thee; and do thou hearken to the seer.</p>
          <p>Cr. Indeed, it has not been my wont to slight thy <lb/>
            counsel.</p>
          <p>Te. Therefore didst thou steer our city's course aright.</p>
          <p>Cr. I have felt, and can attest, thy benefits.</p>
          <p>Te. Mark that now, once more, thou standest on fate's <lb/>
            fine edge.</p>
          <p>Cr. What means this? How I shudder at thy message!</p>
          <p>Te. Thou wilt learn, when thou nearest the warnings <lb/>
            of mine art. As I took my place on mine old seat of <lb/>
            augury, where all birds have been wont to gather within <lb/>
            my ken, I heard a strange voice among them ; they were <lb/>
            screaming with dire, feverish rage, that drowned their <lb/>
            language in a jargon ; and I knew that they were rend­ <lb/>
            ing each other with their talons, murderously ; the whirr <lb/>
            of wings told no doubtful tale.</p>
          <p>Forthwith, in fear, I essayed burnt-sacrifice on a duly <lb/>
            kindled altar: but from my offerings the Fire-god showed <lb/>
            no flame; a dank moisture, oozing from the thigh-flesh, <lb/>
            trickled forth upon the embers, and smoked, and sput­ <lb/>
            tered ; the gall was scattered to the air; and the stream­ <lb/>
            ing thighs lay bared of the fat that had been wrapped <lb/>
            round them.</p>
          <p>Such was the failure of the rites by which I vainly <lb/>
            asked a sign, as from this boy I learned ; for he is my <lb/>
            guide, as I am guide to others. And 'tis thy counsel that <lb/>
            hath brought this sickness on our state. For the altars of <lb/>
            our city and of our hearths have been tainted, one and <lb/>
            all, by birds and dogs, with carrion from the hapless <lb/>
            corpse, the son of Œdipus: and therefore the gods no <lb/>
            more accept prayer and sacrifice at our hands, or the <lb/>
            flame of meat-offering; nor doth any bird give a clear <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            sign by its shrill cry, for they have tasted the fatness of <lb/>
            a slain man's blood.</p>
          <p>Think, then, on these things, my son. All men are <lb/>
            liable to err; but when an error hath been made, that <lb/>
            man is no longer witless or unblest who heals the ill into <lb/>
            which he hath fallen, and remains not stubborn. Self- <lb/>
            will, we know, incurs the charge of folly. Nay, allow <lb/>
            the claim of the dead; stab not the fallen; what prowess <lb/>
            is it to slay the slain anew ? I have sought thy good, and <lb/>
            for thy good I speak: and never is it sweeter to learn <lb/>
            from a good counsellor than when he counsels for thine <lb/>
            own gain.</p>
          <p>Cr. Old man, ye all shoot your shafts at me, as archers <lb/>
            at the butts; ye must needs practise on me with seer-craft <lb/>
            also; ay, the seer-tribe hath long trafficked in me, and <lb/>
            made me their merchandise. Gain your gains, drive <lb/>
            your trade, if ye list, in the silver-gold of Sardis and the <lb/>
            gold of India; but ye shall not hide that man in the <lb/>
            grave-no, though the eagles of Zeus should bear the <lb/>
            carrion morsels to their Master's throne-no, not for <lb/>
            dread of that defilement will I suffer his burial: for well <lb/>
            I know that no mortal can defile the gods. But, aged <lb/>
            Teiresias, the wisest fall with a shameful fall, when they <lb/>
            clothe shameful thoughts in fair words, for lucre's sake.</p>
          <p>Te. Alas ! Doth any man know, cloth any consider...</p>
          <p>Cr. Whereof ? What general truth dost thou an­ <lb/>
            nounce?</p>
          <p>Te. How precious, above all wealth, is good counsel.</p>
          <p>Cr. As folly, I think, is the worst mischief.</p>
          <p>Te. Yet thou art tainted with that distemper.</p>
          <p>Cr. I would not answer the seer with a taunt.</p>
          <p>Te. But thou dost, in saying that I prophesy falsely.</p>
          <p>Cr. Well, the prophet-tribe was ever fond of money.</p>
          <p>Te. And the race bred of tyrants loves base gain.</p>
          <p>Cr. Knowest thou that thy speech is spoken of thy <lb/>
            king ?</p>
          <p>Te. I know it; for through me thou hast saved Thebes.</p><pb n="132"/>
            
          <p>Cr. Thou art a wise seer; but thou lovest evil deeds.</p>
          <p>Te. Thou wilt rouse me to utter the dread secret in <lb/>
            my soul.</p>
          <p>Cr. Out with it!—Only speak it not for gain.</p>
          <p>Te. Indeed, methinks, I shall not-as touching thee.</p>
          <p>Cr. Know that thou shalt not trade on my resolve.</p>
          <p>Te. Then know thou—ay, know it well-that thou <lb/>
            shalt not live through many more courses of the sun's <lb/>
            swift chariot, ere one begotten of thine own loins shall <lb/>
            have been given by thee, a corpse for corpses; because <lb/>
            thou hast thrust children of the sunlight to the shades, <lb/>
            and ruthlessly lodged a living soul in the grave ; but <lb/>
            keepest in this world one who belongs to the gods in­ <lb/>
            fernal, a corpse unburied, unhonoured, all unhallowed. <lb/>
            In such thou hast no part, nor have the gods above, <lb/>
            but this is a violence done to them by thee. Therefore <lb/>
            the avenging destroyers lie in wait for thee, the Furies <lb/>
            of Hades and of the gods, that thou mayest be taken in <lb/>
            these same ills.</p>
          <p>And mark well if I speak these things as a hireling. <lb/>
            A time not long to be delayed shall awaken the wailing <lb/>
            of men and of women in thy house. And a tumult of <lb/>
            hatred against thee stirs all the cities whose mangled <lb/>
            sons had the burial-rite from dogs, or from wild beasts, <lb/>
            or from some winged bird that bore a polluting breath <lb/>
            to each city that contains the hearths of the dead.</p>
          <p>Such arrows for thy heart-since thou provokes! me— <lb/>
            have I launched at thee, archer-like, in my anger-sure <lb/>
            arrows, of which thou shalt not escape the smart.—Boy, <lb/>
            lead me home, that he may spend his rage on younger <lb/>
            men, and learn to keep a tongue more temperate, and to <lb/>
            bear within his breast a better mind than now he bears. <lb/>

          <p>Cr. I, too, know it well, and am troubled in soul. 'Tis <lb/>
            dire to yield; but, by resistance, to smite my pride with <lb/>

            yield ?</p>
          <p>Ch. Yea, King, and with all speed; for swift harms <lb/>
            from the gods cut short the folly of men.</p>

          <p>Me. Dwellers by the house of Cadmus and of Am­ <lb/>
            phion, there is no estate of mortal life that I would ever <lb/>
            praise or blame as settled. Fortune raises and Fortune <lb/>
            humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to day, and no <lb/>
            one can prophesy to men concerning those things which <lb/>
            are established. For Creon was blest once, as I count <lb/>
            bliss; he had saved this land of Cadmus from its foes; <lb/>
            he was clothed with sole dominion in the land ; he <lb/>
            reigned, the glorious sire of princely children. And <lb/>
            now all hath been lost. For when a man hath forfeited <lb/>
            his pleasures, I count him not as living—I hold him but a <lb/>
            breathing corpse. Heap up riches in thy house, if thou <lb/>
            wilt; live in kingly state; yet, if there be no gladness <lb/>
            therewith, I would not give the shadow of a vapour for <lb/>
            all the rest, compared with joy.</p>
          <p>Ch. And what is this new grief that thou hast to tell <lb/>

            Ch. And who is the slayer? Who the stricken? <lb/>
            Speak.</p>
          <p>Me. Hæmon hath perished ; his blood hath been shed <lb/>
            by no stranger.</p>
          <p>Ch. By his father's hand, or by his own?</p>

          <p>Eu. People of Thebes, I heard your words as I was <lb/>
            going forth, to salute the goddess Pallas with my prayers. <lb/>
            Even as I was loosing the fastenings of the gate, to open <lb/>
            it, the message of a household woe smote on mine ear: I <lb/>
            sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms of my handmaids, <lb/>
            and my senses fled. But say again what the tidings were; <lb/>
            I shall hear them as one who is no stranger to sorrow.</p>
          <p>Me. Dear lady, I will witness of what I saw, and will <lb/>
            leave no word of the truth untold. Why, indeed, should <lb/>
            I soothe thee with words in which I must presently be <lb/>
            found false? Truth is ever best.—I attended thy lord as <lb/>
            his guide to the farthest part of the plain, where the body <lb/>
            of Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay unpitied. We prayed <lb/>
            the goddess of the roads, and Pluto, in mercy to restrain <lb/>
            their wrath ; we washed the dead with holy washing; and <lb/>
            with freshly-plucked boughs we solemnly burned such <lb/>
            relics as there were. We raised a high mound of his na­ <lb/>
            tive earth ; and then we turned away to enter the maid­ <lb/>
            en's nuptial chamber with rocky couch, the caverned <lb/>
            mansion of the bride of Death. And, from afar off, one <lb/>
            of us heard a voice of loud wailing at that bride's unhal­ <lb/>
            lowed bower; and came to tell our master Creon.</p>
          <p>And as the king drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a <lb/>
            bitter cry floated around him ; he groaned, and said in <lb/>
            accents of anguish: " Wretched that I am, can my fore­ <lb/>
            boding be true ? Am I going on the wofullest way that <lb/>
            ever I went ? My son's voice greets me.—Go, my serv­ <lb/>
            ants-haste ye nearer, and when ye have reached the <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            tomb, pass through the gap, where the stones have been <lb/>
            wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth-and look, and <lb/>
            see if 'tis Hæmon's voice that I know, or if mine ear is <lb/>
            cheated by the gods."</p>
          <p>This search, at our despairing master's word, we went <lb/>
            to make ; and in the farthest part of the tomb we descried <lb/>
            her hanging by the neck, slung by a thread-wrought halter <lb/>
            of fine linen; while he was embracing her with arms <lb/>
            thrown around her waist—bewailing the loss of his bride <lb/>
            who is with the dead, and his father's deeds, and his own <lb/>
            ill-starred love.</p>
          <p>But his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a <lb/>
            dread cry, and went in, and called to him with a voice of <lb/>
            wailing: " Unhappy, what a deed hast thou done! What <lb/>
            thought hath come to thee ? What manner of mischance <lb/>
            hath marred thy reason ? Come forth, my child ! I pray <lb/>
            thee—I implore ! " But the boy glared at him with fierce <lb/>
            eyes, spat in his face, and, without a word of answer, drew <lb/>
            his cross-hilted sword : as his father rushed forth in flight, <lb/>
            he missed his aim; then, hapless one, wroth with himself, <lb/>
            he straightway leaned with all his weight against his <lb/>
            sword, and drove it, half its length, into his side; and <lb/>
            while sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint <lb/>
            embrace, and, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek <lb/>
            the swift stream of the oozing blood.</p>
          <p>Corpse enfolding corpse he lies; he has won his nup­ <lb/>

            and he hath witnessed to mankind that, of all curses which <lb/>

            Came back, who, flying, 'scaped the general slaughter. <lb/>
            But nothing save one little circumstance <lb/>
            Or knew, or e'er related.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What was that ? <lb/>
            Much may be learned from that. A little dawn <lb/>
            Of light appearing may discover all.</p>
          <p>Creon. Laius, -attacked by robbers, and oppressed <lb/>
            By numbers, fell. Such is his tale.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Would they- <lb/>
            Would robbers do so desperate a deed, <lb/>
            Unbribed and unassisted ?</p>
          <p>Creon. So, indeed, <lb/>
            Suspicion whispered then. But—Laius dead- <lb/>
            No friend was found to vindicate the wrong.</p>
          <p>Œdi. But what strange cause could stop inquiry thus <lb/>
            Into the murder of a king ?</p>
          <p>Creon. The Sphinx. <lb/>
            Her dire enigma kept our thoughts intent <lb/>
            On present ills, nor gave us time to search <lb/>
            The past mysterious deed.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Myself will try <lb/>
            Soon to unveil it. Thou, Apollo, well, <lb/>
            And well hast thou, my Creon, lent thy aid. <lb/>
            Your CEdipus shall now perform his part. <lb/>
            Yes, I will fight for Phœbus and my country. <lb/>
            And so I ought. For not to friends alone, <lb/>
            Or kindred, owe I this, but to myself. <lb/>
            Who murdered him, perchance would murder me! <lb/>
            His cause is mine. Wherefore, my children, rise; <lb/>
            Take hence your suppliant boughs, and summon here <lb/>
            The race of Cadmus—my assembled people. <lb/>
            Naught shall be left untried. Apollo leads, <lb/>
            And we shall rise to joy, or sink forever.</p>
          <p>Priest. Haste, then, my sons, for this we hither came: <lb/>

          <p>Œdi. Your prayers are heard : and if you will obey <lb/>
            Your king, and hearken to his words, you soon <lb/>
            Shall find relief; myself will heal your woes. <lb/>
            I was a stranger to the dreadful deed, <lb/>
            A stranger e'en to the report till now; <lb/>
            And yet without some traces of the crime <lb/>
            I should not urge this matter; therefore hear me. <lb/>
            I speak to all the citizens of Thebes, <lb/>
            Myself a citizen-observe me well: <lb/>
            If any know the murderer of Laius, <lb/>
            Let him reveal it; I command you all. <lb/>
            But if restrained by dread of punishment <lb/>
            He hide the secret, let him fear no more; <lb/>
            For naught but exile shall attend the crime <lb/>
            Whene'er confessed ; if by a foreign hand <lb/>
            The horrid deed was done, who points him out <lb/>
            Commands our thanks, and meets a sure reward; <lb/>
            But if there be who knows the murderer, <lb/>
            And yet conceals him from us, mark his fate, <lb/>
            Which here I do pronounce : Let none receive <lb/>
            Throughout my kingdom, none hold converse with him, <lb/>
            Nor offer prayer, nor sprinkle o'er his head <lb/>
            The sacred cup ; let him be driven from all, <lb/>
            By all abandoned, and by all accursed, <lb/>
            For so the Delphic oracle declared ; <lb/>
            And therefore to the gods I pay this duty <lb/>
            And to the dead. Oh ! may the guilty wretch, <lb/>
            Whether alone, or by his impious friends <lb/>
            Assisted, he performed the horrid deed, <lb/>
            Denied the common benefits of Nature, <lb/>
            Wear out a painful life ! And oh ! if here, <lb/>
            Within my palace, I conceal the traitor, <lb/>
            On me and mine alight the vengeful curse! <lb/>
            To you, my people, I commit the care <lb/>
            Of this important business; 'tis my cause, <lb/>
            .The cause of Heaven, and your expiring country. <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            E'en if the god had naught declared, to leave <lb/>
            This crime unexpiated were most ungrateful. <lb/>
            He was the best of kings, the best of men; <lb/>
            That sceptre now is mine which Laius bore; <lb/>
            His wife is mine; so would his children be <lb/>
            Did any live; and therefore am I bound, <lb/>
            E'en as he were my father, to revenge him. <lb/>
            Yes, 1 will try to find this murderer, <lb/>
            I owe it to the son of Labdacus, <lb/>
            To Polydorus, Cadmus, and the race <lb/>
            Of great Agenor. Oh ! if yet there are, <lb/>
            Who will not join me in the pious deed, <lb/>
            From such may earth withhold her annual store, <lb/>
            And barren be their bed, their life most wretched, <lb/>
            And their death cruel as the pestilence <lb/>
            That wastes our city ! But on you, my Thebans, <lb/>
            Who wish us fair success, may justice smile <lb/>
            Propitious, and the gods forever bless!</p>
          <p>Chor. 0 king! thy imprecations unappalled <lb/>
            I hear, and join thee, guiltless of the crime, <lb/>
            Nor knowing who committed it. The god <lb/>
            Alone, who gave the oracle, must clear <lb/>
            Its doubtful sense, and point out the offender.</p>
          <p>Œdi. 'Tis true. But who shall force the powers divine <lb/>
            To speak their hidden purpose?</p>
          <p>Chor. One thing more, <lb/>
            If I might speak.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Say on, whate'er thy mind <lb/>
            Shall dictate to thee.</p>

            All-knowing Phoebus, so to mortal men <lb/>

            Shine forth pre-eminent. Perchance his aid <lb/>
            Might much avail us.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Creon did suggest <lb/>
            The same expedient, and by his advice <lb/>
            Twice have I sent for this Tiresias; much <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            I wonder that he comes not.</p>

            We do consult him ; for the idle tales <lb/>
            Which rumour spreads are not to be regarded.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What are those tales? for naught should we <lb/>
            despise.</p>
          <p>Chor. 'Tis said some travellers did attack the king.</p>
          <p>Œdi. It is ; but still no proof appears.</p>
          <p>Chor. And yet, <lb/>
            If it be so, thy dreadful execration <lb/>
            Will force the guilty to confess.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Oh no! <lb/>
            Who fears not to commit the crime will ne'er <lb/>
            Be frightened at the curse that follows it.</p>
          <p>Chor. Behold he comes, who will discover all, <lb/>
            The holy prophet. See! they lead him hither; <lb/>
            He knows the truth and will reveal it to us.</p>

            I here possess, Creon, my faithful friend, <lb/>
            For such I thought him once, would now wrest from me, <lb/>

            This wandering hypocrite, of sharpest sight <lb/>
            When interest prompts, but ignorant and blind <lb/>
            When fools consult him. Tell me, prophet, where <lb/>
            Was all thy art when the abhorred Sphinx <lb/>
            Alarmed our city ? Wherefore did not then <lb/>
            Thy wisdom save us? Then the man divine <lb/>
            Was wanting. But thy birds refused their omens, <lb/>
            Thy god was silent. Then came CEdipus, <lb/>
            This poor, unlearned, uninstructed sage ; <lb/>
            Who not from birds uncertain omens drew, <lb/>
            But by his own sagacious mind explored <lb/>
            The hidden mystery. And now thou com'st <lb/>

            Propped on his staff, and from his native land <lb/>
            Expelled, I see him in a foreign clime <lb/>

            A father and a brother; child and husband <lb/>

            With all its dangers, to an equal rank <lb/>
            In peace and safety? I am not of those <lb/>

            Fools only make such wishes: I have all <lb/>
            From thee, and fearless I enjoy it all: <lb/>
            Had I the sceptre, often must I act <lb/>
            Against my will. Know then, I am not yet <lb/>
            So void of sense and reason as to quit <lb/>
            A real 'vantage for a seeming good. <lb/>
            Am I not happy, am I not revered, <lb/>
            Embraced, and loved by all? To me they come <lb/>
            Who want thy favour, and by me acquire it: <lb/>
            What then should Creon wish for; shall he leave <lb/>
            All this for empire ? Bad desires corrupt <lb/>
            The fairest mind. I never entertained <lb/>
            A thought so vile, nor would I lend my aid <lb/>
            To forward such base purposes. But go <lb/>
            To Delphi, ask the sacred oracle <lb/>
            If I have spoke the truth ; if there you find <lb/>
            That with the prophet I conspired, destroy <lb/>
            The guilty Creon ; not thy voice alone <lb/>
            Shall then condemn me, for myself will join <lb/>
            In the just sentence. But accuse me not <lb/>
            On weak suspicion's most uncertain test. <lb/>
            Justice would never call the wicked good, <lb/>
            Or brand fair virtue with the name of vice, <lb/>
            Unmerited : to cast away a friend, <lb/>
            Faithful and just, is to deprive ourselves <lb/>
            Of life and being, which we hold most dear: <lb/>
            But time and time alone revealeth all; <lb/>
            That only shows the good man's excellence: <lb/>
            A day sufficeth to unmask the wicked.</p>

            O princes! Is this well, at such a time <lb/>
            With idle broils to multiply the woes <lb/>
            Of wretched Thebes? Home, home, for shame ! nor thus <lb/>
            With private quarrels swell the public ruin.</p>
          <p>Creon. Sister, thy husband hath most basely used me; <lb/>
            He threatens me with banishment or death.</p>
          <p>Œdi. I do confess it; for he did conspire <lb/>
            With vile and wicked arts against my life.</p>
          <p>Creon. Oh ! may I never prosper, but accursed, <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            Unpitied, perish if I ever did.</p>
          <p>Joe. Believe him, (Edipus; revere the gods <lb/>
            Whom he contests, it thou dost love Jocasta; <lb/>
            Thy subjects beg it of thee.</p>
          <p>Chor. Hear, 0 king! <lb/>
            Consider, we entreat thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What wouldst have? <lb/>
            Think you I'll e'er submit to him ?</p>
          <p>Chor. Revere <lb/>
            His character, his oath, both pleading for him.</p>
          <p>Œdi. But know you what you ask ?</p>
          <p>Chor. We do.</p>
          <p>Œdi What is it?</p>
          <p>Chor. We ask thee to believe a guiltless friend, <lb/>
            Nor cast him forth dishonoured thus, on slight <lb/>
            Suspicion's weak surmise.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Requesting this, <lb/>
            You do request my banishment, or death.</p>
          <p>Chor. No; by yon leader of the heavenly host, <lb/>
            Th' immortal sun, I had not such a thought; <lb/>
            I only felt for Thebes' distressful state, <lb/>
            And would not have it by domestic strife <lb/>
            Embittered thus.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Why, let him then depart: j <lb/>
            If CEdipus must die, or leave his country <lb/>
            For shameful exile, be it so; I yield <lb/>
            To thy request, not his; for hateful still <lb/>
            Shall Creon ever be.</p>
          <p>Creon. Thy stubborn soul <lb/>
            Bends with reluctance, and when anger fires it <lb/>
            Is terrible ; but natures formed like thine <lb/>
            Are their own punishment.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Wilt thou not hence? <lb/>
            Wilt not begone?</p>
          <p>Creon. I go ; thou knowest me not; <lb/>
            But these will do me justice. [Exit CREON.</p><pb n="167"/>

          <p>Chor. Princess, now <lb/>
            Persuade him to retire.</p>
          <p>Joe. First, let me know <lb/>
            The cause of this dissension.</p>
          <p>Chor. From reports <lb/>
            Uncertain, and suspicions most injurious, <lb/>
            The quarrel rose.</p>
          <p>Joe. Was th' accusation mutual?</p>
          <p>Chor. It was.</p>
          <p>Joe. What followed then?</p>
          <p>Chor. Ask me no more; <lb/>
            Enough s already known ; we 'll not repeat <lb/>
            The woes of hapless Thebes.</p>
          <p>(Edi. You are all blind, <lb/>
            Insensible, unjust; you love me not, <lb/>
            Yet boast your piety.</p>
          <p>Chor. I said before, <lb/>
            Again I say, that not to love my king <lb/>
            E'en as myself, would mark me for the worst <lb/>
            Of men. For thou didst save expiring Thebes. <lb/>
            Oh ! rise once more, protect, preserve thy country!</p>
          <p>Joe. 0 king! inform me, whence this strange dissen­ <lb/>
            sion ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. I'll tell thee, my Jocasta, for thou knowst <lb/>
            The love I bear thee, what this wicked Creon <lb/>
            Did artfully devise against me.</p>
          <p>Joe. Speak it, <lb/>
            If he indeed be guilty.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Creon says <lb/>
            That I did murder Laius.</p>
          <p>Joe. Spake he this <lb/>
            As knowing it himself, or from another?</p>
          <p>Œdi. He had suborned that evil-working priest, <lb/>
            And sharpens every tongue against his king.</p>
          <p>Joe. Let not a fear perplex thee, CEdipus; <lb/>
            Mortals know nothing of futurity, <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            And these prophetic seers are all impostors; <lb/>
            I'll prove it to thee. Know then, Laius once, <lb/>
            Not from Apollo, but his priests, received <lb/>
            An oracle, which said it was decreed <lb/>
            He should be slain by his own son, the offspring <lb/>
            Of Laius and Jocasta. Yet he fell <lb/>
            By strangers, murdered, for so fame reports, <lb/>
            By robbers, in the place where three ways meet. <lb/>
            A son was born, but ere three days had passed <lb/>
            The infant's feet were bored. A servant took <lb/>
            And left him on the pathless mountain's top, <lb/>
            To perish there. Thus Phoebus ne'er decreed <lb/>
            That he should kill his father, or that Laius, <lb/>
            Which much he feared, should by his son be slain. <lb/>
            Such is the truth of oracles. Henceforth <lb/>
            Regard them not. What Heaven would have us know, <lb/>
            It can with ease unfold, and will reveal it. j</p>
          <p>Œdi. What thou hast said, Jocasta, much disturbs me <lb/>
            I tremble at it.</p>
          <p>Joe. Wherefore shouldst thou fear?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Methought I heard thee say, Laius was slain <lb/>
            Where three ways meet.</p>
          <p>Joc. 'Twas so reported then, <lb/>
            And is so still.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Where happened the misfortune?</p>
          <p>Joe. In Phocis, where the roads unite that lead <lb/>
            To Delphi and to Daulia.</p>
          <p>Œdi. How long since?</p>
          <p>Joe. A little time ere you began to reign <lb/>
            O'er Thebes, we heard it.</p>
          <p>Œdi. 0 almighty Jove ! <lb/>
            What wilt thou do with me?</p>
          <p>Joe. Why talkst thou thus?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Ask me no more; but tell me of this Laius: <lb/>
            What was his age and stature ?</p>
          <p>Joe. He was tall; <lb/>
            His hairs just turning to the silver hue ; <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            His form not much unlike thy own.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Oh me! <lb/>
            Sure I have called down curses on myself <lb/>
            Unknowing.</p>
          <p>Joe. Ha! what sayst thou, OEdipus? <lb/>
            I tremble while I look on thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Oh! much <lb/>
            I fear the prophet saw too well; but say, <lb/>
            One thing will make it clear.</p>
          <p>Joe. I dread to hear it; <lb/>
            Yet speak, and I will tell thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Went he forth <lb/>
            With few attendants, or a numerous train, <lb/>
            In kingly pomp?</p>
          <p>Joe. They were but five in all, <lb/>
            The herald with them ; but one chariot there, <lb/>
            Which carried Laius.</p>
          <p>I <lb/>
            (Edi. Oh ! 'tis but too plain. <lb/>
            Who brought the news?</p>
          <p>Joe. A servant, who alone <lb/>
            Escaped with life.</p>
          <p>Œdi. That servant, is he here?</p>
          <p>Joe. Oh, no! His master slain, when he returned <lb/>
            And saw thee on the throne of Thebes, with prayer <lb/>
            Most earnest he beseeched me to dismiss him, <lb/>
            That he might leave this city, where he wished <lb/>
            No longer to be seen, but to retire, <lb/>
            And feed my flocks; I granted his request; <lb/>
            For that and more his honest services <lb/>
            Had merited.</p>
          <p>Œdi. I beg he may be sent for <lb/>
            Immediately.</p>
          <p>Joe. He shall; but wherefore is it ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. I fear thou'st said too much, and therefore wish <lb/>
            To see him.</p>
          <p>Joe. He shall come ; but, 0 my lord ! <lb/>
            Am I not worthy to be told the cause <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            Of this distress?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Thou art, and I will tell thee; <lb/>
            Thou art my hope-to whom should I impart <lb/>
            My sorrows, but to thee? Know then, Jocasta, <lb/>
            I am the son of Poly bus, who reigns <lb/>
            At Corinth, and the Dorian Merope <lb/>
            His queen ; there long I held the foremost rank, <lb/>
            Honoured and happy, when a strange event <lb/>
            (For strange it was, though little meriting <lb/>
            The deep concern I felt) alarmed me much: <lb/>
            A drunken reveller at a feast proclaimed <lb/>
            That I was only the supposed son <lb/>
            Of Corinth's king. Scarce could I bear that day <lb/>
            The vile reproach. The next, I sought my parents <lb/>
            And asked of them the truth ; they too, enraged, <lb/>
            Resented much the base indignity. <lb/>
            I liked their tender warmth, but still I felt <lb/>
            A secret anguish, and, unknown to them, <lb/>
            Sought out the Pythian oracle. In vain. <lb/>
            Touching my parents nothing could I learn; <lb/>
            But dreadful were the miseries it denounced <lb/>
            Against me. 'Twas my fate, Apollo said, <lb/>
            To wed my mother, to produce a race <lb/>
            Accursed and abhorred ; and last, to slay <lb/>
            My father who begat me. Sad decree! <lb/>
            Lest I should e'er fulfil the dire prediction, <lb/>
            Instant I fled from Corinth, by the stars <lb/>
            Guiding my hapless journey to the place <lb/>
            Where thou report'st this wretched king was slain. <lb/>
            But I will tell thee the whole truth. At length <lb/>
            I came to where the three ways meet, when, lo! <lb/>
            A herald, with another man like him <lb/>
            Whom thou describ'st, and in a chariot, met me. <lb/>
            Both strove with violence to drive me back; <lb/>
            Enraged, I struck the charioteer, when straight, <lb/>
            As I advanced, the old man saw, and twice <lb/>
            Smote me o' th' head, but dearly soon repaid <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            The insult on me ; from his chariot rolled <lb/>
            Prone on the earth, beneath my staff he fell, <lb/>
            And instantly expired ! Th' attendant train <lb/>
            All shared his fate. If this unhappy stranger <lb/>
            And Laius be the same, lives there a wretch <lb/>
            So cursed, so hateful to the gods as I am ? <lb/>
            Nor citizen nor alien must receive, <lb/>
            Or converse, or communion hold with me, <lb/>
            But drive me forth with infamy and shame. <lb/>
            The dreadful curse pronounced with my own lips <lb/>
            Shall soon o'ertake me. I have stained the bed <lb/>
            Of him whom I had murdered; am I then <lb/>
            Aught but pollution ? If I fly from hence, <lb/>
            The bed of incest meets me, and I go <lb/>
            To slay my father Polybus, the best, <lb/>
            The tenderest parent. This must be the work <lb/>
            Of some malignant power. Ye righteous gods! <lb/>
            Let me not see that day, but rest in death, <lb/>
            Rather than suffer such calamity.</p>
          <p>Chor. 0 king! we pity thy distress ; but wait <lb/>
            With patience his arrival, and despair not.</p>
          <p>Œdi. That shepherd is my only hope: Jocasta, <lb/>
            Would he were here!</p>
          <p>Joe. Suppose he were ; what then ? <lb/>
            What wouldst thou do ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. I'll tell thee : if he says <lb/>
            The same as thou dost, I am safe and guiltless.</p>
          <p>Joe. What said I then ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Thou saidst he did report <lb/>
            Laius was slain by robbers; if 'tis true <lb/>
            He fell by numbers, I am innocent, <lb/>
            For I was unattended ; if but one <lb/>
            Attacked and slew him, doubtless I am he.</p>
          <p>Joe. Be satisfied it must be as he first <lb/>
            Reported it; he can not change the tale: <lb/>
            Not I alone, but the whole city heard it. <lb/>
            Or grant he should, the oracle was ne'er <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            Fulfilled : for Phoebus said, Jocasta's son <lb/>
            Should slay his father. That could never be ; <lb/>
            For, oh ! Jocasta's son long since is dead. <lb/>
            He could not murder Laius; therefore never <lb/>
            Will I attend to prophecies again.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Right, my Jocasta; but, I beg thee, send <lb/>
            And fetch this shepherd ; do not fail.</p>
          <p>Joe. I will <lb/>
            This moment; come, my lord, let us go in: <lb/>
            I will do nothing but what pleases thee. [Exeunt.</p>

          <p>Sliep. Can you instruct met strangers, which way lies <lb/>
            The palace of King CEdipus? Himself <lb/>
            I would most gladly see. Can you inform me?</p>
          <p>Chor. This is the palace ; he is now within ; <lb/>
            Thou seest his queen before thee.</p>
          <p>Shep. Ever blest <lb/>
            And happy with the happy mayst thou live!</p>
          <p>Joe. Stranger, the same good wish to thee, for well <lb/>
            Thy words deserve it; but say, wherefore com'st thou, <lb/>
            And what's thy news?</p>
          <p>Shep. To thee, and to thy husband, <lb/>
            Pleasure and joy.</p>
          <p>Joe. What pleasure ? And whence art thou ?</p>
          <p>Shep. From Corinth. To be brief, I bring thee tidings <lb/>
            Of good and evil.</p>
          <p>Joe. Ha! what mean thy words <lb/>
            Ambiguous?</p>
          <p>Shep. Know then, if report say true, <lb/>
            The Isthmian people will choose CEdipus <lb/>
            Their sovereign.</p>
          <p>Joe. Is not Poly bus their king?</p>
          <p>Shep. No; Poly bus is dead.</p>
          <p>Joe. What sayst thou? Dead?</p>
          <p>Shep. If I speak falsely, may death seize on me!</p>
          <p>Joe. [to one of her ATTENDANTS]. Why fliest thou not <lb/>
            to tell thy master? Hence! <lb/>
            What are you now, you oracles divine? <lb/>
            Where is your truth ? The fearful Œdipus <lb/>
            From Corinth fled, lest he should slay the king, <lb/>
            This Polybus, who perished, not by him, <lb/>
            But by the hand of Heaven.</p><pb n="175"/>

          </ab>
          <p>Œdi. My dear Jocasta, <lb/>
            Why hast thou called me hither ?</p>
          <p>Joc. Hear this man, <lb/>
            And when thou hear'st him, mark what faith is due <lb/>
            To your revered oracles.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Who is he? <lb/>
            And what doth he report?</p>
          <p>Joc. He comes from Corinth, <lb/>
            And says thy father Polybus is dead.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What sayst thou, stranger? Speak to me—oh! <lb/>
            speak!</p>
          <p>Shep. If touching this thou first desir'st my answer; <lb/>
            Know, he is dead.</p>
          <p>Œdi. How died he ? Say, by treason, <lb/>
            Or some disease?</p>
          <p>Shep. Alas! a little force <lb/>
            Will lay to rest the weary limbs of age.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Distemper then did kill him ?</p>
          <p>Shep. That in part, <lb/>
            And part a length of years that wore him down,</p>
          <p>Œdi. Now, my Jocasta, who shall henceforth trust <lb/>
            To prophecies, and seers, and clamorous birds <lb/>
            With their vain omens-they who had decreed <lb/>
            That I should kill my father? He thou seest <lb/>
            Beneath the earth lies buried, while I live <lb/>
            In safety here and guiltless of his blood: <lb/>
            Unless perhaps sorrow for loss of me <lb/>
            Shortened his days, thus only could I kill <lb/>
            My father. But he's gone, and to the shades <lb/>
            Hath carried with him those vain oracles <lb/>
            Of fancied ills, no longer worth my care.</p>
          <p>Joc: Did I not say it would be thus ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Thou didst; <lb/>
            But I was full of fears.</p>
          <p>Joe. Henceforth, no more <lb/>
            Indulge them.</p><pb n="176"/>
            
          <p>Œdi. But my mother's bed-that still <lb/>
            Must be avoided. I must fly from that.</p>
          <p>Joe. Why should man fear, whom chance, and chance <lb/>
            alone, <lb/>
            Doth ever rule ? Foreknowledge, all is vain, <lb/>
            And can determine nothing. Therefore best <lb/>
            It is to live as fancy leads, at large, <lb/>
            Uncurbed, and only subject to our will. <lb/>
            Fear not thy mother's bed. Ofttimes in dreams <lb/>
            Have men committed incest. But his life <lb/>
            Will ever be most happy who contemns <lb/>
            Such idle phantoms.</p>
          <p>Œdi. I Thou wert right, Jocasta, <lb/>
            Did not my mother live. But as it is, <lb/>
            Spite of thy words, I must be anxious still.</p>
          <p>Joe. Think on thy father's death ; it is a light <lb/>
            To guide thee here.</p>
          <p>Œdi. It is so. Yet I fear <lb/>
            While she survives him.</p>
          <p>Shep. Who is it you mean ? <lb/>
            What woman fear you ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Merope, the wife <lb/>
            Of Polybus.</p>
          <p>Shep. And wherefore fear you her ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Know, stranger, a most dreadful oracle <lb/>
            Concerning her affrights me.</p>
          <p>Shep. May I know it, <lb/>
            Or must it be revealed to none but thee ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Oh, no ! I'll tell thee. Phœbus hath declared <lb/>
            That CEdipus should stain his mother's bed, <lb/>
            And dip his hands in his own father's blood ; <lb/>
            Wherefore I fled from Corinth, and lived here, <lb/>
            In happiness indeed. But still thou knowst <lb/>
            It is a blessing to behold our parents, <lb/>
            And that I had not.</p>
          <p>Shep. Was it for this cause <lb/>
            Thou wert an exile then ?</p><pb n="177"/>
            
          <p>Œdi. It was. I feared <lb/>
            That I might one day prove my father's murderer.</p>
          <p>Shep. What if I come, 0 king ! to banish hence <lb/>
            Thy terrors, and restore thy peace ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Oh, stranger! <lb/>
            Couldst thou do this, I would reward thee nobly.</p>
          <p>Shep. Know then, for this I came. I came to serve, <lb/>
            And make thee happy.</p>
          <p>Œdi. But I will not go <lb/>
            Back to my parents.</p>
          <p>Shep. Son, I see thou knowst not <lb/>
            What thou art doing.</p>
          <p>(Edi. Wherefore thinks! thou so ? <lb/>
            By Heaven I beg thee then do thou instruct me.</p>
          <p>Shep. If thou didst fly from Corinth for this cause</p>
          <p>Œdi. Apollo's dire predictions still affright me.</p>
          <p>.Sep. Fearst thou pollution from thy parents ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. That, <lb/>
            And that alone I dread.</p>
          <p>Shep. Thy fears are vain.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Not if they are my parents.</p>
          <p>Shep. Polybus <lb/>
            Was not akin to thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What sayst thou ? Speak, <lb/>
            Say, was not Polybus my father?</p>
          <p>Shep. No; <lb/>
            No more than he is mine.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Why call me then <lb/>
            His son ?</p>
          <p>Shep. Because long since I gave thee to him— <lb/>
            He did receive thee from these hands.</p>
          <p>Œdi Indeed! <lb/>
            And could he love another's child so well ?</p>
          <p>Shep. He had no children ; that persuaded him <lb/>
            To take and keep thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Didst thou buy me, then, <lb/>
            Or am I thine, and must I call thee father?</p><pb n="178"/>
            
          <p>Shep. I found thee in Cithæron's woody vale.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What brought thee there?</p>
          <p>Shep. I came to feed my flocks <lb/>
            On the green mountain's side.</p>
          <p>Œdi. It seems thou wert <lb/>
            A wandering shepherd.</p>
          <p>Shep. Thy deliverer; <lb/>
            I saved thee from destruction.</p>
          <p>Œdi. How? What then <lb/>
            Had happened to me ?</p>
          <p>Shep. Thy own feet will best <lb/>
            Inform thee of that circumstance.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Alas! <lb/>
            Why callst thou to remembrance a misfortune <lb/>
            Of so long date ?</p>
          <p>Shep. 'Twas I who loosed the tendons <lb/>
            Of thy bored feet.</p>
          <p>Œdi. It seems in infancy <lb/>
            I suffered much, then.</p>
          <p>Shep. To this incident <lb/>
            Thou ow'st thy name.</p>
          <p>Œdi. My father, or my mother, <lb/>
            Who did it ? Knowst thou ?</p>
          <p>Shep. He who gave thee to me <lb/>
            Must tell thee that.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Then from anether's hand <lb/>
            Thou didst receive me.</p>
          <p>Shep. Ay, another shepherd.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Who was he ? Canst thou recollect ?</p>
          <p>Shep. 'Twas one, <lb/>
            At least so called, of Laius' family.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Laius, who ruled at Thebes?</p>
          <p>Shep. The same ; this man <lb/>
            Was shepherd to King Laius.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Lives he still ? <lb/>
            And could I see him ?</p>

            His countrymen, may give you information.</p>
          <p>Œdi. [to the CHORUS]. Oh! speak, my friends, if any <lb/>
            of you know <lb/>
            This shepherd ; whether still he lives at Thebes, <lb/>
            Or in some neighbouring country. Tell me quick, <lb/>
            For it concerns us near.</p>
          <p>Chor. It must be he <lb/>
            Whom thou didst lately send for; but the queen <lb/>
            Can best inform thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Knowst thou, my Jocasta, <lb/>
            Whether the man whom thou didst order hither, <lb/>
            And whom the shepherd speaks of, be the same ?</p>
          <p>Joe. Whom meant he? for I know not. CEdipus, <lb/>
            Think not so deeply of this thing.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Good heaven! <lb/>
            Forbid, Jocasta, I should now neglect <lb/>
            To clear my birth, when thus the path is marked <lb/>
            And open to me.</p>
          <p>Joe. Do not, by the gods <lb/>
            I beg thee, do not, if thy life be dear, <lb/>
            Make further search, for I have felt enough <lb/>
            Already from it.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Rest thou satisfied ; <lb/>
            Were I descended from a race of slaves, <lb/>
            'Twould not dishonour thee.</p>
          <p>Joe. Yet hear me ; do not, <lb/>
            Once more I beg thee, do not search this matter.</p>
          <p>Œdi. I will not be persuaded. I must search <lb/>
            And find it too.</p>
          <p>Joe. I know it best, and best <lb/>
            Advise thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. That advice perplexes more.</p>
          <p>Joe. Oh! would to Heaven that thou mayst never know <lb/>
            Or who or whence thou art!</p>
          <p>Œdi. [to the ATTENDANTS]. Let some one fetch <lb/>
            That shepherd quick, and leave this woman here <lb/>
            To glory in her high descent.</p><pb n="180"/>

            Alas! <lb/>

            Perdition on thee!</p>
          <p>Œdi. Why reprove him thus? <lb/>
            Thou art thyself to blame, old man.</p>
          <p>Old Shep. In what <lb/>
            Am I to blame, my lord ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Thou wilt not speak <lb/>
            Touching this boy.</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Alas! poor man, he knows not <lb/>
            What he hath said.</p>
          <p>Œdi. If not by softer means <lb/>
            To be persuaded, force shall wring it from thee.</p><pb n="183"/>
            
          <p>Old Shep. Treat not an old man harshly.</p>
          <p>Œdi. [to the ATTENDANTS]. Bind his hands.</p>
          <p>Old .Sep. Wherefore, my lord? What wouldst thou <lb/>
            have me do?</p>
          <p>Œdi. That child he talks of, didst thou give it to <lb/>
            him?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. I did; and would to Heaven I then had <lb/>
            died !</p>
          <p>Œdi. Die soon thou shalt, unless thou tellst it all.</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Say, rather if I do.</p>
          <p>Œdi. This fellow means <lb/>
            To trifle with us, by his dull delay.</p>
          <p>Old Shep. I do not; said I not I gave the child ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Whence came the boy ? Was he thy own, or who <lb/>
            Did give him to thee?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. From another hand <lb/>
            I had received him.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Say, what hand ? From whom ? <lb/>
            Whence came he?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Do not-by the gods I beg thee, <lb/>
            Do not inquire !</p>
          <p>Œdi. Force me to ask again, <lb/>
            And thou shalt die !</p>
          <p>Old Shep. In Laius' palace born</p>
          <p>Œdi. Son of a slave, or of the king ?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Alas! <lb/>
            'Tis death for me to speak.</p>
          <p>Œdi. And me to hear; <lb/>
            Yet say it.</p>
          <p>Old Shep. He was called the son of Laius; <lb/>
            But ask the queen, for she can best inform thee.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Did she then give the child to thee?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. She did.</p>
          <p>Œdi. For what?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. To kill him.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Kill her child ! Inhuman <lb/>
            And barbarous mother!</p><pb n="184"/>
            
          <p>Old Shep. A dire oracle <lb/>
            Affrighted, and constrained her to it.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Ha! <lb/>
            What oracle ?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Which said, her son should slay <lb/>
            His parents.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Wherefore gav'st thou then the infant <lb/>
            To this old shepherd ?</p>
          <p>Old Shep. Pity moved me to it: <lb/>
            I hoped he would have soon conveyed his charge <lb/>
            To some far-distant country ; he, alas ! <lb/>
            Preserved him but for misery and woe ; <lb/>
            For, 0 my lord! if thou indeed art he, <lb/>
            Thou art of all mankind the most unhappy.</p>
          <p>Œdi. 0 me ! at length the mystery's unravelled ; <lb/>
            'Tis plain, 'tis clear; my fate is all determined. <lb/>
            Those are my parents who should not have been <lb/>
            Allied to me; she is my wife, e'en she <lb/>
            Whom Nature had forbidden me to wed ; <lb/>
            I have slain him who gave me life; and now <lb/>
            Of thee, 0 light! I take my last farewell, <lb/>

          <p>Messenger. Sages of Thebes, most honoured and re­ <lb/>
            vered, <lb/>
            If e'er the house of Labdacus was dear <lb/>
            And precious to you, what will be your grief <lb/>
            When I shall tell the most disastrous tale <lb/>
            You ever heard, and to your eyes present <lb/>
            A spectacle more dreadful than they yet <lb/>
            Did e'er behold? Not the wide Danube's waves <lb/>
            Nor Phasis' streams can wash away the stains <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            Of this polluted palace; the dire crimes <lb/>
            Long time concealed at length are brought to light; <lb/>
            But those which spring from voluntary guilt <lb/>
            Are still more dreadful.</p>
          <p>Chor. Nothing can be worse <lb/>
            Than that we know already; brings! thou more <lb/>
            Misfortunes to us ?</p>
          <p>Mes. To be brief, the queen, <lb/>
            Divine Jocasta's dead.</p>
          <p>Chor. Jocasta dead ! Say, by what hand?</p>
          <p>Mes. Her own ; <lb/>
            And what's more dreadful, no one saw the deed. <lb/>
            What I myself beheld you all shall hear. <lb/>
            Inflamed with rage, soon as she reached the palace, <lb/>
            Instant retiring to the nuptial bed, <lb/>
            She shut the door, then raved and tore her hair, <lb/>
            Called out on Laius dead, and bade him think <lb/>
            On that unhappy son who murdered him <lb/>
            And stained his bed ; then turning her sad eyes <lb/>
            Upon the guilty couch, she cursed the place <lb/>
            Where she had borne a husband from her husband, <lb/>
            And children from her child ; what followed then <lb/>
            I know not, by the cries of CEdipus <lb/>
            Prevented, for on him our eyes were fixed <lb/>
            Attentive; forth he came, beseeching us <lb/>
            To lend him some sharp weapon, and inform him <lb/>
            Where he might find his mother and his wife, <lb/>
            His children's wretched mother and his own. <lb/>
            Some ill-designing power did then direct him <lb/>
            (For we were silent) to the queen's apartment; <lb/>
            Forcing the bolt, he rushed into the bed, <lb/>
            And found Jocasta, where we all beheld her, <lb/>
            Entangled in the fatal noose, which soon <lb/>
            As he perceived, loosing the pendant rope, <lb/>
            Deeply he groaned, and casting on the ground <lb/>
            His wretched body, showed a piteous sight <lb/>
            To the beholders; on a sudden, thence <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            Starting, he plucked from off the robe she wore <lb/>
            A golden buckle that adorned her side, <lb/>
            And buried in his eyes the sharpened point, <lb/>
            Crying, he ne'er again would look on her, <lb/>
            Never would see his crimes or miseries more, <lb/>
            Or those whom guiltless he could ne'er behold, <lb/>
            Or those to whom he now must sue for aid. <lb/>
            His lifted eyelids then, repeating still <lb/>
            These dreadful plaints, he tore; while down his cheek <lb/>
            Fell showers of blood ! Such fate the wretched pair <lb/>
            Sustained, partakers in calamity, <lb/>
            Fallen from a state of happiness (for none <lb/>
            Were happier once than they) to groans and death, <lb/>
            Reproach and shame, and every human woe.</p>
          <p>Chor. And where is now the poor unhappy man?</p>
          <p>Mes. Open the doors, he cries, and let all Thebes <lb/>
            Behold his parents' murderer, adding words <lb/>
            Not to be uttered ; banished now, he says, <lb/>
            He must be, nor, devoted as he is <lb/>
            By his own curse, remain in this sad place. <lb/>
            He wants a kind conductor and a friend <lb/>
            To help him now, for 'tis too much to bear. <lb/>
            But you will see him soon, for lo! the doors <lb/>
            Are opened, and you will behold a sight <lb/>
            That would to pity move his deadliest foe.</p>

            Shame, terrors, and unutterable woe! <lb/>
            More painful is the memory of my crimes <lb/>
            Than all the wounds my wild distraction made.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thus doubly cursed, 0 prince! I wonder not <lb/>
            At thy affliction.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Art thou here, my friend ? <lb/>
            I know thy voice; thou wouldst not leave the wretched ; <lb/>
            Thou art my faithful, kind assistant still.</p>
          <p>Chor. How couldst thou thus deprive thyself of sight? <lb/>
            What madness drove thee to the desperate deed ? <lb/>
            What god inspired ?</p>
          <p>Œdi. Apollo was the cause; <lb/>
            He was, my friends, the cause of all my woes ; <lb/>
            But for these eyes-myself did quench their light- <lb/>
            I want not them; what use were they to me, <lb/>
            But to discover scenes of endless woe?</p>
          <p>Chor. 'Tis but too true.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What pleasure now remains <lb/>
            For CEdipus? He can not joy in aught <lb/>
            To sight or ear delightful. Curse on him, <lb/>
            Whoe'er he was, that loosened my bound feet, <lb/>
            And saved me, in Cithaeron's vale, from death! <lb/>
            I owe him nothing: had I perished then, <lb/>
            Much happier had it been for you, my friends, <lb/>
            And for myself.</p>
          <p>Chor. I too could wish thou hadst.</p>
          <p>Œdi. I should not then have murdered Laius; then <lb/>
            I had not ta'en Jocasta to my bed ; <lb/>
            But now I am a guilty wretch, the son <lb/>
            Of a polluted mother, father now <lb/>
            To my own brothers, all that's horrible <lb/>
            To Nature is the lot of CEdipus.</p>
          <p>Chor. Yet must I blame this cruel act, for sure <lb/>
            The loss of sight is worse than death itself.</p><pb n="189"/>
            
          <p>Œdi. I care not for thy counsel or thy praise; <lb/>
            For with what eyes could I have e'er beheld <lb/>
            My honoured father in the shades below, <lb/>
            Or my unhappy mother, both destroyed <lb/>
            By me? This punishment is worse than death, <lb/>
            And so it should be. Sweet had been the sight <lb/>
            Of my dear children-them I could have wished <lb/>
            To gaze upon; but I must never see <lb/>
            Or them, or this fair city, or the palace <lb/>
            Where I was born. Deprived of every bliss <lb/>
            By my own lips, which doomed to banishment <lb/>
            The murderer of Laius, and expelled <lb/>
            The impious wretch, by gods and men accursed: <lb/>
            Could I behold them after this? Oh no! <lb/>
            Would I could now with equal ease remove <lb/>
            My hearing too, be deaf as well as blind, <lb/>
            And from another entrance shut out woe! <lb/>
            To want our senses, in the hour of ill, <lb/>
            Is comfort to the wretched. 0 Cithæron ! <lb/>
            Why didst thou e'er receive me, or received, <lb/>
            Why not destroy, that men might never know <lb/>
            Who gave me birth? 0 Poly bus ! 0 Corinth! <lb/>
            And thou, long time believed my father's palace, <lb/>
            Oh! what a foul disgrace to human nature <lb/>
            Didst thou receive beneath a prince's form ! <lb/>
            Impious myself, and from an impious race. <lb/>
            Where is my splendour now? 0 Daulian path! <lb/>
            The shady forest, and the narrow pass <lb/>
            Where three ways meet, who drank a father's blood <lb/>
            Shed by these hands, do you not still remember <lb/>
            The horrid deed, and what, when here I came, <lb/>
            Followed more dreadful ? Fatal nuptials, you <lb/>
            Produced me, you returned me to the womb <lb/>
            That bare me ; thence relations horrible <lb/>
            Of fathers, sons, and brothers came ; of wives, <lb/>
            Sisters, and mothers, sad alliance! all <lb/>
            That man holds impious and detestable. <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            But what in act is vile the modest tongue <lb/>
            Should never name. Bury me, hide me, friends, <lb/>
            From every eye; destroy me, cast me forth <lb/>
            To the wide ocean-let me perish there: <lb/>
            Do anything to shake off hated life. <lb/>
            Seize me; approach, my friends—you need not fear, <lb/>
            Polluted though I am, to touch me; none <lb/>
            Shall suffer for my crimes but I alone.</p>
          <p>Chor. In most fit time, my lord, the noble Creon <lb/>
            This way advances ; he can best determine <lb/>
            And best advise ; sole guardian now of Thebes, <lb/>
            To him thy power devolves.</p>
          <p>Œdi. What shall I say? <lb/>
            Can I apply to him for aid whom late <lb/>

            The censure of your fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            At least respect the all-creating eye <lb/>

            To public view a wretch accursed, polluted, <lb/>
            Whom neither earth can bear, nor sun behold, <lb/>
            Nor holy shower besprinkle. Take him hence <lb/>

            Must be consulted first.</p>
          <p>Œdi. Their will is known <lb/>

          <p>Creon. Thy hapless fate should teach us to believe, <lb/>

            My own Cithaeron, by my parents doomed <lb/>
            Long since to be the grave of Œdipus; <lb/>
            Where would I die, as they decreed I should. <lb/>
            Alas! I can not, must not perish yet, <lb/>
            Till I have suffered evils worse than death, <lb/>
            For I was only saved to be unhappy; <lb/>

            My sons are men, and wheresoever fortune <lb/>

            Ui my dear daughters; hath the gracious Creon, <lb/>
            In pity to my woes, already brought <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE ALCESTIS OF EURIPIDES TRANSLATED BY ARTHUR S. WAY</title>
          </head><pb n="196"/>
          
          <p>EURIPIDES, the son of Mnesarchides and Cleito, was born, 480 B. C., in <lb/>
            Salamis, whither the Athenians had fled before the invading army of the <lb/>
            Persians-tradItion says upon the eve ot the great battle that turned the <lb/>
            tide in favour of Grecian liberty. The wealthy father—Aristophanes <lb/>
            scores him for having made his money in trade-intended to train his <lb/>
            son for the great national games, but Euripides soon put athletics aside <lb/>
            for painting, and that again for literature. He took no part in public <lb/>
            life-as did both Æschylus and Sophocles-was scholarly and almost a <lb/>
            recluse, the friend of Socrates, and pupil of Prodicus, Protagoras, and <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, and was the first Athenian to own a considerable private <lb/>
            library. He married twice, both times unhappily, and left two sons. <lb/>
            He is said to have been a bitter woman-hater in his old age. He pro­ <lb/>
            duced his first play in 455 B. c., at which time Æschylus was dead, Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles had been before the public thirteen years, and Aristophanes, to be <lb/>
            his greatest enemy, had not come into the world. But it was 441 B. C. <lb/>
            before he was awarded a first prize in the contest. He received first prize <lb/>
            only five times. He wrote ninety-two plays, eighteen of which have <lb/>
            survived: "Alcestis," “Medea,” ‟ Hippolytus," ‟ Hecuba," ‟ Ion," <lb/>
            ‟ Suppliants," ‟ Andromache," ‟ Heraclidæ,” ‟ Troades,” ‟Electra,” <lb/>
            ‟ Helena," ‟ Hercules Furens," ‟ Phoenissae,” ‟ Orestes," It Iphigeneia <lb/>
            in Aulis," ‟ Iphigeneia in Taurus," ‟ Bacchæ, ‟ Cyclops," a satyr- <lb/>
            drama, and the doubtful play It Rhesus." Euripides was the most human <lb/>
            of the three great tragedians, and perhaps he makes up in this what he <lb/>
            may lose in comparison with Æschylus and Sophocles on the score of <lb/>
            grandeur. He was very popular during his life, and at his death, which <lb/>
            occurred in 406 B. c., at the court of the great literary patron, Archelaus <lb/>
            of Macedonia, Sophocles and all Athens put on mourning for him, and <lb/>
            the ‟ Bacchæ,” ‟ Iphigeneia in Aulis," and perhaps ‟ Iphigeneia in <lb/>
            Taurus," were magnificently played at the theatre. He was Aristotle's <lb/>
            favourite author, and has held a high place in the esteem of many an­ <lb/>
            dent and modern writers.</p><pb n="197"/>
            
          <p><lb/>
            ApOLLO, being banished for a season from Olympus, and <lb/>
            condemned to do service to a mortal, became herdsman of <lb/>
            Admetus, King of Pheræ in Thessaly. Yet he loathed not his <lb/>
            earthly taskmaster, but loved him, for that he was a just man, <lb/>
            and hospitable exceedingly. Wherefore he obtained from the <lb/>
            Fates this boon for Admetus, that, when his hour of death <lb/>
            should come, they should accept in ransom for his life the life <lb/>
            of whosoever should have before consented to die in his stead. <lb/>
            Now when this was made known, none of them who were <lb/>
            nearest by blood to the king would promise to be his ransom <lb/>
            in that day. Then Alcestis his wife, the daughter of Pelias, <lb/>
            King of Iolkos, pledged her to die for him. Of her love she <lb/>
            did it, and for the honour of wifehood. And the years passed <lb/>
            by, and the tale was told in many lands; and all men praised <lb/>
            Alcestis, but Admetus bore a burden of sorrow, for day by day <lb/>
            she became dearer to him, a wife wholly true, a mother most <lb/>
            loving, and a lady to her thralls gentle exceedingly. But <lb/>
            when it was known by tokens that the day was come, Admetus <lb/>
            repented him sorely, but it availed not, for no mortal may <lb/>
            recall a pledge once given to the gods. And on that day there <lb/>
            came to the palace Apollo to plead with Death for Alcestis's <lb/>
            sake; and a company of elders of Pheræ, to ask of her state <lb/>
            and to make mourning for her. And when she was dead, ere <lb/>
            she was borne forth to burial, came Herakles, son of Zeus, in <lb/>
            his journeying, seeking the guest's right of meat and lodging, <lb/>
            but not knowing aught of that which had come to pass. Of <lb/>
            him was a great deliverance wrought, which is told herein.</p><pb n="198"/>

            Wroth for the dead, his smiths of heavenly fire <lb/>
            I slew, the Cyclopes; and, for blood-atonement, <lb/>

            To grieve at all mischance unto thy lords <lb/>
            May be forgiven; but if thy lady lives <lb/>
            Or even now hath passed, fain would we know.</p>

            What must the woman be who passeth her? <lb/>

            And this—yea, all the city knoweth this. <lb/>
            But what within she did, hear thou, and marvel. <lb/>
            For when she knew that the appointed day <lb/>
            Was come, in river-water her white skin <lb/>
            She bathed, and from the cedar-chests took forth <lb/>
            Vesture and jewels, and decked her gloriously, <lb/>
            And stood before the hearth, and prayed, and said: <lb/>
            " Queen, for I pass beneath the earth, I fall <lb/>
            Before thee now, and nevermore, and pray:- <lb/>
            Be mother to my orphans: mate with him <lb/>

            A loving wife, with her a noble husband. <lb/>
            Nor, as their mother dieth, so may they, <lb/>
            My children, die untimely, but with weal <lb/>
            In the home-land fill up a life of bliss." <lb/>
            To all the altars through Admetus' halls <lb/>
            She went, with wreaths she hung them, and she prayed, <lb/>
            Plucking the while the tresses of the myrtle, <lb/>
            Tearless, unsighing, and the imminent fate <lb/>
            Changed not the lovely rose-tint of her cheek. <lb/>
            Then to her bower she rushed, fell on the bed ; <lb/>
            And there, oh, there she wept, and thus she speaks:</p>
          <p>“ 0 couch, whereon I loosed the maiden zone <lb/>
            For this man, for whose sake I die to-day, <lb/>
            Farewell: I hate thee not. Me hast thou lost, <lb/>
            Me only: loath to fail thee and my lord <lb/>
            I die: but thee another bride shall own, <lb/>
            Not more true-hearted ; happier perchance." <lb/>
            Then falls thereon, and kisses: all the bed <lb/>
            Is watered with the flood of melting eyes. <lb/>
            But having wept her fill of many tears, <lb/>
            Drooping she goeth, reeling from the couch; <lb/>
            Yet oft, as forth the bower she passed, returned, <lb/>
            And flung herself again upon the couch. <lb/>
            And the babes, clinging to their mother's robes, <lb/>
            Were weeping: and she clasped them in her arms, <lb/>
            Fondling now this, now that, as one death-doomed. <lb/>
            And all the servants 'neath the roof were weeping, <lb/>
            Pitying their lady. But to each she stretched <lb/>
            Her right hand forth; and none there was so mean <lb/>
            To whom she spake not and received reply. <lb/>
            Such are the ills Admetus' home within. <lb/>
            Now, had he died, he had ended : but in 'scaping, <lb/>
            He bears a pain that he shall ne'er forget.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Doth not Admetus groan for this affliction <lb/>
            Of such a noble wife to be bereft?</p>
          <p>Handmaid. Ay, weeps, and clasps his dear one in his <lb/>

            And prays, " Forsake me not! "-asking the while <lb/>
            The impossible, for still she wanes and wastes, <lb/>
            Drooping her hand, a misery-burdened weight. <lb/>
            But yet, albeit hardly breathing now, <lb/>
            To the sun's rays fain would she lift her eyes, <lb/>
            As never more, but for the last time then <lb/>
            Destined to see the sun's beam and his orb. <lb/>
            But I will go and make thy presence known: <lb/>
            For 'tis not all that love so well their kings <lb/>
            As to stand by them, in afflictions loyal. <lb/>

          <p>Chorus. Fear not; for I am bold to speak for him <lb/>
            This will he do, an if he be not mad.</p>
          <p>Admetus. It shall, it shall be, dread not thou : for thee <lb/>
            Living I had ; and dead, mine only wife <lb/>
            Shalt thou be called: nor ever in thy stead <lb/>
            Shall bride Thessalian hail me as her lord. <lb/>
            None is there of a father so high-born, <lb/>
            None so for beauty peerless among women. <lb/>
            Children enough have I: I pray the gods <lb/>
            For joy in these—our joy in thee is naught. <lb/>
            Not for a year's space will I mourn for thee, <lb/>
            But long as this my life shall last, dear wife, <lb/>
            Loathing my mother, hating mine own sire, <lb/>
            For in word only, not in deed, they loved me. <lb/>
            Thou gav'st in ransom for my life thine all <lb/>
            Of precious, and didst save. Do I not well <lb/>
            To groan, who lose such yokefellow in thee ? <lb/>
            Revels shall cease, and gatherings at the wine, <lb/>
            Garlands, and song, which wont to fill mine house. <lb/>
            For never more mine hand shall touch the lyre : <lb/>
            Nor will I lift up heart to sing to flute <lb/>
            Of Libya: thou hast robbed my life of mirth. <lb/>
            And, wrought by craftsmen’s cunning hands, thy form <lb/>
            Imaged, upon a couch outstretched shall lie, <lb/>
            Falling whereon, and clasping with mine hands, <lb/>
            Calling thy name, in fancy shall mine arms <lb/>
            Hold my beloved, though I hold her not- <lb/>
            A chill delight, I wot—yet shall I lift <lb/>
            The burden from my soul. In dreams shalt thou <lb/>
            Haunt me and gladden: sweet to see the loved, <lb/>
            Though but a fleeting presence night-revealed. <lb/>
            But, were the tongue and strain of Orpheus mine, <lb/>
            To witch Demeter's daughter and her lord, <lb/>
            And out of Hades by my song to win thee, <lb/>
            I had fared down: nor Pluto's hound had stayed me, <lb/>
            Nor spirit-wafter Charon at the oar, <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            Or ever I restored thy life to light. <lb/>
            Yet there look thou for me, whenso I die; <lb/>
            Prepare a home, as who shall dwell with me. <lb/>
            For in the selfsame cedar chest, wherein <lb/>
            Thou liest, will I bid them lay my bones <lb/>
            Outstretched beside thee: ne'er may I be severed, <lb/>
            No, not in death, from thee, my one true friend.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Yea, I withal will mourn, as friend with friend <lb/>
            With thee for this thy wife, for she is worthy.</p>
          <p>Alcestis. My children, ye yourselves have heard all this, <lb/>
            Have heard your father pledge him ne'er to wed <lb/>
            For your oppression and for my dishonour.</p>
          <p>Admetus. Yea, now I say it, and I will perform.</p>
          <p>Alcestis. On these terms take the children from mine <lb/>

          <p>Admetus. I take them-precious gift from precious <lb/>
            hand.</p>
          <p>Alcestis. Be to these babes a mother in my stead.</p>
          <p>Admetus. Sore is their need, who are bereft of thee.</p>
          <p>Alcestis. Darlings, I should have lived; and lo, I die.</p>

            Never again, 0 my father, she seeth the light of the sun ! <lb/>
            In anguish she leaves us forsaken: the story is ended, is <lb/>
            ended, <lb/>
            Of her sheltering love, and the tale of the motherless <lb/>
            life is begun. <lb/>

            And I are stricken with a heavy doom. <lb/>
            Eumelus. And I am but a little one, father-so young, <lb/>

            hast taken, <lb/>
            Which thy brother may bear not alone, and a weariful <lb/>

            O father, of long-living love was thy marriage uncher­ <lb/>

            Thou hast won not the goal of old age with the love of <lb/>

            Nor first of mortals thou, nor shalt be last <lb/>
            To lose a noble wife ; and, be thou sure, <lb/>
            From us, from all, this debt is due—to die.</p>
          <p>Admetus. I know it: nowise unforeseen this ill <lb/>
            Hath swooped upon me: long I grieved to know it. <lb/>
            But-for to burial must I bear my dead- <lb/>
            Stay ye, and, tarrying, echo back my wail <lb/>
            To that dark god whom no drink-offerings move. <lb/>
            And all Thessalians over whom I rule <lb/>
            I bid take part in mourning for this woman, <lb/>
            With shaven head and sable-shrouding robe. <lb/>
            And ye which yoke the cars four-horsed, or steeds <lb/>
            Of single frontlet, shear with steel their manes. <lb/>
            Music of flutes the city through, or lyres, <lb/>
            Be none, while twelve moons round their circles out: <lb/>
            For dearer dead, nor kinder unto me <lb/>
            I shall not bury : worthy of mine honour <lb/>
            Is she, for she alone hath died for me. [Exit.</p>

            None will gainsay : yet these calamities <lb/>

            Receive these ornaments, and let her pass <lb/>
            Beneath the earth: well may the corpse be honoured <lb/>
            Of her who for thy life's sake died, my son; <lb/>
            Who made me not unchilded, left me not <lb/>
            Forlorn of thee to pine in woeful eld. <lb/>
            In all her sisters' eyes she hath crowned her life <lb/>

            To thy wife’s breast was I brought privily, <lb/>
            Put to the test, thou showedst who thou art, <lb/>

            Yet here was honour, hadst thou dared the strife, <lb/>

            To cling to life in any wise was left. <lb/>
            Then had I lived, and she, through days to come, <lb/>

            O'er many folk thou rulest; wide demesnes <lb/>

            Long, and our life-space short, yet is it sweet. <lb/>
            Shamelessly hast thou fought against thy death: <lb/>
            Thy life is but transgression of thy doom <lb/>
            And murder of thy wife—my cowardice! <lb/>

            Cunning device hast thou devised to die <lb/>

            Elektryon's child Alkmene, unto Zeus. <lb/>
            For I must save the woman newly dead, <lb/>

            Albeit smitten with affliction sore, <lb/>
            But hid it, like a prince, respecting me. <lb/>

          <p>Thy wife hath departed: <lb/>

            For naught of grief shall touch her any more, <lb/>

            Shall I find joy of entering ?-whither turn me ? <lb/>
            The solitude within shall drive me forth, <lb/>
            Whenso I see my wife's couch tenantless, <lb/>
            And seats whereon she sat, and, 'neath the roof, <lb/>
            All foul the floor; when on my knees my babes <lb/>
            Falling shall weep their mother, servants moan <lb/>
            The peerless mistress from the mansion lost. <lb/>
            All this within: but from the world without <lb/>
            Shall bridals of Thessalians chase me : throngs <lb/>
            Where women gossip ; for I shall not bear <lb/>
            On those companions of my wife to look. <lb/>
            And, if a foq I have, thus shall he scoff : <lb/>
            " Lo there who basely liveth—dared not die, <lb/>

            Murmurs unvoiced. I came mid thine affliction. <lb/>
            Fair claim was mine to rank amid thy friends. <lb/>

            Till, leading hitherward the Thracian mares, <lb/>
            I come from slaughter of Bistonia's lord. <lb/>
            But if-not that, for I would fain return- <lb/>
            I give her then, for service of thine halls. <lb/>
            Prize of hard toil unto mine hands she came : <lb/>
            For certain men I found but now arraying <lb/>
            An athlete-strife, toil-worthy, for all comers, <lb/>
            Whence I have won and bring this victor's meed. <lb/>
            Horses there were for them to take which won <lb/>
            The light foot's triumph ; but for hero-strife, <lb/>
            Boxing and wrestling, oxen were the guerdon: <lb/>
            A woman made it richer. Shame it seemed <lb/>
            To hap thereon, and slip this glorious gain. <lb/>
            But, as I said, this woman be thy care : <lb/>
            For no thief's prize, but toil-achieved, I bring her. <lb/>
            Yea, one day thou perchance shalt say 'twas well.</p>

            My wife : she stirs mine heart with turmoil: fountains <lb/>
            Of tears burst from mine eyes. 0 wretched I ! <lb/>
            Now first I taste this grief's full bitterness.</p>

          <p>Admetus. Easier to exhort than suffer and be strong.</p>
          <p>Herakles. But what thy profit, though for aye thou <lb/>

          <p>Admetus. I too know this ; yet love constraineth me.</p>

          <p>Admetus. So that this man hath no more joy in life.</p>
          <p>Herakles. Time shall bring healing : now is thy grief <lb/>

            Death !</p>
          <p>Herakles. A wife, and yearning for new love, shall calm <lb/>

            thereon !</p>
          <p>Herakles. How ?—wilt not wed, but widowed keep thy <lb/>
            couch ?</p>
          <p>Admetus. Lives not the woman that shall couch with <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>Herakles. Lookst thou that this shall profit aught the <lb/>
            dead ?</p>
          <p>Admetus. I needs must honour her where'er she be.</p>
          <p>Herakles. Good-good-yet one with folly so might <lb/>

            Past hope I have thee, who ne'er thought to see thee!</p>

            How didst thou bring her from the shades to light?</p>
          <p>Herakles. I closed in conflict with the Lord of Spirits.</p>
          <p>Admetus. Where, sayst thou, didst thou fight this <lb/>

          <p>Herakles. From ambush by the tomb mine hands en­ <lb/>

          <p>WHEN the Heroes, who sailed in the ship Argo to bring <lb/>
            home the Golden Fleece, came to the land of Kolchis, they <lb/>
            found that to win that treasure was a deed passing the might <lb/>
            of mortal man, so terribly was it guarded by monsters magi­ <lb/>
            cal, even fire-breathing bulls and an unsleeping dragon. But <lb/>
            Aphrodite caused Medea the sorceress, daughter of Aietes the <lb/>
            king of the land, to love Jason their captain, so that by her <lb/>
            magic he overcame the bulls and the dragon. Then Jason <lb/>
            took the Fleece, and Medea withal, for that he had pledged <lb/>
            him to wed her in the land of Greece. But as they fled, Absyr­ <lb/>
            tus her brother pursued them with a host of war, yet by Me­ <lb/>
            dea's devising was he slain. So they came to the land of <lb/>
            Iolkos, and to Pelias, who held the kingdom which was Jason's <lb/>
            of right. But Medea by her magic wrought upon Pelias's <lb/>
            daughters so that they slew their father. Yet by reason of <lb/>
            men's horror of the deed might not Jason and Medea abide in <lb/>
            the land, and they came to Corinth. And there all men re­ <lb/>
            joiced for the coming of a hero so mighty in war and a lady <lb/>
            renowned for wisdom unearthly, for that Medea was grand- <lb/>
            child of the Sun-god. But after'ten years, Kreon the king of <lb/>
            the land spake to Jason, saying, “Lo, I will give thee my <lb/>
            daughter to wife, and thou shalt reign after me, if thou wilt <lb/>
            put away thy wife Medea ; but her and her two sons will I <lb/>
            banish from the land." So Jason consented. And of this be­ <lb/>
            fell things strange and awful, which are told herein.</p><pb n="242"/>

            Nor that in Pelion's glens had fallen ever <lb/>

            Of hero-princes, who at Pelias' best <lb/>

            With love for Jason thrilled through all her soul, <lb/>
            Nor had on Pelias' daughters wrought to slay <lb/>
            Their sire, nor now in this Corinthian land <lb/>
            Dwelt with her lord and children, gladdening <lb/>
            By this her exile them whose land received her; <lb/>
            Yea, and in all things serving Jason's weal, <lb/>
            Which is the chief salvation of the home, <lb/>

            Daughter of Kreon ruler of the land. <lb/>
            And, slighted thus, Medea, hapless wife, <lb/>
            Cries on the oaths, invokes that mightiest pledge <lb/>
            Of the right hand, and calls the gods to witness <lb/>

            Lest ye should blame me. Many folk I know <lb/>
            Accounted haughty, some, for proud staid mien,1 <lb/>
            Some, stranger-shy 2 and some, that softly go, <lb/>
            Have gotten ill repute of indolence. <lb/>
            For justice sits not in the eyes of man, <lb/>
            Who, ere he hath discerned his neighbour's heart, <lb/>
            Hates him at sight, albeit nowise wronged. <lb/>
            The sojourner must learn the city's wont; <lb/>
            Nor praise I citizens-born, law to themselves, <lb/>
            Mannerless churls, which flout their fellow-folk. <lb/>

            And, coming to new customs, habits new, <lb/>

            And to this dread do many things conspire. <lb/>

            Better be hated, woman, now of thee, <lb/>
            Than once relent, and sorely groan too late.</p>
          <p>Medea. Not now first, Kreon—many a time ere now <lb/>

            They are burdened with unprofitable lore, <lb/>
            And spite and envy of other folk they earn. <lb/>
            For, if thou bring strange wisdom unto dullards, <lb/>
            Useless shalt thou be counted, and not wise: <lb/>

            That against princes I should dare transgress. <lb/>
            How hast thou wronged me ? Thou hast given thy child <lb/>
            To whomso pleased thee. But—I hate mine husband: <lb/>
            And, doubtless, this in prudence hast thou done? <lb/>
            Nay, but I grudge not thy prosperity. <lb/>
            Wed ye, and prosper. But in this your land <lb/>
            Still let me dwell: for I, how wronged soe'er, <lb/>

            Thou diest—the word is said that shall not lie. <lb/>
            Now, if remain thou must, remain one day- <lb/>
            Too short for thee to do the deeds I dread. [Exit.</p>
          <p>Chorus. 0 hapless thou ! <lb/>
            Woe's me for thy misery, woe for the trouble and an­ <lb/>
            guish that meet thee! <lb/>
            Whitherward wilt thou turn thee ?-what welcoming <lb/>
            hand mid the strangers shall greet thee ? <lb/>
            What home or what land to receive thee, deliverance <lb/>
            from evils to give thee, <lb/>
            Wilt thou find for thee now ? <lb/>
            How mid surge of despair to overwhelm thee in ruin <lb/>
            God's hand on thine helm <lb/>
            Hath steered, 0 Medea, thy prow!</p>
          <p>Medea. 'Tis ill done every way; who shall gainsay? <lb/>
            Yet nowise ill in this; deem not so yet. <lb/>
            Bridegroom and bride grim conflicts yet await; <lb/>
            Nor troubles light abide these marriage-makers. <lb/>
            Think'st thou that I had cringed to yon mOan ever, <lb/>
            Except to gain some gain, or work some wile ? <lb/>
            Nor word nor touch of hand had I vouchsafed him. <lb/>
            But to such height of folly hath he come, <lb/>
            That, when he might forestall mine every plot <lb/>
            By banishment, this day of grace he grants me <lb/>
            To stay, wherein three foes will I lay dead, <lb/>
            The father, and the daughter, and mine husband. <lb/>
            And, having for them many paths of death, <lb/>
            Which first to take in hand I know not, friends; <lb/>
            Whether to set the bridal bower aflame, <lb/>
            Or through the heart to thrust the whetted knife, <lb/>
            Through yon halls stealing silent to their couch. <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            Yet one thing bars the way—if I be found <lb/>
            Crossing the threshold of the house and plotting, <lb/>
            Die shall I, and make mirth unto my foes. <lb/>
            Best the straight path, wherein my nature's cunning <lb/>
            Excels, by poisons to destroy them—yea. <lb/>
            Now, grant them dead: what city will receive me, <lb/>
            What host vouchsafe a land of refuge, home <lb/>
            Secure, and from the avenger shield my life? <lb/>
            There is none. Tarrying then a little space, <lb/>
            If any tower of safety shall appear, <lb/>
            These deaths by guile and silence will I compass; <lb/>
            But if misfortune drive me desperate forth, <lb/>
            Myself will grip the sword—yea, though I die— <lb/>
            And slay, and dare the strong hand's reckless deed <lb/>
            For, by the Queen of Night, whom I revere <lb/>
            Above all, and for fellow-worker chose, <lb/>
            Hekate, dweller by mine hearth's dark shrine, <lb/>
            Not one shall vex my soul, and rue it not. <lb/>
            Bitter and woeful bridal will I give them, <lb/>
            Bitter troth-plight and banishing of me. <lb/>
            Up, then !-spare naught of all thy sorcery-lore, <lb/>
            Medea, of thy plotting and contriving; <lb/>
            On to the dread deed ! Now is need of daring. <lb/>
            Look on my wrongs: thou must not make derision <lb/>
            For sons of Sisyphus, for Jason's bride- <lb/>
            Thou, sprung from royal father, from the Sun! <lb/>
            Thou know'st means. Yea, our woman-nature ’tis— <lb/>

          <p>Jason. Not now first, nay, but ofttimes have I marked <lb/>
            What desperate mischief is a froward spirit. <lb/>
            For in this land, this home, when thou might'st stay <lb/>
            Bearing unfractiously thy rulers' pleasure, <lb/>
            Banished thou art for wild and whirling words. <lb/>
            Me they vex not-cease never, an thou wilt, <lb/>
            Clamouring, " Jason is of men most base! " <lb/>
            But, for thy words against thy rulers' spoken, <lb/>
            Count it all gain-mere exile punishing thee. <lb/>
            For me—still strove I to appease the wrath <lb/>
            Of kings incensed: fain would I thou shouldst stay. <lb/>
            But thou rein'st not thy folly, speaking still <lb/>
            Evil of dignities; art therefore banished. <lb/>
            Yet, for all this, not wearied of my friends, <lb/>
            With so much forethought come I for thee, lady, <lb/>
            That, banished with thy babes, thou lack not gold, <lb/>
            Nor aught beside. Full many an ill is brought <lb/>
            In exile's train. Yea, though thou hatest me, <lb/>
            Ne'er can I harbour evil thought of thee.</p>
          <p>Medea. Caitiff of caitiffs !-blackest of reproaches <lb/>
            My tongue for thine unmanliness can frame- <lb/>
            Thou com'st to me—thou com'st, most hateful proved <lb/>
            To Heaven, to me, to all the race of men! <lb/>
            This is not daring, no, nor courage this, <lb/>
            To wrong thy friends, and blench not from their eyes, <lb/>
            But, of all plagues infecting men, the worst, <lb/>
            Even shamelessness. And yet 'tis well thou cam'st, <lb/>
            For I shall ease the burden of mine heart <lb/>

            Reviling thee, and thou be galled to hear. <lb/>
            And with the first things first will I begin. <lb/>
            I saved thee, as they know, what Greeks soe'er <lb/>
            Entered with thee the selfsame Argo's hull, <lb/>
            Thee, sent to quell the flame-outbreathing bulls <lb/>
            With yoke-bands, and to sow the tilth of death. <lb/>
            The dragon, warder of the Fleece of Gold, <lb/>
            That sleepless kept it with his manifold coils, <lb/>
            I slew, and raised deliverance-light for thee. <lb/>
            Myself forsook my father and mine home, <lb/>
            And to Iolkos under Pelion came <lb/>
            With thee, more zealous in thy cause than wise, <lb/>
            And Pelias slew by his own children's hands- <lb/>
            Of all deaths worst-so cast out all thy 1 fear. <lb/>
            And thus of me, basest of men, entreated, <lb/>
            For a new bride hast thou forsaken me, <lb/>
            Though I had borne thee children. Wert thou childless, <lb/>
            Not past forgiving were this marriage-craving. <lb/>
            But faith of oaths hath vanished. I know not <lb/>
            Whether thou deem'st the olden gods yet rule, <lb/>
            Or that new laws are now ordained for men ; <lb/>
            For thine heart speaks thee unto me forsworn. <lb/>
            Out on this right hand, which thou oft wouldst clasp- <lb/>
            These knees!-how vainly have we been embraced <lb/>
            By a base man, thus frustrate of our hopes! <lb/>
            Come, as a friend will I commune with thee- <lb/>
            Yet what fair dealing should I hope from thee ?— <lb/>
            Yet will I: questioned, baser shalt thou show. <lb/>
            Now, whither turn I ?-to my father's house, <lb/>
            Which, with my country, I for thee cast off? <lb/>
            To Pelias' hapless daughters?—Graciously <lb/>
            Their father's slayer would they welcome home ! <lb/>
            For thus it is : a foe am I become <lb/>
            To mine own house. Whom I should ne'er have harmed, <lb/>
            For grace to thee I made mine enemies. <lb/>
            So then midst Hellas' daughters hast thou made me <note type="footnote"> 1 Or " Yea, cast out all their fear." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            Blest in return for all: in thee have I— <lb/>

            If from the land cast forth I pass to exile <lb/>
            Forlorn of friends, alone with children lone. <lb/>
            A proud reproach for our new bridegroom this- <lb/>
            In poverty thy babes, thy saviour, wander! <lb/>
            O Zeus, ah, wherefore hast thou given to men <lb/>
            Plain signs for gold which is but counterfeit, <lb/>
            But no assay-mark Nature-graven shows <lb/>
            On man's form, to discern the base withal ?</p>

          <p>Jason. Needs must I be not ill at speech, meseems, <lb/>
            But, like the careful helmsman of a ship, <lb/>
            With close-reefed canvas run before the gale, <lb/>
            Woman, of thy tempestuous-railing tongue. <lb/>
            I—for thy kindness tower-high thou pilest- <lb/>
            Deem Kypris saviour of my voyaging, <lb/>
            Her, and none other or of gods or men. <lb/>
            A subtle wit thou hast—what need to force me <lb/>
            To tell the tale how Love, by strong compulsion <lb/>
            Of shafts unerring, made thee save my life ? <lb/>
            Yet take I not account too strict thereof; <lb/>
            For, in that thou didst save me, thou didst well. <lb/>
            Howbeit, more hast thou received than given <lb/>
            Of this my safety, as my words shall prove:- <lb/>
            First, then, in Hellas dwell'st thou, in the stead <lb/>
            Of land barbaric, knowest justice, learnest <lb/>
            To live by law without respect of force. <lb/>
            And all the Greeks have heard thy wisdom's fame. <lb/>
            Renown is thine : but if on earth's far bourn <lb/>
            Thou dwelledst yet, thou hadst not lived in story. <lb/>
            Now mine be neither gold-mine halls within, <lb/>
            Nor sweeter song be mine than Orpheus sang, <lb/>
            If my fair fortune be to fame unknown. <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄπιστον</foreign>, “Woe’s me !-a marvellous spouse beyond <lb/>

            Thus far of my great labours have I spoken- <lb/>
            Since thou flung'st down this challenge to dispute- <lb/>
            But, for thy railings on my royal marriage, <lb/>
            Herein will I show, first, that wise I was ; <lb/>
            Then, temperate; third, to thee the best of friends <lb/>
            And to my children—nay, but hear me out. <lb/>
            When I came hither from Iolkos-land <lb/>
            With many a desperate fortune in my train, <lb/>
            What happier treasure-trove could I have found <lb/>
            Than to wed—I, an exile-with a princess ? <lb/>
            Not-where it galls thee-loathing couch of thine, <lb/>
            And for a new bride smitten with desire, <lb/>
            Nor eager I to multiply mine offspring— <lb/>
            Suffice these born to me : no fault in them- <lb/>
            But that we might with honour live-grave import- <lb/>
            And be not straitened-for I know full well <lb/>
            How all friends from the poor man stand aloof- <lb/>
            And I might nurture as beseems mine house <lb/>
            Our sons, and to these born of thee beget <lb/>
            Brethren, and, knitting in one family all, <lb/>
            Live happy days. Thou, what wouldst thou of children? <lb/>
            But me it profits, through sons to be born <lb/>
            To help the living. Have I planned so ill? <lb/>
            Not thou wouldst say it, but the lost couch galls thee. <lb/>
            But ye—ye women-so unreasoning are <lb/>
            That, wedlock-rights unmarred, ye count all well; <lb/>
            But to the couch if aught untoward hap, <lb/>
            With the best, fairest lot are ye at feud <lb/>
            Most bitter. Would that mortals otherwise <lb/>
            Could get them babes, that womankind were not, <lb/>
            And so no curse had lighted upon men.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Words, Jason, words, tricked out full cun­ <lb/>
            ningly : <lb/>
            Yet to me—though I speak not to thy mind- <lb/>
            Unjust thou seem'st, betraying thus thy wife.</p>
          <p>Medea. Of many things I think not as think many. <lb/>

            Getteth himself for gain exceeding loss, <lb/>
            Who, confident his tongue can gloze the wrong, <lb/>
            Becomes a bold knave-no great wisdom this. <lb/>
            So be not thou, as touching me, fair-seeming <lb/>
            And crafty-tongued : one word shall overthrow thee : <lb/>
            Thou shouldest, if not base, have wed this bride <lb/>
            With my consent, not hid it from thy friends.</p>
          <p>f Jason. Ay, nobly hadst thou helped in this my purpose, <lb/>
            Had I a marriage named, who even now <lb/>
            Canst not refrain thy heart's exceeding wrath!</p>
          <p>Medea. Not this thine hindrance, but the alien wife <lb/>
            No crown of honour was as eld drew on.</p>
          <p>Jason. Now know this well-not for the woman's sake <lb/>
            I wed the royal bride whom I have won, <lb/>
            But, as I said, of my desire to save <lb/>
            Thee, and beget seed royal, to my sons <lb/>
            Brethren, and for mine house a tower of strength.</p>
          <p>Medea. No prosperous life 'neath sorrow's cloud for me, <lb/>
            Nor weal, with thorns of conscience in mine heart!</p>
          <p>Jason. Know'st how to change thy prayer, and show <lb/>
            the wiser ? <lb/>
            May thy good never seem to thee thy sorrow; <lb/>
            Nor in fair fortune deem thy lot misfortune.</p>
          <p>Medea. Oh, yea, insult !- Thou hast a refuge, thou ; <lb/>
            But desolate I am banished from this land.</p>
          <p>Jason. Thyself hast chosen this: none other blame.</p>
          <p>Medea. I ?-sooth, by wedding and betraying thee !</p>
          <p>Jason. By cursing princes with an impious curse.</p>
          <p>Medea. Even so-and thus am cursing now thine house?</p>
          <p>Jason. With thee no more I wrangle touching this. <lb/>
            But if, or for the children or thyself, <lb/>
            For help in exile thou wilt take my gold, <lb/>
            Speak: ready am I to give with hand ungrudging, <lb/>
            And send guest-tokens which shall find thee friends. <lb/>
            If this thou wilt not, foolish shalt thou be: <lb/>
            Refrain wrath, and advantaged shalt thou be.</p>
          <p>Medea. Thy friends !-nothing will I of friends of thine. <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            No whit will I receive, nor offer thou. <lb/>
            No profit is there in a villain's gifts.</p>
          <p>Jason. In any wise I call the gods to witness <lb/>
            That all help would I give thee and thy sons; <lb/>
            But thy good likes thee not: thy stubborn pride <lb/>

            This grace to grant thee : for the gods' sake first; <lb/>
            Then, for the seed of children thou dost promise ; <lb/>

            Since for myself is this the safest course, <lb/>

          <p>Jason. Summoned I come : for, though thou be my foe, <lb/>
            This grace thou shalt not miss ; but I will hear <lb/>
            What new thing, lady, thou dost wish of me.</p>
          <p>Medea. Jason, I ask thee to forgive the words <lb/>
            Late-spoken, and' to bear with that my mood: <lb/>
            Well mayst thou, for remembrance of old loves. <lb/>
            Now have I called myself to account, and railed <lb/>
            Upon myself: “ Wretch, wherefore am I mad? <lb/>
            And wherefore rage against good counsellors, <lb/>
            And am at feud with rulers of the land, <lb/>
            And with my lord, who works my veriest good, <lb/>
            Wedding a royal house, to raise up brethren <lb/>
            Unto my sons ? Shall I not cease from wrath ? <lb/>
            What aileth me, when the gods proffer boons ? <lb/>
            Have I not children ? Know I not that we <lb/>
            Are exiles from our own land, lacking friends?" <lb/>
            Thus musing, was I 'vare that I had nursed <lb/>
            Folly exceeding, anger without cause. <lb/>
            Now then I praise thee; wise thou seem'st to me <lb/>
            In gaining us this kinship, senseless I, <lb/>
            Who in these counsels should have been thine ally, <lb/>
            Have furthered all, have decked the bridal couch, <lb/>
            And joyed to minister unto the bride. <lb/>
            But we are-women : needs not harsher word. <lb/>
            Yet evil shouldst thou not for evil render, <lb/>
            Nor pit against my folly folly of thine. <lb/>
            I yield, confessing mine unwisdom then, <lb/>

            Hast voted : a wise woman's deed is this.- <lb/>
            And for you, children, not unheedfully <lb/>
            Your sire hath ta'en much forethought, so help Heaven. <lb/>

            In manhood's prime, triumphant o'er my foes. <lb/>
            Thou, why bedew'st thou with wan tears thine eyes, <lb/>
            Turning aback from them thy pallid cheek, <lb/>

            them, <lb/>
            Pity stole o'er me, whispering, “ Shall this be? ” <lb/>

            Since the king pleaseth forth the land to send me, <lb/>
            For me too this is best—I know it well- <lb/>
            That I bide not, a stumbling-block to thee <lb/>
            And the land's lords, whose house's foe I seem, <lb/>
            So fare I forth to exile from this land. <lb/>
            But, that my sons by thine hand may be reared, <lb/>
            Entreat thou Kreon that they be not banished.</p>
          <p>Jason. Prevail I may not, yet must I essay.</p>
          <p>Medea. Nay then, thy bride bid thou to pray her sire <lb/>
            That thy sons be not banished from this land.</p>
          <p>Jason. Yea, surely ; and, I trow, her shall I win, <lb/>
            If of her sister women she is one.</p>
          <p>Medea. I too will bear a part in thine endeavour ; <lb/>
            For I will send her gifts unmatched for beauty <lb/>
            Of all that men see now, I know, by far, <lb/>
            A robe fine-spun, a golden diadem ; <lb/>
            Our sons to bear them. Now must an attendant <lb/>
            With all speed hither bring the ornaments. <lb/>
            Blessings shall hers be, not one, but untold, <lb/>

            Who owneth ornaments which once the Sun, <lb/>
            My father's father, gave unto his offspring !— <lb/>
            Take in your hands, my sons, these bridal gifts, <lb/>
            And to the happy princess-bride bear ye <lb/>
            And give: with gifts shall she be satisfied.</p>
          <p>Jason. But, fond one, why make void thine hands of <lb/>
            these ? <lb/>
            Deem'st thou a royal house hath lack of robes, <lb/>
            Or gold, deem'st thou ? Keep these and give them not. <lb/>
            For, if my wife esteems me aught, my wish <lb/>
            Will she prefer to treasures, well I wot. <note type="footnote"> 1 Verrall here says, " There is no apparent reason for the emphatic <lb/>
            pronoun " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign>). Is it not that the object of the interview was twofold, <lb/>
            first, to ask Jason's pardon-that had now been spoken by him ; secondly, <lb/>
            to introduce a proposal of her own, involving independent action on her <lb/>

            Gold weigheth more with men than words untold. <lb/>
            Hers fortune is; God favoureth now her cause; <lb/>
            Young is her power. Life would I give for ransom <lb/>
            Of my sons' banishment, not gold alone.- <lb/>

            Make supplication, pray ye be not exiled, <lb/>

          <p>Messenger. 0 thou who hast wrought an awful deed <lb/>
            and lawless, <lb/>
            Flee, 0 Medea, flee, nor once leave thou <lb/>
            The sea-wain, or the car that scours the plain.</p>
          <p>Medea. Now what hath happed that calleth for such <lb/>

          <p>Messenger. Dead is the princess even now, and dead <lb/>
            Kreon her father, by thy poison-drugs.</p>
          <p>Medea. A glorious tale thou tellest: thou henceforth <lb/>
            Art of my benefactors and my friends.</p>
          <p>Messenger. What say'st?—Of sound mind art thou, and <lb/>
            not mad ? <lb/>
            Who, hearing of the havoc of the hearth <lb/>
            Of kings, art glad, and hast no fear for this ?</p>
          <p>Medea. Oh, yea ; I too with words of controversy <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            Could answer thee-yet be not hasty, friend, <lb/>
            Hut tell how died they: thou shouldst gladden me <lb/>
            Doubly, if these most horribly have perished.</p>
          <p>Messenger. When, with their father, came thy children <lb/>
            twain, <lb/>
            And passed into the halls for marriage decked, <lb/>
            Glad were we thralls who sorrowed for thy woes. <lb/>
            And straightway buzzed from ear to ear the tale <lb/>
            Of truce to old feuds 'twixt thy lord and thee. <lb/>
            The hand one kisseth, one the golden head <lb/>
            Of those thy sons: myself by joy on-drawn <lb/>
            Followed thy children to the women's bowers. <lb/>
            Now she which had our worship in thy stead, <lb/>
            Ere she beheld thy chariot-yoke of sons, <lb/>
            Aye upon Jason turned her yearning gaze. <lb/>
            But then her veil before her eyes she cast, <lb/>
            And swept aback the scorn of her white neck, <lb/>
            Loathing thy sons' approach : but now thy lord, <lb/>
            To turn the maiden's wrath and spite aside, <lb/>
            Thus spake: ‟ Nay, be not hostile to thy friends: <lb/>
            Cease from thine anger, turn thine head again, <lb/>
            Accounting friends whomso thy spouse accounts. <lb/>
            Their gifts receive, and plead thou with thy sire <lb/>
            To pardon these their exile-for my sake." <lb/>
            She, when she saw the attire, could not refrain, <lb/>
            But yielded her lord all. And ere their father <lb/>
            Far from her bower with those thy sons had gone, <lb/>
            She took the rich-wrought robes and clad herself, <lb/>
            Circling her ringlets with the golden crown, <lb/>
            And by a shining mirror ranged her tresses, <lb/>
            Smiling at her own phantom image there. <lb/>
            Then, rising from her seat, she paced adown <lb/>
            The halls with mincing tread of ivory feet, <lb/>
            Exulting in the gifts, and oftentimes <lb/>
            Sweeping her glance from neck to ankle-hem. <lb/>
            But then was there a fearful sight to see. <lb/>
            Suddenly changed her colour: reeling back <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            With trembling limbs she goes; and scarce in time <lb/>
            Drops on the couch to fall not on the ground. <lb/>
            Then a gray handmaid, deeming peradventure <lb/>
            That frenzy was of Pan or some god sent, <lb/>
            Raised the prayer-cry, before she saw the foam <lb/>
            White-frothing from her lips, or marked how rolled <lb/>
            Her eyeballs, and her face's bloodless hue. <lb/>
            Then a scream, unaccordant, long and loud, <lb/>
            She shrilled forth. Straight to her father's chambers one <lb/>
            Darted, and one unto her new-made spouse, <lb/>
            To tell the bride's mischance: and all the roof <lb/>
            Echoed with multitudinous-hurrying feet. <lb/>
            And a swift athlete's straining limbs had won <lb/>
            By this the goal of the six-plethra course: <lb/>
            Then she from trance all speechless of closed eyes <lb/>
            Awoke—ah, wretch !-with horrible-shrilling shriek : <lb/>
            For like two charging hosts her agony came- <lb/>
            The golden coil about her head that lay <lb/>
            'Gan spurt a marvellous stream of ravening fire; <lb/>
            While the fine robes, the gift thy children brought, <lb/>
            Devoured the white flesh of the unhappy one. <lb/>
            Upstarting from her seat she flees, all flame, <lb/>
            Shaking her hair, her head, this way and that, <lb/>
            To cast from her the crown ; but firmly fixed <lb/>
            The gold held fast its clasp : the fire, whene'er <lb/>
            She shook her locks, with doubled fury blazed. <lb/>
            Then misery-vanquished falls she on the floor, <lb/>
            Past recognising, save for a father, marred. <lb/>
            No more was seen her eyes' imperial calm, <lb/>
            No more her comely features; but the gore <lb/>
            Dripped from her head's crown flecked with blended fire. <lb/>
            The flesh-flakes from her bones, like the pine's tears, <lb/>
            'Neath that mysterious drug's devourings melted- <lb/>
            Dread sight-and came on all folk fear to touch <lb/>
            The corpse: her hideous fate had we for warning. <lb/>
            But, ignorant of all, her wretched sire, <lb/>
            Suddenly entering, falls upon her corpse, <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            And straightway wailed and clasped the body round. <lb/>
            And kissed it, crying: " Oh, my hapless child, <lb/>
            What god thus horribly hath thee destroyed ? <lb/>
            Who maketh this old sepulchre bereft <lb/>
            Of thee ? Ah me, would I might die with thee! " <lb/>
            But, when from wailing and from moans he ceased, <lb/>
            Fain would he have upraised his aged frame, <lb/>
            Yet clave, as ivy clings to laurel boughs, <lb/>
            To those fine robes : then was a ghastly wrestling : <lb/>
            For, while he laboured to upraise his knee, <lb/>
            She strained against him : if by force he haled, <lb/>
            Then from the bones he tare his aged flesh. <lb/>
            At last refrained he, and gave up the ghost, <lb/>
            Ill-starred, who could no more withstand his bane. <lb/>
            There lie the corpses, child by aged sire <lb/>
            Clasped-such affliction tears, not words, must mourn. <lb/>
            And of thy part no word be said by me— <lb/>
            Thyself from punishment wilt find escape. <lb/>
            But man's lot now, as oft, I count a shadow, <lb/>
            Nor fear to say that such as seem to be <lb/>
            Wise among men and cunning in speech-lore, <lb/>
            Even these are chargeable with deepest folly ; <lb/>
            For among mortals happy man is none. <lb/>
            In Fortune's flood-tide might a man become <lb/>
            More prosperous than his neighbour : happy ?-no ! <lb/>

          <p>Jason. A vaunt, foul thing by whose deed thy children <lb/>

          <p>Medea. Go hence to thine halls, thence lead to the <lb/>

          <p>Medea. Of their mother beloved, not of thee.</p>

          <p>Medea. That thou mightest fall in the net that <lb/>
            thou spreadest for me.</p>
          <p>Jason. Woe's me! I yearn with my lips to press <lb/>
            My sons' dear lips in my wretchedness.</p>
          <p>Medea. Ha! now art thou calling upon them, now <lb/>
            wouldst thou kiss, <lb/>
            Who rejectedst them then?</p>
          <p>Jason. For the gods' sake grant me but this, <lb/>
            The sweet soft flesh of my children to feel!</p>
          <p>Medea. No—wasted in air is all thine appeal.</p>

            What outrage I suffer of yonder abhorred <lb/>
            Child-murderess, yonder tigress-dam ? <lb/>
            Yet out of mine helplessness, out of my shame, <lb/>
            I bewail my beloved, I call to record <lb/>
            High Heaven, I bid God witness the word, <lb/>
            That my sons thou hast slain, and withholdest me <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE CLOUDS OF ARISTOPHANES TRANSLATED BY WILLIAM JAMES HICKIE</title>
          </head><pb n="292"/>
          
          <p>ARISTOPHANES, the greatest of Attic comedians, and one of the great­ <lb/>
            est of all times, was born about 450 B. c. Very little is known of his life. <lb/>
            He is supposed not to have been of pure Attic blood, and his father is <lb/>
            said to have been a property-holder of Ægina. He had three sons- <lb/>
            Philippus, Araros, and Nicostratos—who were all comic poets. Through­ <lb/>
            out his life Aristophanes championed the cause of the aristocratic ele­ <lb/>
            ment of Athenian society. He bitterly opposed, and in turn held up to <lb/>
            the highest ridicule, everything that savoured in the least of demagogism <lb/>
            or popular sophistry. He began his career with The Banqueters," in <lb/>
            427 B. c., and continued to produce popular plays until his death, about <lb/>
            385 B. c. Of the fifty or more plays that he is said to have written, eleven <lb/>
            have been preserved: " The Acharnians," " The Knights,” "The Clouds," <lb/>
            " The Wasps,” " The Peace," " The Birds," " Lysistrata," " The Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusæ,” " The Frogs," .. The Ecclesiazusæ,” and " Plutus." From <lb/>
            the beginning of his public career Aristophanes was the sworn enemy of <lb/>
            Euripides, and after the death of the latter The Frogs" was written <lb/>
            (405 B. c.) to extol Æschylus by belittling the life and art of Euripides.</p><pb n="293"/>

          <p>s <lb/>
            TREPSIADES (sitting up in his bed). Ah me! ah me! <lb/>
            O King Jupiter, of what a terrible length the nights <lb/>
            are! Will it never be day? And yet long since I <lb/>
            heard the cock. My domestics are snoring; but they <lb/>
            would not have done so heretofore! May you perish <lb/>
            then, 0 war! for many reasons; because I may not even <lb/>
            punish my domestics. Neither does this excellent youth <lb/>
            awake through the night; but takes his ease, wrapped up <lb/>
            in five blankets. Well, if it is the fashion, let us snore <lb/>
            wrapped up. [Lies down, and then almost immediately <lb/>
            starts up again.]</p>
          <p>But I am not able, miserable man, to sleep, being tor­ <lb/>
            mented by my expenses, and my stud of horses, and my <lb/>
            debts, through this son of mine. He, with his long hair, <lb/>
            is riding horses and driving curricles, and dreaming of <lb/>
            horses; while I am driven to distraction, as I see the <lb/>
            moon bringing on the twentieths; for the interest is run­ <lb/>
            ning on.—Boy ! light a lamp, and bring forth my tablets, <lb/>
            that I may take them and read to how many I am indebt­ <lb/>
            ed. and calculate the interest. [Enter boy with a light and <lb/>
            tablets.] Come, let me see; what do I owe? Twelve <lb/>
            minæ to Pasias. Why twelve minæ to Pastas? Why did <lb/>
            I borrow them ? When I bought the blood-horse. Ah <lb/>
            me, unhappy ! Would that it had had its eye knocked <lb/>
            out with a stone first! <note type="footnote"> 295 </note></p><pb n="296"/>
            
          <p>Phidippides (talking in his sleep). You are acting unfairly, <lb/>
            Philo! Drive on your own course.</p>
          <p>.tre. This is the bane that has destroyed me; for. <lb/>
            even in his sleep he dreams about horsemanship.</p>
          <p>Phid. How many courses will the war-chariots <lb/>
            run ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Many courses do you drive me, your father.- <lb/>
            But what debt came upon me after Pastas? Three minæ <lb/>
            to Amynias for a little chariot and pair of wheels.</p>
          <p>Phid. Lead the horse home, after having given him a <lb/>
            good rolling.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 foolish youth, you have rolled me out of <lb/>
            my possessions; since I have been cast in suits, and <lb/>
            others say that they will have surety given them for the <lb/>
            interest.</p>
          <p>Phid. (awaking). Pray, father, why are you peevish, and <lb/>
            toss about the whole night?</p>
          <p>Strep. A bailiff out of the bedclothes is biting me. <lb/>
            Phid. Suffer me, good sir, to sleep a little.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then, do you sleep on; but know that all these <lb/>
            debts will turn on your head. [PHIDIPPIDES falls asleep <lb/>
            again.] Alas! would that the match-maker had perished <lb/>
            miserably, who induced me to marry your mother. For <lb/>
            a country life used to be most agreeable to me, dirty, un­ <lb/>
            trimmed, reclining at random, abounding in bees, and <lb/>
            sheep, and oil-cake. Then I, a rustic, married a niece of <lb/>
            Megacles, the son of Megacles, from the city, haughty, <lb/>
            luxurious, and Ccesyrafied. When I married her, I lay <lb/>
            with her redolent of new wine, of the cheese-crate, and <lb/>
            abundance of wool; but she, on the contrary, of ointment, <lb/>
            saffron, wanton-kisses, extravagance, gluttony, and of <lb/>
            Colias and Genetyllis. I will not indeed say that she was <lb/>
            idle; but she wove. And I used to show her this cloak <lb/>
            by way of pretext, and say, “ Wife, you weave at a great <lb/>
            rate."</p>

          <p>Servant. We have no oil in the lamp.</p><pb n="297"/>
            
          <p>Strep. Ah me! why did you light the thirsty lamp? <lb/>
            Come hither, that you may weep!</p>
          <p>Sere For what, pray, shall I weep?</p>
          <p>Strep. Because you put in one of the thick wicks. [SER­ <lb/>
            VANT runs out.]—After this, when this son was born to us, <lb/>
            to me, forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled <lb/>
            then about the name: for she was for adding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππος</foreign>to the <lb/>
            name, Xanthippus, or Charippus, or Callippides; but I <lb/>
            was for giving him the name of his grandfather, Phido­ <lb/>
            nides. For a time therefore we disputed ; and then at <lb/>
            length we agreed, and called him Phidippides. She used <lb/>
            to take this son and fondle him, saying, " When you, being <lb/>
            grown up, shall drive your chariot to the city, like Meg­ <lb/>
            acles, with a xystis." But I used to say, “ Nay, rather, <lb/>
            when dressed in a leathern jerkin, you shall drive your <lb/>
            goats from Phelleus, like your father. He paid no atten­ <lb/>
            tion to my words, but poured a horse-fever over my prop­ <lb/>
            erty. Now, therefore, by meditating the whole night, I <lb/>
            have discovered one path for my course extraordinarily <lb/>
            excellent; to which if I persuade this youth I shall be <lb/>
            saved. But first I wish to awake him. How then can I <lb/>
            awake him in the most agreeable manner?-How? Phidip­ <lb/>
            pides, my little Phidippides?</p>
          <p>Phid. What, father?</p>
          <p>Strep. Kiss me, and give me your right hand!</p>
          <p>Phid. There. What's the matter?</p>
          <p>Strep. Tell me, do you love me?</p>
          <p>Phid. Yes, by this Equestrian Neptune.</p>
          <p>Strep. Nay, do not by any means mention this Eques­ <lb/>
            trian to me, for this god is the author of my misfortunes. <lb/>
            But, if you really love me from your heart, my son, <lb/>
            obey me.</p>
          <p>Phid. In what then, pray, shall I obey you?</p>
          <p>Strep. Reform your habits as quickly as possible ; and <lb/>
            go and learn what I advise.</p>
          <p>Phid. Tell me now, what do you prescribe?</p>
          <p>Strep. And will you obey me at all? <note type="footnote"> 11 </note></p><pb n="298"/>
            
          <p>Phid.By Bacchus, I will obey you.</p>
          <p>Sire-. Look this way then ! Do you see this little <lb/>
            door and little house ?</p>
          <p>Phid. I see it. What then, pray, is this, father?</p>
          <p>Strep. This is a thinking-shop of wise spirits. There <lb/>
            dwell men who in speaking of the heavens persuade <lb/>
            people that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, <lb/>
            and that we are the embers. These men teach, if one <lb/>
            give them money, to conquer in speaking, right or <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>Phid. Who are they ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I do not know the name accurately. They are <lb/>
            minute philosophers, noble and excellent.</p>
          <p>Phid.Bah! they are rogues; I know them. You <lb/>
            mean the quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed <lb/>
            fellows, of whose number are the miserable Socrates and <lb/>
            Chærephon.</p>
          <p>Strep. Hold! hold ! be silent! Do not say anything <lb/>
            foolish. But, if you have any concern for your father's <lb/>
            patrimony, become one of them, having given up your <lb/>
            horsemanship.</p>
          <p>Phid. I would not, by Bacchus, if even you were to <lb/>
            give me the pheasants which Leogoras rears!</p>
          <p>Strep. Go, I entreat you, dearest of men, go and be <lb/>
            taught.</p>
          <p>Phid. Why, what shall I learn?</p>
          <p>Strep. They say that among them are both the two <lb/>
            causes-the better cause, whichever that is, and the <lb/>
            worse: they say that the one of these two causes, the <lb/>
            worse, prevails, though it speaks on the unjust side. If <lb/>
            therefore you learn for me this unjust cause, I would not <lb/>
            pay to any one, not even an obolus of these debts, which <lb/>
            I owe at present on your account.</p>
          <p>Phid. I can not comply; for I should not dare to look <lb/>
            upon the knights, having lost all mv colour.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then, by Ceres, you shall not eat any of my <lb/>
            goods! neither you, nor your draught-horse, nor your <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            blood-horse ; but I will drive you out of my house to the <lb/>
            crows.</p>
          <p>Phid. My uncle Megacles will not permit me to be <lb/>
            without a horse. But I'll go in, and pay no heed to you. <lb/>
            [Exit PHIDIPPIDES.</p>
          <p>Strep. Though fallen, still I will not lie prostrate: but <lb/>
            having prayed to the gods, I will go myself to the think­ <lb/>
            ing-shop and get taught. How, then, being an old man, <lb/>
            and having a bad memory, and dull of comprehension, <lb/>
            shall I learn the subtleties of refined disquisitions?—I <lb/>
            must go. Why thus do I loiter and not knock at the <lb/>
            door ? [Knocks at the door.] Boy ! little boy !</p>
          <p>Disciple (fromwithin). Go to the devil! Who is it <lb/>
            that knocked at the door ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Strepsiades, the son of Phidon, of Cicynna.</p>
          <p>Dis. You are a stupid fellow, by Jove! who have <lb/>
            kicked against the door so very carelessly, and have <lb/>
            caused the miscarriage of an idea which I had con­ <lb/>
            ceived.</p>
          <p>Strep. Pardon me; for I dwell afar in the country. <lb/>
            But tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.</p>
          <p>Dis. It is not lawful to mention it, except to disciples.</p>
          <p>Strep. Tell it, then, to me without fear; for I here am <lb/>
            come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.</p>
          <p>Dis. I will tell you; but you must regard these as <lb/>
            mysteries. Socrates lately asked Chærephon about a <lb/>
            flea, how many of its own feet it jumped ; for after hav­ <lb/>
            ing bit the eyebrow of Chærephon it leaped away on to <lb/>
            the head of Socrates.</p>
          <p>Strep. How, then, did he measure this ?</p>
          <p>Dis. Most cleverly. He melted some wax, and then <lb/>
            took the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a <lb/>
            pair of Persian slippers stuck to it when cooled. Having <lb/>
            gently loosened these, he measured back the distance.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 King Jupiter ! what subtlety of thought!</p>
          <p>Dis, What then would you say if you heard another <lb/>
            contrivance of Socrates?</p><pb n="300"/>
            
          <p>Strep. Of what kind ? Tell me, I beseech you !</p>
          <p>Dis. Chærephon the Sphettian asked him whether he <lb/>
            thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech.</p>
          <p>Strep. What, then, did he say about the gnat?</p>
          <p>Dis. He said the intestine of the gnat was narrow, <lb/>
            and that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender, <lb/>
            straight to the breech ; and then that the rump, being <lb/>
            hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part, resounded <lb/>
            through the violence of the wind.</p>
          <p>Strep. The rump of gnats then is a trumpet! Oh, thrice <lb/>
            happy he for his sharp-sightedness ! Surely a defendant <lb/>
            might easily get acquitted who understands the intestine <lb/>
            of the gnat.</p>
          <p>Dis. But he was lately deprived of a great idea by a <lb/>
            lizard.</p>
          <p>Strep. In what way ? Tell me.</p>
          <p>Dis. As he was investigating the courses of the moon <lb/>
            and her revolutions, then as he was gaping upward a <lb/>
            lizard in the darkness dropped upon him from the roof.</p>
          <p>Strep. I am amused at a lizard's having dropped on <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Dis. Yesterday evening there was no supper for us.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well. What then did he contrive for provi­ <lb/>
            sions ?</p>
          <p>Dis. He sprinkled fine ashes on the table, and bent a <lb/>
            little spit, and then took it as a pair of compasses and <lb/>
            filched a cloak from the Palaestra.</p>
          <p>Strep. Why then do we admire that Thales? Open, <lb/>
            open quickly the thinking-shop, and show to me Socrates <lb/>
            as quickly as possible. For I desire to be a disciple. <lb/>
            Come, open the door. [ The door of the thinking-shop opens, <lb/>
            and the pupils of SOCRATES are seen all with their heads fixed <lb/>
            on the ground, while SOCRATES himself is seen suspended in the <lb/>
            air in a basket.] 0 Hercules, from what country are these <lb/>
            wild beasts?</p>
          <p>Dis. What do you wonderat ? To what do they seem <lb/>
            to you to be like ?</p><pb n="301"/>
            
          <p>Strep. To the Spartans who were taken at Pylos. But <lb/>
            why in the world do these look upon the ground ?</p>
          <p>Dis. They are in search of the things below the earth.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then they are searching for roots. Do not, <lb/>
            then, trouble yourselves about this; for I know where <lb/>
            there are large and fine ones. Why, what are these <lb/>
            doing, who are bent down so much ?</p>
          <p>Dis. These are groping about in darkness under Tar­ <lb/>
            tarus.</p>
          <p>Strep. Why then does their rump look toward heaven?</p>
          <p>Dis.It is getting taught astronomy alone by itself. <lb/>
            [Turning to the pupils.] But go in, lest he meet with us.</p>
          <p>Strep. Not yet, not yet; but let them remain, that I <lb/>
            may communicate to them a little matter of my own.</p>
          <p>Dis. It is not permitted to them to remain without in <lb/>
            the open air for a very long time. [The pupils retire.</p>
          <p>Strep.(discovering a variety of mathematical instruments). <lb/>
            Why, what is this, in the name of heaven ? Tell me.</p>
          <p>Dis. This is Astronomy.</p>
          <p>Strep. But what is this?</p>
          <p>Dis. Geometry.</p>
          <p>Strep. What then is the use of this ?</p>
          <p>Dis. To measure out the land.</p>
          <p>Strip. What belongs to an allotment?</p>
          <p>Dis. No, but the whole earth.</p>
          <p>Strep. You tell me a clever notion; for the contriv­ <lb/>
            ance is democratic and useful.</p>
          <p>Dis. (pointing to a map). See, here's a map of the <lb/>
            whole earth. Do you see ? this is Athens.</p>
          <p>Strep. What say you? I don't believe you; for I do <lb/>
            not see the Dicasts sitting.</p>
          <p>Dis. Be assured that this is truly the Attic territory.</p>
          <p>Strep. Why, where are my fellow-tribesmen of Ci­ <lb/>
            cynna ?</p>
          <p>Dis. Here they are. And Eubœa here, as you see, is <lb/>
            stretched out a long way by the side of it to a great dis­ <lb/>
            tance.</p><pb n="302"/>
            
          <p>Strep. I know that; for it was stretched by us and <lb/>
            Pericles. But where is Lacedæmon?</p>
          <p>Dis. Where is it? Here it is.</p>
          <p>Strep. How near it is to us ! Pay great attention to <lb/>
            this, to remove it very far from us.</p>
          <p>Dis. By Jupiter, it is not possible.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then you will weep for it. [Looking up and dis­ <lb/>
            covering SOCRATES.] Come, who is this man who is in <lb/>
            the basket ?</p>
          <p>Dis. Himself.</p>
          <p>Strep. Who's “ Himself " ?</p>
          <p>Dis. Socrates.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 Socrates! Come, you sir, call upon him <lb/>
            loudly for me.</p>
          <p>Dis. Nay, rather, call him yourself; for I have no <lb/>
            leisure. [Exit DISCIPLE.</p>
          <p>Strep. Socrates! my little Socrates !</p>
          <p>Socrates. Why callest thou me, thou creature of a day ?</p>
          <p>Strep. First tell me, I beseech you, what you are <lb/>
            doing.</p>
          <p>Soc. I am walking in the air, and speculating about <lb/>
            the sun.</p>
          <p>Strep. And so you look down upon the gods from <lb/>
            your basket, and not from the earth ?</p>
          <p>Soc. For I should never have rightly discovered things <lb/>
            celestial if I had not suspended the intellect, and mixed <lb/>
            the thought in a subtle form with its kindred air. But if, <lb/>
            being on the ground, I speculated from below on things <lb/>
            above, I should never have discovered them. For the <lb/>
            earth forcibly attracts to itself the meditative moisture. <lb/>
            Water-cresses also suffer the very same thing.</p>
          <p>Strep.What do you say?—Does meditation attract the <lb/>
            moisture to the water-cresses? Come then, my little Soc­ <lb/>
            rates, descend to me, that you may teach me those things, <lb/>
            for the sake of which I have come. [SOCRATES lowers <lb/>
            himself and gets out of thebasket.]</p>
          <p>Soc. And for what did NOU come?</p><pb n="303"/>
            
          <p>Strep. Wishing to learn to speak; for, by reason of <lb/>
            usury, and most ill-natured creditors, I am pillaged and <lb/>
            plundered, and have my goods seized for debt.</p>
          <p>Soc. How did you get in debt without observing it ?</p>
          <p>Strep. A horse-disease consumed me—terrible at eat­ <lb/>
            ing. But teach me the other one of your two causes, <lb/>
            that which pays nothing; and I will swear by the gods, I <lb/>
            will pay down to you whatever reward you exact of me.</p>
          <p>Soc. By what gods will you swear? for, in the first <lb/>
            place, gods are not a current coin with us.</p>
          <p>Strep. By what do you swear? By iron money, as in <lb/>
            Byzantium ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, <lb/>
            what they rightly are ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Yes, by Jupiter, if it be possible !</p>
          <p>Soc. And to hold converse with the Clouds, our divini­ <lb/>
            ties ?</p>
          <p>Strep. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. (with great solemnity). Seat yourself, then, upon <lb/>
            the sacred couch.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well, I am seated !</p>
          <p>Soc. Take, then, this chaplet.</p>
          <p>Strep. For what purpose a chaplet ?—Ah me ! Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, see that you do not sacrifice me like Athamas !</p>
          <p>Soc. No ; we do all these to those who get initiated.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then what shall I gain, pray?</p>
          <p>Soc. You shall become in oratory a tricky knave, a <lb/>
            thorough rattle, a subtle speaker.-But keep quiet.</p>
          <p>Strep. By Jupiter! you will not deceive me; for if I <lb/>
            am besprinkled, I shall become fine flour.</p>
          <p>Soc. It becomes the old man to speak words of good <lb/>
            omen, and to hearken to my prayer.—O sovereign King, <lb/>
            immeasurable Air, who keepest the earth suspended, and <lb/>
            thou bright Æther, and ye august goddesses, the Clouds <lb/>
            sending thunder and lightning, arise, appear in the air, 0 <lb/>
            mistresses, to your deep thinker!</p>
          <p>Strep. Not yet, not yet, till I wrap this around me, lest <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            I be wet through. To think of my having come from <lb/>
            home without even a cap, unlucky man!</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then, ye highly honoured Clouds, for a dis­ <lb/>
            play to this man. Whether ye are sitting upon the sacred <lb/>
            snow-covered summits of Olympus, or in the gardens of <lb/>
            Father Ocean form a sacred dance with the Nymphs, or <lb/>
            draw in golden pitchers the streams of the waters of the <lb/>
            Nile, or inhabit the Mæotic lake, or the snowy rock of <lb/>
            Mimas, hearken to our prayer, and receive the sacrifice, <lb/>
            and be propitious to the sacred rites. [The followingsong <lb/>
            is heard at a distance, accompanied by loud claps of thunder.]</p>
          <p>Chorus. Eternal Clouds ! let us arise to view with our <lb/>
            dewy, clear-bright nature, from loud-sounding Father <lb/>
            Ocean to the wood-crowned summits of the lofty moun­ <lb/>
            tains, in order that we may behold clearly the far-seen <lb/>
            watch-towers, and the fruits, and the fostering, sacred <lb/>
            earth, and the rushing sounds of the divine rivers, and <lb/>
            the roaring, loud-sounding sea; for the unwearied eye of <lb/>
            Æther sparkles with glittering rays. Come, let us shake <lb/>
            off the watery cloud from our immortal forms and survey <lb/>
            the earth with far-seeing eye.</p>
          <p>Soc. 0 ye greatly venerable Clouds, ye have clearly <lb/>
            heard me when I called. [Turning to STREPSIADES.] Did <lb/>
            you hear the voice, and the thunder which bellowed at <lb/>
            the same time, feared as a god ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I too worship you, 0 ye highly honoured, and <lb/>
            am inclined to reply to the thundering, so much do I trem­ <lb/>
            ble at them and am alarmed. And whether it be lawful, <lb/>
            or be not lawful, I have a desire just now to ease myself.</p>
          <p>Soc. Don't scoff, nor do what these poor-devil-poets do, <lb/>
            but use words of good omen, for a great swarm of god­ <lb/>
            desses is in motion with their songs.</p>
          <p>Cho. Ye rain-bringing virgins, let us come to the fruit­ <lb/>
            ful land of Pallas, to view the much-loved country of <lb/>
            Cecrops, abounding in brave men ; where is reverence <lb/>
            for sacred rites not to be divulged ; where the house that <lb/>
            receives the initiated is thrown open in holy mystic rites; <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            and gifts to the celestial gods; and high-roofed temples, <lb/>
            and statues; and most sacred processions in honour of the <lb/>
            blessed gods; and well-crowned sacrifices to the gods, <lb/>
            and feasts, at all seasons; and with the approach of spring <lb/>
            the Bacchic festivity, and the rousings of melodious <lb/>
            choruses, and the loud-sounding music of flutes.</p>
          <p>Strep. Tell me, 0 Socrates, I beseech you, by Jupiter, <lb/>
            who are these that have uttered this grand song? Are <lb/>
            they some heroines ?</p>
          <p>Soc. By no means ; but heavenly Clouds, great divinities <lb/>
            to idle men; who supply us with thought and argument, <lb/>
            and intelligence, and humbug, and circumlocution, and <lb/>
            ability to hoax, and comprehension.</p>
          <p>Strep. On this account therefore my soul, having heard <lb/>
            their voice, flutters, and already seeks to discourse sub­ <lb/>
            tilely, and to quibble about smoke, and having pricked a <lb/>
            maxim with a little notion, to refute the opposite argu­ <lb/>
            ment. So that now I eagerly desire, if by any means it <lb/>
            be possible, to see them palpably.</p>
          <p>Soc. Look, then, hither, toward Mount Parnes; for <lb/>
            now I behold them descending gently.</p>
          <p>Strep. Pray where? Show me.</p>
          <p>Soc. See! there they come in great numbers through <lb/>
            the hollows and thickets; there, obliquely.</p>
          <p>Strep. What's the matter? for I can't see them.</p>
          <p>Soc. By the entrance.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Enter CHORUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Strep. Now at length with difficulty I just see them.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now at length you assuredly see them, unless you <lb/>
            have your eyes running pumpkins.</p>
          <p>Strep. Yes, by Jupiter! 0 highly honoured Clouds, <lb/>
            for now they cover all things.</p>
          <p>Soc. Did you not, however, know, nor yet consider, <lb/>
            these to be goddesses?</p>
          <p>Strep. No, by Jupiter! but I thought them to be mist, <lb/>
            and dew, and smoke. <note type="footnote"> 20 </note></p><pb n="306"/>
            
          <p>Soc. For you do not know, by Jupiter! that these feed <lb/>
            very many sophists, Thurian soothsayers, practisers of <lb/>
            medicine, lazy-long-haired-on y x-ring-wearers, song-twist­ <lb/>
            ers for the cyclic dances, and meteorological quacks. <lb/>
            They feed idle people who do nothing, because such men <lb/>
            celebrate them in verse.</p>
          <p>Strep. For this reason, then, they introduced into their <lb/>
            verses “the dreadful impetuosity of the moist, whirling- <lb/>
            bright clouds ”; and " the curls of hundred-headed Typho"; <lb/>
            and “ the hard-blowing tempests " ; and then, “ aerial, <lb/>
            moist ; “ crooked-clawed birds, floating in air "; and <lb/>
            " the showers of rain from dewy Clouds." And then, in <lb/>
            return for these, they swallow “ slices of great, fine mul­ <lb/>
            lets, and bird's-flesh of thrushes."</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not just, however, that they should have <lb/>
            their reward, on account of these ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Tell me, pray, if they are really Clouds, what <lb/>
            ails them, that they resemble mortal women? For they <lb/>
            are not such.</p>
          <p>Soc. Pray, of what nature are they ?</p>
          <p>Strep. 1 do not clearly know: at any rate they resem­ <lb/>
            ble spread-out fleeces, and not women, by Jupiter! not a <lb/>
            bit; for these have noses.</p>
          <p>Soc. Answer, then, whatever I ask you.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then say quickly what you wish.</p>
          <p>Soc. Have you ever, when you looked up, seen a cloud <lb/>
            like to a centaur, or a panther, or a wolf, or a bull ?</p>
          <p>Strep. By Jupiter, have I! But what of that?</p>
          <p>Soc. They become all things, whatever they please. <lb/>
            And then if they see a person with long hair, a wild one <lb/>
            of these hairy fellows, like the son of Xenophantes, in de­ <lb/>
            rision of his folly, they liken themselves to centaurs.</p>
          <p>Strep. Why, what, if they should see Simon, a plunderer <lb/>
            of the public property, what do they do?</p>
          <p>Soc. They suddenly become wolves, showing up his <lb/>
            disposition.</p>
          <p>Strep. For this reason, then, for this reason, when they <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            yesterday saw Cleonymus the recreant, on this account <lb/>
            they became stags, because they saw this most cowardly <lb/>
            fellow.</p>
          <p>Soc. And now too, because they saw Clisthenes, you <lb/>
            observe, on this account they became women.</p>
          <p>Strep. Hail therefore, 0 mistresses! And now, if ever <lb/>
            ye did to any other, to me also utter a voice reaching to <lb/>
            heaven, 0 all-powerful queens.</p>
          <p>Cho. Hail, 0 ancient veteran, hunter after learned <lb/>
            speeches! And thou, 0 priest of most subtle trifles! tell <lb/>
            us what you require ? For we would not hearken to any <lb/>
            other of the present meteorological sophists, except to <lb/>
            Prodicus; to him, on account of his wisdom and intelli­ <lb/>
            gence ; and to you, because you walk proudly in the <lb/>
            streets, and cast your eyes askance, and endure many <lb/>
            hardships with bare feet, and in reliance upon us lookest <lb/>
            supercilious.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 Earth, what a voice ! how holy, and dignified, <lb/>
            and wondrous!</p>
          <p>Soc. For, in fact, these alone are goddesses ; and all the <lb/>
            rest is nonsense.</p>
          <p>Strep. But come, by the Earth, is not Jupiter, the <lb/>
            Olympian, a god ?</p>
          <p>Soc. What Jupiter? Do not trifle. There is no Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Strep. What do you say? Who rains, then? For first <lb/>
            of all explain this to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. These, to be sure. I will teach you it by powerful <lb/>
            evidence. Come, where have you ever seen him raining <lb/>
            at any time without Clouds? And yet he ought to rain in <lb/>
            fine weather, and these to be absent.</p>
          <p>Strep. By Apollo, of a truth you have rightly con­ <lb/>
            firmed this by your present argument. And yet, before <lb/>
            this, I really thought that Jupiter caused the rain. But <lb/>
            tell me who it is that thunders. This makes me tremble.</p>
          <p>Soc. These, as they roll, thunder.</p>
          <p>Strep. In what way ? you all-daring man !</p>
          <p>Soc. When they are full of much water, and are com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            polled to be borne along, being necessarily precipitated <lb/>
            when full of rain, then they fall heavily upon each other <lb/>
            and burst and clap.</p>
          <p>Strep. Who is it that compels them to be borne along? <lb/>
            is it not Jupiter?</p>
          <p>Soc. By no means, but æthereal Vortex. t</p>
          <p>Strep. Vortex? It had escaped my notice that Jupiter <lb/>
            did not exist, and that Vortex now reigned in his stead. <lb/>
            But you have taught me nothing as yet concerning the <lb/>
            clap and the thunder.</p>
          <p>Soc. Have you not heard me, that I said that the Clouds, <lb/>
            when full of moisture, dash against each other, and clap by <lb/>
            reason of their density ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Come, how am I to believe this?</p>
          <p>Soc. I'llteach you from your own case. Were you <lb/>
            ever, after being stuffed with broth at the Panathenaic <lb/>
            festival, then disturbed in your belly, and did a tumult <lb/>
            suddenly rumble through it?</p>
          <p>Strep. Yes, by Apollo! and immediately the little <lb/>
            broth plays the mischief witi me, and is disturbed, <lb/>
            and rumbles like thunder, and grumbles dreadfully: at <lb/>
            first gently pappax, pappax; and then it adds papa­ <lb/>
            pappax ; and finally, it thunders downright papapappax, <lb/>
            as they do.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            Soc. Consider, therefore, how you have trumpeted from <lb/>
            a little belly so small: and how is it not probable that this <lb/>
            air, being boundless, should thunder loudly ? {</p>
          <p>Strep. For this reason, therefore, the two names also, <lb/>
            Trump and Thunder, are similar to each other. But teach <lb/>
            me this, whence comes the thunderbolt blazing with fire, <lb/>
            and burns us to ashes when it smites us, and singes those <lb/>
            who survive. For indeed Jupiter evidently hurls this at <lb/>
            the perjured.</p>
          <p>Soc. Why, how then, you foolish person, and savouring <lb/>
            of the dark ages and antediluvian, if his manner is to smite <lb/>
            the perjured, does he not blast Simon, and Cleonymus, <lb/>
            and Theorus? And yet they are very perjured. But he <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            smites his own temple, and Sunium the promontory of <lb/>
            Athens, and the tall oaks. Wherefore ? for indeed an oak <lb/>
            does not commit perjury.</p>
          <p>Strep. I do not know; but you seem to speak well. <lb/>
            For what, pray, is the thunderbolt?</p>
          <p>Soc. When a dry wind, having been raised aloft, is <lb/>
            inclosed in these Clouds, it inflates them within, like a <lb/>
            bladder; and then, of necessity, having burst them, it <lb/>
            rushes out with vehemence by reason of its density, set­ <lb/>
            ting fire to itself through its rushing and impetuosity.</p>
          <p>Strep. By Jupiter, of a truth I once experienced this <lb/>
            exactly at the Diasian festival! I was roasting a haggis <lb/>
            for my kinsfolk, and through neglect I did not cut it open ; <lb/>
            but it became inflated, and then suddenly bursting, befouled <lb/>
            my eyes, and burned my face.</p>
          <p>Cho. 0 mortal, who hast desired great wisdom from <lb/>
            us! How happy will you become among the Athenians <lb/>
            and among the Greeks, if you be possessed of a good <lb/>
            memory, and be a deep thinker, and endurance of labour <lb/>
            be implanted in your soul, and you be not wearied either <lb/>
            by standing or walking, nor be exceedingly vexed at shiv­ <lb/>
            ering with cold, nor long to break your fast, and you <lb/>
            refrain from wine, and gymnastics, and the other follies, <lb/>
            and consider this the highest excellence, as is proper a <lb/>
            clever man should, to conquer by action and counsel, and <lb/>
            by battling with your tongue.</p>
          <p>Strep. As far as regards a sturdy spirit, and care that <lb/>
            makes one's bed uneasy, and a frugal and hard-living and <lb/>
            savory-eating belly, be of good courage and don't trouble <lb/>
            yourself; I would offer myself to hammer on, for that <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will you not, pray, now believe in no god, except <lb/>
            what we believe in-this Chaos, and the Clouds, and the <lb/>
            Tongue-these three?</p>
          <p>Strep. Absolutely I would not even converse with the <lb/>
            others, not even if I met them ; nor would I sacrifice to <lb/>
            them, nor make libations, nor offer frankincense.</p><pb n="310"/>
            
          <p>Cho. Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you? <lb/>
            for you shall not fail in getting it, if you honour and <lb/>
            admire us, and seek to become clever.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 mistresses, I request of you then this very <lb/>
            small favour, that I be the best of the Greeks in speaking <lb/>
            by a hundred stadia.</p>
          <p>Cho. Well, you shall have this from us, so that hence- <lb/>
            forward from this time no one shall get more opinions <lb/>
            passed in the public assemblies than you.</p>
          <p>Strep. Grant me not to deliver important opinions ; for <lb/>
            I do not desire these, but only to pervert the right for my <lb/>
            own advantage, and to evade my creditors.</p>
          <p>Cho. Then you shall obtain what you desire; for you <lb/>
            do not covet great things. But commit yourself without <lb/>
            fear to our ministers.</p>
          <p>Strep. I will do so in reliance upon you, for necessity <lb/>
            oppresses me, on account of the blood-horses, and the <lb/>
            marriage that- ruined me. Now, therefore, let them <lb/>
            use me as they please. I give up this my body to them <lb/>
            to be beaten, to be hungered, to be troubled with thirst, <lb/>
            to be squalid, to shiver with cold, to flay into a leathern <lb/>
            bottle, if I shall escape clear from my debts, and appear <lb/>
            to men to be bold, glib of tongue, audacious, impudent, <lb/>
            shameless, a fabricator of falsehoods, inventive of words, a <lb/>
            practised knave in lawsuits, a law-tablet, a thorough rattle, <lb/>
            fox, a sharper, a slippery knave, a dissembler, a slippery <lb/>
            fellow, an impostor, a gallows-bird, a blackguard, a twister, <lb/>
            a troublesome fellow, a licker-up of hashes. If they call <lb/>
            me this, when they meet me, let them do to me absolutely <lb/>
            what they please. And if they like, by Ceres! let them <lb/>
            serve up a sausage out of me to the deep thinkers.</p>
          <p>Cho. This man has a spirit not void of courage, but <lb/>
            prompt. Know, that if you learn these matters from me, <lb/>
            you will possess among mortals a glory as high as heaven.</p>
          <p>Strep. What shall I experience ?</p>
          <p>Cho. You shall pass with me the most enviable of mor­ <lb/>
            tal lives the whole time.</p><pb n="311"/>
            
          <p>Strep. Shall I then ever see this ?</p>
          <p>Cho. Yea, so that many be always seated at your <lb/>
            gates, wishing to communicate with you and come to a <lb/>
            conference with you, to consult with you as to actions <lb/>
            and affidavits of many talents, as is worthy of your abili­ <lb/>
            ties. [To SOCRATES.] But attempt to teach the old man <lb/>
            by degrees whatever you purpose, and scrutinize his in­ <lb/>
            tellect, and make trial of his mind.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come now, tell me your own turn of mind ; in <lb/>
            order that, when I know of what sort it is, I may now, <lb/>
            after this, apply to you new engines.</p>
          <p>Strep. What? By the gods, do you purpose to be­ <lb/>
            siege me ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No ; I wish to briefly learn from you if you are <lb/>
            possessed of a good memory.</p>
          <p>Strep. In two ways, by Jove ! If anything be owing <lb/>
            to me, I have a very good memory ; but if I owe, un­ <lb/>
            happy man, I am very forgetful.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is the power of speaking, pray, implanted in <lb/>
            your nature ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Speaking is not in me, but cheating is.</p>
          <p>Soc. How, then, will you be able to learn ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Excellently, of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come, then, take care that, whenever I propound <lb/>
            any clever dogma about abstruse matters, you catch it up <lb/>
            immediately.</p>
          <p>Strep. What then ? Am I to feed upon wisdom like a <lb/>
            dog ?</p>
          <p>Soc. This man is ignorant and brutish.—I fear, old <lb/>
            man, lest you will need blows. Come, let file see ; what <lb/>
            do you do if any one beat you ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I take the beating; and then, when I have <lb/>
            waited a little while, I call witnesses to prove it : then, <lb/>
            again, after a short interval, I go to law.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come, then, lay down your cloak.</p>
          <p>Strep. Have I done any wrong ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No; but it is the rule to enter naked.</p><pb n="312"/>
            
          <p>Strep. But I do not enter to search for stolen goods.</p>
          <p>Soc. Lay it down. Why do you talk nonsense ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Now tell me this, pray. If I be diligent and <lb/>
            learn zealously, to which of your disciples shall I become <lb/>
            like ?</p>
          <p>Soc. You will no way differ from Chaerephon in intellect.</p>
          <p>Strep. Ah me, unhappy ! I shall become half-dead.</p>
          <p>Soc. Don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with <lb/>
            smartness.</p>
          <p>Strep. Then give me first into my hands a honeyed <lb/>
            cake; for I am afraid of descending within, as if into the <lb/>
            cave of Trophonius.</p>
          <p>Soc. Proceed; why do you keep poking about the <lb/>
            door? [Exeunt SOCRATES and STREPSIADES.</p>
          <p>Cho. Well, go in peace, for the sake of this your val­ <lb/>
            our. May prosperity attend the man, because, being ad­ <lb/>
            vanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect with <lb/>
            modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom ! [Turning to the <lb/>
            audience.] |</p>
          <p>Spectators, I will freely declare to you the truth, by <lb/>
            Bacchus, who nurtured me! So may I conquer, and be <lb/>
            accounted skilful, as that, deeming you to be clever spec­ <lb/>
            tators, and this to be the cleverest of my comedies, I <lb/>
            thought proper to let you first taste that comedy, which <lb/>
            gave me the greatest labour. And then I retired from <lb/>
            the contest defeated by vulgar fellows, though I did not <lb/>
            deserve it. These things, therefore, I object to you, a <lb/>
            learned audience, for whose sake I was expending this <lb/>
            labour. But not even thus will I ever willingly desert <lb/>
            the discerning portion of you. For since what time my <lb/>
            Modest Man and my Rake were very highly praised here <lb/>
            by an audience, with whom it is a pleasure even to hold <lb/>
            converse, and I (for I was still a virgin, and it was not <lb/>
            lawful for me as yet to have children) exposed my off­ <lb/>
            spring, and another girl took it up and owned it, and you <lb/>
            generously reared and educated it, from this time I have <lb/>
            had sure pledges of your good will toward me. Now, <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            therefore, like that well-known Electra, has this comedy <lb/>
            come seeking, if haply it meet with an audience so clever, <lb/>
            for it will recognise, if it should see, the lock of its <lb/>
            brother. But see how modest she is by nature, who, in <lb/>
            the first place, has come, having stitched to her no leath­ <lb/>
            ern phallus hanging down, red at the top, and thick, to <lb/>
            set the boys a laughing ; nor yet jeered the bald-headed, <lb/>
            nor danced the cordax ; nor does the old man who speaks <lb/>
            the verses beat the person near him with his staff, keep­ <lb/>
            ing out of sight wretched ribaldry; nor has she rushed in <lb/>
            with torches, nor does she shout <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰοὺ ἰού</foreign> ;but has come re­ <lb/>
            lying on herself and her verses. And I, although so ex­ <lb/>
            cellent a poet, do not give myself airs, nor do I seek to <lb/>
            deceive you by twice and thrice bringing forward the <lb/>
            same pieces ; but I am always clever at introducing new <lb/>
            fashions, not at all resembling each other, and all of them <lb/>
            clever ; who struck Cleon in the belly when at the height <lb/>
            of his power, and could not bear to attack him afterward <lb/>
            when he was down. But these scribblers, when once <lb/>
            Hyperbolus has given them a handle, keep ever tram­ <lb/>
            pling on this wretched man and his mother. Eupolis, in­ <lb/>
            deed, first of all craftily introduced his Maricas, having <lb/>
            basely, base fellow, spoiled by altering my play of the <lb/>
            Knights, having added to it, for the sake of the cordax, a <lb/>
            drunken old woman, whom Phrynichus long ago poetized, <lb/>
            whom the whale was for devouring. Then again Her­ <lb/>
            mippus made verses on Hyperbolus; and now all others <lb/>
            press hard upon Hyperbolus, imitating my simile of the <lb/>
            eels. Whoever, therefore, laughs at these, let him not <lb/>
            take pleasure in my attempts; but if you are delighted <lb/>
            with me and my inventions, in times to come you will <lb/>
            seem to be wise.</p>
          <p>I first invoke, to join our choral band, the mighty <lb/>
            Jupiter, ruling on high, the monarch of gods; and the <lb/>
            potent master of the trident, the fierce upheaver of earth <lb/>
            and briny sea; and our father of great renown, most au­ <lb/>
            gust Æther, life-supporter of all: and the horse-guider, <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            1 <lb/>
            who fills the plain of the earth with exceeding bright <lb/>
            beams, a mighty deity among gods and mortals.</p>
          <p>Most clever spectators, come, give us your attention; <lb/>
            for having been injured, we blame you to your faces. For <lb/>
            though we benefit the state most of all the gods, to us <lb/>
            alone of deities you do not offer sacrifice nor yet pour <lb/>
            libations, who watch over you. For if there should be <lb/>
            any expedition without prudence, then we either thunder <lb/>
            or drizzle small rain. And then, when you were for <lb/>
            choosing as your general the Paphlagonian tanner, hate­ <lb/>
            ful to the gods, we contracted our brows and were en­ <lb/>
            raged; and thunder burst through the lightning; and the <lb/>
            Moon forsook her usual paths; and the Sun immediately <lb/>
            drew in his wick to himself, and declared he would not <lb/>
            give you light, if Cleon should be your general. Never­ <lb/>
            theless you chose him. For they say that ill counsel is <lb/>
            in this city ; that the gods, however, turn all these your <lb/>
            mismanagements to a prosperous issue. And how this <lb/>
            also shall be advantageous, we will easily teach you. <lb/>
            If you should convict the cormorant Cleon of bribery and <lb/>
            embezzlement, and then make fast his neck in the stocks, <lb/>
            the affair will turn out for the state to the ancient form <lb/>
            again, if you have mismanaged in any way, and to a pros­ <lb/>
            perous issue.</p>
          <p>Hear me again, King Phœbus, Delian Apollo, who in­ <lb/>
            habitest the high-peaked Cynthian rock ! and thou, blessed <lb/>
            goddess, who inhabitest the all-golden house of Ephesus, <lb/>
            in which Lydian damsels greatly reverence thee; and <lb/>
            thou, our national goddess, swayer of the regis, Minerva, <lb/>
            guardian of the city ! and thou, reveller Bacchus, who, <lb/>
            inhabiting the Parnassian rock, sparklest with torches, <lb/>
            conspicuous among the Delphic Bacchanals !</p>
          <p>When we had got ready to set out hither, the Moon <lb/>
            met us, and commanded us first to greet the Athenians <lb/>
            and their allies; and then declared that she was angry, <lb/>
            for that she had suffered dreadful things, though she <lb/>
            benefits you all, not in words, but openly. In the first <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            place, not less than a drachma every month for torches; <lb/>
            so that also all, when they went out of an evening, were <lb/>
            wont to say, “Boy, don't buy a torch, for the moonlight <lb/>
            is beautiful." And she says she confers other benefits on <lb/>
            you, but that you do not observe the days at all correctly, <lb/>
            but confuse them up and down; so that she says the gods <lb/>
            are constantly threatening her, when they are defrauded <lb/>
            of their dinner, and depart home, not having met with the <lb/>
            regular feast according to the number of the days. And <lb/>
            then, when you ought to be sacrificing, you are inflicting <lb/>
            tortures and litigating. And often, while we gods are <lb/>
            observing a fast, when we mourn for Memnon or Sarpe­ <lb/>

            most beautiful measure: the trimetre or the tetrametre?</p>
          <p>Strep. I think nothing superior to the semisextarius.</p>

            what, again, according to the dactyle.</p>

          <p>Soc. You must learn one thing more about names, <lb/>
            what are masculine, and what of them are feminine.</p>
          <p>Strep. I know what are female.</p>

          <p>Soc. What names are masculine ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Thousands: Philoxenus, Melesias, Amynias.</p>
          <p>Soc. But, you wretch! these are not masculine.</p>
          <p>Strep. Are they not males with you ?</p>

          <p>Strep. How would I call ? Thus: “Come hither, come <lb/>

            cock-chafer tied with a thread by the foot.</p>
          <p>Strep. I have found a very clever method of getting <lb/>
            rid of my suit, so that you yourself would acknowl­ <lb/>
            edge it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Of what description ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Have you ever seen this stone in the chemists' <lb/>
            shops, the beautiful and transparent one, from which they <lb/>
            kindle fire?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you mean the burning-glass?</p>
          <p>f Strep. I do. Come, what would you say, pray, if I <lb/>
            were to take this, when the clerk was entering the suit, <lb/>
            and were to stand at a distance, in the direction of the <lb/>
            sun, thus, and melt out the letters of my suit?</p>
          <p>Soc. Cleverly done, by the Graces!</p>
          <p>Strep. Oh! how I am delighted, that a suit of five <lb/>
            talents has been cancelled !</p>
          <p>Soc. Come now, quickly seize upon this.</p>
          <p>Strep. What?</p>
          <p>Soc. How, when engaged in a lawsuit, you could over­ <lb/>
            turn the suit, when you were about to be cast, because <lb/>
            you had no witnesses.</p>
          <p>Strep. Most readily and easily.</p>
          <p>Soc. Tell me, pray.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well now, I'll tell you. If, while one suit was <lb/>

            away and hang myself.</p>

            learn to ply the tongue. Come, 0 ye Clouds, give me <lb/>

            up, to send him to learn in your stead.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well, I have a fine, handsome son, but he is not <lb/>
            willing to learn. What must I do?</p>
          <p>Cho. But do you permit him ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Yes, for he is robust in body, and in good health, <lb/>
            and is come of the high-plumed dames of Cœsyra. I will <lb/>
            go for him, and if he be not willing, I will certainly drive <lb/>

            be? tell me.</p><pb n="323"/>
            
          <p><lb/>
            Phid. Alectryon.</p>
          <p>Strep. Right. And what this?</p>
          <p>Phid. Alectryon.</p>
          <p>Strep. Both the same? You are very ridiculous. Do <lb/>
            not do so, then, for the future; but call this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεκτρύαινα</foreign>, <lb/>
            and this one <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλέκτωρ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Phid. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλεκτρύαινα</foreign>!Did you learn these clever things <lb/>
            by going in just now to the Titans?</p>
          <p>Strep. And many others too ; but whatever I learned <lb/>
            on each occasion I used to forget immediately, through <lb/>
            length of years.</p>
          <p>Phid. Is it for this reason, pray, you have also lost your <lb/>
            cloak ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I have not lost it; but have studied it away.</p>
          <p>Phid. What have you made of your slippers, you fool­ <lb/>
            ish man ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I have expended them, like Pericles, for needful <lb/>
            purposes. Come, move, let us go. And then if you obey <lb/>
            your father, go wrong if you like. I also know that I for­ <lb/>
            merly obeyed you, a lisping child of six years old, and <lb/>
            bought you a go-cart at the Diasia, with the first obolus <lb/>
            I received from the Heliæa.</p>
          <p>Phid. You will assuredly some time at length be grieved <lb/>
            at this.</p>
          <p>Strep. It is well done of you that you obeyed. Come <lb/>
            hither, come hither, 0 Socrates! come forth, for I bring <lb/>
            to you this son of mine, having persuaded him against <lb/>
            his will.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Enter SOCRATES</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Soc. For he is still childish, and not used to the baskets <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>Phid. You would yourself be used to them if you were <lb/>
            hanged.</p>
          <p>Strep. A mischief take you! do you abuse your teacher?</p>
          <p>Soc. " Were hanged" quoth 'a! how sillily he pro­ <lb/>
            nounced it, and with lips wide apart! How can this <lb/>
            youth ever learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal sum­ <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            mons, or persuasive refutation? And yet Hyperbolus <lb/>
            learned this at the cost of a talent.</p>
          <p>Strep. Never mind ; teach him. He is clever by nature. <lb/>
            Indeed, from his earliest years, when he was a little fellow <lb/>
            only so big, he was wont to form houses and carve ships <lb/>
            within-doors, and make little wagons of leather, and <lb/>
            make frogs out of pomegranate-rinds, you can't think <lb/>
            how cleverly. But see that he learns those two causes; <lb/>
            the better, whatever it may be; and the worse, which, <lb/>
            by maintaining what is unjust, overturns the better. If <lb/>
            not both, at any rate the unjust one by all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. He shall learn it himself from the two causes in <lb/>
            person. [Exit SOCRATES.</p>
          <p>Strep. I will take my departure. Remember this now, <lb/>
            that he is to be able to reply to all just arguments. [Exit <lb/>

          <p>Unj. But I conquer you, who say that you are better <lb/>
            than I.</p>
          <p>Just. By doing what clever trick ?</p>
          <p>Unj. By discovering new contrivances.</p>
          <p>Just. For these innovations nourish by the favour of <lb/>
            these silly persons.</p>
          <p>Unj. No ; but wise persons.</p>
          <p>Just. I will destroy you miserably.</p>

          <p>Just. By speaking what is just.</p>
          <p>Unt. But I will overturn them by contradicting them ; <lb/>
            for I deny that justice even exists at all.</p>
          <p>Just. Do you deny that it exists?</p>

          <p>perished, who bound his own father ?</p>
          <p>Just, Bah ! this profanity now is spreading! Give me <lb/>
            a basin.</p>
          <p>Unj. You are a dotard and absurd.</p>
          <p>Just. You are debauched and shameless.</p>
          <p>Unj. You have spoken roses of me.</p>
          <p>Just. And a dirty lickspittle.</p>
          <p>Unj. You crown me with lilies.</p>
          <p>Just. And a parricide.</p>
          <p>Unj. You don't know that you are sprinkling me with <lb/>

          <p>Unj. But now this is an ornament to me.</p>
          <p>Just. You are very impudent.</p>
          <p>Unj. And you are antiquated.</p>
          <p>Just. And through you, no one of our youths is willing <lb/>
            to go to school; and you will be found out some time or <lb/>
            other by the Athenians, what sort of doctrines you teach <lb/>
            the simple-minded.</p>
          <p>Unj. You are shamefully squalid.</p>
          <p>Just. And you are prosperous. And yet formerly you <lb/>
            were a beggar, saying that you were the Mysian Tele­ <lb/>
            phus, and gnawing the maxims of Pandeletus out of your <lb/>
            little wallet.</p>
          <p>Unj. Oh, the wisdom--</p>
          <p>Just. Oh, the madness-</p>
          <p>Unj. Which you have mentioned.</p>
          <p>Just. And of your city, which supports you who ruin <lb/>
            her youths.</p>
          <p>Unj. You sha'n't teach this youth, you old dotard.</p>
          <p>Just. Yes, if he is to be saved, and not merely to prac­ <lb/>
            tise loquacity.</p>
          <p>Unj. (to PHIDIPPIDES). Come hither, and leave him to <lb/>
            rave.</p>
          <p>Just. You shall howl, if you lay your hand on him.</p><pb n="326"/>
            
          <p>Cho. Cease from contention and railing. But show to <lb/>
            us, you, what you used to teach the men of former times, <lb/>
            and you, the new system of education ; in order that, <lb/>
            having heard you disputing, he may decide and go to the <lb/>
            school of one or the other.</p>
          <p>Just. I am willing to do so.</p>
          <p>Vij. I also am willing.</p>
          <p>Cho. Come now, which of the two shall speak first?</p>
          <p>Unj. I will give him the precedence; and then, from <lb/>
            these things which he adduces, I will shoot him dead with <lb/>
            new words and thoughts. And at last, if he mutter, he <lb/>
            shall be destroyed, being stung in his whole face and his <lb/>
            two eyes by my maxims, as if by bees.</p>
          <p>Cho. Now the two, relying on very dexterous argu­ <lb/>
            ments and thoughts, and sententious maxims, will show <lb/>
            which of them shall appear superior in argument. For <lb/>
            now the whole crisis of wisdom is here laid before them; <lb/>
            about which my friends have a very great contest. But <lb/>
            do you, who adorned our elders with many virtuous; <lb/>
            manners, utter the voice in which you rejoice, and declare <lb/>
            your nature.</p>
          <p>Just. I will, therefore, describe the ancient system of <lb/>
            education, how it was ordered, when I nourished in thej <lb/>
            advocacy of justice, and temperance was the fashion. In <lb/>
            the first place it was incumbent that no one should hear <lb/>
            the voice of a boy uttering a syllable; and next, that <lb/>
            those from the same quarter of the town should march <lb/>
            in good order through the streets to the school of the <lb/>
            harp-master, naked, and in a body, even if it were to <lb/>
            snow as thick as meal. Then again, their master would <lb/>
            teach them, not sitting cross-legged, to learn by rote a <lb/>
            song, either “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παλλάδαπερσέπολινδεινὰν</foreign>,”or " <foreign xml:lang="grc">τηλέπορόντι <lb/>
            βόαμα</foreign>,”raising to a higher pitch the harmony which our <lb/>
            fathers transmitted to us. But if any of them were to <lb/>
            play the buffoon, or turn any quavers, like these difficult <lb/>
            turns the present artists make after the manner of Phry­ <lb/>
            nis, he used to be thrashed, being beaten with mann' <lb/>
            J <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            blows, as banishing the Muses. And it behooved the <lb/>
            boys, while sitting in the school of the Gymnastic-master, <lb/>
            to cover the thigh, so that they might exhibit nothing in­ <lb/>
            decent to those outside; then, again, after rising from the <lb/>
            ground, to sweep the sand together, and to take care not <lb/>
            to leave an impression of the person for their lovers. <lb/>
            And no boy used in those days to anoint himself below <lb/>
            the navel; so that their bodies wore the appearance of <lb/>
            blooming health. Nor used he to go to his lover, having <lb/>
            made up his voice in an effeminate tone, prostituting him­ <lb/>
            self with his eyes. Nor used it to be allowed when one <lb/>
            was dining to take the head of a radish, or to snatch from <lb/>
            their seniors dill or parsley, or to eat fish, or to giggle, or <lb/>
            to keep the legs crossed.</p>
          <p>Unj. Aye, antiquated and Dipolia -like, and full of <lb/>
            grasshoppers, and of Cecydes, and of the Buphonian <lb/>
            festival!</p>
          <p>Just. Yet certainly these are those principles by which <lb/>
            my system of education nurtured the men who fought at <lb/>
            Marathon. But you teach the men of the present day, <lb/>
            from their earliest years, to be wrapped up in himatia; <lb/>
            so that I am choked, when at the Panathenaia a fellow, <lb/>
            holding his shield before his person, neglects Tritogenia, <lb/>
            when they ought to dance. Wherefore, 0 youth, choose, <lb/>
            with confidence, me, the better cause, and you will learn <lb/>
            to hate the Agora, and to refrain from baths, and to be <lb/>
            ashamed of what is disgraceful, and to be enraged if any <lb/>
            one jeer you, and to rise up from seats before your seniors <lb/>
            when they approach, and not to behave ill toward your <lb/>
            parents, and to do nothing else that is base, because you <lb/>
            are to form in your mind an image of Modesty : and not <lb/>
            to dart into the house of a dancing woman, lest, while <lb/>
            gaping after these things, being struck with an apple by <lb/>
            a wanton, you should be damaged in your reputation: <lb/>
            and not to contradict your father in anything ; nor by <lb/>
            calling him Iapetus, to reproach him with the ills of age, <lb/>
            by which you were reared in your infancy.</p><pb n="328"/>
            
          <p>Unj.If you shall believe him in this, 0 youth, by Bac­ <lb/>
            chus, you will be like the sons of Hippocrates, and they <lb/>
            will call you a booby.</p>
          <p>Just. Yet certainly shall you spend your time in the <lb/>
            gymnastic schools, sleek and blooming ; not chattering in <lb/>
            the market-place rude jests, like the youths of the present <lb/>
            day; nor dragged into court for a petty suit, greedy, <lb/>
            pettifogging, knavish; but you shall descend to the <lb/>
            Academy and run races beneath the sacred olives along <lb/>
            with some modest compeer, crowned with white reeds, <lb/>
            redolent of yew, and careless ease, and of leaf-shedding <lb/>
            white poplar, rejoicing in the season of spring, when the <lb/>
            plane-tree whispers to the elm. If you do these things <lb/>
            which I say, and apply your mind to these, you will ever <lb/>
            have a stout chest, a clear complexion, broad shoulders, a <lb/>
            little tongue, large hips, little lewdness. But if you prac­ <lb/>
            tise what the youths of the present day do, you will have, <lb/>
            in the first place, a pallid complexion, small shoulders, a <lb/>
            narrow chest, a large tongue, little hips, great lewdness, <lb/>
            a long psephism ; and this deceiver will persuade you to <lb/>
            consider everything that is base to be honourable, and <lb/>
            what is honourable to be base ; and, in addition to this, he <lb/>
            will fill you with the lewdness of Antimachus.</p>
          <p>Cho. 0 thou that practises! most renowned high-tower­ <lb/>
            ing wisdom ! how sweetly does a modest grace attend <lb/>
            your words! Happy, therefore, were they who lived in <lb/>
            those days, in the times of former men ! In reply, then, <lb/>
            to these, 0 thou that hast a dainty-seeming Muse, it be­ <lb/>
            hooveth thee to say something new ; since the man has <lb/>
            gained renown. And it appears you have need of power­ <lb/>
            ful arguments against him, if you are to conquer the man <lb/>
            and not incur laughter.</p>
          <p>Unj. And yet I was choking in my heart, and was <lb/>
            longing to confound all these with contrary maxims. For <lb/>
            I have been called among the deep thinkers the “worse <lb/>
            cause," on this very account, that I first contrived how to <lb/>
            speak against both law and justice : and this art is worth <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            more than ten thousand staters, that one should choose <lb/>
            the worse cause, and nevertheless be victorious. But <lb/>
            mark how I will confute the system of education on which <lb/>
            he relies, who says, in the first place, that he will not per- j <lb/>
            mit you to be washed with warm water. And yet, on <lb/>
            what principle do you blame the warm baths ?</p>
          <p>Just. Because it is most vile, and makes a man cow­ <lb/>
            ardly.</p>
          <p>Unj. Stop ! For immediately I seize and hold you by <lb/>
            the waist without escape. Come, tell me, which of the <lb/>
            sons of Jupiter do you deem to have been the bravest in <lb/>
            soul, and to have undergone most labours ?</p>
          <p>Just. I consider no man superior to Hercules.</p>
          <p>Unj. Where, pray, did you ever see cold Heraclean <lb/>
            baths ? And yet, who was more valiant than he ?</p>
          <p>Just. These are the very things which make the bath <lb/>
            full of youths always chattering all day long, but the <lb/>
            palæstras empty.</p>
          <p>Unj. You next find fault with their living in the mar­ <lb/>
            ket-place ; but I commend it. For if it had been bad, <lb/>
            Homer would never have been for representing Nestor <lb/>
            as an orator; nor all the other wise men. I will return, <lb/>
            then, from thence to the tongue, which this fellow says <lb/>
            our youths ought not to exercise, while I maintain they <lb/>
            should. And, again, he says they ought to be modest: <lb/>
            two very great evils. For tell me to whom you have ever <lb/>
            seen any good accrue through modesty; and confute me <lb/>
            by your words.</p>
          <p>Just. To many. Peleus, at any rate, received his <lb/>
            sword on account of it.</p>
          <p>Unj. A sword ? Marry, he got a pretty piece of luck, <lb/>
            the poor wretch ! while Hyperbolus, he of the lamps, got <lb/>
            more than many talents by his villainy, but, by Jupiter, no <lb/>
            sword !</p>
          <p>Just. And Peleus married Thetis, too, through his <lb/>
            modesty.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            Unj. And then she went off, and left him ; for he was <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            not lustful, nor an agreeable bedfellow to spend the night <lb/>
            with. Now a woman delights in being wantonly treated. <lb/>
            But you are an old dotard. For (to PHIDIPPIDES) consider, <lb/>
            O youth, all that attaches to modesty, and of how many <lb/>
            pleasures you are about to be deprived-of women, of <lb/>
            games at cottabus, of dainties, of drinking-bouts, of gig­ <lb/>
            gling. And yet, what is life worth to you if you be de­ <lb/>
            prived of these enjoyments? Well, I will pass from thence <lb/>
            to the necessities of our nature. You have gone astray, <lb/>
            you have fallen in love, you have been guilty of some <lb/>
            adultery, and then have been caught. You are undone, <lb/>
            for you are unable to speak. But if you associate with <lb/>
            me, indulge your inclination, dance, laugh, and think noth­ <lb/>
            ing disgraceful. For if you should happen to be detected <lb/>
            as an adulterer, you will make this reply to him, " that <lb/>
            you have done him no injury ”: and then refer him to Ju­ <lb/>
            piter, how even he is overcome by love and women. And <lb/>
            yet, how could you, who are a mortal, have greater <lb/>
            power than a god ?</p>
          <p>Just. But what if he should suffer the radish through <lb/>
            obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes? What <lb/>
            argument will he be able to state, to prove that he is not a <lb/>

            their own accord ; but if not, that they might be worried <lb/>

            deposits on the new moon, but on the Old and New ?</p>
          <p>Phid. They seem to me to do what the forestallers do: <lb/>

            overcome all with whomsoever he holds converse, even <lb/>
            if he advance most villainous doctrines; and perhaps, per­ <lb/>
            haps his father will wish that he were even speechless.</p>
          <p>Strep. (running out of the house pursued by his son). <lb/>
            Hollo! Hollo ! 0 neighbours and kinsfolk and fellow- <lb/>
            tribesmen, defend me, by all means, who am being <lb/>
            beaten ! Ah me, unhappy man, for my head and jaw ! <lb/>
            Wretch ! do you beat your father?</p>
          <p>Phid. Yes, father.</p>
          <p>Strep. You see him owning that he beats me.</p>
          <p>Phid. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 wretch, and parricide, and house-breaker!</p>
          <p>Phid. Say the same things of me again, and more. Do <lb/>
            you know that I take pleasure in being much abused ?</p>
          <p>Strep. You blackguard !</p>
          <p>Phid. Sprinkle me with roses in abundance.</p>
          <p>Strep. Do you beat your father ?</p>
          <p>Phid. And will prove too, by Jupiter! that I beat you <lb/>
            with justice.</p>
          <p>Strep. 0 thou most rascally! Why, how can it be <lb/>
            just to beat a father?</p>
          <p>Phid. I will demonstrate it, and will overcome you in <lb/>
            argument.</p>
          <p>Strep. Will you overcome me in this?</p><pb n="339"/>
            
          <p>Phid. Yea, by much and easily. But choose which of <lb/>
            the two Causes you wish to speak.</p>
          <p>Strep. Of what two Causes ?</p>
          <p>Phid. The better, or the worse ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Marry, I did get you taught to speak against <lb/>
            justice, by Jupiter, my friend, if you are going to per­ <lb/>
            suade me of this, that it is just and honourable for a <lb/>
            father to be beaten by his sons !</p>
          <p>Phid. I think I shall certainly persuade you ; so that, <lb/>
            when you have heard, not even you yourself will say any­ <lb/>
            thing against it.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well, now, I am willing to hear what you have <lb/>
            to say.</p>
          <p>Cho. It is your business, old man, to consider in what <lb/>
            way you shall conquer the man ; for, if he were not rely­ <lb/>
            ing upon something, he would not be so licentious. But <lb/>
            he is emboldened by something; the boldness of the man <lb/>
            is evident. Now you ought to tell to the Chorus from <lb/>
            what the contention first arose. And this you must do <lb/>
            by all means.</p>
          <p>Strep. Well, now, I will tell you from what we first be­ <lb/>
            gan to rail at one another. After we had feasted, as you <lb/>
            know, I first bade him take a lyre, and sing a song of <lb/>
            Simonides, " The Shearing of the Ram.” But he imme­ <lb/>
            diately said it was old-fashioned to play on the lyre, and <lb/>
            sing while drinking, like a woman grinding parched <lb/>
            barley.</p>
          <p>Phid. For ought you not then immediately to be <lb/>
            beaten and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you <lb/>
            were entertaining cicadæ ?</p>
          <p>Strep. He expressed, however, such opinions then too <lb/>
            within, as he does now ; and he asserted that Simonides <lb/>
            was a bad poet. I bore it at first, with difficulty, indeed, <lb/>
            yet nevertheless I bore it. And then I bade him at least <lb/>
            take a myrtle-wreath and recite to me some portion of <lb/>
            Æschylus; and then he immediately said, "Shall I con­ <lb/>
            sider Æschylus the first among the poets, full of empty <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            sound, unpolished, bombastic, using rugged Words?” <lb/>
            And hereupon you can't think how my heart panted. <lb/>
            But, nevertheless, I restrained my passion, and said, " At <lb/>
            least recite some passage of the more modern poets, of <lb/>
            whatever kind these clever things be." And he imme­ <lb/>
            diately sang a passage of Euripides, how a brother, 0 <lb/>
            averter of ill! debauched his uterine sister. And I bore <lb/>
            it no longer, but immediately assailed him with many <lb/>
            abusive reproaches. And then, after that, as was natural, <lb/>
            we hurled word upon word. Then he springs upon me ; <lb/>
            and then he was wounding me, and beating me, and throt­ <lb/>
            tling me, and killing me.</p>
          <p>Phid. Were you not therefore justly beaten, who do <lb/>
            not praise Euripides, the wisest of poets?</p>
          <p>Strep. He the wisest! Oh, what shall I call you? <lb/>
            But I shall get beaten again.</p>
          <p>Phid. Yes, by Jupiter, with justice !</p>
          <p>Strep. Why, how with justice? Who, 0 shameless <lb/>
            fellow, reared you, understanding all your wishes, when <lb/>
            you lisped what you meant? If you said bryn, I, under­ <lb/>
            standing it, used to give you to drink. And when you <lb/>
            asked for mamman, I used to come to you with bread. <lb/>
            And you used no sooner to say caccan, than I used to <lb/>
            take and carry you out of doors, and hold you before me. <lb/>
            But you now, throttling me who was bawling and crying <lb/>
            out because I wanted to ease myself, had not the heart to <lb/>
            carry me forth out of doors, you wretch; but I did it <lb/>
            there, while I was being throttled.</p>
          <p>Cho. I fancy the hearts of the youths are panting to <lb/>
            hear what he will say. For if, after having done such <lb/>
            things, he shall persuade him by speaking, I would not <lb/>
            take the hide of the old folks, even at the price of a chick­ <lb/>
            pea. It is thy business, thou author and upheaver of new <lb/>
            words, to seek some means of persuasion, so that you shall <lb/>
            seem to speak justly.</p>
          <p>Phid. How pleasant it is to be acquainted with new <lb/>
            and clever things, and to be able to despise the established <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            Taws! For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship <lb/>
            alone, used not to be able to utter three words before I <lb/>
            made a mistake ; but now, since he himself has made me <lb/>
            cease from these pursuits, and I am acquainted with sub­ <lb/>
            tle thoughts, and arguments, and speculations, I think I <lb/>
            shall demonstrate that it is just to chastise one's father.</p>
          <p>Strep. Ride, then, by Jupiter! since it is better for <lb/>
            me to keep a team of four horses, than to be killed with <lb/>
            beating.</p>
          <p>Phid. I will pass over to that part of my discourse <lb/>
            where you interrupted me ; and first I will ask you this: <lb/>
            Did you beat me when I was a boy ?</p>
          <p>Strep. I did, through good-will and concern for you.</p>
          <p>Phid. Pray tell me, is it not just that I also should be <lb/>
            well inclined toward you in the same way, and beat you, <lb/>
            since this is to be well inclined-to give a beating? For <lb/>
            why ought your body to be exempt from blows, and mine <lb/>
            not? And yet I too was born free. The boys weep, and <lb/>
            do you not think it right that a father should weep ? You <lb/>
            will say that it is ordained by law that this should be the <lb/>
            lot of boys. But I would reply, that old men are boys <lb/>
            twice over, and that it is the more reasonable that; the <lb/>
            old should weep than the young, inasmuch as it is less <lb/>
            just that they should err.</p>
          <p>Strep. It is nowhere ordained by law that a father <lb/>
            should suffer this.</p>
          <p>Phid. Was it not then a man like you and me, who <lb/>
            first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the <lb/>
            ancients? Why then is it less lawful for me also in <lb/>
            turn to propose henceforth a new law for the sons, that <lb/>
            they should beat their fathers in turn ? But as many <lb/>
            blows as we received before the law was made, we re­ <lb/>
            mit ; and we concede to them our having been well <lb/>
            thrashed without return. Observe the cocks and these <lb/>
            other animals, how they punish their fathers; and yet, <lb/>
            in what do they differ from us, except that they do not <lb/>
            write decrees ?</p><pb n="342"/>
            
          <p>Strep. Why then, since you imitate the cocks in all <lb/>
            things, do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch ?</p>
          <p>Phid. It is not the same thing, my friend ; nor would <lb/>
            it appear so to Socrates.</p>
          <p>Strep. Therefore do not beat me ; otherwise you will <lb/>
            one day blame yourself.</p>
          <p>Phid. Why, how ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Since I am justly entitled to chastise you; and <lb/>
            you to chastise your son, if you should have one.</p>
          <p>Phid. But if I should not have one, I shall have wept <lb/>
            for nothing, and you will die laughing at me.</p>
          <p>Strep. To me, indeed, 0 comrades, he seems to speak <lb/>
            justly ; and I think we ought to concede to them what is <lb/>
            fitting. For it is proper that we should weep, if we do <lb/>
            not act justly.</p>
          <p>Phid. Consider still another maxim.</p>
          <p>Strep. No; for I shall perish if I do.</p>
          <p>Phid. And yet perhaps you will not be vexed at suffer­ <lb/>
            ing what you now suffer.</p>
          <p>Strep. How, pray ? for inform me what good you will <lb/>
            do me by this.</p>
          <p>Phid. I will beat my mother, just as I have you.</p>
          <p>Strep. What do you say ? what do you say ? This <lb/>
            other, again, is a greater wickedness.</p>
          <p>Phid. But what if, having the worst Cause, I shall <lb/>
            conquer you in arguing, proving that it is right to beat <lb/>
            one's mother ?</p>
          <p>Strep. Most assuredly, if you do this, nothing will <lb/>
            hinder you from casting yourself and your Worse Cause <lb/>
            into the pit along with Socrates.—These evils have I suf­ <lb/>
            fered through you, 0 Clouds! having intrusted all my <lb/>
            affairs to you. <lb/>
            f Cho. NaN, rather, you are yourself the cause of these <lb/>
            things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.</p>
          <p>Strep. Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but <lb/>
            excited with hopes a rustic and aged man ?</p>
          <p>Cho. We always do this to him whom we perceive to <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            be a lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into <lb/>
            misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.</p>
          <p>Strep. Ah me! it is severe, 0 Clouds! but it is just; <lb/>
            for I ought not to have withheld the money which I bor­ <lb/>
            rowed.-Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son, <lb/>
            that you may destroy the blackguard Chærephon and <lb/>
            Socrates, who deceived you and me.</p>
          <p>Phid. I will not injure my teachers. j</p>
          <p>Strep. Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove.</p>
          <p>Phid. " Paternal Jove," quoth'a ! How antiquated you <lb/>
            are ! Why, is there any Jove?</p>
          <p>Strep. There is.</p>
          <p>Phid. There is not, no; for Vortex reigns, having ex­ <lb/>
            pelled Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Strep. He has not expelled him ; but I fancied this, on <lb/>
            account of this Vortex here. Ah me, unhappy man! <lb/>
            when I even took you who are of earthenware for <lb/>
            a god.</p>
          <p>Phid. Here rave and babble to yourself. [Exit PHI­ <lb/>
            DIPPIDES.</p>
          <p>Strep. Ah me, what madness! How mad, then, I was, <lb/>
            when I ejected the gods on account of Socrates! But, O <lb/>
            dear Hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy <lb/>
            me; but pardon me, since I have gone crazy through <lb/>
            prating. And become my adviser, whether I shall bring <lb/>
            an action and prosecute them, or whatever you think.- <lb/>
            You advise me rightly, not permitting me to get up a <lb/>
            lawsuit, but as soon as possible to set fire to the house of <lb/>
            the prating fellows. Come hither, come hither, Xanthias ! <lb/>
            Come forth with a ladder, and with a mattock, and then <lb/>
            mount upon the thinking-shop, and dig down the roof, if <lb/>
            you love your master, until you tumble the house upon <lb/>
            them. [XANTHIAS mounts upon the roof] But let some <lb/>
            one bring me a lighted torch, and I'll make some of them <lb/>

            ARIO. How troublesome a thing it is, 0 Jupiter and <lb/>
            ye gods, to be the slave of a crazy master! For if <lb/>
            the servant should happen to have given the best <lb/>
            advice, and it should seem fit to his master not to do this, <lb/>
            it must be that the servant share the evils; for fortune <lb/>
            suffers not the natural owner to be master of his person, <lb/>
            but the purchaser. And so much for this. But Loxias, <lb/>
            who prophesies from his tripod of beaten gold, I censure <lb/>
            with this just censure, because being a physician and a <lb/>
            clever soothsayer, as they say, he has sent away my mas­ <lb/>
            ter melancholy-mad, who is following behind a blind man, <lb/>
            acting contrary to what it became him to do; for we <lb/>
            who see lead the blind; whereas he follows him, and <lb/>
            compels me besides ; and that too without even answering <lb/>
            a syllable at all. Therefore it is not possible for me to <lb/>
            hold my tongue, unless you tell me, master, for what in <lb/>
            the world we are following this man, but I will give you <lb/>
            trouble ; for you will not beat me while I wear the chaplet.</p>
          <p>Chremylus. No, by Jove! but if you trouble me in any <lb/>
            way, I'll do it when I have taken away your chaplet, that <lb/>
            you may grieve the more.</p>
          <p>Ca. Nonsense! for I will not cease until you tell me <lb/>
            who in the world this is; for I ask it, being exceedingly <lb/>
            well disposed to you.</p>

             <pb n="350"/>
            believe you to be the most faithful of my domestics, and <lb/>
            —the arrantest thief. I, though a religious and just man, <lb/>
            was unprosperous and poor.</p>
          <p>Ca. In truth I know it.</p>
          <p>Chr. While others, sacrilegious persons, demagogues, <lb/>
            and informers, and villains, were rich.</p>
          <p>Ca. I believe you.</p>
          <p>Chr. So I went to the god to consult him, thinking <lb/>
            that my own life, unhappy man, had now nearly been <lb/>
            wasted away, but to ask about my son, who is my only <lb/>
            one, if he ought to change his habits and be knavish, un­ <lb/>
            just, nothing good ; since I thought this very thing to be­ <lb/>
            advantageous for life.</p>
          <p>Ca. What then did Phcebus proclaim from among his <lb/>
            chaplets?</p>
          <p>Chr. You shall hear; for the god told me this plainly: <lb/>
            whomsoever I should first meet with on going out, him <lb/>
            he bid me never let go, but prevail on him to accompany <lb/>
            me home.</p>
          <p>Ca. And whom then did you first meet with ?</p>
          <p>Chr. With this man.</p>
          <p>Ca. Then did you not understand the meaning of the <lb/>
            god, when it directed you, 0 most stupid, in the plainest <lb/>
            terms, to educate your son after the fashion of the country ?</p>
          <p>t Chr. By what do you judge of this?</p>
          <p>Ca. It is evident that even a blind man fancies he <lb/>
            knows this, that it is very advantageous to practise no <lb/>
            virtue in these times.</p>
          <p>Chr. It is not possible that the oracle inclines to this, <lb/>
            but to something else of greater moment. But if this fel­ <lb/>
            low tell us who in the world he is, and on account of what, <lb/>
            and in want of what he came hither with us, we might <lb/>
            understand what our oracle means.</p>
          <p>Ca. (to PLUTUS). Come now, do you declare yourself <lb/>
            who you are, before I do what comes next? You must <lb/>
            be very quick about speaking.</p>
          <p>Plutus, A plague take you !</p><pb n="351"/>
            
          <p>Ca. (to CHREMYLUS). Do you understand whom he pro­ <lb/>
            fesses himself to be ?</p>
          <p>Chr. He says this to you, not to me; for you inquire <lb/>
            of him uncouthly and roughly. But [to PLUTUS] if you <lb/>
            take any pleasure in the manners of a man of honour, <lb/>
            tell me!</p>
          <p>PIu. Go, hang yourself!</p>
          <p>Ca. Take the man, and omen of the god.</p>
          <p>Chr. By Ceres, you certainly shall not any longer escape <lb/>
            unpunished !</p>
          <p>Ca. For unless you will tell us, I will kill you, you <lb/>
            wretch, in a wretched way.</p>
          <p>Plu. Good sirs, depart from me.</p>
          <p>Chr. Not a whit.</p>
          <p>Ca. Well, now, what I say is best, master: I'll kill this <lb/>
            fellow in a most wretched way; for I will set him up on <lb/>
            some precipice and leave him and go away, that he may <lb/>
            fall and break his neck.</p>
          <p>Chr. Well, up with him quickly.</p>
          <p>Plu By no means.</p>
          <p>Chr. Will you not tell us then?</p>
          <p>Plu. But if you learn who I am, I well know that you <lb/>
            will do me some mischief, and not let me go.</p>
          <p>Chr. By the gods will we, if you wish it.</p>
          <p>Plu.Then first let me go.</p>
          <p>Chr. Lo ! we let you go.</p>
          <p>Plu.Hear now ; for, as it seems, I must speak what I <lb/>
            was prepared to conceal: I am Plutus.</p>
          <p>Chr. 0 most abominable of all men ! did you hold your <lb/>
            tongue then, you Plutus ?</p>
          <p>Ca. You Plutus, so wretchedly circumstanced?</p>
          <p>Chr. 0 Phœbus Apollo, and ye gods and demons, and <lb/>
            Jove, what do you say? Are you really he?</p>
          <p>Plu. Yes.</p>
          <p>Chr. He himself?</p>
          <p>Plu. His very self.</p>
          <p>Chr. Whence then, tell us, come you so squalid?</p><pb n="352"/>
            
          <p>Plu. I come from the house of Patrocles, who has not <lb/>
            washed himself since he was born.</p>
          <p>Chr. But how did you suffer this mishap? Declare it <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>PIN. Jupiter treated me in this manner through envy <lb/>
            toward mankind. For when I was a boy, I threatened <lb/>
            that I would go to the just, and wise, and well-behaved <lb/>
            alone. So he made me blind, that I might not distinguish <lb/>
            any of these. So much does he envy the good.</p>
          <p>Chr. And yet he is honoured by the good and the just <lb/>
            alone.</p>
          <p>PIu. I grant you.</p>
          <p>Chr. Come, what then ? if you were to recover your <lb/>
            sight again, just as formerly, would you now shun the <lb/>
            wicked ?</p>
          <p>Plui. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Chr. But would you go to the just?</p>
          <p>Plu. Most assuredly ; for I have not seen them for a <lb/>
            long time.</p>
          <p>Chr. And no wonder too; for neither have I, who see.</p>
          <p>Piu. Now let me go; for now you know all about me.</p>
          <p>Chr. No, by Jove! but so much the more will we keep <lb/>
            hold of you.</p>
          <p>PIu. Did I not say that you would cause me trouble ?</p>
          <p>Chr. And do you, I beseech you, comply, and do not <lb/>
            abandon me; for you will never find a man better in his <lb/>
            morals than I, if you search. No, by Jove ! for there is <lb/>
            no other save me.</p>
          <p>Piu. They all say this: but when they actually get <lb/>
            possession of me, and become wealthy, they absolutely <lb/>
            exceed all bounds in their wickedness.</p>
          <p>Chr. So it is; yet all are not wicked.</p>
          <p>Plu. No, by Jove! not all, but all without exception.</p>
          <p>Ca. You shall suffer for it severely.</p>
          <p>Chr. And that you may know how many blessings you <lb/>
            will have, if you stay with us, give your attention, that <lb/>
            you may hear. For I think, I think-with God's permis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            sion it shall be spoken-that I shall free you from this <lb/>
            blindness, having made you see.</p>
          <p>Plu. By no means do this ; for I do not wish to recover <lb/>
            my sight again.</p>
          <p>Chr. What do you say ?</p>
          <p>Ca. This fellow is a born miserable.</p>
          <p>Plu. I know indeed that Jupiter would destroy me, if <lb/>
            he were to hear of the follies of these men.</p>
          <p>Chr. But does he not do this now, who suffers you to <lb/>
            go about stumbling?</p>
          <p>Plu. I know not; but I dread him exceedingly.</p>
          <p>Chr. What really, 0 you most cowardly of all deities? <lb/>
            For do you suppose the sovereignty of Jove and his thun­ <lb/>
            derbolts would be worth a three-obol piece, if you should <lb/>
            recover your sight, if it were but for a short time ?</p>
          <p>Plu. Ah! say not so, you wretch !</p>
          <p>Chr. Be quiet; for I will demonstrate you to be far <lb/>
            more powerful than Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Plu. Me?</p>
          <p>Chr. Ay, by Heaven! For, for example, through <lb/>
            whom does Jupiter rule the gods?</p>
          <p>Ca. Through money, for he has most of it.</p>
          <p>Chr. Come, who then is it that supplies him with <lb/>
            this?</p>
          <p>Ca. This person here.</p>
          <p>Chr. And through whom do men sacrifice to him ? is <lb/>
            it not through him ?</p>
          <p>Ca. And, by Jupiter! they pray openly to be rich.</p>
          <p>Chr. Is not he then the cause, and might he not easily <lb/>
            put an end to this, if he wished ?</p>
          <p>Plu. Why so? why, pray?</p>
          <p>Chr. Because no man would any longer sacrifice, either <lb/>
            ox or barley-cake, or anything else whatever, if you were <lb/>
            not willing.</p>
          <p>Plu. How?</p>
          <p>Chr. How? it is not possible for him to purchase it, I <lb/>
            ween, unless you yourself be present and give him the <note type="footnote"> 23 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            money; so that you alone will put down the power of <lb/>
            Jove, if he annoy you in any way.</p>
          <p>Plu.What do you say ? do they sacrifice to him <lb/>
            through me?</p>
          <p>Chr. Certainly. And, by Jupiter! if there be any­ <lb/>
            thing magnificent and beautiful or agreeable to men, it is <lb/>
            through you: for all things are subservient to riches.</p>
          <p>Ca. I, in truth, have become a slave on account of a <lb/>
            trifling sum of money, because I was not equally rich as <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>Chr. And they say that the Corinthian courtesans, <lb/>
            when any poor man tries them, do not even pay any <lb/>
            attention to him, but if a rich man try, that they imme­ <lb/>
            diately turn anything to him.</p>
          <p>Ca. And they say that the boys do this very thing, not <lb/>
            for their lovers', but the money's sake.</p>
          <p>Chr. Not the better sort, but the catamites; for the <lb/>
            better sort do not ask for money.</p>
          <p>Ca. What then?</p>
          <p>It Chr. One asks for a good horse, another hunting dogs.</p>
          <p>Ca. For, perhaps, being ashamed to ask for money, <lb/>
            they gloss over their wickedness by a false name.</p>
          <p>Chr. And all arts and clever contrivances among men <lb/>
            have been invented through you. For one of them sits <lb/>
            and makes shoes; and some other one is a smith, and <lb/>
            another a carpenter; another is a goldsmith, having <lb/>
            received gold from you ; another, by Jove ! steals clothes; <lb/>
            another is a house-breaker; another is a fuller; another <lb/>
            washes fleeces ; another is a tanner; another sells onions; <lb/>
            another, having been detected as an adulterer, is depil­ <lb/>
            lated through you.</p>
          <p>Plu. Ah me, miserable! this has been unknown to me <lb/>
            this long while.</p>
          <p>Ca. And docs not the Great King pride himself <lb/>
            through him? And is not the Assembly held through <lb/>
            him ? But how ?-do you not man the triremes? tell me. <lb/>
            And does not he support the mercenaries in Corinth ? <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            And will not Pamphilus suffer through him? And will <lb/>
            not the "Needle-seller" along with Pamphilus? And <lb/>
            does not Agyrrhius spout through him ? And [to PLUTUS] <lb/>
            does not Philepsius relate fables on account of you ? And <lb/>
            is not the alliance with the Egyptians through you ? And <lb/>
            does not Lais, through you, love Philonides? And the <lb/>
            tower of Timotheus——</p>
          <p>Chr. —— May it fall upon you. And [to PLUTUS] are <lb/>
            not all our affairs transacted through you? For you alone <lb/>
            are the cause of all, both of our miseries and our blessings, <lb/>
            be well assured.</p>
          <p>Ca. At any rate, in wars also, they always conquer, <lb/>
            upon whom he only sits down.</p>
          <p>Piu. Am I able, single as I am, to effect so many <lb/>
            things ?</p>
          <p>Chr. And, by Jupiter! far more than these ; so that no <lb/>
            one has ever at any time been sated of you. For of all <lb/>
            the rest there is a satiety. Of love,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of bread,</p>
          <p>Chr. Of music,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of sweetmeats,</p>
          <p>Chr. Of honour,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of cheese-cakes,</p>
          <p>Chr. Of manly virtue,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of dried figs,</p>
          <p>Chr. Of ambition,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of barley-cakes,</p>
          <p>Chr. Of military command,</p>
          <p>Ca. Of lentil-broth.</p>
          <p>Chr. But of you no one has ever at any time been <lb/>
            sated. But if any one get thirteen talents, so much the <lb/>
            more does he desire to get sixteen. And if he accomplish <lb/>
            this, he wishes for forty, or he says his life is not worth <lb/>
            living.</p>
          <p>Plu. In truth you appear to me to speak exceedingly <lb/>
            well; but one thing only I fear.</p>
          <p>Chr. Tell us, what about.</p><pb n="356"/>
            
          <p>Plu.How I shall become master of this power which <lb/>
            you say I have.</p>
          <p>Chr. Yes, by Jove, you shall! But even all say that <lb/>
            wealth is a most timid thing.</p>
          <p>PIu. By no means; but some housebreaker has calum­ <lb/>
            niated me. For having once crept into the house, he was <lb/>
            not able to get anything, having found everything locked <lb/>
            up; so then he called my forethought cowardice.</p>
          <p>Chr. Let nothing trouble you now ; for if you be <lb/>
            . <lb/>
            zealous man yourselfin the business, I'llmake you more <lb/>
            sharp-sighted than Lynceus.</p>
          <p>Plu. How then will you be able to do this, mortal as <lb/>
            you are ?</p>
          <p>Chr. I have some good hope from what Phoebus him­ <lb/>
            self told me, having shaken the Pythian laurel.</p>
          <p>Plu. And was he then privy to this?</p>
          <p>Chr. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Plu. Take care!</p>
          <p>Chr. Do not be at all concerned, my good sir; for I, <lb/>
            be well assured of this, will accomplish this myself, even <lb/>
            if I must die for it.</p>
          <p>Ca. And I too, if you wish it.</p>
          <p>Chr. And many others will be our allies, as many as <lb/>
            had no bread, though they were just.</p>
          <p>Piu. Deary me! you tell us of miserable allies.</p>
          <p>Chr. Not so, if they become rich again as before. But <lb/>
            do you [to CARIO] go and run quickly——</p>
          <p>Ca. What am I to do? Tell file.</p>
          <p>Chr. Call my fellow-labourers-and you will probably <lb/>
            find them working hard in the fields-that each, being <lb/>
            present here, may share an equal portion with us of this <lb/>
            Plutus.</p>
          <p>Ca. Well now, I am going. But let some one of the <lb/>
            servants from within take and carry in this small bit of <lb/>
            meat.</p>
          <p>Chr. (taking the meat).This shall be my care: but.tun <lb/>
            quickly. [Exit CARIO.] And do you, O Plutus, most ex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            cellent of all gods, go in this way with me; for this is <lb/>
            the house which you must to-day fill with riches, by fair <lb/>
            means or by foul.</p>
          <p>Plu. But, by the gods, I am exceedingly loath to be <lb/>
            always going into other people's houses. For I never at <lb/>
            any time got any good from it. For if I chance to go <lb/>
            into the house of a miser, he immediately buries me deep <lb/>
            in the earth: and if any good man, his friend, come to <lb/>
            him asking to get some small sum of money, he denies <lb/>
            that he has ever at any time even seen me. But if I <lb/>
            chance to go into the house of a mad fellow, I am ex­ <lb/>
            posed to harlots and dice and driven out of doors naked <lb/>
            in a moment of time.</p>
          <p>Chr. Yes; for you never at any time met with a mod­ <lb/>
            erate man. But I am somehow always of this character. <lb/>
            For I both take pleasure in saving, as never man did, and <lb/>
            again in spending, whenever there is occasion for it. But <lb/>
            let us go in; for I wish both my wife to see you and my <lb/>
            only son, whom I love most of all-next to you.</p>
          <p>Plu. I believe you.</p>
          <p>Chr. For why should one not tell the truth to you? <lb/>
            [Exeunt CHREMYLUS and PLUTUS.</p>
          <p>Ca. Oh, you who have often eaten of the same thyme <lb/>
            with my master, his friends, and fellow-tribesmen, and <lb/>
            lovers of labour, come, make haste, hurry, since the <lb/>
            time does not admit delay, but it is at the very crisis <lb/>
            at which you ought to be present and lend your aid.</p>
          <p>Chorus of Country-people. Don't you see then that we <lb/>
            have been actively hastening this long while, as is reason­ <lb/>
            able those should who are now feeble old men? But <lb/>
            you, perhaps, expect that I should run, before you even <lb/>
            tell me this, on what account your master has called me <lb/>
            hither.</p>
          <p>Ca. Have I not then, I ween, been telling you this long <lb/>

          <p>Cho. But what, pray, and whence, is this thing which <lb/>
            he speaks of ?</p>
          <p>Ca. He has come hither with a certain old man, ye <lb/>
            wretches, who is filthy, crooked, miserable, wrinkled,</p>
          <p>bald, and toothless ; and, by Heaven! I think he is cir-.</p>
          <p>cumcised, too.</p>
          <p>Cho. U you who have announced golden tidings, how <lb/>
            say you ? tell me again ! For you plainly show that he is</p>
          <p>come with a heap of money.</p>

            unpunished, and that, too, when I have a staff?</p>
          <p>Ca. Why, do you consider me to be altogether such <lb/>
            a man by nature in all respects, and do you think that I <lb/>
            would say nothing true ?</p>
          <p>Cho. How haughty the rascal is! Your legs are cry­ <lb/>
            ing out, " Oh ! oh ! " longing for the stocks and fetters.</p>
          <p>Ca. But are you not for going, when now your letter <lb/>
            has assigned you to administer justice in the tomb, and <lb/>
            Charon gives you your ticket?</p>
          <p>Cho. Split you! What an impudent fellow you are, <lb/>
            and arrant knave by nature, who humbug us, and have <lb/>
            not yet had the patience to tell us on what account your <lb/>
            master has called us hither, who, after labouring much, <lb/>
            have come hither readily, though we had no leisure, pass­ <lb/>
            ing over many roots of thyme !</p>
          <p>Ca. Well, then, I will not conceal it any longer; for, <lb/>
            sirs, my master has come with Plutus, who will make you <lb/>
            rich.</p>
          <p>Cho. Why, is it really possible for us all to be rich ? <lb/>
            Ca. Nay, rather, by the gods, all Midases, if you get <lb/>
            ass's ears.</p>
          <p>Cho. How I am delighted and gladdened, and wish to <lb/>
            dance for joy, if you arc really speaking this truly !</p>
          <p>Ca. Well, now, I should like to lead you, imitating the <lb/>
            Cyclops, threttanelo! and moving thus to and fro with <lb/>
            my feet. But come, my children, crying out frequently. <lb/>

            me lewdly, and you shall breakfast like goats.</p>

            have caught you, this Cyclops, threttanelo! dirty, with a <lb/>
            wallet and dewy, wild potherbs, having a drunken head­ <lb/>
            ache, leading your sheep, and carelessly asleep some­ <lb/>
            where, will take a great lighted, sharp stake and try to <lb/>
            blind you.</p>
          <p>Ca. And I will imitate in all her ways Circe, who <lb/>
            mixed up the drugs, who once in Corinth persuaded the <lb/>
            companions of Philonides, as if they were boars, to eat <lb/>
            kneaded dung; while she herself kneaded it for them. <lb/>
            But do you, grunting for delight, follow, like swine, your <lb/>
            mother.</p>
          <p>Cho. Therefore we, having caught you, the Circe, who <lb/>
            mixed up the drugs and bewitched and defiled our com­ <lb/>
            panions, imitating for delight the son of Laertes, will <lb/>
            hang you up and besmear your nostrils with dung, like <lb/>
            a goat's; while you, gaping like Aristyllus, shall say, <lb/>
            “Follow, like swine, your mother."</p>
          <p>Ca. But come now, do you now have done with your <lb/>
            jests and turn yourselves into another shape; while I <lb/>
            should like now to go unknown to my master and take <lb/>
            some bread and meat and eat it, and so afterward to join <lb/>
            in the work. [Exit CARIO.</p>
          <p>Chremylus(entering and addressing the CHORUS). To bid <lb/>
            you “hail," my fellow-tribesmen, is now old-fashioned and <lb/>
            obsolete; so I “embrace you," because you have come <lb/>
            readily and eagerly, and not tardily. But see that you be <lb/>
            my coadjutors in the rest as well, and truly preservers of <lb/>

          <p>Blepsidemus(talking to himself).What then can the <lb/>
            affair be? in what way has Chremylus suddenly become <lb/>
            rich? I don't believe it: and yet, by Hercules, there was <lb/>
            much talk among those who sat in the barbers' shops, that <lb/>
            the man has suddenly become wealthy. But this very <lb/>
            thing is marvellous to me, that he, being well off, sends for <lb/>
            his friends. In truth he does not do a thing fashionable in <lb/>
            the country.</p>
          <p>Chr. (aside). Well then, by the gods, I'll tell him, with­ <lb/>
            out concealing anything. 0 Blepsidemus, we are better <lb/>
            off than yesterday, so that it is permitted you to share ; for <lb/>
            you are of the number of my friends.</p>
          <p>Bl. But have you really become rich, as people <lb/>
            say?</p>
          <p>Chr. Nay, but I shall be very soon, if God please; for <lb/>
            there is-there is some hazard in the affair.</p>
          <p>Bl. Of what sort?</p>
          <p>Chr. Such as</p>
          <p>Bl. Tell me quickly what in the world you mean.</p>
          <p>Chr. -that, if we succeed, we shall be always well off; <lb/>
            but if we be foiled, we shall be utterly undone.</p>
          <p>Bl. This load looks bad, and does not please me. For <lb/>
            your suddenly becoming so excessively rich, and, again, <lb/>
            your fearing, is in character with a man who has done <lb/>
            nothing good.</p>
          <p>Chr. How nothing good?</p>
          <p>Bl. If, by Jove! you have come from thence, having <lb/>
            stolen any silver or gold from the good, and then, perhaps, <lb/>
            repent.</p>
          <p>Chr. 0 Apollo, averter of evil! not I, by Jove!</p>
          <p>Bl. Cease talking nonsense, my good sir; for I know <lb/>
            it for certain.</p>

          <p>Bl. Alas! how there is absolutely no good in any one! <lb/>
            but all are slaves of gain.</p>
          <p>Chr. By Ceres! you certainly do not appear to me to <lb/>
            be in your right senses.</p>
          <p>Bl. (aside). How much he has altered from the charac­ <lb/>
            ter he formerly had !</p>
          <p>Chr. By Heaven, fellow, you are mad !</p>
          <p>Bl. (aside). But not even does his glance itself keep in <lb/>
            its place, but is like to one who has committed some vil­ <lb/>
            lainy.</p>
          <p>Chr. I know what you are croaking about: you seek to <lb/>
            get a share, as if I had stolen something.</p>
          <p>Bl. I seek to get a share ? of what ?</p>
          <p>Chr. Whereas it is not of such nature, but different.</p>
          <p>Bl. Have you not stolen, but snatched it away ?</p>
          <p>Chr. You are possessed.</p>
          <p>Bl. But have you, in truth, not even defrauded any one?</p>
          <p>Chr. Not I, indeed !</p>
          <p>Bl. 0 Hercules, come, whither can one turn himself? <lb/>
            for you will not tell the truth.</p>
          <p>Chr. For you accuse me before you know my case.</p>
          <p>Bl. My good friend, I will settle this for you at a very <lb/>
            trifling expense, before the city hear of it, by stopping the <lb/>
            orators' mouths with small coin.</p>
          <p>Chr. And verily, by the gods, methinks you would in <lb/>
            a friendly way lay out three minae and set down twelve.</p>
          <p>Bl. I see a certain person who will sit at the Bema, <lb/>
            holding the suppliant's bough, with his children and his <lb/>
            wife ; and who will not differ at all, not even in any way, <lb/>
            from the Heraclidæ of Pamphilus.</p>
          <p>Chr. Not so, you wretch, but, on the contrary, I will <lb/>
            cause the good alone, and the clever and discreet, to be­ <lb/>

            trary of this. We therefore desiring that this should take <lb/>
            place, have with difficulty found out a plan, excellent, and <lb/>
            noble, and useful for every enterprise. For if Plutus now <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            should have the use of his eyes, and not go about blind, <lb/>
            he will go to the good men, and not leave them, but will <lb/>
            fly from the wicked and the ungodly; and then he will <lb/>
            make all to be good and rich, I ween, and to reverence <lb/>
            things divine. And yet, who could ever devise a better <lb/>
            thing than this for men ?</p>
          <p>Bl. No one ; I am your witness in this; don't ask her.</p>
          <p>Chr. For as life is at present circumstanced for us men, <lb/>
            who would not think it to be madness, or rather still a <lb/>
            demoniacal possession ? For many men who are wicked <lb/>
            are rich, having accumulated them unjustly ; while many <lb/>
            who are very good, are badly off, and suffer hunger, and <lb/>
            live with you [to POVERTY] for the most part. I say, <lb/>
            then, that there is a way, proceeding upon which a per­ <lb/>
            son might procure greater benefits for men, namely, if <lb/>
            Plutus were ever to have the use of his eyes and put a <lb/>
            stop to her.</p>
          <p>Pov. Nay, 0 you two old dotards, partners in non­ <lb/>
            sense and folly, of all men the most easily persuaded not <lb/>
            to be in your right senses, if this were to happen, which <lb/>
            you desire, I deny that it would profit you. For if Plutus <lb/>
            were to have the use of his eyes again and portion himself <lb/>
            out equally, no man would practise either art or science; <lb/>
            and when both these have disappeared through you, who <lb/>
            will be willing to be a smith, or to build ships, or to sew, <lb/>
            or to make wheels, or to make shoes, or to make bricks, <lb/>
            or to wash, or to tan hides, or who will be willing to break <lb/>
            up the soil of the earth with ploughings and reap the fruits <lb/>
            of Ceres, if it be possible for you to live in idleness, <lb/>
            neglecting all these ?</p>
          <p>Chr. You talk nonsense; for our servants shall toil at <lb/>
            all these things for us, as many as you have now enumer­ <lb/>
            ated.</p>
          <p>Pov. Whence then will you have servants?</p>
          <p>Chr. We will buy them for money, to be sure.</p>
          <p>Pov. But first, who will be the seller, when he too has <lb/>
            money ?</p><pb n="367"/>
            
          <p>Chr. Some one wishing to make gain, having come as <lb/>
            a merchant from Thessaly, from among very many kid­ <lb/>
            nappers.</p>
          <p>Pov. But first of all, there will not even be any one, <lb/>
            not even a kidnapper, according to the statement, I ween, <lb/>
            which you mention. For who that is wealthy will be <lb/>
            willing to do this at the hazard of his own life ? So that, <lb/>
            having been compelled to plough, and dig, and toil at the <lb/>
            other labours yourself, you will spend a much more pain­ <lb/>
            ful life than the present one.</p>
          <p>Chr. May it fall on your own head!</p>
          <p>Pov. Moreover, you will not be able to sleep either in <lb/>
            a bed-for there will be none-or in carpets ; for who will <lb/>
            be willing to weave them when he has gold ? Nor, when <lb/>
            you lead home a bride, to anoint her with dropping <lb/>
            unguents; nor to adorn her with sumptuous garments, <lb/>
            dyed, and variegated. And yet, what advantage will it <lb/>
            be to you to be rich, when in want of all these? But <lb/>
            from me all these which you stand in need of are easily <lb/>
            obtained ; for I sit, compelling the artisan, like a mistress, <lb/>
            through his want and his poverty, to seek whence he shall <lb/>
            have subsistence.</p>
          <p>Chr. Why, what good could you procure, except a <lb/>
            swarm of blisters from the bath, and of children begin­ <lb/>
            ning to be hungry, and of old women ? and the quantity <lb/>
            of lice, and gnats, and fleas, I don't even mention to you, <lb/>
            by reason of their multitude, which buzz about my head <lb/>
            and torment me, wakening me and saying: " You will <lb/>
            suffer hunger; come, get up." Moreover, to have a rag <lb/>
            instead of a garment; and instead of a bed, a mattress of <lb/>
            rushes, full of bugs, which wakens the sleepers ; and to <lb/>
            have a rotten mat instead of a carpet; and a good-sized <lb/>
            stone against one's head instead of a pillow ; and to eat <lb/>
            shoots of mallow instead of bread ; and leaves of withered <lb/>
            radish instead of barley-cake ; and to have the head of a <lb/>
            broken jar instead of a bench ; and the side of a cask, <lb/>
            and that too broken, instead of a kneading-trough. Do <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            I not demonstrate you to be the cause of many blessings <lb/>
            to all men?</p>
          <p>Pov. You have not mentioned my way of life, but have <lb/>
            attacked that of beggars.</p>
          <p>Chr. Therefore we say, I ween, that poverty is sister <lb/>
            of beggary.</p>
          <p>Pov. Ay, you who also say that Dionysus is like <lb/>
            Thrasybulus. But my mode of life is not thus circum­ <lb/>
            stanced, no, by Jove! nor will it. For a beggar's mode <lb/>
            of life, which you describe, is to live possessed of nothing; <lb/>
            but that of a poor man to live sparingly, and attentive to <lb/>
            his work; and not to have any superfluity, nor yet, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to have a deficiency.</p>
          <p>Chr. 0 Ceres! how blessed is his life which you have <lb/>
            set forth, if after sparing and toiling he shall leave behind <lb/>
            him not even wherewith to be buried.</p>
          <p>Pov. You are trying to scoff at and ridicule me, heed­ <lb/>
            less of being earnest, not knowing that I render men bet­ <lb/>
            ter both in mind and body than Plutus does. For with <lb/>
            him they are gouty in their feet, and pot-bellied, and <lb/>
            thick-legged, and extravagantly fat; but with me they <lb/>
            are thin and slender, and grievous to their foes.</p>
          <p>Chr. For, no doubt, you bring about the slenderness <lb/>
            for them by hunger.</p>
          <p>Pov. Now therefore I will discourse to you respecting <lb/>
            sobriety, and will demonstrate that orderly behaviour <lb/>
            dwells with me, but that riotousness belongs to Plutus.</p>
          <p>Chr. In sooth it is very orderly to steal and to dig <lb/>
            through walls.</p>
          <p>Bl. Yes, by Jove! how is it not orderly, if he must <lb/>
            escape notice?</p>
          <p>Pov. Consider therefore the orators in the states, how, <lb/>
            when they are poor, they are just toward the people and <lb/>
            the state; but when they have become rich out of the <lb/>
            public purse, they immediately become unjust, and plot <lb/>
            against the commons, and make war upon the democracy.</p>
          <p>Chr. Well, you don't speak falsely in any of these <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            things, although you are exceedingly slanderous. But <lb/>
            you shall suffer none the less—don't pride yourself on <lb/>
            this-because you seek to convince us of this, that poverty <lb/>
            is better than riches.</p>
          <p>PaVe And you too are not yet able to refute me about <lb/>
            this, but talk nonsense and flap your wings.</p>
          <p>Chr. Why, how is it that all shun you?</p>
          <p>Pov. Because I make them better. But you may see <lb/>
            it best in children; for they shun their fathers who are <lb/>
            very well-disposed toward them. So difficult a matter is <lb/>
            it to distinguish what is right.</p>
          <p>Chr. You will say, then, that Jupiter does not correctly <lb/>
            distinguish what is best; for he too has wealth.</p>
          <p>Bl. And despatches her to us.</p>
          <p>Pov. Nay, 0 you who are both of you purblind in your <lb/>
            minds with old-fashioned prejudices, Jupiter is certainly <lb/>
            poor; and I will now teach you this clearly. For if he <lb/>
            was rich, how would he, when celebrating the Olympic <lb/>
            games himself, where he assembles all the Greeks every <lb/>
            fifth year, have proclaimed as conquerors the victorious <lb/>
            athletes, having crowned them with a chaplet of wild <lb/>
            olive? And yet he ought rather to crown them with <lb/>
            gold, if he was rich ?</p>
          <p>Chr. By this therefore he certainly shows that he <lb/>
            honours riches. For through parsimony and a wish to <lb/>
            spend none of it, he crowns the victors with trifles and <lb/>
            lets his wealth remain by him.</p>
          <p>Pov. You seek to fix upon him a much more disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful thing than poverty, if he, though rich, be so stingy and <lb/>
            avaricious.</p>
          <p>Chr. Well, may Jupiter utterly destroy you, having <lb/>
            crowned you with a chaplet of wild olive!</p>
          <p>Pov. To think of your daring to contradict me, that all <lb/>
            your blessings are not through poverty !</p>
          <p>Chr. One may learn this from Hecate, whether to be <lb/>
            rich or to suffer hunger is better. For she says that those <lb/>
            who have property and are wealthy send a dinner every <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            month, while the poor people snatch it away before one <lb/>
            has set it down. But go and be hanged, and don't mutter <lb/>
            anything more whatever. For you shall not convince me, <lb/>
            even if you should convince me.</p>
          <p>Pov. " 0 city of Argos, you hear what he says! "</p>
          <p>Chr. Call Pauson, your messmate.</p>
          <p>Pov. What shall I do, unhappy woman ?</p>
          <p>Chr. Go to the devil quickly from us!</p>
          <p>Pov. But whither on earth shall I go ?</p>
          <p>Chr. To the pillory; you ought not to delay, but to <lb/>
            make haste.</p>
          <p>Pov. Assuredly you will have to send for me hither <lb/>
            some time.</p>
          <p>Chr. Then you shall return; but now go and be hanged ! <lb/>
            For it is better for me to be rich, and to leave you to wail <lb/>
            loudly in your head. [Exit POVERTY.</p>
          <p>Bl. By Jove! then I wish, when I am rich, to feast <lb/>
            along with my children and my wife ; and going sleek <lb/>
            from the bath, after I have bathed, to hoot at the artisans <lb/>

          <p>Chr. This cursed wretch is gone. But let you and me <lb/>

            culapius to put him to bed in it.</p>
          <p>Bl. And let us not delay, lest again some one come and <lb/>
            hinder us from doing something useful.</p>
          <p>Chr. Boy Cario, you must bring out the bedclothes, <lb/>
            and convey Plutus himself, as is customary, and the other <lb/>
            things, as many as are ready prepared in the house. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Enter WIFE OF CHREMYLUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Wife. What in the world means the shout? Is some <lb/>
            good news announced ? for, longing for this, I have <lb/>
            been sitting in the house this long while, waiting for this <lb/>
            fellow.</p>
          <p>Ca. Quickly, quickly, bring wine, mistress, in order <lb/>
            that you yourself also may drink-and you are very fond <lb/>
            of doing it-for I bring you all blessings in a lump.</p>
          <p>Wife. Why, where are they ?</p>
          <p>Ca. You will soon learn by what is said.</p>
          <p>Wife. Be quick and finish then some time or other <lb/>
            what you are for saying.</p>
          <p>Ca. Hear, then ; for I will tell you the whole affair from <lb/>
            the foot to the head.</p>
          <p>Wife. Nay, not on my head, pray.</p>
          <p>Ca. Not the blessings which have now taken place?</p>
          <p>Wife. Nay, rather, not the troubles.</p>
          <p>Ca. As soon as we came to the god, conveying a man, <lb/>
            at that time most miserable, but now blessed and fortu­ <lb/>
            nate, if there ever was one, we first conveyed him to the <lb/>
            sea, and then washed him.</p>
          <p>Wife. By Jupiter, then he was fortunate, an old man <lb/>
            washed in the cold sea!</p>
          <p>Ca. Then we went to the temple of the god. And <lb/>
            when our wafers and preparatory sacrifices were offered <lb/>
            on the altar, and our cake in the flame of Vulcan, we laid <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            Plutus on a couch, as was proper, while each of us began <lb/>
            putting his mattress in order.</p>
          <p>Wife. And were there any others also in need of the <lb/>
            god?</p>
          <p>Ca. Yes, there was one Neoclides, who is indeed <lb/>
            blind, but outdoes in stealing those who see: and many <lb/>
            others having all sorts of diseases. But when the sacrist <lb/>
            of the god put out the lamps and ordered us to sleep, tell­ <lb/>
            ing us if any one should hear a noise, he must be silent, <lb/>
            we all lay down in an orderly manner. And I could not <lb/>
            sleep; but a pot of porridge which was lying a little way <lb/>
            off from the head of an old woman strongly affected me, <lb/>
            toward which I desired exceedingly to creep. Then on <lb/>
            looking up I saw the priest snatching away the cakes and <lb/>
            dried figs from the sacred table. And after this he went <lb/>
            round to all the altars round about, if anywhere a cake <lb/>
            might be left; and then he consecrated these-into a sack. <lb/>
            And I, supposing there was great piety in the thing, got <lb/>
            up toward the pot of porridge.</p>
          <p>Wife. 0 most daring of men, were you not afraid of, <lb/>
            the god?</p>
          <p>Ca. Yes, by the gods, lest he might get to the pot <lb/>
            before me, with his garlands on; for his priest taught me <lb/>
            that beforehand. But the old woman, when she heard my <lb/>
            noise, stretched forth her hand; and then I hissed and <lb/>
            seized it with my teeth, as if I were an Æsculapian <lb/>
            snake. But she immediately drew back her hand again, <lb/>
            and lay down, having wrapped herself up quietly, trem­ <lb/>
            bling with fear. And then I swallowed greedily the <lb/>
            greater part of the porridge: and then, when I was full, <lb/>
            I rested.</p>
          <p>Wife. But did not the god come to you?</p>
          <p>Ca. Not yet.</p>
          <p>Wife. Doubtless he was immediately disgusted at you <lb/>
            on account of this.</p>
          <p>Ca. After this I immediately covered myself up for <lb/>
            fear; while he went round in a circuit inspecting all the <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            maladies very regularly. Then a servant set before him <lb/>
            a small stone mortar and a pestle and a small chest.</p>
          <p>Wife. Of stone ?</p>
          <p>Ca. No, by Jove, certainly not, not the little chest.</p>
          <p>Wife. But how did you see, the devil take you! who <lb/>
            say you were wrapped up ?</p>
          <p>Ca. Through my little threadbare cloak; for, by Jupi­ <lb/>
            ter ! it has no few holes. First of all he began to pound up <lb/>
            a plaster for Neoclides, having thrown in three heads of <lb/>
            Tenian garlic. Then he beat them up in the mortar, <lb/>
            mixing along with them gum and squill; and then he <lb/>
            moistened it with Sphettian vinegar, and spread it over, <lb/>
            having turned his eyelids inside out, that he might be <lb/>
            pained the more. And he crying out and bawling, <lb/>
            jumped up and ran away, while the god laughed and <lb/>
            said, " Sit there now, plastered over, that I may stop <lb/>
            your excusing yourself on oath from the Assembly."</p>
          <p>Wife. How very patriotic and wise the god is!</p>
          <p>Ca. After this he sat down beside Plutus; and first he <lb/>
            handled his head, and then he took a clean napkin and <lb/>
            wiped his eyelids all round: and Panacea covered his <lb/>
            head and the whole of his face with a purple cloth. Then <lb/>
            the god whistled; then two snakes rushed forth from the <lb/>
            temple, prodigious in size.</p>

            of his eyes: and I clapped my hands for joy, and began to <lb/>

          <p>Chr. What's the matter? I suppose you also were an <lb/>
            informeress among women ?</p>
          <p>Old Wom. No, by Jupiter, not I !</p>
          <p>Chr. Or did you not drink in your letter, having ob­ <lb/>
            tained it by lot?</p>
          <p>Old Wom. You are mocking me ; but I burn with love, <lb/>
            unhappy woman.</p>
          <p>Chr. Will you not then quickly tell me what is your <lb/>
            love ?</p>
          <p>Old Wom.Hear then! I had a dear youth, poor, in­ <lb/>
            deed, but, for the rest, good-looking, and handsome, and <lb/>
            good. For if I wanted anything, he used to perform <lb/>
            everything for me decently and well, while I assisted him <lb/>
            in all his wants in the same manner.</p>
          <p>Chr. But what was it he especially wanted of you, on <lb/>
            each occasion?</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Not much ; for he was marvellously respect­ <lb/>
            ful to me. But he used to ask for twenty drachmae of <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            silver for a mantle, and eight for shoes ; and he used to <lb/>
            entreat me to purchase a tunic for his sisters, and a little <lb/>
            mantle for his mother; and he used to beg for four me­ <lb/>
            dimni of wheat.</p>
          <p>Chr. Certainly, by Apollo ! this is not much which you <lb/>
            have mentioned; but it is evident that he respected you.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And these, moreover, he said he asked of <lb/>
            me, not on account of lewdness, but for affection, that <lb/>
            while wearing my mantle he might think on me.</p>
          <p>Chr. You describe a man most marvellously in love <lb/>
            with you.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. But the abominable fellow now no longer <lb/>
            has the same mind, but has changed very much. For <lb/>
            when I sent him this cheese-cake here and the other <lb/>
            sweetmeats which are upon the plate, and whispered that <lb/>
            I would come in the evening</p>
          <p>Chr. What did he do to you ? tell me.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. He sent back to us besides this milk-cake <lb/>
            here, on condition that I never came thither any more; <lb/>
            and besides, in addition to this, when sending it off he <lb/>
            said, " Once in olden time the Milesians were brave."</p>
          <p>Chr. It is evident that he was not very bad in his <lb/>
            character. So then, being rich, he no longer takes pleas­ <lb/>
            ure in lentil-porridge: but formerly, through his poverty, <lb/>
            he used to eat everything as a relish.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And yet formerly, by the two goddesses, he <lb/>
            used always to come to my door every day.</p>
          <p>Chr. For your burial?</p>
          <p>Old Wom. No, by Jupiter! but merely through a desire <lb/>
            to hear my voice.</p>
          <p>Chr. Nay, rather, for the sake of getting something.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And, by Jove! if he perceived me afflicted, <lb/>
            he used to call me coaxingly his little duck and little dove.</p>
          <p>Chr. And then, perhaps, he used to ask you for money <lb/>
            for shoes.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And when any one looked at me when riding <lb/>
            in my carriage at the Great Mysteries, I was beaten on <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            account of this the whole day ; so very jealous was the <lb/>
            young man.</p>
          <p>Chr. For he took pleasure, as it seems, in eating <lb/>
            alone.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And he said I had very beautiful hands.</p>
          <p>Chr. Ay, whenever they offered twenty drachmæ.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And he said I smelt sweet in my skin</p>
          <p>Chr. Ay, like enough, by Jove! if you poured in Tha­ <lb/>
            sian wine for him.</p>
          <p>Old Worn. And that I had a gentle and beautiful look.</p>
          <p>Chr. The man was no fool, but knew how to devour <lb/>
            the substance of a lustful old woman.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. In this therefore, 0 dear sir, the god does <lb/>
            not act rightly, who professes to succour whoever happen <lb/>
            to be wronged.</p>
          <p>Chr. Why, what must he do? speak, and it shall be <lb/>
            done immediately.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. It is just, by Jove! to compel him who has <lb/>
            been benefited by me to benefit me in turn, for he deserves <lb/>
            to possess no blessing whatever.</p>
          <p>Chr. Did he not then repay you every night ?</p>
          <p>Old Worn. But he said he would never desert me while <lb/>
            I lived.</p>
          <p>Chr. Ay, rightly; but now he thinks you no longer <lb/>
            alive.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. For I am wasting away through grief, 0 <lb/>
            dearest friend.</p>
          <p>Chr. No, but you have rotted away, as it appears <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Indeed, then, you might draw me through <lb/>
            a ring.</p>
          <p>Chr. Yes, if the ring were the hoop of a sieve.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Well, now, see! here's the youth approach­ <lb/>
            ing, whom I have been accusing this long while ; and he <lb/>
            seems to be going to a revel.</p>
          <p>Chr. He appears so: at least he is certainly coming <lb/>
            with a chaplet and a torch.</p><pb n="384"/>

          <p>Young Man. I salute you.</p>
          <p>Old Wom.(to CHREMYLUS). What says he?</p>
          <p>You. My ancient sweetheart, by Heaven! you have <lb/>
            quickly become gray.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Unhappy me, for the insult with which I am <lb/>
            insulted !</p>
          <p>Chr. He seems to have seen you after a long time.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Since what time, 0 most audacious, who <lb/>
            was at my house yesterday ?</p>
          <p>Chr. Then he is affected in a manner opposite to most <lb/>
            people; for, as it seems, he sees sharper when he's drunk.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. No, but he is always saucy in his manners.</p>
          <p>You. (holdingthe torch close to her face). 0 Sea-Posei­ <lb/>
            don and ye elderly gods, how many wrinkles she has in <lb/>
            her face!</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Ah ! ah! don't bring the torch near me!</p>
          <p>LilY. Upon my word, she says rightly ; or it only <lb/>
            single spark catch her, it will burn her like an old harvest- <lb/>
            wreath.</p>
          <p>You. Will you play with me for a while ?</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Where, wretch ?</p>
          <p>You. Here, having taken some nuts.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. What game ?</p>
          <p>You. How many teeth you have.</p>
          <p>Chr. Come, I also will have a guess ; for she has three, <lb/>
            perhaps, or four.</p>
          <p>You. Pay up! for she carries only one grinder.</p>
          <p>Old Worn. Most audacious of men, you dont appear <lb/>
            to me to be in your right senses, who make a wash-pot of <lb/>
            me in the presence of so many men.</p>
          <p>You. Upon my word, you'd be the better for it, if one <lb/>
            were to wash you clean.</p>
          <p>Chr. Certainly not, for now she is playing the cheat; <lb/>
            but if this white-lead shall be washed off, you'll see the <lb/>
            wrinkles in her face quite plain.</p><pb n="385"/>
            
          <p>Old Wom. You don't appear to me to be in your right <lb/>
            senses, old man as you are.</p>
          <p>You. Perhaps, indeed, he is tempting you, and is touch­ <lb/>
            ing your breasts, fancying that he escapes my notice.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. No, by Venus, not mine, you abominable <lb/>
            fellow!</p>
          <p>Chr. No, by Hecate! certainly not! for I should be <lb/>
            mad. But, young man, I won't suffer you to hate this <lb/>
            girl.</p>
          <p>You. Nay, I love her beyond measure.</p>
          <p>Chr. And yet she accuses you.</p>
          <p>You.What does she accuse me of?</p>
          <p>Chr. She says that you are an insolent person, and <lb/>
            that you tell her, " Once in olden time the Milesians were <lb/>
            brave."</p>
          <p>rou. I will not quarrel with you about her.</p>
          <p>Chr. Why so?</p>
          <p>You. Out of respect for your age ; for I would never <lb/>
            have suffered another to do so; but now go in peace, hav­ <lb/>
            ing taken the girl along with you.</p>
          <p>Chr. I know, I know your meaning; perhaps you no <lb/>
            longer deign to be with her.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. But who is there to permit him ?</p>
          <p>You. I would not have to do with one who has been <lb/>
            embraced by thirteen thousand years.</p>
          <p>Chr. But yet, since you thought proper to drink the <lb/>
            wine, you must also drink up the dregs.</p>
          <p>You. But the dregs are altogether old and fusty.</p>
          <p>Chr. Then a straining-cloth will cure all this.</p>
          <p>You. Come, go within! for I wish to go and dedicate <lb/>
            to the god these chaplets which I have on.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. And I also wish to say something to him.</p>
          <p>You. But I will not go in.</p>
          <p>Chr. Be of good courage, don't be afraid! for she <lb/>
            sha'n't ravish you.</p>

            knock at the door so violently ?</p>
          <p>! Mer. No, by Jove! but I was going to; and then you <lb/>

            call out your master, then his wife and children, then his <lb/>

          <p>Ca. Tell me, what's the matter?</p>
          <p>Mer. Jupiter, you rascal, intends to mix you up in the <lb/>
            same bowl and cast you all together into the Barathrum.</p>
          <p>Ca. The tongue is given to the herald of these tidings. <lb/>
            But on what account, pray, does he purpose to do this <lb/>
            to us?</p>
          <p>Mer. Because you have done the most dreadful of all <lb/>
            deeds. For since what time Plutus began to have the <lb/>
            use of his eyes as before, no one any longer offers to us <lb/>
            gods either frankincense, or laurel, or barley-cake, or vic­ <lb/>
            tim, or anything else.</p>
          <p>Ca. No, by Jupiter! nor will he offer them. For you <lb/>
            took bad care of us aforetime.</p>
          <p>Mer. And for the other gods I care less; but I am un­ <lb/>
            done, and am ruined.</p>
          <p>Ca. You're wise.</p>
          <p>Mer. For formerly I used to enjoy all good things in <lb/>
            the female innkeepers' shops as soon as it was morning, <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            wine-cake, honey, dried figs, as many as 'tis fitting that <lb/>

            eiy legs lying up.</p>
          <p>Ca. Is it not then with justice, who sometimes caused <lb/>
            their loss, although you enjoyed such good things?</p>
          <p>Mer. Ah me, miserable! Ah me, for the cheese-cake <lb/>
            that was baked on the fourth day !</p>
          <p>Ca. “You long for the absent, and call in vain."</p>

          <p>Ca. Leap upon the bottle there in the open.</p>
          <p>Mer. And for the warm entrails which I used to <lb/>

          <p>Ca. A pain about your entrails seems to torture you.</p>
          <p>Mer. Ah me, for the cup that was mixed half-and-half!</p>
          <p>Ca. You can not be too quick in drinking this besides <lb/>
            and running away.</p>
          <p>Her. Would you assist your own friend in any way?</p>
          <p>Ca. Yes; if you want any of those things in which I <lb/>
             <lb/>
            am able to assist you.</p>
          <p>Mer. If you were to procure me a well-baked loaf and <lb/>
            give it me to eat, and a huge piece of meat from the sac­ <lb/>
            rifices you are offering within.</p>
          <p>Ca. But there is no carrying out.</p>
          <p>Her. And yet whenever you stole any little vessel from <lb/>

          <p>Her. Well, as deceiver, then.</p>

            of deception now, but of simple manners.</p>
          <p>Mer. As conductor, then.</p>
          <p>Ca. But the god now has the use of his eyes; so we <lb/>
            shall no longer want a conductor.</p>
          <p>Mer. Then I will be president of the games. And <lb/>
            what further will you say ? For this is most convenient <lb/>
            for Plutus, to celebrate musical and gymnastic contests.</p>

            for this fellow has found out a scant living for himself by <lb/>
            this means. No wonder all the judges often seek eagerly <lb/>

            ;tay here—Plutus where he was before established, al­ <lb/>
            ways guarding the inner cell of the goddess. But let <lb/>
            some one give me out here lighted torches, that you may <lb/>
            lold them and go before the god.</p>
          <p>Priest. Yes, by all means we must do this.</p>
          <p>Chr. Call Plutus out, some of you.</p>

          <p>Old Wom. But what am I to do ?</p>
          <p>Chr. Take the pots with which we are to establish the <lb/>
            god, and carry them on your head in a stately manner, <lb/>
            for you came yourself with a party-coloured dress on.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. But on what account I came ?</p>
          <p>Chr. All shall be immediately done for you. For the <lb/>
            young man shall come to you in the evening.</p>
          <p>Old Wom. Well, by Jove! if indeed you promise me <lb/>
            that he shall come to me, I'll carry the pots. [ Takes up <lb/>
            the pots and puts them on her head.</p>

            but go back to the rear; for we must follow after these, <lb/>
