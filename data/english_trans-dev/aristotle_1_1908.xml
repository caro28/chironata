          <p>THE investigation of the science of Mind, especially <lb/>
            as to its element, Thought, is of so interesting a charac­ <lb/>
            ter as in great measure to reconcile the inquirer to the <lb/>
            abstruseness of formal reasoning. The beauty of the <lb/>
            flower, whilst concealing the ruggedness, is apt to with­ <lb/>
            draw our attention from the utility, of the soil on <lb/>
            which it grows; and thus in like manner the charms of <lb/>
            Idealism, ending but too frequently in visionary specu­ <lb/>
            lation, have obstructed the clear appreciation of the <lb/>
            design and use of Logic. Not that we deny the con­ <lb/>
            nexion which must ever subsist between Logic, as the <lb/>
            science of the laws of reasoning, and psychology; in­ <lb/>
            deed the latter is constantly introduced in several topics <lb/>
            of the Organon; but if we would derive real practical <lb/>
            benefit from logical study, we must regard it as enun­ <lb/>
            ciative of the universal principle of inference, affording <lb/>
            a direct test for the detection of fallacy, and the estab­ <lb/>
            lishment of true conclusion.</p><pb n="iv"/>
            
          <p>Wherefore, while primarily connected with the lawi <lb/>
            of Thought, Logic is secondarily and practically alliec <lb/>
            to language as enunciative of Thought. To enter intc <lb/>
            the mental processes incident thereto, though so tempt <lb/>
            ing a theme as already to have seduced many from the <lb/>
            direct subject of the science, would far exceed the <lb/>
            limits of this Introduction. We shall therefore conten <lb/>
            ourselves with a few observations upon the utility o <lb/>
            the study connected with the Organon itself.</p>
          <p>It is a quaint remark of Erasmus, that the human un. <lb/>
            derstanding, like a drunken clown lifted on horseback <lb/>
            falls over on the farther side the instant he is supporte( <lb/>
            on the nearer ; and this is the characteristic of humai <lb/>
            praise and censure. From an ignorant and exaggerate( <lb/>
            notion of its purport, Logic, instead of being limited t&lt; <lb/>
            its proper sphere, was supposed commensurate with the <lb/>
            whole investigation of abstract truth in relation t&lt; <lb/>
            matter, cause, and entity,—in fact, the substance of ; <lb/>
            folio volume, describing every phase of human life <lb/>
            compressed into a few pages of Boethius and Aldrich <lb/>
            Thus, not having effected what nothing short of a mi <lb/>
            raculous expansion of the understanding could effect, i <lb/>
            sunk into insignificance, until recently vindicated, an&lt; <lb/>
            placed upon its proper footing, by Whately, Mansel. <lb/>
            and others.</p>
          <p>It is true that, whether viewed as an art or a science <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            Logic does not solve the origin of mental conception; <lb/>
            but it furnishes the rules on which all reasoning is <lb/>
            constructed; and it would be strange indeed if we re­ <lb/>
            fused the practical assistance of surgery because it does <lb/>
            not exhibit in theory the operation of will upon matter. <lb/>
            We may learn Logic and yet not be able to think; but <lb/>
            the science cannot be blamed for the imperfection of <lb/>
            the element worked upon, any more than the artificer <lb/>
            for the inferiority of the only material within his reach. <lb/>
            It is sufficient that Logic, without entering into all the <lb/>
            phenomena of mind, provides certain forms which an <lb/>
            argument, to be legitimate, must exhibit, certain tests <lb/>
            by which fallacy may be detected, and certain barriers <lb/>
            against ambiguity in the use of language.</p>
          <p>Hence, the utility of a science which enables men <lb/>
            to take cognizance of the travellers on the mind's <lb/>
            highway, and excludes those disorderly interlopers <lb/>
            verbal fallacies, needs but small attestation. Its search­ <lb/>
            ing penetration by definition alone, before which even <lb/>
            mathematical precision fails,l would especially com­ <lb/>
            mend it to those whom the abstruseness of the study <lb/>
            does not terrify, and who recognise the valuable results <lb/>
            which must attend discipline of mind. Like a medi­ <lb/>
            cine, though not a panacea for every ill, it has the <lb/>
            health of the mind for its aim, but requires the de­ <lb/>
            termination of a powerful will to imbibe its nauseating <note type="footnote"> t Prior Analyt. ü. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            yet wholesome influence: it is no wonder therefore that <lb/>
            puny intellects, like weak stomachs, abhor and reject <lb/>
            it. What florid declaimer can endure that the lux­ <lb/>
            uriant boughs of verdant sophistry, the rich blossoms <lb/>
            of oratorical fervour, should be lopped and pared by <lb/>
            the stern axe of a syllogism, and the poor stripped <lb/>
            trunk of worthless fallacy exposed unprotected to the <lb/>
            nipping atmosphere of truth ?</p>
          <p>Like the science of which it treats, not only has the <lb/>
            term “Logic " been variously applied,1 but even the Or. <lb/>
            ganon, as a whole, presents no great claim to unity <lb/>
            The term is neither found, as belonging to an ari <lb/>
            or science, in Aristotle, nor does it occur in the writing: <lb/>
            of Plato, and the appellation “ Organon," given to the <lb/>
            treatises before us, has been attributed to the Peripatetics <lb/>
            who maintained against the Stoics that Logic was " air <lb/>
            instrument" of Philosophy. The book, according t( <lb/>
            M. St. Hilaire, was not called “ Organon " before the <lb/>
            15th century,2 and the treatises were collected into on. <lb/>
            volume, as is supposed, about the time of Andronicus o <lb/>
            Rhodes ; it was translated into Latin by Boethius abou <lb/>
            the 6th century. That Aristotle did not compose the <lb/>
            Organon as a whole, is evident from several portion <lb/>
            having been severally regarded as logical, gram <lb/>
            matical, and metaphysical, and even the Aristotelia <lb/>
            names themselves, Analytic and Dialectic, are applica <note type="footnote"> I Scotus super Univ. Qu. 3. 2 Cf. Waitz, vol. ii. p. 294. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            )le only to certain portions of the Organon. Still the <lb/>
            system is so far coherent in the immediate view taken <lb/>
            of Logic, as conversant with language in the process of <lb/>
            easoning, that any addition to the structure of the <lb/>
            Stagirite can never augment the compactness with <lb/>
            vhich the syllogism, as a foundation, is built. The <lb/>
            reatises themselves are mentioned under distinct titles <lb/>
            )y their author, and subsequent commentators have <lb/>
            liscussed the work, not as a whole, but according to its <lb/>
            everal divisions. It is remarkable also, that no quot- <lb/>
            Ltions from the Categories, de Interpretatione, or So­ <lb/>
            )histical Elenchi, are found in the extant writings of <lb/>
            Aristote, since those given by Ritter1 of the first and <lb/>
            ast must be considered doubtful.</p>
          <p>In the present Translation my utmost endeavour has <lb/>
            been to represent the mind and meaning of the author <lb/>
            is closely as the genius of the two languages admits. <lb/>
            Che benefit of the student has been my especial object; <lb/>
            tence in the Analysis, the definitions are given in the <lb/>
            rery words of Aristotle, and the syllogistic examples, <lb/>
            ntroduced by Taylor, have been carefully examined <lb/>
            and corrected. In order also to interpret the more con­ <lb/>
            used passages, I have departed somewhat from the <lb/>
            Lsual plan, and in addition to foot-notes have affixed <lb/>
            explanations in the margin, that the eye may catch, <unclear>in</unclear> <lb/>
            he same line, the word and its import. Wherever <note type="footnote"> : Vol. iiL p. 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            further elucidation was necessary, I have referred to <lb/>
            standard authorities, amongst whom I would gratefully <lb/>
            commemorate the works of Mr. Mansel and Dr. <lb/>
            Whately, not forgetting my solitary predecessor in this <lb/>
            laborious undertaking, Thomas Taylor, whose strict <lb/>
            integrity in endeavouring to give the meaning of the <lb/>
            text deserves the highest commendation. For books <lb/>
            placed at my disposal I have especially to express my <lb/>
            sincere acknowledgments to the Rev. Dr. Hessey, <lb/>
            Head Master of Merchant Tailors' School, and John <lb/>
            Cuninghame, Esq. of Lainshaw.</p>
          <p>By an alteration in the original plan, it has been <lb/>
            found requisite, in order to equalize the size of the <lb/>
            volumes, to place Porphyry's Introduction at the close, <lb/>
            instead of at the commencement, of the Organon.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THINGS are termed homonymous, of which the 1. What are <lb/>
            name alone is common, but the definition (of sub- homonyms. <lb/>
            stance according to the name) is different; thus " man" <note type="footnote"> I Categories, or Predicaments, so called because they concern things <lb/>
            which may always be predicated, are the several classes under which all <lb/>
            abstract ideas, and their signs, common words, may be arranged. Their <lb/>
            classification under ten heads was introduced by Archytas and adopted by <lb/>
            Aristotle. The reason why, in this treatise about them, Aristotle does not <lb/>
            begin from these, but from Homonyms, &amp;c., is that he might previously <lb/>
            explain what was necessary to the doctrine of the Categories to prevent <lb/>
            subsequent digression. Vide Porphyr. in Prædicam. After comparing <lb/>
            various opinions of Alexander Aphrodisiensis, Syrianus, Simplicius, and <lb/>
            others, it appears agreed by all, that Aristotle's intention in this treatise <lb/>
            was, to discuss simple primary and general words, so far as they are sig­ <lb/>
            nificant of things ; at the same time to instruct us in things and conceptions, <lb/>
            so far as they are signified by words. A recollection of this digested ex-" <lb/>
            planation, will much assist the student in the enunciation of the plan. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Homonyms," equivocal words,—“ Synonyms," univocal,—“ Paro­ <lb/>
            hyms," derivative. We may remark here, that analogous nouns consti­ <lb/>
            tute only one species of equivocal: that the synonyms of Aristotle must <lb/>
            be distinguished from the modem synonyms, which latter are defined by <lb/>
            Boethius, " those which have many names, but one definition;" and <lb/>
            lastly, that paronyms have been limited by the schoolmen to certain con­ <lb/>
            crete adjectives, a limitation which is not warranted by Aristotle, and is <lb/>
            expressly rejected by his Greek commentators.—Mansel’s Rudiments of <lb/>
            Logic. See also Simplicius Scholia, p. 43, b. 5. “The reason," says <lb/>
            Syrianus, " why things polyonomous, and heteronomous, are omitted by <lb/>
            Aristotle, is because they rather pertain to ornament of diction, than to <lb/>
            the consideration of things; they are therefore more properly discussed <lb/>
            in the Rhetoric and Poetics." </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            and “ the picture of a man ” are each termed “animal," <lb/>
            since of these, the name alone is common, but the definition <lb/>
            (of the substance according to the name) is different:1 as if <lb/>
            any one were to assign what was in either, to constitute it <lb/>
            " animal,” he would allege the peculiar definition of each.</p>
          <p>2. What are <lb/>
            synonyms.</p>
          <p>But those are called synonyms, of which both the <lb/>
            name is common, and the definition (of the sub­ <lb/>
            stance according to the name) is the same,2 as <lb/>
            both " a man " and " an ox " are " animal," for each of these <lb/>
            is predicated of as "animal" by a common name, and the <lb/>
            definition of the substance is the same, since if a man gave <lb/>
            the reason of each as to what was in either, to constitute <lb/>
            3. Paronyms. <lb/>
            it “animal," he would assign the same reason. <lb/>
            Again, things are called paronyms which, though <lb/>
            differing in case, have their appellation (according to name) <lb/>
            from some thing, as “a grammarian " is called so from “gram­ <lb/>
            mar,” and “a courageous man " from " courage."</p>

            subject, as “the man" is predicated of a subject, i. e. of <note type="footnote"> their original state, are not predicable of substances; but by the mental <lb/>
            act, we may so connect an attribute with a subject, as to render the <lb/>
            former predicable of the latter, as a difference, property, or accident. <lb/>
            When a predicate is thus formed from an attribute, it is called connota­ <lb/>
            tive, or, as Whately justly remarks, " attributive," and signifies primarily, <lb/>
            the attribute, and secondarily, the subject of inhesion. Original uni­ <lb/>
            versals or attributes, as "man," "whiteness," are called "absolute;" <lb/>
            but terms may be made to cross, so that by an act of mind, that which <lb/>
            signifies substance may be conceived as an attribute, and as no longer <lb/>
            predicable of the individuals; in this sense they are called " abstract,” as <lb/>
            " humanitas " from " homo;" but when they are primarily or secondarily <lb/>
            predicable of individuals, they become " concrete," e. g. " man " is con­ <lb/>
            crete and absolute; "white," concrete and connotative; "whiteness," <lb/>
            abstract and absolute; it must be remembered only, that no abstract term <lb/>
            is connotative. Vide Occam, Log. p. i. ch. 5, 10. Simplicius enumerates <lb/>
            eleven modes of predication, arising from the relations of genus and spe­ <lb/>
            cies. Aristotle, in the Physics, divides substance in eight modes, omit­ <lb/>

            nor is in any; as " a certain ,” or " a certain <lb/>

            stances are inherent, that is to say, both these <lb/>
            and the genera of these species;2 as "a certain man exists <lb/>
            in “man,” as in a species, but the genus of this species is <lb/>
            “animal;” these, therefore, are termed secondary substances, <note type="footnote"> 1 On the various modes in which Aristotle employs the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>, <lb/>
            cf. Metaphy. lib. iv., and Phys. lib. iii. Without entering into the <lb/>
            dispute relative to the real existence of genera and species, as substances <lb/>
            independent of us, between the old Realists and the modern Conceptual­ <lb/>
            ists, it will be sufficient to state that Aristotle here employs the term as <lb/>
            the summum genus, under which, by continued abstraction of differences, <lb/>
            all things may be comprehended as a common universal. Thus also <lb/>
            Plato in Repub. lib. vii. Whether called Entity, Being, Substance, or <lb/>
            Subsistence, it may be defined, " That which subsists independently of <lb/>
            any other created thing,” and in this view may be affirmatively predi­ <lb/>
            cated of every cognate term, though no cognate term can be so predi­ <lb/>
            cated of it: thus all bodies, all animals, all lions, etc., are substances <lb/>
            or things, according as we adopt either of these last as summum genus. <lb/>
            Archytas places essence first; Plotinus and Nicostratus doubt its generic <lb/>
            affinity altogether; but all regard the principle laid down, of some one, <lb/>
            independent, existence, or conception. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 But in getting to this ultimate abstraction, the first common nature <lb/>
            of which the mind forms conception from individual comparison, is called <lb/>
            the lowest primary or most specific species, and of this, every cognate term <lb/>
            may be universally predicated, though itself cannot be predicated of any <lb/>
            cognate term. Between these extremes, all intermediate notions (and their <lb/>
            verbal signs) are called subaltern, each of which, like the step of a lad­ <lb/>
            der, is at once superior to some and inferior to others, and becomes a <lb/>
            genus in relation to some lower species, and a species to some higher <lb/>
            genera. The annexed " Arbor Porphyriana” is given by Aquinas, Opusc. <lb/>
            48. Tract. 2, cap. 3. In all the earlier specimens, "animal rationale" <lb/>
            is placed between “Animal” and “Homo,” as the proximum genus, <lb/>
            divided into " mortale" and " immortale," in accordance with Porphyry's <lb/>
            definition of man. We shall here observe also, that a summum genus can <lb/>

              fore both the name and the definition will be pre­ <lb/>

              some, there is nothing to prevent the name from being some­ <lb/>
              times predicated of the subject, though the definition cannot <lb/>
              be so; as "whiteness" being in a body, as in a subject, is <lb/>
              predicated of the subject, (for the body is termed " white,") <lb/>
              but the definition of "whiteness" can never be predicated of <lb/>
              body. All other things, however, are either predicated of <lb/>
              primary substances, as of subjects, or are inherent in them <lb/>
              as in subjects;1 this, indeed, is evident, from several obvi­ <lb/>
              ous instances, thus "animal" is predicated of "man," and <lb/>
              therefore is also predicated of some “certain man," for if it <lb/>

              "some certain body," for if it were not in "some one" of <lb/>
              bodies singularly, it could not be in " body" universally; <lb/>
              so that all other things are either predicated of primary sub­ <lb/>
              stances as of subjects, or are inherent in them as in subjects; <lb/>
              if therefore the primal substances do not exist, it is impossible <lb/>

            a substance <lb/>
            than genus.</p>
          <p>But of secondary substances, species is more <lb/>
            substance than genus;2 for it is nearer to the <lb/>
            primary substance, and if any one explain what <lb/>
            the primary substance is, he will explain it more clearly and <lb/>
            appropriately by giving the species, rather than the genus; <lb/>
            as a person defining "a certain man" would do so more <lb/>
            clearly, by giving " man" than " animal," for the former is <lb/>
            more the peculiarity of "a certain man," but the latter is <lb/>
            more common. In like manner, whoever explains what “a <lb/>
            certain tree" is, will define it in a more known and appropri- <lb/>

            species and genera alone are termed secondary <lb/>

            are secondary <lb/>

            to define what "a certain man" is, he would, by giving the <lb/>
            species or the genus, define it appropriately, and will do so <lb/>
            more clearly by introducing "man" than "animal;" but <lb/>
            whatever else he may introduce, he will be introducing, in <lb/>
            a manner, foreign to the purpose, as if he were to introduce <lb/>
            it white," or " runs," or any thing else of the kind, so that <lb/>
            with propriety of the others, these alone are termed sub­ <lb/>
            stances. Moreover, the primary substances, be­ <lb/>
            cause they are subject to all the-rest, and all the <lb/>
            others are predicated of, or exist in, these, are most <lb/>
            properly termed substances, but the same relation <lb/>

            all the rest, since of these, are all the rest predicated, foryou <lb/>
            will say that " a certain man " is "a grammarian,” and therefore <lb/>
            you will call both " man" and " animal" " a grammarian,” and <lb/>

          <p>It is common however to every substance, not to <lb/>
            be in a subject,1 for neither is the primal substance in <lb/>
            a subject, nor is it predicated of any,; but of the se­ <lb/>
            condary substances, that none of them is in a subject, is evident <lb/>
            from this; " man " is predicated of " some certain " subject <lb/>
            " man," but is not in a subject, for " man " is not in “a cer­ <lb/>
            tain man." So also " animal" is predicated of " some certain " <lb/>
            13. Of inhe­ <lb/>

            may be predi­ <lb/>

            ject, nothing prevents the name from being some­ <lb/>
            times predicated of the subject, but that the defi­ <lb/>
            nition should be predicated of it, is impossible.</p>
          <p>Of secondary substances however the definition and the name <lb/>
            are both predicated of the subject, for you will predicate the <lb/>
            14. The latter <lb/>
            may be predi­ <lb/>

            definition of " a man concerning " a certain man, <lb/>
            and likewise the definition of " animal," so that <lb/>
            substance, may not be amongst the number, of those <lb/>
            things which are in a subject.</p>
          <p>This however is not the peculiarity of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, but difference also is of the number of <lb/>
            those things not in a subject;2 for "pedestrian" <lb/>
            and "biped" are indeed predicated of "a man" as of a <lb/>
            subject, but are not in a subject, for neither "biped" nor <lb/>
            "pedestrian" is in "man." The definition also of differ­ <lb/>
            ence is predicated of that, concerning which, difference is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated, so that if " pedestrian " be predicated of " man," the <lb/>
            definition also of "pedestrian " will be predicated of man, for <lb/>
            16. Parts of <lb/>
            substances are <lb/>
            also sub­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            “man " is " pedestrian." Nor let the parts of sub­ <lb/>
            stances, being in wholes as in subjects, perplex us,, <lb/>
            so that we should at any time be compelled.to say, <lb/>
            that they are not substances; for in this manner, <note type="footnote"> I Simplicius observes that Aristotle discusses the things which sub­ <lb/>
            stance has in common with the other predicaments; Iamblichus, what is <lb/>
            common to it, and also its property and difference. Some may doubt <lb/>
            how essence, will not be in a subject, as ideas according to Plato are in <lb/>
            intellect, yet these are neither as in a subject, but are as essence in an­ <lb/>

            and to differences alike, that all things should be <lb/>
            predicated of them univocally, for all the cate­ <lb/>
            gories from them are predicated either in respect <lb/>

            substance there is no category, for it is predicated in respect <lb/>
            of no subject. But of secondary substances, species indeed <lb/>
            is predicated in respect of the individual, but genus in respect <lb/>
            to species and to individuals, so also differences are predicated <lb/>
            as to species and as to individuals. Again, the <lb/>
            primary substances take the definition of species <lb/>
            18. <lb/>
            and of genera, and the species the definition of the genus, for <lb/>
            as many things as are said of the predicate, so many also will <lb/>
            be said of the subject, likewise both the species and the indi­ <lb/>
            viduals accept the definition of the differences: those things <lb/>
            at least were univocal, of which the name is common and the <lb/>
            definition the same, so that all which arise from substances <lb/>
            and differences are predicated univocally.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless every substance appears to signify <lb/>
            this particular thing :1 as regards then the pri­ <lb/>
            mary substances, it is unquestionably true that <lb/>

            ticular thing, by the figure of appellation, when any one says <lb/>
            " man” or “animal,” yet it is not truly so, but <lb/>

            some admirable remarks in Mansel's Prolego. Log. 277. Generally it <lb/>

            one of such other things as are substances: hence substance <lb/>

          <p>It appears however, to be especially the pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity of substance, that being one and the same <lb/>

            also one in number, both bad and good; in like manner of other <lb/>
            things as many as are not substances. Put substance being <lb/>
            one, and the same in number, can receive contraries, as " a. <lb/>
            certain man " being one and the same, is at one time, white, <lb/>
            and at another, black, and warm and cold, and bad and good. <lb/>
            In respect of none of the rest does such a thing appear, ex­ <lb/>
            cept some one should object, by saying, that a sentence and <lb/>
            opinion are capable of receiving contraries, for the same sen­ <lb/>
            tence appears to be true and false; thus if the statement be <lb/>
            true that " some one sits," when he stands up, this <lb/>
            very same statement will be false. And in a si­ <lb/>
            milar manner in the matter of opinion, for if <lb/>

            the same opinion about him. Still, if any one, should even <lb/>
            admit this, yet there is a difference in the mode. <lb/>
            For some things in substances, being themselves <lb/>
            changed, are capable of contraries, since cold, be­ <lb/>
            ing made so, from hot, has changed, for it is <lb/>

            good from bad: in like manner as to other things, each one <lb/>
            of them receiving change is capable of contraries. The sen­ <lb/>

            immovable, but the thing being moved, a contrary is pro­ <lb/>
            duced about them; the sentence indeed remains the same, <lb/>
            that " some one sits," but the thing being moved, it becomes <lb/>
            at one time, true, and at another, false. Likewise as to opinion, <note type="footnote"> I He does not mean that contraries exist in substance at one and the <lb/>

            so that in this way, it will be the peculiarity of substance, to <lb/>
            receive contraries according to the change in itself, but if any <lb/>

            contraries, this would not be true. For the sen­ <lb/>
            tence and the opinion are not said to be capable <lb/>
            of contraries in that they have received any thing, <lb/>
            but, in that about something else, a passive qua­ <lb/>
            lity has been produced, for in that a thing is, or <lb/>
            is not, in this, is the sentence said to be true, or false, not in <lb/>
            that itself, is capable of contraries.1 In short, neither is a sen­ <lb/>
            tence nor an opinion moved by any thing, whence they can­ <lb/>
            not be capable of contraries, no passive quality being in them ; <lb/>
            substance at least, from the fact of itself receiving contraries, <lb/>
            is said in this to be capable of contraries, for it receives dis­ <lb/>
            ease and health, whiteness and blackness, and so long as it <lb/>
            receives each of these, it is said to be capable of receiving <lb/>
            contraries. Wherefore it will be the peculiarity of substance, <lb/>
            that being the same, and one in number, according to change <lb/>
            in itself, it is capable of receiving contraries ; and concerning <lb/>

            continuous, as line, superficies, body, besides <lb/>
            place and time. For, of the parts of number, <lb/>
            there is no common term, by which its parts con­ <lb/>
            crete and conti­ <lb/>
            nuous; cf parts <lb/>
            occupying rela­ <lb/>

            join, as if five be a part of ten, five and five, conjoin at no <lb/>
            common boundary, but are separated. Three, and seven, also <lb/>
            conjoin at no common boundary, nor can you at all take a <lb/>
            common limit of parts, in number, but they are always sear­ <lb/>
            ated, whence number is of those things which <lb/>
            are discrete. In like manner a sentence, for <lb/>
            2. Oratio. <lb/>
            that a sentence is quantity is evident, since it is measured <lb/>
            by a short and long syllable ;1 but I mean a sentence produced <lb/>
            by the voice, as its parts concur at no common limit, for there <lb/>
            is no common limit, at which the syllables concur, but each is <lb/>
            distinct by itself. A line, on the contrary, is <lb/>
            continuous, for you may take a common term, at <lb/>
            which its parts meet, namely, a point, and of a <lb/>

            continuous. <lb/>
            1. A line. <lb/>
            superficies, a line, for the parts of a superficies coalesce in a <lb/>
            certain common term. So also you can take a common term <lb/>
            in respect of body, namely, a line, or a superficies, <lb/>
            by which the parts of body are joined. Of the <lb/>
            2. A superficies. <lb/>
            same sort are time and place, for the present time is joined <lb/>
            both to the past and to the future. Again, place <lb/>
            is of the number of continuous things, for the <lb/>
            3. Time and <lb/>
            place. <lb/>
            parts of a body occupy a certain place, which parts join at a <lb/>
            certain common boundary, wherefore also the parts of place, <lb/>
            which each part of the body occupies, join at the same bound­ <lb/>
            ary as the parts of the body, so that place will also be con­ <lb/>
            tinuous, since its parts join at one common boundary.</p>
          <p>Moreover, some things consist of parts, having <lb/>
            position with respect to each other, but others of <lb/>
            parts not having such position;2 thus the parts of <lb/>
            a line have relative position, for each of them lies <lb/>

            some where, and you can distinguish, and set out, where each <lb/>
            lies, in a superficies, and to which part of the rest, it is joined. <lb/>
            So also the parts of a superficies, have a certain position, for <lb/>
            it may be in like manner pointed out where each lies, and <lb/>
            what have relation to each other, and the parts of a solid, and <lb/>
            5. Parts have <lb/>
            no relation in <lb/>
            respect of num­ <lb/>
            ber or time. <lb/>
            of a place, in like manner. On the contrary, in <lb/>
            respect of number, it is impossible for any one to <lb/>
            show that its parts have any relative position, or <lb/>
            that they are situated any where, or which of the <lb/>
            parts are joined to each other. Nor as regards parts of time, <lb/>
            for not one of the parts of time endures, but that which <lb/>
            does not endure, how can it have any position ? you would <lb/>
            rather say, that they have a certain order, inasmuch as one <lb/>
            part of time is former, but another latter. In the same man­ <lb/>
            ner is it with number, because one, is reckoned before two, <lb/>
            and two, before three, and so it may have a certain order, but <lb/>
            6. Oratio. <lb/>
            you can, by no means, assume, that it has position. <lb/>
            A speech likewise, for none of its parts en­ <lb/>
            dures, but it has been spoken, and it is no longer possible to <lb/>
            bring back what is spoken, so that there can be no position <lb/>
            of its parts, since not one endures: some things therefore <lb/>
            consist of parts having position, but others of those which <lb/>
            7. The above- <lb/>
            named are the <lb/>
            only proper <lb/>
            quanta-all <lb/>
            others reduci­ <lb/>
            ble to these.- <lb/>
            Examples. <lb/>
            have not position. What we have enumerated <lb/>
            are alone properly termed quantities; all the rest <lb/>
            being so denominated by accident, for looking <lb/>
            to these, we call other things quantities, as white­ <lb/>
            ness is said to be much, because the superficies is <lb/>
            great, and an action long, because of its time be­ <lb/>
            ing long, and motion also, is termed, much. Yet each of <lb/>
            these is not called a quantity by itself, for if a man should <lb/>
            explain the quantity of an action, he will define it by time, <lb/>
            describing it as yearly, or something of the sort; and if he <lb/>
            were to explain the quantity of whiteness, he will define it by <lb/>
            the superficies, for as the quantity of the superficies, so he <lb/>
            would say is the quantity of the whiteness ; whence the par­ <lb/>
            ticulars we have mentioned are alone properly of themselves <lb/>
            termed quantities, none of the rest being so of itself, but ac­ <note type="footnote"> the intellect, and confounds the distinction between order, in discrete, <lb/>
            and position, in continued quantities. The point is touched upon also in <lb/>
            lib. vi. of the Physics. Compare also ch. 12, on Priority, in the Cate­ <lb/>

            cording to accident. Again, nothing is contrary <lb/>
            to quantity,1 for in the definite it is clear there is <lb/>
            nothing contrary, as to " two cubits " or to " three," <lb/>
            8. Quantity, <lb/>
            per se, has no <lb/>
            contrary. <lb/>
            or to "superficies," or to any thing of this kind, for there <lb/>
            is no contrary to them; except indeed a man should allege <lb/>
            that " much " was contrary to " little," or the " great " to the <lb/>
            " small." Of these however, none is a quantity, but rather be­ <lb/>
            longs to relatives, since nothing, itself by itself, is described as <lb/>
            great or small, but from its being referred to <lb/>
            something else. A mountain, for instance, is called <lb/>
            " little," but a millet seed " large," from the fact <lb/>
            of the one being greater, but the other less, in re­ <lb/>
            spect of things of the same nature, whence the <lb/>
            9. Reply to ob­ <lb/>
            jection, founded <lb/>
            upon the con­ <lb/>
            trariety of great <lb/>
            to small. <lb/>
            relation is to something else, since if each were called "small" <lb/>
            or "great" of itself, the mountain would never have been <lb/>
            called "small," nor the seed " large." We say also that there <lb/>
            are it many " men in a village, but " few " at Athens, although <lb/>
            these last are more numerous, and " many " in a house, but <lb/>
            "few " in a theatre, although there is a much larger number <lb/>
            in the latter. Besides, " two cubits," " three," and every thing <lb/>
            of the kind signify quantity, but " great" or " small" does not <lb/>
            signify quantity, but rather relation, for the " great" and <lb/>
            " small" are viewed in reference to something else, so as evi­ <lb/>
            dently to appear relatives. Whether however any one does, <lb/>
            or does not, admit such things to be quantities, still there is <lb/>
            no contrary to them, for to that which cannot of <lb/>
            itself be assumed, but is referred to another, how <lb/>
            10. <lb/>
            can there be a contrary ? Yet more, if " great" and " small" <lb/>
            be contraries, it will happen, that the same thing, <lb/>
            at the same time, receives contraries, and that the <lb/>
            11. <lb/>
            same things are contrary to themselves, for it happens that the <lb/>
            same thing at the same time is both " great" and " small." <lb/>
            Something in respect of this thing is " small," but the same, in <lb/>
            reference to another, is " large," so that the same thing happens <lb/>
            at the same time to be both "great" and " small," by which at <lb/>
            the same moment it receives contraries. Nothing <lb/>
            however appears to receive contraries simultane­ <lb/>
            ously, as in the case of substance, for this indeed <lb/>

              and " healthy," nor a thing " white " and " black " together, <lb/>
              neither does any thing else receive contraries at one and the <lb/>
              13. <lb/>
               <lb/>
              same time. It happens also, that the same things <lb/>
              are contrary to themselves, since if the " great" <lb/>
              be opposed to the " small," but the same thing at the same <lb/>
              time be great and small, the same thing would be contrary to <lb/>
              itself, but it is amongst the number of impossibilities, that the <lb/>
              same thing should be contrary to itself, wherefore the great is <lb/>
              not contrary to the small, nor the many to the few, so that even <lb/>
              if some one should say that these do not belong to relatives, <lb/>
              but to quantity, still they will have no contrary.</p>

            riety of quan­ <lb/>
            tity chiefly <lb/>
            subsistent in <lb/>
            space.</p>
          <p>The contrariety however of quantity seems <lb/>
            especially to subsist about place, since men admit <lb/>
            " upward " to be contrary to " downward," calling <lb/>
            the place toward the middle " downward," because <lb/>
            there is the greatest distance from the middle, to the extremities <lb/>
            of the world;1 they appear also to deduce the definition of the <lb/>
            other contraries from these, for they define contraries to be <lb/>
            those things which, being of the same genus, are most distant <lb/>
            from each other.</p>
          <p>15. Quantity is <lb/>
            incapable of de­ <lb/>
            gree.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless quantity does not appear capable <lb/>
            of the greater and the less, as for instance " two <lb/>
            cubits," for one thing is not more " two cubits" <lb/>
            than another; neither in the case of number, since " three or <lb/>
            "five" are not said to be more than "three" or "five," nei­ <lb/>
            ther "five" more "five" than "three" "three;" one time <lb/>
            also is not said to be more " time " than another; in short, of <lb/>
            none that I have mentioned is there said to be a greater or a <lb/>
            less, wherefore quantity is not capable of the greater and less.</p>
          <p>16. But of <lb/>
            equality and <lb/>
            inequality.</p>
          <p>Still it is the especial peculiarity of quantity <lb/>
            to be called " equal" and " unequal," 2 for each of <lb/>
            the above-mentioned quantities is said to be <note type="footnote">1 The " upward " and " downward " do not signify place, but the pre­ <lb/>
            dicament where, just as " yesterday " and " to-day " do not signify time, <lb/>

            "equal" and "unequal," thus body is called "equal" and <lb/>

            and "unequal;" likewise in the case of the rest enumerated, <lb/>
            each one is denominated "equal" and "unequal." Of the <lb/>
            remainder, on the contrary, such as are not quantities, do not <lb/>
            altogether appear to be called " equal" and " unequal," as for <lb/>

            "similar" and "dissimilar;" hence the peculiarity of quan­ <lb/>

            therefore,are suchthings,as are said to be what they are, from <lb/>
            belonging to others, or which may somehow be referred to an­ <lb/>
            other.; as a mountain is called " great" in comparison with an­ <lb/>
            other, for the mountain is called " great" in relation to something, <lb/>
            and " like" is said to be like somewhat, and other things of this <note type="footnote"> subsists. Archytas divides the equal and unequal triply, according to <lb/>

            sort, are similarly spoken of, in relation to something. Re­ <lb/>
            clining, station, sitting, are nevertheless certain positions, and <lb/>
            position is a relative; but to recline, to stand, or to sit, are not <lb/>
            themselves positions, but are paronymously denominated from <lb/>
            the above-named positions.</p>
          <p>2. Some rela­ <lb/>
            tives admit <lb/>
            contrariety.</p>
          <p>Yet there is contrariety in relatives, as virtue <lb/>
            is contrary to vice, each of them being relative, <lb/>
            and knowledge to ignorance;1 but contrariety is not <lb/>
            inherent in all relatives, since there is nothing contrary to <lb/>
            double, nor to triple, nor to any thing of the sort.</p>
          <p>3. Also degree.</p>
          <p>Relatives appear, notwithstanding, to receive <lb/>
            the more and the less, for the like and the unlike <lb/>
            are said to be so, more and less, and the equal and the on­ <lb/>
            equal are so called, more and less, each of them being a <lb/>
            relative, for the similar is said to be similar to something, and <lb/>
            4. Exceptions. <lb/>
            the unequal, unequal to something. Not that all <lb/>
            relatives admit of the more and less, for double is <lb/>
            not called more and less double, nor any such thing, but all <lb/>
            5. Relatives <lb/>
            reciprocally <lb/>
            convertible. <lb/>
            relatives are styled so by reciprocity, as the servant <lb/>
            is said to be servant of the master, and the master, <lb/>
            master of the servant; and the double, double of <lb/>
            the half, also the half, half of the double, and the greater, <lb/>
            greater than the less, and the less, less than the greater. In <lb/>
            like manner it happens as to other things, except that some­ <lb/>
            times they differ in diction by case, as knowledge is said to <lb/>
            be the knowledge of something knowable, and what is know­ <lb/>
            able is knowable by knowledge: sense also is the sense of <lb/>
            6. Except <lb/>
            where the attri­ <lb/>
            bution of the <lb/>
            relation is er­ <lb/>
            roneous. <lb/>
            the sensible, and the sensible is sensible by sense. <lb/>
            Sometimes indeed they appear not to recipro­ <lb/>
            cate, if that be not appropriately attributed to <lb/>
            which relation is made, but here he who attributes <lb/>
            errs ; for instance, a wing of a bird, if it be attributed to the <lb/>
            bird, does not reciprocate, for the first is not appropriately <note type="footnote"> 1 These are relatives, according to their genus, which is habit in this <lb/>
            case. It may, however, be inquired how Aristotle afterwards ranks sci­ <lb/>
            ence, virtue, and their opposites, amongst qualities ? Because the same <lb/>
            thing, as he shows throughout, according to its connexion with different <lb/>
            relations, occupies often a different predicament. Hence, also, contrariety <lb/>
            is only partly inherent in relatives, since they derive their contrariety <lb/>
            from the contrariety of their predicaments: thus in habit or in quality <lb/>
            they receive contrariety, but not in the double or triple, because quantity <lb/>
            does not receive it. To admit contraries therefore, is not the peculiarity <lb/>
            of relatives, since contrariety is not in all relatives, nor in them alone, </note> <pb n="21"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. VII.]</note><lb/>
            attributed, namely "wing" to " bird," since " wing " is not <lb/>
            predicated of it so far as it is " bird," but so far as it is <lb/>
            "winged," as there are wings of many other things which are <lb/>
            not birds, so that if it were appropriately attributed, it would <lb/>
            also reciprocate; as " wing " is the wing of " a winged crea­ <lb/>
            ture," and " the winged creature " is " winged " by the " wing." <lb/>
            It is sometimes necessary perhaps even to invent <lb/>
            a namne' if there be none at hand, for that to <lb/>
            which it may be properly applied: e. g. if a rudder <lb/>
            be attributed to a ship, it is not properly so attri- <lb/>
            7. Necessity cf <lb/>
            sometimes in­ <lb/>
            venting a name <lb/>
            for the relata. <lb/>
            buted, for a rudder is not predicated of a ship so far as it is <lb/>
            " ship," since there are ships without rudders ;hence they do <lb/>
            not reciprocate, inasmuch as aship is not said to be the ship <lb/>
            of a rudder. The attribution will perhaps be more appro­ <lb/>
            priate, if it were attributed thus, a rudder is the rudder of <lb/>
            something ruddered, or in some other way, since a name is <lb/>
            not assigned; a reciprocity also occurs, if it is appropriately <lb/>
            attributed, for what is ruddered, is ruddered by a rudder. So <lb/>
            also in other things ; the for example, will be more ap­ <lb/>
            propriately attributed to something headed, than to animal, <lb/>
            for a thing has not a head, so far as it is an animal, since <lb/>
            there are many animals which have not a head.</p>
          <p>Thus any one may easily assume those things to <lb/>
            which names are not given, if from those which <lb/>
            are first, he assigns names to those others also, <lb/>
            8. Rule for no­ <lb/>
            mination of re­ <lb/>
            ciprocals. <lb/>
            with which they reciprocate,2 as in the cases adduced, <lb/>
            "winged" from "wing," and "ruddered" from "rudder." <lb/>
            An relatives therefore, if they be properly attri­ <lb/>
            buted, are referred to reciprocals, si nce if they <lb/>
            are referred to something casual,and not to that <lb/>
            9. All proper <lb/>
            relatives reci­ <lb/>
            procate. <lb/>
            to which they relate, they will not reciprocate. I mean, that <lb/>
            neither will any one of those things which are admitted to be <lb/>
            referrible to reciprocals, reciprocate, even though, names ba <lb/>
            assigned to them, if the thing be attributed to something ac-­ <lb/>
            cidental, and not to that to which it has relation: for ex- <note type="footnote"> I Conf. Top. i. 5, 1, also Anal. Post, ii. 7, 2. Definable objects are <lb/>

            ample, a servant, if he be not attributed as the servant of a <lb/>
            master, but of a man, of a biped, or any thing else of the kind, <lb/>
            will not reciprocate, for the attribution is not appropriate. <lb/>
            If however that, to which something is referred, be appropri­ <lb/>
            ately attributed, every thing else accidental being taken <lb/>
            away, and this thing alone being left, to which it is appropri­ <lb/>
            ately attributed, it may always be referred to it, as "a <lb/>
            servant," if he is referred to " a master," every thing else ac­ <lb/>
            cidental to the master being left out of the question, (as the <lb/>
            being " a biped," and " capable of knowledge," and that he is <lb/>
            "a man,") and his being "a master" alone, left, here the <lb/>
            "servant" will always be referred to him, for a "servant" <lb/>
            is said to be the servant of a " master." If again, on the <lb/>
            other hand, that to which it is at any time referred is not ap­ <lb/>
            propriately attributed, other things being taken away, and <lb/>
            10. So that the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            one depends <lb/>
            upon the other. <lb/>
            Vide infra, 13. <lb/>
            that alone left, to which it is attributed, in this <lb/>
            case it will not be referred to it. For let a " serv­ <lb/>
            ant " be referred to " man," and a " wing to <lb/>
            " bird," and let the being " a master " be taken <lb/>
            away from " man," the servant will no longer <lb/>
            refer to man, since "master not existing, neither does "serv­ <lb/>
            ant" exist. So also let " being winged" be taken away from <lb/>
            " bird," and " wing " will no longer be amongst relatives, for <lb/>
            what is " winged " not existing, neither will " wing " be the <lb/>
            wing of any thing. Hence it is necessary to attribute that, <lb/>
            to which a thing is appropriately referred, and if indeed a name <lb/>
            be already given to it, the application is easy; but if no name be <lb/>
            assigned, it is perhaps necessary to invent one; but being thus <lb/>
            attributed, it is clear that all relatives are referred to reciprocals.</p>
          <p>11. Relatives <lb/>
            by nature si­ <lb/>
            multaneous, <lb/>
            with some ex­ <lb/>
            ceptions.</p>
          <p>Naturally, relatives appear simultaneous, and <lb/>
            this is true of the generality of them, for " double" <lb/>
            and "half" are simultaneous, and "half" existing, <lb/>
            " double " exists, and " a master" existing, the " serv­ <lb/>
            ant " is, and the " servant" existing, the "master" <lb/>
            is, and other things are also like these. These also are mutually <lb/>
            subversive, for if there is no "double" there is no "half," and no <lb/>
            "half" there is no "double " ; likewise as to other things of the <lb/>
            same kind. It does not however appear to be true of, all re- <lb/>
            12. As science <lb/>
            and its object, <lb/>
            apparently. <lb/>
            latives, that they are by nature simultaneous, for <lb/>
            the object of "science" may appear to be prior <lb/>
            to " science," since for the most part we derive <pb n="23"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. VII.]</note><lb/>
            science from things pre-existing, as in few things, if even in <lb/>
            any, do we see science and its object originating together.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the object of science being subverted, <lb/>
            co-subverts the science, but science being sub­ <lb/>
            verted, does not co-subvert the object of science, <lb/>
            13. Sometimes, <lb/>
            but not always, <lb/>
            co-subversive. <lb/>
            for there being no object of science, science itself becomes <lb/>
            non-existent, (since there will be no longer a science of any <lb/>
            thing); ;1but on the contrary, though science does not exist, <lb/>
            there is nothing to prevent the object of science existing. Thus <lb/>
            the quadrature of the circle, if it be an object of scientific <lb/>
            knowledge, the science of it does not yet exist, though it is itself <lb/>
            an object of science :2 again, " animal" being taken away, there <lb/>
            will not be " science, but still it is possible for <lb/>
            many objects of science to be. Likewise also do <lb/>
            things pertaining to sense subsist, since the sens- <lb/>
            14. Instance of <lb/>
            things pertain­ <lb/>
            ing to sense. <lb/>
            ible seems to be prior to the sense, as the sensible being sub­ <lb/>
            verted co-subverts sense, but sense does not co-subvert the <lb/>
            sensible. For the senses are conversant with body, and are in <lb/>
            body, but the sensible being subverted, body also is subverted, <lb/>
            (since body is of the number of sensibles,) and body not existing, <lb/>
            sense also is subverted, so that the sensible co-subverts sense. <lb/>
            Sense on the other hand does not co-subvert the sensible, since if <lb/>
            animal were subverted, sense indeed would be subverted, but yet <note type="footnote">I This is self-evident, as also that there are some few things in which <lb/>
            science is the same as its object, e. g. things without matter are certainly <lb/>
            present at the same time as the intellectual science which abides in <lb/>
            energy. On the contrary, in the other case, as Simplicius observes, if in­ <lb/>
            dolence reject the knowledge of things, yet the things themselves remain, <lb/>
            as music, etc. Vide also Brewer's Introduction to the Ethics, book v., as <lb/>

              the sensible will remain ; such for instance as "body," “ warm," <lb/>
              " sweet," " bitter," and every thing else which is sensible. Be­ <lb/>
              sides, “ sense " is produced simultaneously with what is "sensi­ <lb/>
              tive," for at one and the same time " animal" and " sense " are <lb/>
              produced, but the “ sensible " is prior in existence to " animal" <lb/>
              or “ sense," for fire and water, and such things as animal con­ <lb/>
              sists of, are altogether prior to the existence of animal or sense, <lb/>
              so that the sensible will appear to be antecedent to sense.</p>
          <p>15. Primary <lb/>
            substance has <lb/>
            no relation.</p>
          <p>It is doubtful however whether no substance is <lb/>
            among the number of relatives, as seems to be the <lb/>
            case, or whether this happens in certain second sub­ <lb/>
            stances ; for it is true in first substances, since neither the <lb/>
            wholes, nor the parts, of first substances are relative. " A cer­ <lb/>
            tain man " is not said to be a certain man of something, nor " a <lb/>
            certain ox" said to be a certain ox of something; and so also with <lb/>
            respect to the parts, for a " certain hand” is not said to be a cer­ <lb/>
            tain hand of some one, but the hand of some one; and some head <lb/>
            is not said to be a certain head of some one, but the head of some <lb/>
            one, and in most secondary substances the like occurs. Thus <lb/>
            man is not said to be the man of some one, nor an ox the ox <lb/>
            of some one, nor the wood the wood of some one, but they <lb/>
            are said to be the possession of some one ; in such things <lb/>
            therefore, it is evident, that they are not included amongst re- <lb/>
            16. But some <lb/>
            secondary sub­ <lb/>
            stances seem to <lb/>
            possess rela­ <lb/>
            tion, but the <lb/>
            question is <lb/>
            solved by an <lb/>
            analysis of the <lb/>
            definition of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν πρός, τι</foreign>. <lb/>
            latives. In the case of some secondary substances <lb/>
            there is a doubt, as " head” is said to be the head of <lb/>
            some one, and “ hand,” the hand of some one, and in <lb/>
            like manner, every such thing, so that these may <lb/>
            appear amongst the number of relatives. Ifthen <lb/>
            the definition of relatives has been sufficiently <lb/>
            framed, it is either a matter of difficulty, or of <lb/>
            impossibility, to show that no substance is relative;1 but if <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato's favourite method of definition, which however was rejected by <lb/>
            Speusippus, was to take a wide genus, and by the addition of successive <lb/>
            differentiæ, to arrive at a complex notion, co-extensive with the desired <lb/>
            definition. Aristotle, on the other hand, to discover definition, employed <lb/>
            the inductive method, (he does not name this however,) which consisted <lb/>
            in examining the several individuals, of which the term to be defined is <lb/>
            predicable, and observing what they had in common. This will apply to <lb/>
            relatives and co-relatives equally, and hence we perceive that, properly <lb/>
            speaking, all definition is an inquiry into attributes. Every substance <lb/>
            definable must be a species, every attribute a property. Vide Scholia. <lb/>
            Edinburgh Review, No. cxv. p. 236. Pacius on Anal. Post, 11, 13, 21. </note> <pb n="25"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. VII.]</note><lb/>
            the definition has not been sufficiently framed, but those <lb/>
            things are relatives, whose substance is the same, as consists <lb/>
            with a relation, after a certain manner, to a certain thing ; <lb/>
            somewhat, perhaps, in reply to this, may be stated. The <lb/>
            former definition, however, concurs with all relatives, yet it <lb/>
            is not the same thing, that their being, consists in relation, <lb/>
            and that being what they are, they are predicated <lb/>
            of other things. Hence it is clear, that he who <lb/>
            knows any one relative, definitely, will also know <lb/>
            what it is referred to, definitely. Wherefore also <lb/>
            17. One rela­ <lb/>
            tive being <lb/>
            known, the co­ <lb/>
            relative can be <lb/>
            known. <lb/>
            from this it is apparent, that if one knows this particular <lb/>
            thing to be among relatives, and if the substance of relatives <lb/>
            is the same, as subsisting in a certain manner, with reference <lb/>
            to something, he will also know that, with reference to which, <lb/>
            this particular thing, after a certain manner, subsists ; for if, in <lb/>
            short, he were ignorant of that, with reference to which, this <lb/>
            particular thing, after a certain manner, subsists, neither would r <lb/>
            he know, whether it subsists, after a certain manner, with re­ <lb/>
            ference to something. And in singulars, indeed, <lb/>
            this is evident -, for if any one knows definitely, <lb/>
            18. Singulars. <lb/>
            that this thing is he will also forthwith know that, <lb/>
            definitely, of which it is the double, since if he knows not that <lb/>
            it is the double, of something definite, neither will he know <lb/>
            that it is "double," at all. So again, if a man knows this <lb/>
            thing, to be more beautiful than something else, he must <lb/>
            straightway and definitely know that, than which, it is more <lb/>
            beautiful. Wherefore, he will not indefinitely know, that this, <lb/>
            is better, than that which is worse, for such is opinion and not <lb/>
            science, since he will not accurately know that it is better <lb/>
            than something worse, as it may so happen that there is <lb/>
            nothing worse than it, whence it is necessarily evident, that <lb/>
            whoever definitely knows any relative, also definitely knowa <lb/>
            that, to which it is referred. It is possible, <lb/>
            notwithstanding, to know definitely what the <lb/>
            head, and the hand, and every thing of the sort <lb/>
            are, which are substances; but it is not necessary <lb/>
            19. The con­ <lb/>

            secondary sub­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            to know that to which they are referred, since it is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary de finitely to know whose, is the heady, or whose, is the <lb/>
            hand ; thus these will not be relatives, but if these be not <lb/>
            relatives, we may truly affirm no substance to be among re­ <lb/>
            latives.It is, perhaps, difficult for a man to assert assuredly <pb n="26"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAP. VIII.—Of the Quale and of Quality.2</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. Quality and <lb/>
            its species; the <lb/>
            latter of four <lb/>
            kinds. <lb/>
            1st, Habit and <lb/>
            disposition- <lb/>
            these ex­ <lb/>
            plained.</p>
          <p>By quality, I mean that, according to which, cer. <lb/>
            tain things, are said to be, what they are. Quality, <lb/>
            however, is among those things which are predi­ <lb/>
            cated multifariously; hence one species of quality <lb/>
            is called "habit" and "disposition," but habit, <lb/>
            differs from disposition, in that it is a thing more <lb/>
            lasting and stable.3 Of this kind too, are both the sciences <lb/>
            and the virtues,4 for science appears to rank among those <lb/>
            things, which continue more stable, and are hardly removed, <lb/>
            even when science is but moderately attained, unless some <lb/>
            great change should occur from disease, or from something <lb/>
            of the sort; so also virtue, as justice, temperance, and so <lb/>
            forth, does not appear capable of being moved or changed with <lb/>
            facility. But those are termed dispositions, which are easily <lb/>
            moved and quickly changed, as heat, cold, disease, health, and <lb/>
            such things; or a man is disposed, after a manner, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to these, but is rapidly changed, from hot becoming cold, <lb/>
            and from health passing to disease, and in like manner as to <lb/>
            other things, unless some one of these qualities has, from <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Metaph. lib. iv. c. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποιότης</foreign>. Def. " That which imparts what is apparent in matter, and <lb/>

            See also Metaphys. lib. iv. c. 14, 19, and 20, Leip. The distinction in <lb/>
            the text has been remarked upon, as exemplifying Aristotle's passion for <lb/>
            definition, but it would be more correct to remember that it was perhaps <lb/>
            less his inclination than his judgment, which induced him to lay down <lb/>
            strict notions of verbal definition primarily, knowing that the thing signi­ <lb/>
            fied, or idea, could never hold its proper position in the mind, if any doubt <lb/>
            existed as to the meaning of the term or verbal symbol of it, ab origine. <lb/>

            were divinely bestowed. Aristotle's opinion resembled Locke's, in the de. <lb/>

            length of time, become natural, immovable, or at least dif­ <lb/>
            ficult to be moved, in which case we may term it a habit. <lb/>
            But it is evident that those ought to be called habits, which are <lb/>
            more lasting, and are with greater difficulty removed, for those <lb/>
            persons who do not very much retain the dogmas of science, but <lb/>
            are easily moved, are said not to possess a scientific habit, <lb/>
            although they are in some manner disposed as to science, <lb/>
            either worse or better ; so that habit differs from disposition <lb/>
            in the one being easily removed, but the former is more lasting, <lb/>
            and less easily removed. Habits are dispositions also,1 but <lb/>
            dispositions not necessarily habits, for those who have habits <lb/>
            are also, after a manner, disposed according to them, but those <lb/>
            who are disposed are not altogether possessed of the habit.</p>
          <p>Another kind of quality is, that, according <lb/>
            to which, we say that men are prone to pugilism, <lb/>
            or to the course, or to health, or to disease, in <lb/>
            short, whatever things are spoken of according to <lb/>
            2nd species of <lb/>
            quality, that <lb/>
            which compre­ <lb/>
            hends the fa­ <lb/>
            culties. <lb/>
            natural power, or weakness; for each of these is not denomi­ <lb/>
            nated from being disposed after a certain manner, but from <lb/>
            having a natural power or inability of doing something easily, <lb/>
            or of not suffering ; thus, men are called pugilistic, or fitted <lb/>
            for the course, not from being disposed after a certain man­ <lb/>
            tier, but from possessing a natural power of doing something <lb/>
            easily. Again, they are said to be healthy, from possessing a <lb/>
            natural power of not suffering easily from accidents, but to be <lb/>
            diseased, from possessing a natural incapacity to resist suffer­ <lb/>
            ing easily from accidents: similarly to these, do hard and soft <lb/>
            subsist, for that is called “hard” which possesses the power <lb/>
            of not being easily divided, but" soft," that which has an impo­ <lb/>
            tence as to this same thing.</p>
          <p>The third kind of quality consists of passive qua­ <lb/>
            lities and passions, and such are sweetness, bitter- <lb/>
            Srd, Passive <lb/>
            qualities. <note type="footnote"> 1 The 'HOc signifies the habitual disposition or " humour," as in <lb/>

            "When some one peculiar quality <lb/>

            ness, sourness, and all their affinities, besides warmth, and cold­ <lb/>
            ness, and whiteness, and blackness. Now that these are qualities, <lb/>
            is evident from their recipients being called from them, “qua­ <lb/>
            lia,”1 as honey from receiving sweetness, is said to be sweet, and <lb/>
            the body white, from receiving whiteness; in like manner in <lb/>
            other things. They are called passive qualities,2 not from the re­ <lb/>
            cipients of the qualities suffering any thing, for neither is honey <lb/>
            said to be sweet from suffering any thing, nor any thing else of <lb/>
            such a kind. In like manner to these are heat and cold called <lb/>
            passive qualities, not from the recipients themselves suffering <lb/>
            any thing, but because each of the above-mentioned qualities <lb/>
            produces passion in the senses, they are denominated passive <lb/>
            qualities ; for as sweetness, produces a certain passion in the <lb/>
            taste, and warmth, in the touch, so also do the rest. Whiteness, <lb/>
            1. Exception in <lb/>
            the case of co­ <lb/>
            lours. <lb/>
            and blackness, and other colours are, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, not called passive qualities in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner with the above-mentioned, but from themselves <lb/>
            being produced from passion; for that many changes of co­ <lb/>
            lours spring from passion is evident, since when a man blushes <lb/>
            he becomes red, and when frightened, pale, and so every thing <lb/>
            of this sort. Whence also if a man naturally suffers a passion <lb/>
            of this nature, he will probably have a similar colour, since the <lb/>
            disposition which is now produced about the body when he <lb/>
            blushes, may also be produced in the natural constitution, so <lb/>
            as that a similar colour should naturally arise. Whatever <lb/>
            such symptoms then originate from certain passions diffi- <note type="footnote"> 1 Simplicius doubts whether the same thing is signified by quale, and <lb/>
            quality: probably the latter signifies the peculiarity itself, but quale that <lb/>
            which participates in the peculiarity, as in the examples given above. As <lb/>
            to the term “ quality," Plato in his Theætetus insinuates that he was <lb/>
            the author of it, and indeed some ancient philosophers, as Antisthenes, <lb/>
            subverted certain qualities, and allowed only the subsistence of qualia, <lb/>
            which they deemed incorporeal. The Stoics, on the contrary, thought <lb/>
            the qualities of incorporeal natures incorporeal, and of bodies, corporeal. <lb/>
            Simplicius defines qualities—“ powers, active, yet not so, primarily, nor <lb/>
            alone." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It may perhaps seem strange that Aristotle distinguishes passions and <lb/>
            passive qualities by the same characteristics as he has before used about <lb/>
            habit and disposition; but it may be replied, that here he considers the <lb/>
            passions and passive qualities which by nature are easily or hardly re­ <lb/>
            moved. Heat, so far as it disposes a subject, is a disposition; so far as <lb/>
            that disposition is permanent, is a habit; if it be superficially effected by an <lb/>
            agent, it is called a passion, and so far as the passion is produced perma­ <lb/>
            nently and intrinsically, it is called passive quality Taylor. </note> <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. VIII.]</note><lb/>
            cult to be removed and permanent are called passive qualities. <lb/>
            For whether in the natural constitution, paleness, or blackness, <lb/>
            be produced, they are called qualities, (for according to them <lb/>
            we are called "quales;") or whether through long disease or <lb/>
            heat, or any such thing, paleness or blackness happens, nei­ <lb/>
            ther are easily removed, or even remain through life, these are <lb/>
            called qualities, for in like manner, we are called " quales " in <lb/>
            respect of them. Notwithstanding, such as are <lb/>
            produced from things easily dissolved, and quickly <lb/>
            restored, are called passions,1 and not qualities, <lb/>
            2. There may <lb/>
            be <foreign xml:lang="grc">παθη</foreign>. <lb/>
            for men are not called "quales" in respect of them, since neither <lb/>
            is he who blushes, in consequence of being ashamed, called red, <lb/>
            nor he who turns pale, from fear, called pale, they are rather <lb/>
            said to have suffered something, so that such things are called <lb/>
            passions, but not qualities. Like these also are <lb/>
            passive qualities, and passions denominated in the <lb/>
            soul. For such things as supervene immediately <lb/>
            3. Also affec­ <lb/>
            tions of the <lb/>
            soul. <lb/>
            upon birth from certain passions difficult of removal, are called <lb/>
            qualities; as insanity, anger, and such things, for men ac­ <lb/>
            cording to these are said to be " quales," that is, wrathful and <lb/>
            insane. So also as many other mutations as are not natural, <lb/>
            but arise from certain other symptoms, and are with difficulty <lb/>
            removed, or even altogether immovable, such are qualities, <lb/>
            for men are called " quales " in respect of them. Those which, <lb/>
            on the other hand, arise from things easily and rapidly restored, <lb/>
            are called passions, as for instance, where one being vexed <lb/>
            becomes more wrathful, for he is not called wrathful who is <lb/>
            more wrathful in a passion of this kind, but rather he is said <lb/>
            to have suffered something, whence such things are called <lb/>
            passions, but not qualities.2</p>
          <p>The fourth kind of quality is figure and the form, <lb/>
            which is about every thing, besides rectitude and <lb/>
            curvature, and whatever is like them, for accord- <lb/>
            4th species of <lb/>
            quality- form <lb/>
            and figure. <lb/>
            ing to each of these a thing is called " quale." Thus a tri. <lb/>
            angle or a square is said to be a thing of a certain quality, <lb/>
            also a straight line or a curve, and every thing is said to be <lb/>
            " quale" according to form. The rare and the dense, the <lb/>
            rough and the smooth, may appear to signify a certain quality, <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Ethics, b. ii. ch. 5; also Metaphys. lib. iv. ch. 21; where the <lb/>
            same examples of inanimate objects axe given. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ethics, book ix. ch. 8. The being loved is like something passive. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="30"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP. VIII.</note><lb/>
            but probably these are foreign from the division of quality, as <lb/>
            each appears rather to denote a certain position of parts. For <lb/>
            a thing is said to be " dense," from having its parts near each <lb/>
            other, but" rare," from their being distant from each other, and <lb/>
            " smooth," from its parts lying in some respect in a right line, <lb/>
            but " rough," from this part, rising, and the other, falling.</p>
          <p>5. Things call­ <lb/>
            ed qualia paro­ <lb/>
            nymously from <lb/>
            these qualities.</p>
          <p>There may perhaps appear to be some other <lb/>
            mode of quality, but those we have enumerated <lb/>
            are most commonly called so.</p>
          <p>The above-named therefore are qualities, but " qualia are <lb/>
            things denominated paronymously according to them, or in some <lb/>
            other manner from them; most indeed and nearly all of them <lb/>
            are called paronymously,1 as "a white man" from "whiteness," <lb/>
            " a grammarian" from " grammar," a "just man " from "justice," <lb/>
            and similarly of the rest. Still in some, from no names having <lb/>
            been given to the qualities, it is impossible that they should <lb/>
            be called paronymously from them; for instance, a " racer" <lb/>
            or " pugilist," so called from natural power, is paronymously <lb/>
            denominated from no quality, since names are not given to <lb/>
            those powers after which these men are called " quales," as <lb/>
            they are given to sciences, according to which men are said <lb/>
            to be pugilists or wrestlers from disposition, for there is said <lb/>
            to be a pugilistic and palæstric science, from which those dis­ <lb/>
            posed to them are paronymously denominated "quales." <lb/>
            Sometimes however, the name being assigned, that which is <lb/>
            called " quale " according to it, is not denominated parony­ <lb/>
            mously, as from virtue, a man is called worthy, for he is called <lb/>
            worthy, from possessing virtue, but not paronymously from <lb/>
            virtue; this however does not often happen, wherefore those <lb/>
            things are called " qualia," which are paronymously denomin­ <lb/>
            ated from the above-mentioned qualities, or which are in some <lb/>
            other manner termed from them.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide supra, Cat. i. Massinger's employment, of the very word, <lb/>
            we are now discussing, presents a peculiar difficulty, in establishing the <lb/>
            paronymous or denominative relation. In the Roman Actor, act i. scene <lb/>
            3, and also in the Picture, act ii. scene 1, the word quality is limited to <lb/>
            actors and their profession. See Gifford's notes on Massinger. In fact, <lb/>
            most of our ancient dramatists confined the word chiefly to histrionic <lb/>
            performers. </note><note type="footnote"> I The name " conjugata " is more properly applied to derivatives from <lb/>

          <p>In quality, there is also contrariety,1 as justice <lb/>
            is contrary to injustice, and whiteness to black­ <lb/>
            ness, and the like; also those things which sub­ <lb/>
            sist according to them are termed qualia, as the <lb/>
            6. Quality <lb/>
            sometimes sus­ <lb/>
            ceptible of con. <lb/>
            trariety. <lb/>
            unjust to the just, and the white to the black. This however <lb/>
            does not happen in all cases, for to the yellow, or the pale, or <lb/>
            such like colours, though they are qualities, there is no con­ <lb/>
            trary.2 Besides, if one contrary be a quality, the other, will <lb/>
            also be a quality, and this is evident to any one con­ <lb/>
            sidering the other categories. For instance, if <lb/>
            justice be contrary to injustice, and justice be a <lb/>
            quality, then injustice will also be a quality, for <lb/>
            none of the other categories accords with injustice, <lb/>
            7. If one con­ <lb/>
            trary be a quale <lb/>
            the other will <lb/>
            be a quale. <lb/>
            neither quantity, nor relation, nor where, nor in short any <lb/>
            thing of the kind, except quality, and the like also happens as <lb/>
            to quality in the other contraries.</p>
          <p>Qualia also admit the more and the less,3 as one thing is <lb/>
            said to be more or less " white " than another, and one more <lb/>
            and less " just" than another; the same thing also <lb/>
            itself admits accession, for what is ""white," can be­ <lb/>
            come more, it white." This however, does not hap- <lb/>
            8. It can also <lb/>
            admit degree, <lb/>
            but not always <lb/>
            pen with all, but with most things, for some one may doubt <lb/>
            whether justice, can be said to be more or less justice, and so <lb/>
            also in other dispositions, since some doubt about such, and as­ <lb/>
            sert that justice cannot altogether be called more and less, than <lb/>
            justice, nor health than health, but they say, that one man has <lb/>
            less health, than another, and one person less justice, than an­ <lb/>
            other, and so also of the grammatical and other dispositions. <lb/>
            Still the things which are denominated according to these, do <lb/>
            without question admit the more and the less, for one man is said <note type="footnote"> 1 See below, Cat. xi. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Repugnance is not synonymous with contrariety, e. g. red and blue <lb/>

            things which receive the definition of a triangle, <lb/>
            and of a circle, are all alike triangles or circles, but of things <lb/>
            which do not receive the same definition, none can be said to <lb/>
            be more such, than another, as a square, is not more a cir­ <lb/>
            cle, than an oblong, for neither of them admits the definition <lb/>
            of the circle. In a word, unless both receive the definition of <lb/>
            the thing propounded, one cannot be said to be more so and so, <lb/>
            than another, wherefore all qualities do not admit the more and <lb/>

            that similitude <lb/>
            is predicated in <lb/>
            respect of it.</p>
          <p>Of the above-mentioned particulars then, no <lb/>
            one is peculiar to quality, but things are said to <lb/>
            be similar, and dissimilar, in respect of qualities <lb/>
            alone, for one thing is not like another in respect <lb/>
            of any thing else, than so far as it is quale, so <lb/>
            that it will be peculiar to quality, that the like and the unlike <lb/>

            lities. <lb/>
            proposing to speak of quality, we co-enumerate <lb/>
            many things which are relatives, for we said that <lb/>
            habits and dispositions are among the number of re­ <lb/>
            latives, and nearly in all such things the genera are <lb/>
            called relatives, but not one of the singulars. Sci­ <lb/>
            ence, for example, although it is a genus, is said to <lb/>
            be what it is, with respect to something else, for it is <lb/>
            said to be the science of a certain thing, but of singulars not <lb/>
            one is said to be what it is, with reference to something else, <lb/>
            as neither grammar is said to be the grammar of something, <lb/>
            nor music the music of something. But even perhaps these, <lb/>
            are called relatives, according to genus, as grammar is said to <lb/>
            be the science of something, not the grammar of something, <lb/>
            and music the science of something, not the music of some- <note type="footnote"> I If impression and character produce similitude, and quality consists <lb/>
            in character, it will justly have its peculiarity according to the similar <lb/>
            and dissimilar. Archytas observes, " The peculiarity of quality is the si­ <lb/>

            thing; so that singulars are not of the number of relatives. <lb/>
            Still, we are called quales from singulars,1 for <lb/>
            these we possess, as we are called scientific from <lb/>
            possessing certain singular sciences ; so that these <lb/>
            may be singular qualities, according to which <lb/>
            we are sometimes denominated quales, but they <lb/>
            11. Singulars <lb/>
            not included <lb/>

            are not relatives ; besides, if the same thing should happen to <lb/>
            be both a particular quality and a relative, there is no absurdity <lb/>
            in its enumeration under both genera.</p>

          <p>1. Opposites <lb/>
            are of four <lb/>
            kinds.</p>
          <p>WE must now speak of opposites, in how many <lb/>
            ways opposition takes place. One thing then is <lb/>
            said to be opposed to another in four ways, either <lb/>
            as relative, or as contrary, or as privation and habit, or as <lb/>
            affirmation and negation. Thus speaking summarily, each <lb/>
            thing of this kind is opposed, relatively, as " the double " to <lb/>
            " the half," contrarily, as "evil" to "good," privatively and <lb/>
            habitually, as " blindness " and " sight," affirmatively and ne­ <lb/>
            gatively, as " he sits," " he does not sit."</p>
          <p>1. Relative op­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>W hatever things then are relatively opposed, are <lb/>
            said to be what they are with reference to opposites, <lb/>
            or are in some manner referred to them, as " the <lb/>
            double of the half," is said to be what it is, with reference to <lb/>
            something else, for it is said to be the double of something ; and <lb/>
            " knowledge " is opposed relatively to the object of knowledge, <lb/>
            and is said, to be what it is, in reference to what may be <lb/>
            known, and what may be known, is said to be what it is, in <lb/>
            reference to an opposite, namely, " knowledge," for " the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of knowledge " is said to be so, to something, namely, to <lb/>
            "knowledge." <note type="footnote"> 1 For a brief exposition of this chapter, the reader is referred to the <lb/>
            nature and laws of logical opposition in necessary, impossible, and con­ <lb/>
            tingent matter, given in Aldrich, Huyshe, Whately, Hill, and Man­ <lb/>
            sel. It will be remembered however that he here speaks of the opposi­ <lb/>
            tion of terms, the rules for the opposition of propositions being more <lb/>
            especially considered in the Interpretation: still a reference to that treatise, <lb/>
            as well as to the authors cited above, will be useful, as elucidating the <lb/>
            grounds on which all logical opposition is founded. Archytas (says <lb/>
            Simplicius) does not omit, but seems to have more accurately explained <lb/>
            the differences of contraries adduced by Aristotle. He says : Of contra­ <lb/>
            ries, some are in the genera of genera, as good and evil, the first being the <lb/>
            genus of the virtues, the second of the vices: some again in the genera of <lb/>
            species, as virtue to vice, the first being the genus of prudence, temperance, <lb/>
            etc.; the other of imprudence, intemperance: lastly, some in species, as <lb/>
            fortitude to timidity, etc.: but he adds, " there is nothing to prevent the <lb/>
            contraries of genera being reduced under one genus, as good and evil <lb/>
            under quality." </note> <pb n="35"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">CHAP. X.]</note></p>
          <p>Things therefore relatively opposed are said to be, what <lb/>
            they are, with reference to opposites, or in whatever manner, <lb/>
            they are referrible to each other, but those which <lb/>
            are opposed as contraries, are by no means, said <lb/>
            to be what they are, with reference to each other, <lb/>
            2. Contrary <lb/>
            opposition. <lb/>
            but are said to be contrary to each other, for neither is <lb/>
            "good" said to be the "good" of "evil," but the contrary of <lb/>
            evil, nor is "white," denominated the "white"of "black," <lb/>
            but its contrary, so that these oppositions differ from each <lb/>
            other. Such contraries however, as are of that kind, that one <lb/>
            of them must necessarily be in those things, in which it can <lb/>
            naturally be, or of which it is predicated, these have nothing <lb/>
            intermediate; but in the case of those, in which it is not <lb/>
            necessary, that one should be inherent, there is something <lb/>
            intermediate. For instance, health and disease may na­ <lb/>
            turally subsist in the body of an animal, and it is necessary <lb/>
            that one, should be therein, either disease, or health ; the odd <lb/>
            and even are also predicated of number, and one of the two, <lb/>
            either the odd or the even, must necessarily be in number, yet <lb/>
            there is nothing intermediate between these, neither between <lb/>
            disease and health, nor between the odd and the even. Those <lb/>
            contraries, again, have something intermediate, in which one <lb/>
            of them need not be inherent, as black and white are naturally <lb/>
            in body, but it is not necessary, that one of these, should be <lb/>
            inherent in body, for every body, is not white or black. <lb/>
            Vileness, also and worth, are predicated of man, and of many <lb/>
            others, yet one of these, need not be in those things of which <lb/>
            it is predicated, for not all things are either vile or worthy ; <lb/>
            at least, there is something intermediate, as between white <lb/>
            and black, there is dark brown, and pale, and many other <lb/>
            colours, but between vileness and worth, that, is intermediate, <lb/>
            which is neither vile, nor worthy. In some instances, the inter­ <lb/>
            mediates have names, thus, the dark brown, and the pale, and <lb/>
            such colours are media between white and black, but in other <lb/>
            cases, it is not easy to assign a name to the intermediate, but the <lb/>
            latter is defined, by the negation of either extreme, as, for exam­ <lb/>

            in the meaning <lb/>
            of habitual and <lb/>
            privative op­ <lb/>
            position. <lb/>
            less nor blind. To be deprived of, and to possess <lb/>
            habit, then, are not privation and habit, for the <lb/>
            sight is habit, but the privation is blindness, but <lb/>
            to possess sight is not sight, nor to be blind, blind­ <lb/>
            ness, for blindness is a certain privation, but the being blind <lb/>
            is to be deprived, and is not privation, for if blindness were <lb/>
            the same as being blind, both might be predicated of the same <lb/>
            person, but a man is said to be blind, yet he is never called <lb/>
            blindness. To be deprived also, and to possess habit, appear <lb/>
            to be similarly opposed, as privation and habit, since the mode <lb/>
            of opposition is the same, for as blindness is opposed to sight, so <lb/>
            likewise is the being blind, opposed to the possession of sight.'</p>
          <p>4. Opposition <lb/>
            of affirmative <lb/>
            and negative.</p>
          <p>Neither is that, which falls under affirmation and <lb/>
            negation, affirmation and negation ; for affirmation <lb/>
            is an affirmative sentence, and negation a negative <note type="footnote"> and Negative words are given in Hill's Logic, p. 27. Aldrich's definition <lb/>
            of the three will be remembered here, namely, that the first signifies the <lb/>
            presence of an attribute; the second, its absence from a subject capable <lb/>
            of it; the last, its absence from a subject incapable of it. A definite <lb/>
            noun and its corresponding indefinite noun together, constitute a perfect <lb/>
            division. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This opposition between propositions is said to be as to their quality ; <lb/>
            to this may be appended that contrariety of quality which exists between <lb/>
            two particulars, properly called the opposition of sub-contraries. It may <lb/>
            here be observed, that though this last-named form of contrariety is ad­ <lb/>
            mitted by Aristotle, (Int. ch. 7,) he does not use the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπεναντιως</foreign> as <lb/>
            expressive of it, but calls it, in Anal. Prior, ii. 15, an opposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν <lb/>
            λέξιν</foreign>. The term is used by the Greek commentators, (Ammonius Schol. <lb/>
            p. 115, a. 15,) Boethius Int. ad Syll. p. 564. A poetical example of the <lb/>
            mutual subversion of some relative opposites may be found in Shaks­ <lb/>

            " Indirection thereby grows direct, <lb/>
            And falsehood falsehood cures : as fire cools fire <lb/>
            Within the scorched veins of one new burn'd." </note> <pb n="37"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. X.]</note><lb/>
            sentence, but nothing which falls under affirmation and nega­ <lb/>
            tion is a sentence (but a thing). Still these are said to be <lb/>
            mutually opposed, as affirmation and negation, since in them <lb/>
            the mode of opposition is the same, for as affirmation is some­ <lb/>
            times opposed to negation, for example, "he sits" to "he doer <lb/>
            not sit," so that thing which is under each is opposed, as <lb/>
            " sitting " to " not sitting."</p>
          <p>But that privation and habit, are not opposed <lb/>
            as relatives, is evident, since what a thing is, is <lb/>
            not asserted of its opposite, for sight is not the <lb/>
            sight of blindness, nor in any other way spoken <lb/>
            5. Privation <lb/>
            and habit not <lb/>
            relatively op­ <lb/>
            posed. <lb/>
            in reference to it, so also blindness, cannot be called the blind­ <lb/>
            ness of sight, but blindness indeed is said to be the privation <lb/>
            of sight, not the blindness of sight. Moreover, all relatives <lb/>
            are referred to reciprocals, so that if blindness were relative, <lb/>
            it would reciprocate with that to which it is referred, but it <lb/>
            does not reciprocate, for sight is not said to be the sight of <lb/>
            blindness.</p>
          <p>From these things, also, it is manifest that those which are <lb/>
            predicated, according to privation and habit, are not <lb/>
            contrarily opposed, for of contraries which have <lb/>
            no intermediate, one must always necessarily be <lb/>
            (2.) Nor con­ <lb/>
            trarily. <lb/>
            inherent, wherein it is naturally adapted to be inherent, or of <lb/>
            which it is predicated, but between these, there is no inter­ <lb/>
            mediate thing wherein it was necessary that the one should be in <lb/>
            what was capable of receiving it, as in the case, of disease and <lb/>
            health, in odd and the even number. Of those however between <lb/>
            which there is an intermediate, it is never necessary that one <lb/>
            should be inherent in every thing ; for neither is it necessary <lb/>
            that every thing capable of receiving it, should be white or <lb/>
            black, or hot or cold, since there is no prevention to an interme­ <lb/>
            diate being between them. Again, of these also there was a cer­ <lb/>
            tain medium, of which it was not requisite that one should be <lb/>
            in its recipient, unless where one is naturally inherent, as in fire <lb/>
            to be hot, and in snow to be white: still in these, one, must <lb/>
            of necessity be definitely inherent, and not in whatever way <lb/>
            it may happen, for neither does it happen that fire is cold, <lb/>
            nor that snow is black.1 Wherefore it is not necessary that one <lb/>
            of them should be in every thing capable of receiving it, but <note type="footnote"> I Vide Whately and Hill's Logic, De terminorum distributione: also <lb/>
            the former upon Fallacies, book i. sections 1 and 13. </note> <pb n="38"/>
             <note type="margin">[CHAP. X.</note><lb/>
            only in those wherein the one is naturally inherent, and in <lb/>
            these, that which is definitely and not casually, one. In <lb/>
            privation however, and habit, neither of the above-men­ <lb/>
            tioned particulars is true, since it is not always necessary <lb/>
            that one should be inherent in what is capable of receiv­ <lb/>
            ing it, as what is not yet naturally adapted to have sight, <lb/>
            6. Nature of <lb/>
            intermediates <lb/>
            in respect to <lb/>
            opposition. <lb/>
            is neither said to be blind nor to have sight; <lb/>
            wherefore these things will not be of such contra­ <lb/>
            ries as have nothing intermediate. But neither, <lb/>
            on the other hand, will they be amongst those <lb/>
            which have something intermediate, since it is necessary that <lb/>
            at some time, one of them, should be inherent in every thing ca­ <lb/>
            pable of receiving it: thus when a man is naturally fitted to <lb/>
            have sight, then he will be said to be blind, or to have sight, <lb/>
            and one of these, not definitely, but whichever may happen, <lb/>
            since he need not necessarily be blind, nor see, but either, as it <lb/>
            may happen. In respect nevertheless of contraries, which have <lb/>
            an intermediate, it is by no means necessary that one, should <lb/>
            be inherent in every thing, but in some things, and in these, <lb/>
            one of them definitely, and neither casually, so that things <lb/>
            which are opposed according to privation and habit, are evi­ <lb/>
            dently not in either of these ways opposed, as contraries.</p>
          <p>Again, in contraries, when the recipient exists, a change <lb/>
            into each other may happen, unless one is naturally inherent <lb/>
            in something, as for instance, in fire to be hot. It is possible <lb/>
            also for the healthy to be sick, the white to become black, <lb/>
            cold to become hot, (and the hot to become cold) ; from good <lb/>
            it is possible to become bad, and from bad good, for he <lb/>
            who is depraved, being led to better pursuits and discourses, <lb/>
            advances, though but a little, to be better, and if he once makes <lb/>
            an advancement ever so little, he will evidently become either <lb/>
            altogether changed, or have made a very great proficiency, 1 <note type="footnote"> I Vide Ethics, book ii. ch. 1; also Magna Moralia, and Metaph. lib. <lb/>

            since he ever becomes more disposed to virtue, even if he has ob. <lb/>
            tained the smallest, increase, from the beginning. Wherefore <lb/>
            he will probably acquire greater increase, and this perpetually <lb/>
            occurring, he will at last be transformed entirely to a contrary <lb/>
            habit, unless he be prevented by time ; but in privation and <lb/>
            habit, it is impossible for a mutual change to occur, since it <lb/>
            may take place from habit to privation, but from privation to <lb/>
            habit is impossible, as neither can he who has become blind, <lb/>
            again see, the bald again have hair, nor has the toothless ever <lb/>
            yet again got teeth.</p>
          <p>Whatever things are opposed, as affirmation <lb/>
            and negation, are evidently opposed according to <lb/>
            none of the above-mentioned modes, since in these <lb/>
            alone it is always necessary that one should be <lb/>
            true, but the other false;1 as neither, is it al­ <lb/>

            should be true <lb/>
            and the other <lb/>
            false. <lb/>
            true but the other false, nor in relatives, nor in habit and <lb/>
            privation. For instance, health and disease, are contrary, yet <lb/>
            neither of them is either true or false; so also the double and <lb/>
            the half are relatively opposed, and neither of them is either <lb/>
            true or false; nor in things which are predicated as to priva­ <lb/>
            tion and habit, as sight and blindness. In short, nothing pre­ <lb/>
            dicated without any conjunction, is either true or false, and <lb/>
            all the above-named are predicated without conjunction. Not <lb/>

            which are predicated conjunctively, for " Socrates is well" is <lb/>

            necessary, that one should be true and the other false, for <lb/>
            while Socrates lives, one will be true and the other false, but <lb/>
            when he is not alive, both will be false, since neither is it <lb/>

            ject is non-existent, neither is true, but when the subject exists, <lb/>
            the one is not always true, nor the other false. " Socrates <lb/>
            sees " is opposed to " Socrates is blind," as privation and habit, <lb/>
            and whilst he exists, one need not be true or false, for when he <lb/>
            is not naturally fitted to possess them, both are false, but when <lb/>
            Socrates does not exist at all, both will thus be false, that he <lb/>
            sees, and that he is blind. In affirmation and negation always, <lb/>
            if Socrates be or be not, one will always be false and the other <lb/>
            true ; for it is evident with respect to these two, " Socrates is <lb/>
            sick," and " Socrates is not sick," that when he exists one of <lb/>
            them is true and the other false; and in like manner when he <lb/>
            does not exist, for in the latter case that he is ill is false, but <lb/>
            that he is not ill is true; so that in those things alone which <lb/>
            are affirmatively and negatively opposed will it be the pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity that one of them is either true or false.</p>

          <p>Moreover, besides what we have mentioned, the <lb/>
            better and more excellent appear to be prior by <lb/>
            nature. The common people are accustomed to <lb/>
            say, that those whom they chiefly honour and especially re­ <lb/>
            gard, are prior in their esteem;1 but this is nearly the most <lb/>
            foreign of all the modes, wherefore such are (nearly) the modes <lb/>
            of priority which have been enumerated.</p>
          <p>2. Another <lb/>
            mode of prior­ <lb/>
            ity may be add­ <lb/>
            ed, where one <lb/>
            thing is the <lb/>
            cause of an­ <lb/>
            other's exist­ <lb/>

          <p>Besides the above-mentioned, there may yet <lb/>
            appear to be another mode of the prior; as of <lb/>
            things reciprocating, according to the consequence <lb/>
            of existence, that which in any respect is the cause <lb/>
            of the existence of the one, may justly be said to be <lb/>
            by nature prior, and that there are, certain things <lb/>
            of this kind, is manifest. For that man exists, reciprocates, <lb/>
            according to the consequence of existence, with the true sen­ <lb/>
            tence respecting him, since if man is, the sentence is true, by <lb/>
            which we say, that man is, and it reciprocates, since if the <lb/>
            sentence be true, by which we say that man is, then man is. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding, a true sentence, is by no means the cause of <lb/>
            a thing's existence, but in some way, the thing appears the <lb/>
            cause of the sentence being true, for in consequence of a thing <lb/>
            existing, or not existing, is a sentence said to be true or <lb/>
            false. Wherefore one thing may be called prior to another, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THINGS are called simultaneous simply and most <lb/>
            properly, whose generation occurs at the same <lb/>
            time, for neither is prior or posterior; these, <lb/>
            therefore, are said to be simultaneous as to time. <lb/>
            But by nature those are simultaneous, which re­ <lb/>
            ciprocate according to the consequence of exist­ <lb/>
            ence, although one, is by no means the cause of <lb/>
            the existence of the other, as in the double and <lb/>
            I. Those things <lb/>
            are simultane­ <lb/>
            ous which at <lb/>
            the same time <lb/>
            are produced, <lb/>
            and which re­ <lb/>
            ciprocate, but <lb/>
            do not either <lb/>
            cause the <lb/>
            other's exist­ <lb/>
            ence. <lb/>
            the half, for these reciprocate; thus the double existing, the <lb/>
            half also exists, and the half existing, the double exists, but <lb/>
            neither is the cause of existence to the other.</p>
          <p>Those, also, which being derived from the same <lb/>
            genus, are by division mutually opposed, are said <lb/>
            to be naturally simultaneous;1 but they, are said <lb/>
            to have a division opposite to each other, which <lb/>
            subsist according to the same division; thus the <lb/>
            2. Or which as <lb/>
            species of the <lb/>
            same genus,are <lb/>
            opposed in the <lb/>
            same relation <lb/>
            of division. <lb/>
            winged is opposed to pedestrian and aquatic, as these being <lb/>
            derived from the same genus, are by division mutually opposed, <lb/>
            for animal is divided into these, viz. into the winged, the pe­ <lb/>
            destrian, and aquatic, and none of these is prior or posterior, <lb/>
            but things of this kind appear naturally simultaneous. Each <lb/>
            of these again, may be divided into species, for instance, the <lb/>
            winged, the pedestrian, and the aquatic; wherefore, those will <lb/>
            be naturally simultaneous which, derived from the same genus, <lb/>
            subsist according to the same division. But genera are al­ <lb/>
            ways prior to species, since they do not reciprocate according <lb/>
            to the consequence of existence ;2 for the aquatic existing, ani­ <lb/>
            mal exists, but though animal exists, it is not necessary that <lb/>
            the aquatic should.</p>
          <p>Hence those are called naturally simultaneous, which in­ <lb/>
            deed reciprocate, according to the consequence of existence; <lb/>
            but the one is by no means the cause of existence to the other, <lb/>
            which is also the case with things that, derived from the same <note type="footnote"> chapter will appear elucidatory, and, in fact, is the same statement of the <lb/>
            whole, in reverse. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Porphyry recognises only a relative difference between two given <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Motion of <lb/>
            six kinds.</p>
          <p>OF motion, there are six species, generation, cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, increase, diminution, alteration, and <lb/>
            change of place.</p>
          <p>The other motions then evidently differ from each other, <lb/>
            for neither is generation, corruption, nor increase, diminu­ <lb/>
            tion, nor alteration, change of place, and so of the rest. In <lb/>
            2. Alteration <lb/>
            questionably <lb/>
            relative to the <lb/>
            rest, this dis­ <lb/>
            proved. <lb/>
            the case of alteration however, there is some <lb/>
            doubt, whether it be not sometimes necessary that <lb/>
            what is altered, be so, in respect to some one, of <lb/>
            the other motions, but this is not true, for it hap­ <lb/>
            pens that we are altered, as to nearly all the passions, or at <lb/>
            least the greater part of them, without any participation <lb/>
            of the other motions, for it is not necessary that what is <lb/>
            passively moved should be either increased or diminished. <lb/>
            Wherefore, alteration will differ from the other motions, since <lb/>
            I st, By no in­ <lb/>
            crease or dimi­ <lb/>
            nution neces­ <lb/>

            change taking <lb/>
            place in <lb/>
            quality. <lb/>
            if it were the same, it would be necessary that <lb/>
            what is altered, be forthwith increased or dimin­ <lb/>
            ished, or follow some of the other motions, but <lb/>
            this is not necessary. Similarly, also, what is in­ <lb/>
            creased or moved with any other motion, ought <lb/>
            to be altered (in quality); but some things are <lb/>
            increased which are not so altered, as a square <lb/>
            is increased when a gnomon3 is placed about it, but it has <note type="footnote"> 1 The office of Logic being to guard against ambiguity in the use of <lb/>
            terms; it is clear that by nominal division alone, species from the same <lb/>
            genus will often have a subordinate opposition, as antagonistic in its na­ <lb/>
            ture, as opposite genera; for example, purple, yellow, etc., under colour. <lb/>
            Boethius uses division in three senses: 1. Of a genus into species. 2. Of <lb/>
            a whole into its parts. 3. Of an equivocal term into its several significa­ <lb/>

          <p>Nevertheless simply, rest is contrary to motion, <lb/>

            specific contra­ <lb/>
            riety to motion. <lb/>
            in place to change in place; but change to a contrary place <lb/>
            seems especially opposed, as ascent to descent, downwards to <lb/>
            upwards. Still it is not easy, to define the contrary to the re­ <lb/>
            mainder of these specified motions, but it seems to have no <lb/>
            contrary, unless some one should oppose to this, rest according <lb/>
            to quality, or change of quality into its contrary, just as in <lb/>
            change of place, rest according to place, or change to a contrary <lb/>
            place. For alteration is the mutation of quality, so that to mo­ <lb/>
            tion according to quality, will rest according to quality, or <lb/>
            change to the contrary of the quality, be opposed; thus becoming <lb/>
            white is opposed to becoming black, since a change in quality <lb/>
            occurs, there being an alteration of quality into contraries.</p>

            So highly is it esteemed by Ammonius, (in librum Arts. de Int., Venet. <lb/>
            1545,) that he states his gratitude to the god Hermes if he shall be able <lb/>

            enunciative of the gnostic powers of the soul; it may therefore, we <lb/>

            wherein something is added to the predicate, making in fact a fourth <lb/>

            time, besides something else, as for instance, "health" is a <lb/>
            noun, but "is well" is a verb ; for it signifies, besides being <lb/>
            well, that such is the case now: it is always also significant <lb/>
            of things asserted of something else, as of those which are <lb/>

          <p>Nevertheless I do not call, "is not well," and, "is <lb/>

            it is similarly inherent both in whatever does, and <lb/>
            does not exist.1 So also "was well" or "will be well" are <lb/>
            not verbs, but they are cases of a verb, and differ from a verb, <lb/>

          <p>1. Divisions of <lb/>
            the enunciative <lb/>
            sentence—<foreign xml:lang="grc">λό­ <lb/>

          <p>ONE first enunciative sentence2 is affirmation; <lb/>
            afterwards negation, and all the rest are one by <lb/>
            conjunction. It is necessary however that every <lb/>
            enunciative sentence should be from a verb, or <lb/>
            from the case of a verb, for the definition of “man, unless <lb/>
            " is," or " was," or " will be," or something of this kind, bo <lb/>
            added, is not yet an enunciative sentence. Why indeed is the <lb/>
            sentence “ a terrestrial biped animal" one thing, and not many <lb/>
            things ? for it will not be one, because it is consecutively pro­ <lb/>
            nounced : this however belongs to another discussion.3 One <lb/>
            enunciative sentence, moreover, is either that which signifies <lb/>
            2. Simple or <lb/>
            composite. <lb/>
            one things or which is one by conjunction,5 and <lb/>
            many (such sentences) are either those which sig­ <lb/>
            nify many things6 and not one thing, or which <lb/>
            are without conjunction.7 Let therefore a noun or a verb be <lb/>
            only a word, since we cannot say that he enunciates who thus <note type="footnote"> 1 Cum disseramus de oratione cujus variæ species sunt-est una inter <lb/>

            universally enunciates of an universal, that something is or is <lb/>
            not inherent, these enunciations will be contrary:1 <lb/>
            I mean universally enunciates of an universal, as <lb/>
            that "every man is white," "no man is white." <lb/>
            When on the other hand he enunciates of univer- <lb/>

            contrariety— <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐναντίαι αὶ <lb/>
            ἀποφάνσεις</foreign>. <lb/>
            sals, not universally,2 these are not contraries, though the <lb/>
            things signified may sometimes be contrary ; but I mean by not <lb/>
            universally enunciating of universals, as that " man is white," <lb/>
            "man is not white for man being universal, is not employed <lb/>
            as an universal in the enunciation, since the word " every" <lb/>
            does not signify the universal, but (shows that the subject is) uni­ <lb/>
            versally (taken). Now to predicate universally of what is univer­ <lb/>
            sally predicated is not true, for no affirmation will be true in which <lb/>
            the universal is predicated of an universal predicate,3 as for in­ <lb/>
            stance, " every man " is " every animal." Where­ <lb/>

            " not every man is white,” "no man is white," "some man is <lb/>
            white." But contrarily is between universal affirmative and uni­ <lb/>
            versal negative, as " every man is white," " no man is white," <lb/>
            “ every mail is just," " no man is just." 4 Wherefore it is impossi­ <note type="footnote"> p. 46. When a singular term is the predicate, it must of course be co- <lb/>
            extensive with its subject. On the above chapter compare Whately, <lb/>
            book ii. 2, 3, and Hill, 9, et seq.: in fact, a slight acquaintance even <lb/>
            with Aldrich's Logic will suffice to place the principle of opposition, <lb/>
            as copied here, clearly before the reader; for mere simplification we <lb/>
            have annexed the usual scheme of opposition. </note><note type="footnote"> I That is, adds the universal mark, or sign, " every " or “ none." It <lb/>
            should be recollected also, as Taylor observes here, " that contraries may <lb/>
            at one and the same time be absent from a subject, but they cannot at <lb/>
            one and the same time be inherent in it;" this Aristotle indeed points <lb/>
            out in this chapter. (2) “ Not universally, i. e. does not add the universal <lb/>
            mark "-he adds, " the things signified may be contraries, that is to say, <lb/>
            the mental conceptions may be, whilst the enunciations are still indefi­ <lb/>
            nite. The extent of the indefinite is regulated by the matter of the pro­ <lb/>
            position, and is universal in necessary and impossible matter." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For example, to say, every man is every animal, is false, unless man is <lb/>
            horse, ox, etc.; or to say every man is every visible thing will be false, be­ <lb/>

            their opposites <lb/>
            may. <lb/>
            ble that these should at one and the same time be <lb/>
            true, but the opposites to these may sometimes pos­ <lb/>
            sibly be co-verified about the same thing, as that <lb/>
            " not every man is white," and "some man is white.”1 <lb/>
            Of such contradictions then of universals, as are <lb/>
            universally made, one must necessarily be true or <lb/>
            false, and also such as are of singulars, as " Socrates is <lb/>
            white," " Socrates is not white;" but of such contradictions <lb/>
            as are indeed of universals, yet are not universally made, one <lb/>
            is not always true, but the other false. For at one and the <lb/>
            same time we may truly say that " man is white," and that <lb/>
            “ man is not white," and " man is handsome," and " man is <lb/>
            not handsome," for if he is deformed he is not handsome, <lb/>
            and if any thing is becoming to be, it is, not. This how­ <lb/>
            ever may at once appear absurd, because the assertion " man <lb/>
            is not white," seems at the same time to signify the same <lb/>
            thing, as “ no man is white," but it neither necessarily signi­ <lb/>
            fies the same thing, nor at the same time.2</p>

            tion incident</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding it is evident that of one a- <lb/>
            firmation there is one negation, for it is necessary <note type="footnote"> firmatives are true, negatives false, in impossible matter negatives true, <lb/>
            affirmatives false, in contingent matter both false. Properly speaking, it <lb/>
            is contrary to the very nature of logical inquiry to admit any reference <lb/>
            whatever to the understood matter of proposition, of which Logic can take <lb/>
            no cognizance, its province being, to establish argument when necessarily <lb/>
            deducible from propositions placed in a certain connexion. From the <lb/>
            truth of the universal or the falsehood of the singular we infer the accidental <lb/>
            quality ef all the opposed propositions ; but from the falsehood of an uni. <lb/>
            versal or truth of a singular, we only know the quality of the contradictory. </note><note type="footnote"> I He means " singular sub-contraries," which contradict the universals <lb/>
            mutually contrary to each other, hence are co-verified in the same thing, <lb/>

            contrary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπεναντίως</foreign>) is not used by Aristotle, though he admits the op­ <lb/>
            position above; he calls it in Anal. Prior, ii. 15, an opposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν <lb/>

          <p>1. What con­ <lb/>
            stitutes single <lb/>
            affirmation and <lb/>
            negation, is the <lb/>
            unity of the <lb/>
            subject, and of <lb/>
            the predicate, <lb/>
            without equi­ <lb/>
            vocation.</p>
          <p>THE affirmation and negation are one, which indi­ <lb/>
            cate one thing of one, either of an universal, being <lb/>
            taken universally, or in like manner if it is not, as <lb/>
            "every man is white," " not every man is white," <lb/>
            " man is white," "man is not white,” "no man is <lb/>
            white," " some man is white," if that which is <lb/>
            white signifies one thing. But if one name be <lb/>
            given to two things, from which one thing does not arise, there <lb/>
            is not one affirmation nor one negation;2 as if any one gave <lb/>
            the name garment" to a "horse," and to "a man;" that <lb/>
            " the garment is white," this will not be one affirmation, nor <lb/>
            one negation, since it in no respect differs from saying it man " <lb/>
            and "horse" are "white," and this is equivalent to "man is <lb/>
            white," and “ horse is white." If therefore these signify many <lb/>
            things, and are many, it is evident that the first enunciation <lb/>
            either signifies many things or nothing,3 for " some man is not <lb/>
            a horse," wherefore neither in these is it necessary that one <lb/>
            should be a true, but the other a false contradiction.4</p>

            to singulars and futures, this is not the case. For if every <lb/>
            affirmation or negation be true or false, it is also necessary <lb/>
            that every thing should exist or should not exist, for if one <lb/>
            man says that a thing will be, but another denies the same, <lb/>
            one of them must evidently of necessity speak truth, if every <lb/>
            affirmation or negation be true or false, for both will not <lb/>
            subsist in such things at one and the same time. Thus if <lb/>
            it is true to say that " a thing is white," or that " it is not <lb/>
            white," it must of necessity be "white" or not "white," and <lb/>
            if it is white or not white, it was true to affirm or to deny it : <lb/>
            also if it is not, it is falsely said to be, and if it is falsely <lb/>
            said to be, it is not; so that it is necessary that either <lb/>
            the affirmation or the negation should be true or false. In­ <lb/>
            deed there is nothing which either is, or is gene­ <lb/>
            rated fortuitously, nor casually, nor will be, or <lb/>
            not be, but all things are from necessity, and not <lb/>
            casually, for either he who affirms speaks truth, <lb/>
            or he who denies, for in like manner it might <lb/>

            is well observed by Ammonius, that the observations here made by Aristo­ <lb/>
            tle " are conversant not only with logic, but with every part of philosophy." <lb/>
            Not all things are assumed to exist from necessity, but some are supposed <lb/>
            to be in our own power; this constitutes the doctrine of moral responsibi­ <lb/>

            trine of necessity as authorizing his " affections and antipathies " to become <lb/>
            " the laws ruling his moral state," (Vide Shelley's Queen Mab,) forgetful of <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[CHAP. IX.</note><lb/>
            was true to say before that it will be “white,” so that it <lb/>
            was always true to say of any thing generated that it <lb/>
            either is, or that it will be; but if it was always true to <lb/>
            say that it is, or will be, it is impossible that this is not, <lb/>
            nor should be; and whatever must of necessity be, it is <lb/>
            impossible that it should not have been generated, and what <lb/>
            it is impossible should not have been generated must of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity have been generated; wherefore all things that will <lb/>
            be, it is necessary should be generated, and hence there will <lb/>
            be nothing casual nor fortuitous, for if it were fortuitous it <lb/>
            would not be of necessity. Nor is it possible to say, that <lb/>
            neither of them is true, as that it will neither be, nor will not <lb/>
            be, for in the first place the affirmation being false, the nega- <lb/>

            tion will not be true, and this being false, it re­ <lb/>
            sults that the affirmation is not true. And besides, <lb/>
            if it were true to say that a thing is at the same <lb/>
            time " white " and it great," both must of necessity be, but if <lb/>
            it shall be to-morrow, it must necessarily be to-morrow, and if <lb/>
            it will neither be nor will not be to-morrow, it will not be a <lb/>

            surdity follows <lb/>
            from denying <lb/>
            the casual.</p>
          <p>These and similar absurdities then will hap­ <lb/>
            pen, if of every affirmation and negation, whether <lb/>
            in respect of universals enunciated universally, or <lb/>
            of singulars, it is necessary that one of the op­ <lb/>
            posites be true and the other false, but that nothing happens <lb/>
            casually in those things which subsist, but that all are, and <lb/>
            are generated of necessity; so that it will neither be necessary <lb/>
            to deliberate nor to trouble ourselves, as if we shall do this <lb/>
            thing, something definite will occur, but if we do not, it will <lb/>
            not occur. For there is nothing to prevent a person for ten <lb/>
            thousand years asserting that this will happen, and another <lb/>
            person denying it, so that of necessity it will have been then <lb/>
            true to assert either of them. And it makes no difference <lb/>
            whether any persons have uttered a contradiction or not, for <note type="footnote"> Aristotle traces here the institution of a word to the primary concept of <lb/>
            the thing, so that if affirmation is true, a thing is, if negation is true, a <lb/>
            thing is not. If either be true or false, he who affirms or denies says truly <lb/>
            or falsely, so that if affirmative be true or false, a thing must necessarily <lb/>
            exist or not exist. He alleges two enthymematic proofs, terminating in a <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. IX.]</note><lb/>
            it is evident that the things are so, although the one should <lb/>
            not have affirmed any thing, or the other have denied it, since <lb/>
            it is not, because it has been affirmed or denied, that therefore <lb/>
            a tiling will or will not be, neither will it be more so for ten <lb/>
            thousand years than for any time whatever. Hence if a <lb/>
            thing so subsisted in every time that one of these is truly <lb/>
            asserted of it, it was necessary that this should take place; <lb/>
            and each thing generated, always so subsisted, as to have been <lb/>
            generated from necessity, for when any one truly said that it <lb/>
            will be, it was not possible not to have been generated, and of <lb/>
            that which is generated, it was always true to say that it will be.</p>

            we see that there is a beginning of future <lb/>

            there is equally a power of being and of not being, in <lb/>
            which both to be and not to be occurs, as well as to have been <lb/>

            a power of this kind—) then it is evident that all things <lb/>
            neither are, nor are generated of necessity, but <lb/>
            that some things subsist casually, and that their <lb/>
            affirmation is not more true than their negation, and <lb/>
            that there are others in which one of these subsists <lb/>

            is the same reasonii g also in the case of contra­ <lb/>

            thing, also that it shall, or shall not be, yet it is not <lb/>
            requisite to speak of each separately, but I Fay, <lb/>
            for instance, that it is necessary for a naval action <lb/>
            to occur or not occur to-morrow, yet it is not <lb/>
            necessary that there should be a naval action to-morrow, nor <lb/>
            that there should not be; it is necessary, however, that it <lb/>
            should either be or not be. Wherefore, since assertions and <lb/>
            things are similarly true, it is evident that things which so <lb/>
            subsist, as that whatever have happened, the contraries also <lb/>
            were possible, it is necessary that contradiction should subsist <lb/>
            in the same manner, which happens to those things which are <lb/>
            not always, or which not always, are not.. For of these, one <lb/>
            part of the contradiction must necessarily be true or false, not <lb/>
            indeed this or that, but just as it may happen, and one must <lb/>
            be the rather true, yet not already true nor false;1 so that it <lb/>

          <p>SINCE affirmation signifies something of something, and this <lb/>
            is either a noun, or anonymous,2 (i. e. indefinite but what is <lb/>
            in affirmation must be one and of one thing,3 all <lb/>
            affirmation and negation will be either from a <lb/>
            noun and a verb, or from an indefinite noun and <lb/>

            enunciation. <lb/>
            verb. (But what a noun is, and what the anonymous, has been <lb/>
            shown before, for I do not reckon " not man " a noun, but an <lb/>
            indefinite noun, for an indefinite noun signifies in a certain <lb/>
            respect one thing, just as "is not well” is not a verb, but an <lb/>
            indefinite verb.) Still without a verb there is <lb/>
            neither an affirmation nor negation, for " is," or <lb/>
            Cf. ch 2, and 3. <lb/>
            "will be," or "was," or "is going to be," and so forth, are <lb/>
            verbs, from what has been already laid down, since in <lb/>
            addition to something else they signify time. Hence the <lb/>
            first affirmation and negation (will be), "man is," "man is <lb/>
            not," afterwards " non-man is," " non-man is not." Again, <lb/>
            “ every man is," " every man is not," " every non-man is," <lb/>
            "every non-man is not," and the same reasoning holds in <lb/>
            times beyond (the present).4 But when " is," is additionally <note type="footnote"> 1 This is called oppositio tertii adjacentis, and a proposition is so de­ <lb/>

            however, what is said from the under-written <lb/>
            examples: 3 “A man is just," the negation of this is, " a man <lb/>
            is not just ;” “he is not a just man," the negative of this is, " he <lb/>
            is not not a just man," for here the word "is," and "is not," <lb/>
            will be added to the "just" and the “not just," wherefore <lb/>

            these things, as we have shown in the Analytics, <lb/>

            if the affirmation be of a noun taken universally,4 <lb/>

              But the other two (are opposed) in respect to <lb/>

              4. Others witl <lb/>
              an indefinite <lb/>

              "non-man is just, "non-man is not just, "the non-just is <lb/>
              not man," "the not non-just is not man:" there are not, <lb/>
              however, more oppositions than these, _but these without <lb/>
              those, will be by themselves, as using the noun, " non-man." <lb/>
              In those, however, wherein, “ is," is not adapted,-as in " he <lb/>
              enjoys health," and " he walks,”—here it produces the same <lb/>
              when thus placed, as if "is" were added; as " every man <lb/>
              enjoys health," “ every man does not enjoy health," " every <lb/>
              non-man enjoys health," "every non-man does not enjoy <lb/>
              health." For it must not be said, " not every man," but the <lb/>
              negation, "not," must be added to " man;" for "every" does <lb/>
              not signify universal, but that (the thing is taken) universally.1 <lb/>
              This is hpwever evident, from " a man enjoys health," “ a man <lb/>
              does not enjoy health," “ non-man is well," " non-man is not <lb/>
              well," these differ from those, in not being universally (taken).2 <lb/>
              Hence “every,” or "no one," signifies nothing else, than that <lb/>
              affirmation or negation is of a noun universally (assumed); <lb/>
              wherefore it is necessary to add other things of the same kind.3</p>
          <p>But because the contrary negation to this, "every animal <lb/>
            is just," is that which signifies that "no animal is just," it <lb/>
            is evident that these will never be either true at the same <lb/>
            time, nor in respect to the same subject, but the opposites to <lb/>
            these will sometimes be so, as "not every animal is just," <lb/>
            and "some animal is just.”4 But these follow; <lb/>
            the one, "no man is just," follows every man <lb/>
            5. Consequence <lb/>
            of the negative <note type="footnote"> opposite enunciations may be true. Contraries are both false in contin­ <lb/>

            follows “ not every man is not just," for it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that some man should be just. In the case <lb/>
            also of singulars, it is evident that if a man being questioned <lb/>
            denies truly, he asserts also truly, as, "Is Socrates wise? <lb/>
            No!" Socrates therefore is not a wise man. But in the case <lb/>
            of universals, what is similarly asserted is not true, but the <lb/>
            negation is true, as, “ Is every man wise ? No!” Every man <unclear/><lb/>

            " not every man then is wise," is true, and this is <lb/>
            opposite, but that is contrary.</p>
          <p>Opposites, however, as to indefinite nouns and verbs, as "non- <lb/>
            man" and "non-just," may seem to be negations without a noun <lb/>
            and verb, but they are not so, for the negation must always of <lb/>
            necessity be either true or false, but he who says “ non-man " <lb/>
            does not speak more truly or falsely, but rather less, than he who <lb/>

            the opposite to this, namely, " not every non-mar. <lb/>

          <p>Nouns and verbs indeed, when transposed, have the same sig­ <lb/>
            nification, as, " he is a white man," “ he is a man white," for <lb/>
            unless it be so, there will be many negations of the same thing, <lb/>
            but it has been shown that there is one of one; of this, " he <lb/>
            is a white man," there is the negation " he is not a white man," <lb/>
            and of the other, " he is a man white," (except this be the <lb/>
            same with “ he is a white man,") the negation will either be <lb/>

            “man” and “white” are truly predicated of a <lb/>

            "is white," the whole conjointly "is white," wherefore, it <lb/>
            will be " a man white, white," even to infinity; again, " a <lb/>
            musician white walking," and these frequently involved to <lb/>
            infinity. Once more, if " Socrates" is " Socrates" and " man," <lb/>
            " Socrates" is also " Socrates man," and if he is "man" and <lb/>

            ther are such things which are inherent in another (to be <lb/>
            added), hence, neither is " whiteness" (to be predicated) <lb/>
            repeatedly, nor is "a man" "a man animal," nor (a man) <lb/>
            " biped," since both animal and biped are inherent in man; <lb/>
            still it is true to assert it singly of some one, as that “ a cer­ <lb/>
            tain man is a man," or that " a certain white man is a white <lb/>
            man,” but this is not the case always. But when some op­ <lb/>
            position is in the adjunct which a contradiction follows, it is <lb/>
            not true, but false, as to call a dead man a man, but when <lb/>
            such is not inherent, it is true. Or when something (contra­ <lb/>
            dictory) is inherent, it is always not true; but when it is not <lb/>
            inherent, it is not always true, as " Homer" is something, "a <lb/>
            poet," for instance, "is" he therefore, or " is he not? for <lb/>
            “is” is predicated of Homer accidentally, since is" is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of Homer because he is a poet, but not per se (or essen­ <lb/>
            tially). Wherefore, in whatever categories, contrariety is not <lb/>
            inherent, if definitions are asserted instead of nouns, and are <lb/>
            essentially predicated, and not accidentally, of these a parti­ <lb/>
            cular thing may be truly and singly asserted ; but non-being, <lb/>
            because it is a matter of opinion, cannot truly be called a <lb/>
            certain being, for the opinion of it is, not that it is, but that <lb/>

            and the like. <note type="footnote"> I Aristotle here enumerates four modes, but in Anal. Prior, i. 2, they <lb/>
            are reduced to two, the necessary and contingent. See St. Hilaire's <lb/>
            Translation. The Greek commentators have multiplied the modes, by <lb/>
            allowing, any adverb, added to the predicate, or adjective qualifying the <lb/>
            subject to constitute a modal. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρόπος</foreign> as applied to the modes</note> <lb/>

            non-contingent, and of the impossible and necessary, since this <lb/>
            has some doubtful points. For if among the complex, those <lb/>
            contradictions are mutually opposed, which are arranged ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the verb “ to be," and “ not to be," (as for instance <lb/>
            the negation “to be a man," is “not to be man," not this, <lb/>
            " to be not a man," and the negation of " to be a white man " <lb/>
            is " not to be a white man," and not this " to be not a white <lb/>
            man," since if affirmation or negation be true of every thing, it <lb/>
            will be true to say " that wood is not a white man,”)—if this be <lb/>
            so, in those things to which the verb " to be " is not added, <lb/>
            that which is asserted instead of the verb " to be," will pro­ <lb/>
            duce the same thing. For example, the negation of " a man <lb/>
            walks," will not be " non-man walks," but, “ a man does not <lb/>
            walk," for there is no difference in saying that " a man walks," <lb/>
            or that " a man is walking," so that if this is every where the <lb/>
            case, the negation of " it is possible to be," will be “ it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible not to be," and not "it is not possible to be." But it <lb/>
            appears that it is possible for the same thing both to be, and <lb/>
            not to be, for every thing which may possibly be cut, or may <lb/>
            possibly walk, may also possibly not be cut, and not walk, and <lb/>
            2. The possible­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἀεὶ ὲνεργει</foreign>. <lb/>
            the reason is that every thing which is thus pos­ <lb/>
            sible, does not always energize,1 so that negation <lb/>
            will also belong to it, for that which is capable <lb/>
            of walking, may not walk, and the visible may not be seen. <lb/>
            Still however it is impossible that opposite affirmations and <lb/>
            negations should be true of the same thing, wherefore the ne­ <note type="footnote"> of propositions and of syllogisms, comes from the Greek commentators <lb/>
            but is not Aristotelian. (Ammonius Schol. p. 130, a. 16.) The ad <lb/>
            mission of modals into Logic, has been strongly advocated and opposed; <lb/>
            the determination of the implied matter of a pure proposition is extra- <lb/>
            logical of course, but respecting the expressed matter of a modal, the <lb/>
            reader will find some valuable remarks in Mansel's Logic. The authorities <lb/>
            are, on one side of the question Sir W. Hamilton, on the other Kant <lb/>
            and St. Hilaire. A modal is reducible to a pure categorical, by uniting <lb/>
            the modal word to the predicate, or to the subject when the mode only <lb/>
            expresses the nature of the matter of the proposition, e. g. a fish neces­ <lb/>
            sarily lives in the water, i. e. all fish live in the water. Though the man­ <lb/>
            ner of connexion between the extremes is expressed in a modal, yet it <lb/>
            does not thereby test the quantity of the proposition, as there are uni­ <lb/>
            versals and particulars in each mode. On the distinction of propositional <lb/>
            matter, see Sir. W. Hamilton, Ed. Rev. No. 115, p. 217. Also the com­ <lb/>
            mentary of Ammonius, de Int. 7, (Scholia, p. 115, a. 14). </note><note type="footnote"> I " Non semper in actu est.” Averrois. Cf. Metap. lib. ii. 4, and books <lb/>

            gallon of " it is possible to be," is not “it is possible not to <lb/>
            be." Now it results from this that we either at the same <lb/>
            time affirm and deny the same thing of the same, or that the <lb/>
            affirmations and negations are not made according to the ad­ <lb/>
            ditions, " to be or “ not to be ;1" if therefore, that, be im­ <lb/>
            possible, this, will be to be taken, wherefore the negation of <lb/>
            " it is possible to be, is " it is not possible to be, <lb/>
            (but* not it is possible not to be). Now there is <lb/>
            the same reasoning also about the being contingent, <lb/>
            * Omitted by <lb/>
            Bekker. <lb/>
            for the negation of this is, not to be contingent, and in like <lb/>
            manner as to the rest, for example the necessary and impossible, <lb/>
            since as in those it happens that, “ to be," and, " not to be," are <lb/>
            additions, but " whiteness " and “ man " are subjects, so here <lb/>
            “ to be " and " not to be," become as subjects, but " to be possi­ <lb/>
            ble," and " to be contingent," are additions which determine the <lb/>
            true and false in the (enunciations) "to be possible" and "to <lb/>
            be not possible," similarly as in those, " to be," and " not to be." 2 <lb/>
            But of " it is possible not to be," the negation is not, " it is not <lb/>
            possible to be," but " it is not possible not to be," and of " it is <lb/>
            possible to be," the negation is not, "it is possible not to be," but, <lb/>
            " it is not possible to be ;" wherefore, "it is possible to be," and, <lb/>
            "it is possible not to be," will appear to follow each other; for it <lb/>
            is the same thing, “ to be possible to be," and " not to be," since <lb/>
            such things are not contradictories of each other, namely, “ it is <lb/>
            possible to be," and, " it is possible not to be." But " it is pos- <note type="footnote"> 1 Sequitur enim hinc aut idem vere simul affirmari et negari de eodem <lb/>

            that the impossible being enunciated contrarily to the ne­ <lb/>

            these (do so) in a contrary mode,2 since the necessary and the <lb/>

            Buhle and <lb/>
            Averrois omit <lb/>
            the question. <lb/>
            vice versa. Or is it impossible that the contra­ <lb/>
            dictories of the necessary should be thus disposed ? <lb/>
            for, what, "is necessary to be" is "possible to <lb/>
            be, since if not, negation would follow, as it is necessary either <lb/>
            to affirm or deny, so that, if it is not possible to be, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to be, wherefore it would be impossible for that to <lb/>
            be, which necessarily is, which is absurd, but the enunciation, <lb/>
            "it is not impossible to be" follows the other, "it is possible <lb/>
            to be," which again is followed by, " it is not necessary to <lb/>
            be," whence it happens that what necessarily exists does not <lb/>
            necessarily exist, which is absurd. But again neither does, <lb/>
            "it is necessary to be" follow “it is possible to be," nor <lb/>
            does the proposition, " it is necessary not to be," for to that, <lb/>
            both, may occur, but whichever of these is true,1 those2 will <lb/>
            be no longer true, for at one and the same time, it is possible <lb/>
            to be, and not to be, but if it is necessary either to be or not <lb/>
            to be, both, will not be possible. It remains therefore, that <lb/>
            " it is not necessary not to be," follows " it is possible to be ;" <lb/>
            for this3 is also true in respect of what is necessary to be, <lb/>
            since this becomes the contradiction of that proposition which <lb/>
            follows, viz. "it is not possible to be;" as “it is impossible <lb/>

            negation is, " it is not necessary not to be." Wherefore these <lb/>
            contradictions follow according to the above-mentioned mode, <lb/>
            and nothing absurd results, when they are thus disposed.4</p>

            between ration­ <lb/>

          <p>Still it may be doubted whether " it is possible <lb/>
            to be," follows “ it is necessary to be," for if it <lb/>
            does not follow, the contradiction will be conse­ <lb/>
            quent, namely, " it is not possible to be," and if a <lb/>
            man should deny this to be a contradiction, it will <lb/>
            be necessary to call, " it is possible not to be," a <lb/>
            contradiction, both which are false in respect of necessary <lb/>
            matter. Nay, on the contrary, it appears to be possible that the <lb/>
            same thing should " be cut" and " not be cut," should " be" and <lb/>
            "not be," so that what necessarily "is," may happen "not to be," <lb/>
            which is false. Nevertheless it is evident that not every thing <lb/>
            which can " be," and can " walk," is capable also of the op­ <lb/>

            in those things which are potent irrationally,1 as <lb/>
            fire is calorific, and has irrational power; rational <lb/>
            powers then are those of many things, and of <lb/>
            a! <foreign xml:lang="grc">νετὰ</foreign> <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμαις</foreign>. <lb/>
            the contraries ; but not all irrational powers, for, as we <lb/>
            have said, fire cannot heat, and not heat, nor such other <lb/>
            things as always energize. Yet even some irrational powers <lb/>
            can at the same time receive opposites; but this has been <lb/>
            stated by us, because not every power is susceptible of con­ <lb/>
            traries, not even such as are predicated, according to the <lb/>
            same species. Moreover, some powers are equivocal, for the <lb/>
            possible is not predicated, simply; but one thing is (called so), <lb/>
            because it is true, as being in an energy, as it is possible for a <lb/>
            man to walk, because he walks, and in short, a thing is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to be, because that is already in energy which is said to <lb/>
            be possible; on the other hand, another thing (is said to be <lb/>
            possible), because it may be in energy; as it is possible to <lb/>
            walk, because a man may walk. Now this power exists in <lb/>
            movable natures only, but that in immovable; but with re­ <lb/>
            spect to both, it is true to say, that it is not impossible to <lb/>
            walk or to be, and that a man is now walking and energizing, <lb/>
            and has the power to walk, hence it is not true2 to predicate <lb/>
            that which is thus possible, in respect of necessary matter, <lb/>
            simply, but the other is true. Wherefore since the universal <lb/>
            follows the particular, to be able to be, but not all ability, fol­ <lb/>
            lows that which is of necessity, and indeed the <lb/>
            necessary and the non-necessary may perhaps be <lb/>

            from irrational subjects, hence they are, in a sense, unsusceptible of con­ <lb/>

            The learned note of Ammonius, too long to insert, tends to show no <lb/>
            more than what can be gleaned by the student from a reference to the <lb/>
            places quoted, namely, that with Aristotle, energy is prior to capacity, <lb/>
            and that the necessary being invariably the same in subsistence, can only <lb/>
            be predicated of things which are always in energy: this conclusion <lb/>
            being syllogistically educed, he proceeds to evolve the contingents and <lb/>
            consequences, placing form in energy, matter in capacity. In the Meta. <lb/>
            12th book, he calls the gods -essences in energy. Composites are those <lb/>
            which participate of matter, and either may or may not retain form : thus <lb/>
            beings are, first, energies simple and immutable, next, those which are <lb/>
            mutable, yet connected with energy, others, which precede energy as to <lb/>
            time, but do not always obtain it, lastly, others which subsist as to capa­ <lb/>

            contrariety cor­ <lb/>

            the contrariety <lb/>
            of opinion. <lb/>
            the intellect, but there the opinion of a contrary is contrary, <lb/>
            as for instance, that "every man is just," is contrary to, <lb/>
            “ every man is unjust," it is necessary that affirmations also <lb/>
            in the voice should subsist in the same manner, but if there, <lb/>
            the opinion of a contrary be not contrary, neither will affirm­ <lb/>
            ation be contrary to affirmation, but the before-named ne­ <lb/>
            gation. Hence it must be considered what false opinion is <lb/>
            contrary to the true opinion, whether that of negation or that <lb/>
            which opines it to be the contrary. I mean in this way, <lb/>
            there is a certain true opinion of good that it is good, but an­ <lb/>
            other false opinion that it is not good, lastly, a third, that it is <lb/>
            evil, which of these therefore is contrary to the true opinion ? <lb/>
            and if there is one, according to which is it contrary ? If then <lb/>
            a man should fancy contrary opinions to be defined by this, <lb/>
            that they are of contraries, it would be erroneous, for of good <lb/>
            that it is good, and of evil that it is evil, there is perhaps the <lb/>
            same opinion, and it is true whether there be many (opinions) <lb/>
            or one : but these are contraries, yet not from their being of <lb/>
            contraries are they contraries, but rather from their subsist­ <lb/>
            ing in a contrary manner.2 If then there is an opinion of good <lb/>
            that it is good, but another that it is not good, and there is <lb/>
            also something else, which is neither inherent, nor can be, <lb/>

            the opinion is more true and false which is essential, if the <lb/>
            true (be assumed)—the opinion that good is not good, is <lb/>
            false in respect of that which is essentially inherent, but <lb/>
            the opinion that it is evil is false of that which is from acci­ <lb/>
            dent, so that the opinion of the negation of good would be <lb/>
            more false than the opinion of the contrary. He is however <lb/>
            especially deceived about every thing who holds a contrary <lb/>
            opinion, for contraries belong to things which are the most <lb/>
            diverse about the same thing. If then one of these is con­ <lb/>
            trary, but the opinion of the negation is more contrary, it <lb/>
            is evident that this itself will be (truly) contrary; but the <lb/>
            opinion that the good is evil is complex, for it is necessary <lb/>
            perhaps, that the same man should suppose (good) not good. <lb/>
            Once more, if it is requisite for the like to occur in other things, <lb/>
            it may seem to have been well said in this case also; for the <lb/>
            (opposition) of negation is either every where or no where; <lb/>
            but whatever things have no contraries, of these, the opposite <lb/>
            to the true opinion is false, as he is mistaken who fancies “ a <lb/>
            man " " not a man," if then these (negations) are contrary the <lb/>
            other (opinions) also, of negation, are. Besides, it is the same <lb/>
            as to the opinion of good that it is good, and of what is not <lb/>
            good, that it is not good; and also the opinion of good, that it <lb/>
            is not good, and of what is not good that it is good; to the <lb/>
            opinion then of the not good that it is not good, which is true, <lb/>
            2. Nature of <lb/>
            contrariety be­ <lb/>
            tween affirma­ <lb/>
            tion and nega­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            what will be the contrary? Certainly not that <lb/>
            which says that it is evil, since it may at one <lb/>
            and the same time be true; but truth is never <lb/>
            contrary to truth, for whatever is not good is evil, <lb/>
            so that it will happen that these opinions, shall be at one and <lb/>
            the same time, true. Nor again will that (opinion) that it is not <note type="footnote"> I This parenthesis is omitted by Taylor. I follow the reading of Buhle <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIV.]</note><lb/>
            evil, be ( the contrary), for that is also true, and these may exist <lb/>
            at the same time, wherefore (the opinion) of what is not good, <lb/>
            that it is good, remains as a contrary to the opinion of what is <lb/>
            not good, that it is not good, and this will be false, so that <lb/>
            the opinion of good that it is not good, will be the contrary <lb/>
            to that of what is good, that it is good. That there will be no <lb/>
            difference though we should propose universal affirmation is <lb/>
            evident, for universal negation will be the contrary; as for in­ <lb/>
            stance, to the opinion which supposes every thing good to be <lb/>
            good, that nothing of good things is good (will be the contrary <lb/>
            opinion), for the opinion of good that it is good, if good be <lb/>
            universal, is the same with that which opines that whatever <lb/>
            is good is good, and this differs in no respect from the opinion <lb/>
            that every thing which is good is good, and the like takes place <lb/>
            as to that which is not good. So that if this be the case in <lb/>
            opinion, and affirmations and negations in the voice are sym­ <lb/>
            bols of (conceptions) in the soul, it is clear that the universal <lb/>
            negation which is about the same thing, is contrary to affirm­ <lb/>
            ation. For instance, to " every thing good is good," or that <lb/>
            every man is good," (the negation is contrary,) that <lb/>
            “ nothing or no man is good;" but this, that " not every thing, <lb/>
            or not every man," (is good, is opposed) contradictorily. It <lb/>
            is however evident, that true opinion can neither possibly be <lb/>
            contrary to true opinion, nor true negation (to true negation), <lb/>
            for those are contraries which subsist about op­ <lb/>
            posites; but about the same things the same may <lb/>
            be verified, but contraries cannot possibly be in- <lb/>

          <p>1. Purport of <lb/>
            this treatise­ <lb/>
            the attainment <lb/>
            of demonstra­ <lb/>
            tive science.</p>
          <p>IT is first requisite to say what is the subject, <lb/>
            concerning which, and why, the present treatise <lb/>
            is undertaken, namely, that it is concerning de­ <lb/>
            monstration, and for the sake of demonstrative <lb/>
            science; we must afterwards define, what is a proposition, <lb/>
            what a term, and what a syllogism, also what kind of syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is perfect, and what imperfect; lastly, what it is for <lb/>
            a thing to be, or not to be, in a certain whole, and what <lb/>
            we say it is to be predicated of every thing, or of nothing <lb/>
            (of a class).</p>
          <p>2. Definition of <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότασις</foreign>) pro­ <lb/>
            position. It is <lb/>
            either, <lb/>

          <p>A proposition then is a sentence which affirms or <lb/>
            denies something of something,2 and this is uni­ <lb/>
            versal, or particular, or indefinite ; I denominate <lb/>
            universal, the being present3 with all or none; <lb/>
            particular, the being present with something, or <lb/>
            not with something, or not with every thing ; <lb/>
            but the indefinite the being present or not being <lb/>
            present, without the universal or particular (sign); as for <lb/>
            example, that there is the same science of contraries, or that <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle herein analyzes syllogism and demonstration into their prin­ <lb/>

            he denominates the former, " Concerning Syllogism," and the latter <lb/>
            " Concerning Demonstration." Upon the subject of title, compare St. <lb/>

            pleasure is not good. But a demonstrative <lb/>
            proposition differs from a dialectic in this, that <lb/>
            the demonstrative is an assumption of one part of <lb/>

            is not present with something. Wherefore a <lb/>
            syllogistic proposition will be simply an affirma­ <lb/>

              a term—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρος</foreign>. <lb/>
              what has now been determined by us may per­ <lb/>
              haps suffice. Again, I call that a " term," into <lb/>
              which a proposition is resolved, as for instance, <lb/>
              the predicate and that of which it is predicated, whether to be <lb/>

              or not to be is added or separated. Lastly, a <lb/>
              syllogism is a sentence in which certain things <lb/>
              being laid down, something else different from <lb/>
              the premises necessarily results, in consequence of their ex­ <lb/>
              istence.1 I say that, “in consequence of their existence," <lb/>
              something results through them, but though something happens <lb/>
              through them, there is no need of any external term in order <lb/>
              1. The latter <lb/>
              either perfect, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλειος</foreign>. or, <lb/>

              to the existence of the necessary (consequence). <lb/>
              Wherefore I call a perfect syllogism that which <lb/>
              requires nothing else, beyond (the premises) as­ <lb/>
              sumed, for the necessary (consequence) to appear: <lb/>
              but an imperfect syllogism, that which requires besides, one <lb/>
              or more things, which are necessary, through the supposed <lb/>
              terms, but have not been assumed through propositions.2 But <lb/>
              for one thing to be in the whole of another, and for one thing <lb/>
              to be predicated of the whole of another, are the same thing, <lb/>

          <p>SINCE every proposition is either of that which <lb/>
            is present (simply), or is present necessarily or <lb/>
            contingently, and of these some are affirmative, <lb/>

            some are universal, others particular, and others indefinite, it <lb/>
            is necessary that the universal negative proposition of what <lb/>
            is present should be converted in its terms; for instance, if <lb/>
            " no pleasure is good," " neither will any good be pleasure." <lb/>
            But an affirmative proposition we must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity convert not universally, but particularly,1 as <lb/>
            if “ all pleasure is good," it is also necessary that <lb/>
            2. A and I to <lb/>
            be converted <lb/>
            particularly. <lb/>
            " a certain good should be pleasure;" but of particular pro­ <lb/>
            positions, we must convert the affirmative proposition parti­ <lb/>
            cularly, since if " a certain pleasure is good," so also " will a <lb/>
            certain good be pleasure;” a negative proposition however <lb/>
            need not be thus converted, since it does not follow, <lb/>
            if " man " is not present with " a certain animal," <lb/>
            that animal also is not present with a certain man. <lb/>

            with any A, for if it should be present with some A, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample with C, it will not be true, that A is present with no <lb/>
            B, since C is something of B. If, again, A is pre­ <lb/>

            similar manner also if the proposition be particular, for if A <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's account of conversion differs from that of Aldrich, since he <lb/>

          <p>1. Rule for <lb/>
            modal conver­ <lb/>

            as for pure pro­ <lb/>
            posit ions. Ex­ <lb/>
            ample of the <lb/>
            necessary mo­ <lb/>
            dal.</p>
          <p>THE same system will hold good in necessary pro­ <lb/>
            positions, for an universal negative is universally <lb/>
            convertible, but either affirmative proposition par­ <lb/>
            ticularly ; for if it is necessary that A should be <lb/>
            present with no B, it is also necessary that B <lb/>
            should be present with no A, for if it should hap­ <lb/>
            pen to be present with any, A also might happen to be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with some B. But if A is of necessity present with <lb/>
            every or with some certain B, B is also necessarily present <lb/>
            with some certain A; for if it were not necessarily, neither <lb/>
            would A of necessity be present with some certain B: a <lb/>
            particular negative however is not converted, for the reason <lb/>
            we have before assigned.</p>
          <p>In contingent propositions, (since contingency is mul­ <lb/>
            tifariously predicated, for we call the necessary, and the not <lb/>
            necessary, and the possible, contingent,) in all affirmatives, <lb/>
            conversion will occur in a similar manner, for if A is con­ <lb/>
            tingent to every or to some certain B, B may also be con­ <lb/>
            tingent to some A; for if it were to none, neither would <lb/>
            (Vide ch. 2.) <lb/>
            A be to any B, for this has been shown before. <lb/>
            The like however does not occur in negative <lb/>
            propositions, but such things as are called contingent either <lb/>
            from their being necessarily not present, or from their being <lb/>
            not necessarily present, (are converted) similarly (with the <note type="footnote"> I Modality is not altogether excluded from Logic; but is admitted by <lb/>
            Aristotle, only when, being expressed in a proposition, it necessitates un­ <lb/>
            der certain conditions a corresponding modification of consequence. <lb/>
            Logic has nothing to do with deciding the truth or falsity of proposition, <lb/>
            per set necessarily or contingently; it only ascertains the necessary infer­ <lb/>
            ence of conclusion from premises according to certain canons. Vide <lb/>
            some admirable remarks by Sir W. Hamilton on this subject. Psellus <lb/>
            and Petrus Hispanus are both extra-logical in their consideration of <lb/>
            matter. </note> <pb n="85"/>

            contingent, for " a man,” not to be " a horse," <lb/>

            ment. For of these, the one, is necessarily not present, but <lb/>
            the other, is not necessarily, present; and the proposition is <lb/>
            similarly convertible, for if it be contingent to no " man " to <lb/>
            be " a horse," it also concurs with no " horse " to be " a man," <lb/>
            and if " whiteness " happens to no “garment," a " garment " <lb/>
            also happens to no “whiteness;" for if it did happen to any, <lb/>
            "whiteness" will also necessarily happen to "a certain gar­ <lb/>
            ment, and this has been shown before, and in <lb/>
            like manner with respect to the particular negative <lb/>
            proposition. But whatever things are called con­ <lb/>
            tingent as being for the most part and from their <lb/>
            nature, (after which manner we define the contin­ <lb/>

            a particular one is, this however will be evident when we speak <lb/>
            of the contingent. At present, in addition to what we have <lb/>
            said, let thus much be manifest, that to happen to nothing, or <lb/>
            not to be present with any thing, has an affirma­ <lb/>

            is not good," or, " it is not white," or in short, " it is not this <lb/>
            thing." This will however be shown in what follows, but <lb/>
            as regards conversions, these will coincide with the rest.</p>

          <p>THESE things being determined, let us now de­ <lb/>
            scribe by what, when, and how, every syllogism is <lb/>
            produced, and let us afterwards speak of demon­ <lb/>
            stration, for we must speak of syllogism prior to <lb/>

              middle, but the middle is in no last, there is not a syllogism <lb/>
              of the extremes, for nothing necessarily results from the ex­ <lb/>

              every, and with no extreme; so that neither a particular nor <lb/>
              universal (conclusion) necessarily results, and nothing neces­ <lb/>
              sary resulting, there will not be through these a syllogism. <lb/>
              Let the terms of being present universally, be "animal," "man," <lb/>
              " horse," and let the terms of being present with no one be <lb/>
              "animal," "man," "stone."* Since, then, neither <lb/>

              * Example (I.) <lb/>
              middle with any extreme, there will not thus be a syllogism. <lb/>
              Let the terms of being present, be " science,” “line" " medi­ <lb/>

              necessary that the terms should subsist, as we have said, and <lb/>
              that if they do thus subsist there will evidently be a syllogism <lb/>
              But if one of the terms be universal and the other particu <lb/>

              be present with some C, for what we mean by the being predi­ <lb/>
              cated of no one has been defined, so that there will be a perfect <lb/>
              syllogism. In like manner, if B, C, being affirm­ <lb/>
              ative, be indefinite, for there will be the same syl­ <lb/>
              logism, both of the indefinite, and of that which <lb/>

            affirms or denies, e. g. if A is or is not present <lb/>
            5. No syllogism <lb/>
            if the minor be <lb/>
            universal, but <lb/>

            with some B, but B is present to every C; let the terms <lb/>
            of affirmation be "good," "habit," "prudence," and those <lb/>
            * Example (3.) <lb/>
            of negation, "good," "habit, "ignorance. <lb/>
            Again, if B is present with no C, but A is <lb/>
            present or is not present with some B, or not with every <lb/>
            B ; neither thus will there be a syllogism ; let the terms of <lb/>
            t Example (4.) <lb/>
            being present with every (individual) be “white," † <lb/>
            "horse," "swan;" but those of being present <lb/>
            with no one, be " white," “horse," “crow." The same also <lb/>
            6. Nor when <lb/>
            the major is <lb/>
            A or E, but the <lb/>
            minor O. <lb/>
            may be taken if A, B be indefinite. Neither will <lb/>
            there be a syllogism, when to the major extreme <lb/>
            the universal affirmative or negative is added; <lb/>
            but to the minor, a particular negative, whether <lb/>
            it be indefinitely or particularly taken, e. g. if A is present <lb/>
            with every B; but B is not present with some, or not with <lb/>
            every C, for to what the middle is not present, to this, both to <lb/>
            every, and to none, the first will be consequent. For let the <lb/>
            terms, it animal," “man," " white," be supposed, afterwards <lb/>
            from among those white things, of which man is not predicated, <lb/>
            let "swan" and "snow" be taken; hence "animal" is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of every individual of the one, but of no individual of the <lb/>
            t Example (5.) <lb/>
            other, wherefore there will not be a syllogism.‡ <lb/>
            Again, let A be present with no B, but B not be <lb/>
            present with some C, let the terms also be "inanimate," <lb/>
            “man," " white," then let " swan" and “snow" be taken from <lb/>
            those white things, of which man is not predicated, for inani­ <lb/>
            mate is predicated of every individual of the one, but of no <lb/>
            I Example (6.) <lb/>
            individual of the other. § Once more, since it is <lb/>
            indefinite for B not to be present with some C, <lb/>
            (for it is truly asserted, that it is not present with some C, <lb/>
            whether it is present with none, or not with every C,) such <lb/>
            terms being taken, so as to be present with none, there will <lb/>
            be no syllogism (and this has been declared before). Where­ <lb/>
            fore it is evident, that when the terms are thus, there will not <lb/>
            be a syllogism, since if one could be, there could be also one <lb/>
            in these, and in like manner it may be shown, if even an uni- <lb/>
            7. Nor when <lb/>
            both are parti­ <lb/>
            cular, etc. <lb/>
            versal negative be taken. Nor will there by any <lb/>
            means be a syllogism, if both particular inter­ <lb/>
            vals I be predicated either as affirmative or nega- <note type="footnote"> I Propositions. " Propositio ipsa vocatur passim ab Aristotele. “inter* </note> <pb n="89"/>

            five, or the one affirmative and the other negative, or the one <lb/>
            indefinite, or the other definite, or both indefinite; but let the <lb/>
            common terms of all be "animal," "white," "man," <lb/>
            "animal," "white," "stone."* <lb/>
            * Example (7.) <lb/>
            From what has been said, then, it is evident, that if there <lb/>
            be a particular syllogism in this figure, the terms must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily be as we have said, and that if the terms be thus, <lb/>
            there will necessarily be a syllogism, but by no <lb/>
            means if they are otherwise. It is also clear, that <lb/>
            all the syllogisms in this figure are perfect, for <lb/>
            all are perfected through the first assumptions; and <lb/>
            that all problems are demonstrated by this figure, <lb/>

              a figure of this kind I call the second figure. <lb/>
              The middle term1 also in it, I call that which <lb/>
              is predicated of both extremes, and the ex­ <lb/>
              tremes I denominate those of which this mid­ <lb/>
              dle is predicated, the greater extreme being <lb/>
              that which is placed near the middle, but the <lb/>
              less, that which is farther from the middle. Now the mid­ <lb/>
              dle is placed beyond the extremes, and is first in posi­ <lb/>
              tion ; wherefore by no means will there be a perfect syllo­ <lb/>
              * i. e. a syllo­ <lb/>
              gismo <lb/>
              gism in this figure. There may however be one,. <lb/>
              both when the terms are, and are not, universal,2 <lb/>
              and if they be universal there will be a syllogism <lb/>
              when the middle is present with all and with none, to <lb/>
              which ever extreme the negation is added,3 but by no means <lb/>
              in any other way. For let M be predicated of no N, but of <lb/>
              every 0; since then a negative proposition is convertible, N <lb/>
              will be present with no M; but M was supposed to be pre­ <lb/>
              sent with every 0, wherefore N will be present with no 0, <lb/>
              for this has been proved before. Again, if M be present with <lb/>
              every N, but with no 0, neither will 0 be present with any N, <lb/>
              for if M be present with no 0, neither will 0 be present with <lb/>
              any M; but M was present with every N, hence also 0 will <lb/>
              be present with no N ; for again the first figure is produced ; <lb/>
              since however a negative proposition is converted, neither will <lb/>
              N be present with any 0; hence there will be the same syllo­ <lb/>
              gism. We may also demonstrate the same things, by a de­ <lb/>
              duction to the impossible; it is evident therefore, that when <lb/>
              the terms are thus, a syllogism, though not a perfect one, is <lb/>
              produced, for the necessary is not only perfected from first as- <lb/>

              versal affirm­ <lb/>

              M is predicated of every N and of every 0, there <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle gives a separate definition of the three terms in each figure. <lb/>

              logical deduction or inference, and often appears used in this way by <lb/>
              Aristotle, as in this same chapter. <lb/>
              Ex. 1. Every animal is a substance Every animal is a substance <lb/>
              Every man is a substance Every stone is a substance <lb/>
              Every man is an animal. No stone is an animal. </note> <pb n="91"/>
               <note type="margin">CHAP. V.]</note><lb/>
              will not be a syllogism, let the terms of being <lb/>
              present be "substance," "animal," "man," and of <lb/>
              not being present" substance," “animal," “stone," <lb/>
              the middle term "substance."* Nor will there <lb/>
              atives there is <lb/>
              no conse­ <lb/>
              quence. <lb/>
              * Example (1.) <lb/>
              then be a syllogism, when M is neither predicated of any N, <lb/>
              nor of any 0, let the terms of being present be “line,” " ani­ <lb/>
              mal," “man;” but of not being present, “line,” <lb/>
              " animal," " stone."t <lb/>
              t Example (2.)</p>
          <p>Hence it is evident, that if there is a syllogism when the <lb/>
            terms are universal, the latter must necessarily be, as we said <lb/>
            at the beginning,1 for if they are otherwise, no necessary (con­ <lb/>
            clusion) follows. But if the middle be universal in respect to <lb/>
            either extreme, when universal belongs to the major either <lb/>
            affirmatively or negatively, but to the minor particularly, and <lb/>
            in a manner opposite to the universal, (I mean by opposition, <lb/>
            if the universal be negative, but the particular affirmative, or <lb/>
            if the universal is affirmative, but the particular negative,) it <lb/>
            is necessary that a particular negative syllogism <lb/>
            should result. For if M is present with no N, but <lb/>
            with a certain 0, N must necessarily not be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with a certain 0, for since a negative propo- <lb/>

            major is A or E, <lb/>
            and the minor <lb/>

            clusion is O. <lb/>
            sition is convertible, N will be present with no M, but M was <lb/>
            by hypothesis present with a certain 0, wherefore N will not <lb/>
            be present with a certain 0, for a syllogism is produced in <lb/>
            the first figure.</p>
          <p>Again, if M is present with every N, but not with a certain <lb/>
            0, N must of necessity not be present with a certain 0, for <lb/>
            if it is present with every 0, and M is predicated of every N, <note type="footnote"> Ex. 2. No animal is a line No animal is a line <lb/>

              M must necessarily be present with every 0, but it was sup­ <lb/>
              posed not to be present with a certain 0, and if M is present <lb/>
              with every N, and not with every 0, there will be a syllogism, <lb/>
              that N is not present with every 0, and the demonstration <lb/>
              will be the same. But if M is predicated of every 0, but not <lb/>
              of every N, there will not be a syllogism; let the terms of <lb/>
              presence be " animal,” " substance," " crow," and of absence <lb/>
              * Example (3.) <lb/>
              " animal, "white, “crow; * neither will there <lb/>
              be a syllogism when M is predicated of no 0, but of <lb/>
              a certain N, let the terms of presence be "animal," "substance," <lb/>
              t Example (4.) <lb/>
              " stone," but of absence, " animal," " substance," <lb/>
              " science." t</p>
          <p>When therefore universal is opposed to particular, we have <lb/>
            declared when there will, and when there will not, be a syllogism ; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοιοσχήμονες</foreign>. <lb/>
            4. If both pre­ <lb/>
            mises be of the <lb/>
            same quality, <lb/>
            no syllogism <lb/>
            results. <lb/>
            but when the propositions are of the same quality,1 <lb/>
            as both being negative or affirmative, there will not <lb/>
            by any means be a syllogism. For first, let them be <lb/>
            negative, and let the universal belong to the major <lb/>
            extreme, as let M be present with no N, and not be <lb/>
            present with a certain 0, it may happen therefore that N <lb/>
            shall be present with every and with no O; let the terms of <lb/>
            4 Example (5.) <lb/>
            universal absence be " black, " snow, ” “ani­ <lb/>
            mal ;” t but we cannot take the terms of universal <lb/>
            presence, if M is present with a certain 0, and with a certain <lb/>
            0 not present. For if N is present with every 0, but M with <lb/>
            no N, M will be present with no 0, but by hypothesis, it was <lb/>
            present with some 0, wherefore it is not possible thus to assume <lb/>
            the terms. We may prove it nevertheless from the indefinite,2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Taylor forgets that the affirmation and negation of proposition con­ <lb/>
            stitute its quality, so construes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοιοσχήμονες</foreign>, “of the same figure,”—a <lb/>

            for since M was truly asserted not to be with some certain 0, <lb/>
            even if it is present with no 0; yet being present with no 0, <lb/>
            there was not a syllogism, it is evident, that neither now will <lb/>
            there be one. Again, let them. be affirmative, <lb/>
            and let the universal be similarly assumed, e. g. <lb/>
            let M be present with every N, and with a certain <lb/>
            * i. e. both pro­ <lb/>
            positions. <lb/>
            0, N may happen therefore to be present, both with every <lb/>
            and with no 0, let the terms of being present with none, be <lb/>
            "white, "swan," "snow; ”† but we cannot as­ <lb/>
            sume the terms of being present with every, for <lb/>
            t Example (6.) <lb/>
            the reason which we have before stated, but it may be shown <lb/>
            from the indefinite.‡ But if the universal be <lb/>
            joined to the minor extreme, and M is present with <lb/>
            ‡ Example (7.) <lb/>
            no 0, and is not present with some certain N, it is possible <lb/>
            for N to be present with every and with no 0; let the terms <lb/>
            of presence be "white," "animal," "crow," but of absence, <lb/>
            " white,” " stone,” " crow." § But if the proposi­ <lb/>
            tions are affirmative, let the terms of absence be <lb/>

            “white,” " animal," " snow," of presence, " white," " animal," <lb/>
            "swan. || Therefore it is evident, when the pro­ <lb/>
            positions are of the same quality, and the one <lb/>

            universal, but the other particular, that there is by no means <lb/>
            a syllogism. Neither, however, will there be one, if a thing <lb/>
            be present to some one of each term, or not present, or to the <lb/>
            one, but not to the other, or to neither universally, or indefinitely, <lb/>
            let the common terms of all be "white, "ani­ <lb/>

            ¶ Example (10.)</p>
          <p>Wherefore it is evident, from what we have stated, that if <lb/>
            the terms subsist towards each other, as has been said, there <lb/>
            is necessarily a syllogism, and if there be a syllogism, the <lb/>
            terms must thus subsist. It is also clear that all syllogisms <figure type="illustration">

            remote from the middle, and the less, that which <lb/>
            is nearer to the middle. But the middle is placed beyond the <lb/>

            middle, both universally, and not universally. <lb/>
            Now when the terms are universally so, when, for instance, <lb/>
            P and R are present with every S, there will be a syllogism, <lb/>

            It horse,” inanimate," the middle " inanimate." t <lb/>
            t Example (2.) <lb/>
            Wherefore also in this figure it is evident, when there will, <lb/>
            and when there will not, be a syllogism, the <lb/>
            terms being universal, for when both terms are <lb/>
            affirmative, there will be a syllogism, in which it <lb/>
            will be concluded that extreme is with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain extreme,1 but when both terms are negative <lb/>
            there will not be. When however one is negative <lb/>
            and the other affirmative, and the major is nega­ <lb/>
            tive but the other affirmative, there will be a syl­ <lb/>
            logism, that the extreme is not present with <lb/>
            2. When both <lb/>
            premises are <lb/>
            affirmative <lb/>
            there will be a <lb/>
            syllogism, but <lb/>
            not when both <lb/>
            are negative­ <lb/>
            the major <lb/>
            moreover may <lb/>
            be negative,and <lb/>

            a certain extreme, but if the contrary there will not be.</p>
          <p>If indeed one be universal in respect to the middle,2 and the <lb/>
            other particular, both being affirmative, syllogism is necessarily <lb/>
            produced, whichever term be universal. For if R is present <note type="footnote"> the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκθεσις</foreign> as a syllogism at all. Vide Aquinas, Opusc. 47. Zabarella, <lb/>

              with every S, but P with a certain S, P must necessarily be <lb/>
              present with a certain R, for since the affirmative is convert­ <lb/>
              ible, S will be present with a certain P, so that since R is <lb/>
              present to every S, and S with a certain P, R will also be <lb/>
              present with a certain P, wherefore also P will be present with <lb/>
              a certain R. Again, if R is present with a certain S, but P is <lb/>
              present with every S, P must necessarily be present with a <lb/>
              certain R, for the mode of demonstration is the same, and <lb/>
              these things may be demonstrated like the former, both by <lb/>
              the impossible, and by exposition. If however one be affirm­ <lb/>
              ative, and the other negative, and the affirmative be universal, <lb/>
              when the minor is affirmative there will be a syllogism ; for <lb/>
              if R is present with every S, and P not present with a certain <lb/>
              S, P must also necessarily not be present with a certain R, <lb/>
              since if P is present with every R, and R with every S, P <lb/>
              will also be present with every S, but it is not present, and <lb/>
              this may also be shown without deduction, if some S be taken <lb/>
              with which P is not present. But when the major is affirm­ <lb/>
              ative there will not be a syllogism, e. g. if P is present with <lb/>
              every S, but R is not present with a certain S; let the terms <lb/>
              * Example (3.) <lb/>
              of being universally present with be " animate," <lb/>
              "man," "animal."* But it is not possible to <lb/>
              take the terms of universal negative, if R is present with a <lb/>
              certain S, and with a certain S is not present, since if P is <lb/>
              present with every S, and R with a certain S, P will also be <lb/>
              present with a certain R, but it was supposed to be present <lb/>
              with no R, therefore we must assume the same as in the former <lb/>
              syllogisms. As to declare something not present with a cer­ <lb/>
              tain thing is indefinite, so that also which is not present with <lb/>
              any individual, it is true to say, is not present with a certain <lb/>
              individual, but not being present with any, there was no syl­ <lb/>
              logism, (therefore it is evident there will be no syllogism).1 <note type="footnote"> I L e. when it is assumed not to be present with a certain individual. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              But if the negative term be universal, (yet the particular af­ <lb/>
              firmative,) when the major is negative, but the minor affirm­ <lb/>
              ative, there will be a syllogism, for if P is present with no S, <lb/>
              but R is present with a certain S, P will not be present with <lb/>
              a certain R, and again there will be the first figure, the pro­ <lb/>
              position R S being converted. But when the minor is nega­ <lb/>
              tive, there will not be a syllogism ; let the terms of presence <lb/>
              be “animal," " man," " wild" but of absence, “animal" <lb/>
              “science," " wild," the middle of both, “wild." * <lb/>
              Nor will there be a syllogism when both are ne­ <lb/>
              * Example (4.) <lb/>
              gative, the one universal, the other particular: let the terms <lb/>

              “animal,” " science," " wild,” (of presence, " ani­ <lb/>

              major is universal, but the minor particular, let the terms of <lb/>
              absence be "crow," "snow," “white;”† but of <lb/>
              presence we cannot take the terms, if R is present <lb/>

              with every R, but R with some S, P will also be present with <lb/>
              some S, but it was supposed to be present with no S, indeed <lb/>
              it may be proved from the indefinite. Neither if each ex­ <lb/>
              treme be present or not present with a certain middle, will there <lb/>
              be a syllogism; or if one be present and the other not; or if one be <lb/>
              with some individual and the other with not every or indefinitely. <lb/>
              But let the common terms of all be, "animal," "man," " white" <lb/>
              "animal," "inanimate," "white." § Wherefore <lb/>
              it is clear in this figure also, when there will <lb/>
              § Example (7.) <lb/>
              and when there will not be a syllogism, and that when the <lb/>
              terms are disposed as we have stated, a syllogism of necessity <lb/>
              subsists, and that there should be a syllogism, it is necessary <lb/>
              that the terms should be thus. It is also clear <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN all the figures it appears that when a syllogism is not pro­ <lb/>
            duced, both terms being affirmative, or negative, (and par­ <lb/>
            ticular,2) nothing, in short, results of a necessary character; <lb/>
            1. If one pre­ <lb/>
            mise be A or I, <lb/>
            and the other E, <lb/>
            there will be a <lb/>
            conclusion in <lb/>
            which the mi­ <lb/>
            nor is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of the <lb/>
            major. <lb/>
            but if the one be affirmative and the other nega­ <lb/>
            tive, the negative being universally taken, there <lb/>
            is always a syllogism of the minor extreme with the <lb/>
            major. For example, if A is present with every <lb/>
            or with some B, but B is present with no C, the <lb/>
            propositions being converted, C must necessarily <lb/>
            not be present with some A; so also in the other <lb/>
            figures, for a syllogism is always produced by conversion : <lb/>
            again, it is clear that an indefinite taken for a particular affirm­ <lb/>
            ative, will produce the same syllogism in all the figures.</p>
          <p>Moreover it is evident that all incomplete syllogisms <lb/>
            are completed by means of the first figure, for all of them <lb/>
            are concluded, either ostensively or per impossibile, but <lb/>
            in both ways the first figure is produced: being osten­ <lb/>
            * <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεικτικω̃ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            sively*3 completed, (the first figure is produced,) <lb/>
            because all of them were concluded by conversion, <lb/>
            but conversion produces the first figure : but if they are de- <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Hill, p. 196; also Whately, pp. 60 and 61. For the uses of <lb/>

            incorrectness of the phrase, “ reductio ad impossibile;" it ought to be <lb/>

            Alexander, (Schol. p. 153,) we find two of them recognised here by <lb/>
            Aristotle, and the ther three in Anal. Prior, ii. 1. </note> <pb n="99"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. VII.]</note><lb/>
            monstrated per impossible, (there will be still the first figure,) <lb/>
            because the false being assumed, a syllogism arises in the first <lb/>
            figure. For example, in the last figure, if A and B are present <lb/>
            with every C, it can be shown that A is present with some B, for <lb/>
            if A is present with no B, but B is present with every C, A will <lb/>
            be present with no C; but it was supposed that A was present <lb/>
            with every C, and in like manner it will happen in other in­ <lb/>
            stances.</p>
          <p>It is also possible to reduce all syllogisms <lb/>
            to universal syllogisms in the first figure. For <lb/>
            those in the second, it is evident, are completed <lb/>
            through these, yet not all in like manner, but <lb/>
            the universal by conversion of the negative, and <lb/>
            each of the particular, by deduction per impos- <lb/>
            2. All syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms may be <lb/>
            reduced to uni­ <lb/>
            versals in the <lb/>
            first figure <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγαγε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>)— <lb/>
            the various <lb/>
            methods. <lb/>
            sibile. Now, particular syllogisms in the first figure are com­ <lb/>
            pleted through themselves, but may in the second figure be <lb/>
            demonstrated by deduction to the impossible. For example, <lb/>
            if A is present with every B, but B with a certain C, it can <lb/>
            be shown that A will be present with a certain C, for if A is <lb/>
            present with no C, but is present with every B, B will be <lb/>
            present with no C, for we know this by the second figure. So <lb/>
            also will the demonstration be in the case of a negative, for if <lb/>
            A is present with no B, but B is present with a certain C, <lb/>
            A will not be present with a certain C, since if A is present <lb/>
            with every C, and with no B, B will be present with no C, <lb/>
            and this was the middle figure. Wherefore, as all syllogisms <lb/>
            in the middle figure are reduced to universal syllogisms in the <lb/>
            first figure, but particular in the first are reduced to those in <lb/>
            the middle figure, it is clear that particular will be reduced to <lb/>
            universal syllogisms in the first figure. Those, however, in the <lb/>
            third, when the terms are universal, are immediately completed <lb/>
            through those syllogisms ; *1 but when particular <lb/>
            (terms) are assumed (they are completed) through <lb/>
            particular syllogisms in the first figure ; but these t <lb/>
            have been reduced to those,t so that also particu­ <lb/>
            lar syllogisms in the third figure (are reducible <lb/>

          <p>SINCE however to exist, to exist necessarily, and <lb/>
            to exist contingently are different, (for many <lb/>

            neither necessarily, nor in short exist, yet may hap­ <lb/>
            pen to exist,) it is evident that there will be a <lb/>
            different syllogism from each of these, and from the <lb/>
            terms not being alike; but one syllogism will con­ <lb/>
            sist of those which are necessary, another of absolute, and a third <lb/>
            2.. Necessary <lb/>
            syllogisms re­ <lb/>
            semble gener­ <lb/>

            which are abso­ <lb/>
            lute. <lb/>
            of contingent. In necessary syllogisms it will <lb/>
            almost always be the same, as in the case of abso­ <lb/>
            lute subsistences,1 for the terms being similarly <lb/>
            placed in both absolute existence, and in existing, <lb/>
            or not of necessity, there will and there will not <lb/>
            be a syllogism, except that there will be a difference in neces­ <lb/>
            sary or non-necessary subsistence being added to the terms. <lb/>
            For a negative is in like manner convertible, and we assign <lb/>
            similarly to be in the whole of a thing, and to be (predicated) <lb/>
            of every. In the rest then it will be shown by the same <lb/>
            manner, through conversion, that the conclusion is necessary, <lb/>
            as in the case of being present; but in the middle figure, when <lb/>
            the universal is affirmative, and the particular negative, and <lb/>
            again, in the third figure, when the universal is affirmative, <lb/>
            but the particular negative, the demonstration will not be in <lb/>
            the like manner ; but it is necessary that proposing something <lb/>
            with which either extreme is not present, we make a syllogism <lb/>
            of this, for in respect of these there will be a necessary (conclu­ <lb/>
            sion). If, on the other hand, in respect to the proposed term, <lb/>
            there is a necessary conclusion, there will be also one (a neces­ <lb/>
            sary conclusion) of some individual of that term, for what is <lb/>
            proposed is part of it, and each syllogism is formed under its <lb/>

            position is necessary, a necessary syllogism arises,1 <lb/>
            not however from either proposition indifferently, <lb/>
            but from the one that contains the greater ex­ <lb/>
            treme.2 For example, if A is assumed to be <lb/>
            necessarily present or not present with B, but B <lb/>
            to be alone present with C, for the premises being <lb/>
            thus assumed, A will necessarily be present or <lb/>
            1. Conclusion <lb/>
            of a syllogism <lb/>
            with one pre­ <lb/>
            mise neces­ <lb/>
            sary often fol­ <lb/>
            lows the major <lb/>
            premise,—ex­ <lb/>
            ample and <lb/>
            proof,—uni­ <lb/>
            versals and <lb/>
            particulars. <lb/>
            not with C ; for since A is or is not necessarily present with <lb/>
            every B, but C is something belonging to B, C <lb/>
            will evidently of necessity be one of these.* If, <lb/>
            again, A B (the major is not necessary, but B <lb/>
            * i. e. will or <lb/>
            will not be A. <lb/>
            C (the minor) is necessary, there will not be a necessary con­ <lb/>
            clusion, for if there be, it will happen that A is necessarily <lb/>
            present with a certain B, both by the first and the third <lb/>
            figure, but this is false, for B may happen to be a thing of <lb/>
            that kind, that A may not be present with any thing of it. <lb/>
            Besides, it is evident from the terms, that there will not be a <lb/>
            necessary conclusion, as if A were "motion," B "animal," <lb/>
            and C "man," for "man" is necessarily "an animal," but <lb/>
            neither are "animal" nor "man" necessarily "moved;" so <lb/>
            also if A B is negative, for there is the same de­ <lb/>
            nonstration. In particular syllogisms, however, <lb/>
            f the universal is necessary, the conclusion will <lb/>

            necessary conclusion, neither if the universal premise be nega­ <lb/>
            tive nor affirmative. Let then, in the first place, the universal <lb/>
            be necessary, and let A be necessarily present with every B, <note type="footnote"> 1 Theophrastus and Eudemus allowed a necessary conclusion to follow <lb/>

              C, for C is under- B, and A was of necessity pre­ <unclear/> <lb/>
              sent with every B. The same will occur if the <lb/>
              syllogism be negative, for the demonstration will be the same, <lb/>
              but if the particular be necessary, the conclusion will not be <lb/>

          <p>1. In the second <lb/>
            figure, when a <lb/>
            necessary is <lb/>
            joined with a <lb/>
            pure premise, <lb/>
            the conclusion <lb/>
            follows the ne­ <lb/>
            gative neces­ <lb/>
            sary premise.- <lb/>
            Example and <lb/>
            proof.</p>
          <p>IN the second figure, if the negative premise be <lb/>
            necessary, the conclusion will also be necessary, <lb/>
            but if the affirmative (be necessary, the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion) will not be necessary. For first, let the <lb/>
            negative be necessary, and let it not be possible <lb/>
            for A to be in any B, but let it be present with <lb/>
            C alone; as then a negative proposition may be <lb/>
            converted, B cannot be present with any A, but <lb/>
            A is with every C, hence B cannot be present with any C, <lb/>
            § i. e. belongs <lb/>
            to A. <lb/>
            || The conclu­ <lb/>
            sion will be <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            for C is under § A. In like manner also, if the <lb/>
            negative be added to C,|| for if A cannot be with <lb/>
            any C, neither can C be present with any A, but <lb/>
            A is with every B, so neither can C be present <lb/>
            with any B, as the first figure will again be produced; <lb/>
            wherefore, neither can B be present with C, since it is simi- <lb/>
            2. If the affirm­ <lb/>
            ative be neces­ <lb/>
            sary, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion will <lb/>
            not be. <lb/>
            larly converted. If, however, the affirmative pre­ <lb/>
            mise be necessary, the conclusion will not be <lb/>
            necessary; for let A necessarily be present with <lb/>
            every B, and alone not be present with any C, <lb/>
            then the negative being converted, we have the first figure; <lb/>
            but it was shown in the first, that when the major negative <lb/>
            (proposition) is not necessary, neither will the conclusion be <lb/>
            necessary, so that neither in these will there be a necessary <lb/>
            ¶ i. e. in syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms of the <lb/>
            second figure <lb/>
            with a neces­ <lb/>
            sary affirma­ <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            conclusion.¶ Once more, if the conclusion is <lb/>
            necessary, it results that C is not necessarily pre­ <lb/>
            sent with a certain A, for if B is necessarily pre­ <lb/>
            sent with no C, neither will C be necessarily pre­ <lb/>
            sent with any B, but B is present necessarily with <pb n="103"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XI.]</note><lb/>
            a certain A, if A is necessarily present with every B. Hence, <lb/>
            it is necessary that C should not be present with a certain A; <lb/>
            there is, however, nothing to prevent such an A being as­ <lb/>
            sumed, with which universally C may be present. More­ <lb/>
            over, it can be shown by exposition of the terms, that the <lb/>
            conclusion is not simply necessary, but necessary from the <lb/>
            assumption of these, e. g. let A be "animal," B "man." C <lb/>
            " white," and let the propositions be similarly assumed: for it is <lb/>
            possible for an animal to be with nothing " white," then net­ <lb/>
            ther will " man" be present with any thing white, yet not <lb/>
            from necessity, for it may happen for "man" to be "white," <lb/>
            yet not so long as " animal" is present with nothing " white," <lb/>
            so that from these assumptions there will be a necessary con­ <lb/>
            clusion, but not simply necessary.</p>
          <p>The same will happen in particular syllogisms, for <lb/>
            when the negative proposition is universal and ne- <lb/>
            3. Case the <lb/>
            same with par­ <lb/>
            ticulars. <lb/>
            cessary, the conclusion also will be necessary, but when the affirm­ <lb/>
            ative is universal and necessary, and the negative <lb/>
            particular,. the conclusion will not be necessary. <lb/>
            First, then, let there be an universal and necessary <lb/>
            negative, and let A not possibly be present with <lb/>
            any B, but with a certain C. Since, therefore, a <lb/>
            * Taylor in­ <lb/>
            serts " and not <lb/>
            necessary," <lb/>
            which words <lb/>
            are omitted by <lb/>
            Bekker and <lb/>
            Waltz. <lb/>
            negative proposition is convertible, B can neither be possibly <lb/>
            present with any A, but A is with a certain C, so that of <lb/>
            necessity B is not present with a certain C. Again, let there <lb/>
            be an universal and necessary affirmative, and let the affirm­ <lb/>
            ative be attached to B, if then A is necessarily present with <lb/>
            every B, but is not with a certain C, B is not with a certain <lb/>
            C it is clear, yet not from necessity, since there will be the <lb/>
            same terms for the demonstration, as were taken in the case <lb/>
            of universal syllogisms. Neither, moreover, will the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion be necessary, if a particular necessary negative be taken <lb/>
            as the demonstration is through the same terms.</p>

          <p>IN the last figure, when the terms are universally <lb/>
            joined to the middle,1 and both premises are <lb/>
            affirmative, if either of them be necessary, the <lb/>

            be A, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion will be <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            conclusion will also be necessary; and if one be <lb/>
            negative, but the other affirmative, when the <lb/>
            negative is necessary, the conclusion will be also necessary. <lb/>
            but when the affirmative (is so, the conclusion will not be <lb/>
            1st case. <lb/>
            necessary. For first, let both propositions be1 <lb/>
            affirmative, and let A and B be present with <lb/>
            every C, and let A C be a necessary (proposition). Since <lb/>
            then B is present with every C, C will also be present with <lb/>
            a certain B, because an universal is converted into a parti­ <lb/>
            cular : so that if A is necessarily present with every C, and <lb/>
            C with a certain B, A must also be necessarily present with <lb/>
            * i. e. belongs <lb/>
            to it. <lb/>
            2nd case. <lb/>
            a certain B, for B is under C,* hence the first figure <lb/>
            again arises. In like manner, it can be also de­ <lb/>
            monstrated if B C is a necessary (proposition), for <lb/>
            C is converted with a certain A, so that if B is necessarily <lb/>
            present with every C, (but C with a certain A,) B will also <lb/>
            of necessity be present with a certain A. Again let A C be <lb/>
            a negative (proposition), but B C affirmative, and let the <lb/>
            negative be necessary; as therefore an affirmative pro­ <lb/>
            position is convertible, C will be present with some certain <lb/>
            B, but A of necessity with no C, neither will A necessarily <lb/>
            3rd case an ex­ <lb/>
            ception. <lb/>
            be present with some B, for B is under C. But <lb/>
            if the affirmative is necessary, there will not be a <lb/>
            necessary conclusion; for let B C be affirmative <lb/>
            and necessary, but A C negative and not necessary; since <lb/>
            then the affirmative is converted C will also be with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain B of necessity; wherefore if A is with no C, but C with <lb/>
            a certain B, A will also not be present with a certain B, but <lb/>
            t Vide ch. 9. <lb/>
            not from necessity, for it has been shown by the <lb/>
            first figure,† that when the negative proposition <lb/>
            is not, necessary, neither will the conclusion be necessary. <lb/>
            Moreover this will also be evident from the terms, for let A <note type="footnote"> 1 Taylor, by mistake, reads " necessary." <lb/>
            Ex. 1. No horse is good <lb/>
            It is necessary that every horse should be an animal <lb/>

              be "good," B "animal," and C "horse," it happens therefore <lb/>
              that " good" is with no "horse," but "animal" is necessarily <lb/>
              present with every " horse," but it is not however necessary <lb/>
              that a certain " animal" should not be " good," for every <lb/>
              " animal may possibly be " good. * Or if this <lb/>
              is not possible, (viz. that every animal is good,) we <lb/>
              * Example (1.) <lb/>
              must assume another term, as " to wake," or " to sleep," for <lb/>
              every " animal is capable of these. † If then the <lb/>
              terms are universal in respect to the middle, it has <lb/>
              t Example (2.) <lb/>
              been shown when there will be a necessary conclusion.</p>
          <p>But if one term is universally but the other <lb/>
            particularly (predicated of the middle), and both <lb/>
            propositions are affirmative, when the universal is <lb/>
            necessary the conclusion will also be necessary, <lb/>
            for the demonstration is the same as before, since <lb/>
            the particular affirmative is convertible. If there- <lb/>
            2. If one pro­ <lb/>
            position be A <lb/>
            or I, when A it <lb/>
            necessary the <lb/>
            conclusion is <lb/>
            necessary, but <lb/>
            not when 1 is <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            fore B is necessarily present with every C, but A is under C, <lb/>
            B must also necessarily be present with a certain A,l and if <lb/>
            B is with a certain A, A must also be present necessarily with <lb/>
            a certain B, for it is convertible; the same will also occur if <lb/>
            A C be a necessary universal proposition, for B is under C. <lb/>
            But if the particular be necessary, there will not be a neces­ <lb/>
            sary conclusion, for let B C be particular and necessary, and <lb/>
            A present with every C, yet not of necessity, B C then being <lb/>
            converted we have the first figure, and the universal propo­ <lb/>
            sition is not necessary, but the particular is necessary, but <lb/>
            when the propositions are thus there was not a necessary con­ <lb/>

            case of these. § Moreover this is evident from the <lb/>

              and the other negative, when the universal proposition is ne­ <lb/>
              gative and necessary, the conclusion will also be necessary, <lb/>
              for if A happens to no C, but B is present with a certain C, <lb/>
              A must necessarily not be present with a certain B. But <lb/>

              A or I, or when <lb/>
              O is assumed, <lb/>
              there will not <lb/>
              be a necessary <lb/>

              for we may allege the other same (reasons <lb/>
              against it), as in the former cases.1 But let the <lb/>
              terms when the universal affirmative is necessary <lb/>
              be "wakefulness," "animal," "man," the middle <lb/>

            less both propositions signify the being present with,2 but <lb/>
            that a necessary conclusion follows, even if one <lb/>
            alone is necessary. But in both,. the syllogisms <lb/>
            being affirmative, or negative, one of the propo­ <lb/>
            sitions must necessarily be similar to the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion ; I me an by similar, that if (the conclusion) <lb/>
            be (simply) that a thing is present with, (one of <lb/>
            the propositions also signifies simply) the being pre­ <lb/>

            is the contingent, is evident from opposite negatives and <lb/>
            affirmatives, for the assertions-" it does not happen to be," <lb/>
            and, " it is impossible to be," and, " it is necessary not to be," <lb/>
            are either the same, or follow each other; wherefore also the <lb/>
            contraries to these, " it happens to be," " it is not impossible <lb/>
            to be," and, " it is not necessary not to be," will either be the <lb/>
            same, or follow each other ; for of every thing, there is either <lb/>
            affirmation or negation, hence the contingent will be not <lb/>
            necessary, and the not-necessary will be contingent. It hap- <lb/>

            version. <lb/>
            pens, indeed, that all contingent propositions are <lb/>
            convertible with each other. I do not mean the <lb/>
            affirmative into the negative, but as many as have <lb/>
            an affirmative figure, as to opposition ; e. g. "it <lb/>
            happens to exist," (is convertible into) "it happens not to <lb/>
            exist," and, " it happens to every," into " it happens to none," <lb/>
            or, "not to every," and, "it happens to some," into " it hap­ <lb/>
            * i. e. is conver­ <lb/>
            lion effected. <lb/>
            pens not to some." In the same manner also with <lb/>
            the rest,. for since the contingent is non-neces­ <lb/>
            sary, and the non-necessary may happen not to <lb/>
            exist, it is clear that if A happens to be with any B, it may <lb/>
            also happen not to be present, and if it happens to be present <lb/>
            with every B, it may also happen not to be present with every <lb/>
            B. There is the same reasoning also in particular affirmatives, <lb/>
            for the demonstration is the same, but such propositions are <lb/>
            affirmative and not negative, for the verb " to be contingent," <lb/>
            t Vide c. 3. <lb/>
            S. The contin­ <lb/>
            gent predicated <lb/>
            in two ways- <lb/>
            the one general, <lb/>
            the other inde­ <lb/>
            finite-the me­ <lb/>
            thod of conver­ <lb/>
            lion not the <lb/>
            same to each. <lb/>
            is arranged similarly to the verb " to be, as we <lb/>
            have said before. t</p>
          <p>These things then being defined, let us next <lb/>
            remark, that to be contingent is predicated in two <lb/>
            ways, one that which happens for the most part <lb/>
            and yet falls short of the necessary-( for instance, <lb/>
            for a man to become hoary, or to grow, or to <lb/>
            waste, or in short whatever may naturally be, for <lb/>
            this has not a continued necessity, for the man <lb/>
            may not always exist, but while he does exist it is either of <lb/>
            necessity or for the most part)1—the other way (the contin­ <lb/>
            gent is) indefinite, and is that which may be possibly thus and <lb/>
            not thus; as for an animal to walk, or while it is walking for an <lb/>
            earthquake to happen, or in short whatever occurs casually, for <note type="footnote"> 1 i. a. that he is subject to these things. </note> <pb n="109"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIII.]</note><lb/>
            nothing is more naturally produced thus, or in a contrary way. <lb/>
            Each kind of contingent however is convertible according to <lb/>
            opposite propositions, yet not in the same manner, but what <lb/>
            may naturally subsist is convertible into that which does not <lb/>
            subsist of necessity ; thus it is possible for a man not to be­ <lb/>
            come hoary, but the indefinite is converted into what cannot <lb/>
            more subsist in this than in that way. Science however and <lb/>
            demonstrative syllogism do not belong to indefinites, because <lb/>
            the middle is irregular, but to those things which may na­ <lb/>
            turally exist; and arguments and speculations are generally <lb/>
            conversant with such contingencies, but of the indefinite con­ <lb/>
            tingent we may make a syllogism, though it is not generally <lb/>
            investigated. These things however will be more <lb/>
            defined in what follows,1 at present let us show <lb/>
            when and how and what will be a syllogism from <lb/>
            contingent propositions. <lb/>
            4. The indefi­ <lb/>
            nite contingent <lb/>
            of less use in <lb/>
            syllogism.</p>
          <p>Since then that this happens to be present with that may <lb/>
            be assumed in a twofold respect,-( for it either signifies <lb/>
            that with which this is present, or that with which it may be <lb/>
            present, thus the assertion, A is contingent to that of which <lb/>
            B is predicated, signifies one of these things, either that of <lb/>
            which B is predicated, or that of which it may be predicated; <lb/>
            but the assertion that A is contingent to that of which there <lb/>
            is B, and that A may be present with every B, do not differ <lb/>
            from each other, whence it is evident that A may happen to <lb/>
            be present with every B in two ways,)—let us first show if B <lb/>
            is contingent to that of which there is C, and if A is contin­ <lb/>
            gent to that of which there is B, what and what kind of syllo­ <lb/>
            gism there will be, for thus both propositions are contingently <lb/>
            assumed. When however A is contingent to that <lb/>
            with which B is present, one proposition is de in­ <lb/>
            esse, but the other of that which is contingent, so <lb/>
            that we must begin from those of similar character, <lb/>

            versal there <lb/>
            will be a perfect <lb/>
            syllogism.</p>
          <p>WHEN A is contingent to every B, and B to <lb/>
            every C, there will be a perfect syllogism, so that <lb/>
            A is contingent to every C, which is evident from <lb/>
            the definition, for thus we stated the universal <lb/>
            contingent (to imply). So also if A is contingent <lb/>
            to no B, but B to every C, (it may be concluded) that A is <lb/>
            2nd case. <lb/>
            contingent to no C, for to affirm that A is contin­ <lb/>
            gent in respect of nothing to which B is contin­ <lb/>
            gent, this were to leave none of the contingents which are <lb/>
            under B. But when A is contingent to every B, but B con- <lb/>
            3rd case. <lb/>
            tingent to no C, no syllogism arises from the as­ <lb/>
            sumed propositions, but B C1 being converted ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the contingent, the same syllogism arises as existed <lb/>
            before, as since it happens that B is present with no C, it may <lb/>
            * Vide ch. 13. <lb/>
            also happen to be present with every C, which was <lb/>
            shown before,. wherefore if B may happen to <lb/>
            every C, and A to every B, the same syllogism will again <lb/>
            arise. The like will occur also if negation be added with the <lb/>
            4th case. <lb/>
            contingent (mode) to both propositions, I mean, as <lb/>
            if A is contingent to no B, and B to no C, no syl­ <lb/>
            logism arises through the assumed propositions, but when they <lb/>
            2. When the <lb/>
            premises are <unclear/> <lb/>
            both negative <lb/>
            or the minor <lb/>
            negative, there <lb/>
            is either no <lb/>
            syllogism or an <lb/>
            incomplete one <lb/>
            —case of the <lb/>
            major uni­ <lb/>
            versal with the <lb/>
            minor particu­ <lb/>
            lar, different. <lb/>
            are converted there will be the same as before. It <lb/>
            is evident then that when negation is added to <lb/>
            the minor extreme, or to both the propositions, <lb/>
            there is either no syllogism, or an incomplete one, <lb/>
            for the necessity (of consequence) is completed by <lb/>
            conversion. If however one of the propositions <lb/>
            be universal, and the other be assumed as parti­ <lb/>
            cular, the universal belonging to the major ex­ <lb/>
            treme there will be a perfect syllogism, for if A <lb/>
            is contingent to every B, but B to a certain C, A is also con­ <lb/>
            tingent to a certain C, and this is clear from the definition of <lb/>
            universal contingent. Again, if A is contingent to no B, but <lb/>
            B happens to be present with some C, it is necessary that A <lb/>
            should happen not to be present with some C, since the de- <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, the minor negative being made affirmative. </note> <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XIV.]</note><lb/>
            monstration is the same; but if the particular proposition be <lb/>
            assumed as negative, and the universal affirmative, and retain <lb/>
            the same position as if A happens to be present to eveiy B, <lb/>
            but B happens not to be present with some C, no evident <lb/>
            syllogism arises from the assumed propositions, but the parti­ <lb/>
            cular being converted and B being assumed to be contingently <lb/>
            present with some C, there will be the same conclusion as be­ <lb/>
            fore in the first syllogisms.1 Still if the major proposition be <lb/>
            taken as particular, but the minor as universal, and <lb/>
            if both be assumed affirmative or negative, or of <lb/>
            2. Vice versâ. <lb/>
            different figure, or both indefinite or particular, there will <lb/>
            never be a syllogism; for there is nothing to prevent B from <lb/>
            being more widely extended than A, and from not being <lb/>
            equally predicated. Now let that by which B exceeds A, be <lb/>
            assumed to be C, to this it will happen2 that A is present <lb/>
            neither to every, nor to none, nor to a certain one, nor not <lb/>
            to a certain one, since contingent propositions are convertible, <lb/>
            and B may happen to be present to more things than A. <lb/>
            Besides, this is evident from the terms, for when the propo­ <lb/>
            sitions are thus, the first is contingent to the last, and to none, <lb/>
            and necessarily present with every individual, and let the <lb/>
            common terms of all be these; of being present necessarily3 <lb/>
            "animal, "white, ""man, but of not being con­ <lb/>
            tingent, "animal," "white," "garment."* There­ <lb/>
            * Example (1.) <lb/>

              gism, for every syllogism is either de inesse, or of that whicl <lb/>
              exists necessarily or contingently, but that this is neither <lb/>
              de inesse, nor of that which necessarily exists, is clear, since <lb/>
              the affirmative is subverted by the negative, and the negative <lb/>
              by the affirmative, wherefore it remains that it is of the con­ <lb/>
              tingent, but this is impossible, for it has been shown that when <lb/>
              the terms are thus, the first is necessarily inherent in all the <lb/>
              last, and contingently is present with none, so that there <lb/>
              cannot be a syllogism of the contingent, for the necessary is <lb/>
              not contingent. Thus it is evident that when universal terms <lb/>

          <p>1. No syllogism <lb/>
            with mixed <lb/>
            premises, pure <lb/>
            and modal—if <lb/>
            the major is <lb/>
            contingent the <lb/>
            syllogism will <lb/>
            be perfect, not <lb/>
            otherwise.</p>
          <p>IF one proposition be assumed to exist, but the <lb/>
            other to be contingent, when that which contains <lb/>
            the major extreme signifies the contingent, all the <lb/>
            syllogisms will be perfect and of the contingent, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the above definition. But when the mi­ <lb/>
            nor (is contingent) they will all be imperfect, and <lb/>
            the negative syllogisms will not be of the contingent, <lb/>
            according to the definition, but of that which is necessarily <lb/>
            present with no one or not with every; for if it is necessarily <lb/>
            present with no one, or not with every, we say that " it hap­ <lb/>
            pens " to be present with no one and not with every. Now <lb/>
            let A be contingent to every B, and let B be assumed to be <lb/>
            present with every C, since then C is included under B, and <lb/>
            1. Case of a <lb/>
            perfect syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, when the <unclear/> <lb/>
            minor is pure. <lb/>
            A is contingent to every B, A is also clearly con­ <lb/>
            tingent to every C, and there is a perfect syllo­ <lb/>
            gism. So also if the proposition A B is negative, <lb/>
            but B C affirmative, and A B is assumed as con­ <lb/>
            tingent, but B C to be present with (simply), there will be a <lb/>
            perfect syllogism, so that A will happen to be present with no C. <pb n="113"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">CHAP. XV.]</note></p>
          <p>It appears then that when a pure minor is assumed the syl­ <lb/>
            logisms are perfect, but that when it is of a contrary charac­ <lb/>
            ter it may be shown per impossibile that there would be also <lb/>
            syllogisms, though at the same time it would be evident that <lb/>
            they are imperfect, since the demonstration will not arise from <lb/>
            the assumed propositions. First, however, we must show that <lb/>
            if A exists, B must necessarily exist, and that if A is possible, <lb/>
            B will necessarily be possible; let then under these circum­ <lb/>
            stances A be possible but B impossible, if therefore the possible, <lb/>
            since it is possible to be, may be produced, yet the impossible, <lb/>
            because it is impossible, cannot be produced. But if at the <lb/>
            same time A is possible and B impossible, it may happen that <lb/>
            A may be produced without B ; if it is produced also, that it <lb/>
            may exist, tor that which has been generated, <lb/>
            when it has been so generated, exists. We must <lb/>
            however assume the possible and impossible,l not <lb/>
            only in generation, but also in true assertion, and <lb/>
            in the inesse, and in as many other ways as the <lb/>
            possible is predicated, for the case will be the <lb/>
            2. Digression <lb/>
            to prove the na­ <lb/>
            ture of true <lb/>
            consequence in <lb/>
            respect of the <lb/>
            possible and <lb/>
            impossible, and <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            same in all of them. Moreover (when it is said) if A exists <lb/>
            B is, we must not understand as if A being a certain thing B <lb/>
            will be, for no necessary consequence follows from one thing <lb/>
            existing; but from there being two at least, as in the case of <lb/>
            propositions subsisting in the manner we have stated in syllo­ <lb/>
            gism. For if C is predicated of D, but D cf F, C will also <lb/>
            necessarily be predicated of F; and if each be possible, the <lb/>
            conclusion will be possible, just as if one should take A as the <lb/>
            premises, but B the conclusion; it will not only happen that <lb/>
            A being necessary, B is also necessary, but that when the <lb/>
            former is possible, the latter also will be possible.</p>
          <p>This being proved, it is manifest that when <lb/>
            there is a false and not impossible hypothesis, the <lb/>
            consequence of the hypothesis will also be false <lb/>
            and not impossible, e. g. if A is false yet not im- <lb/>
            3. From a false <lb/>
            hypothesis, not <lb/>
            impossible, a <lb/>
            similar conclu­ <lb/>
            sion follows. <lb/>
            possible, but when A is, B also is,-here B will also be false <lb/>
            yet not impossible. For since it has been shown that A ex- <note type="footnote"> 1 The possible is either that which may be when it is not, or that <lb/>
            which is simply, or that which necessarily is; and to all these the above <lb/>
            rule applies, and the formal consequence follows as directly from the pre­ <lb/>
            raises, as to its character, as in the case of categoricals. Cf. Metap. 13. <lb/>
            The nature of the possible is fully discussed, Rhetoric, b. ii. ch. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            isting, B also exists, when A is possible, B will be also pos­ <lb/>
            sible, but A is supposed to be possible, wherefore B will be <lb/>
            also possible, for if it were impossible the same thing would <lb/>
            be possible and impossible at the same time. These things <lb/>
            then being established, let A be present with every B, and <lb/>
            B contingent to every C, therefore A must necessarily hap­ <lb/>
            pen to be present with every C ; for let it not happen, <lb/>
            but let B be supposed to be present with every C, this is <lb/>
            indeed false yet not impossible ; if then A is not con­ <lb/>
            tingent to C, but B is present with every C, A is not con­ <lb/>
            tingent to every B, for a syllogism arises in the third figure. <lb/>
            But it was supposed (that A was) contingently present with <lb/>
            every (B), therefore A must necessarily be contingent to every <lb/>
            * Example (1.) <lb/>
            C, for the false being assumed, and not the im­ <lb/>
            possible,1 the consequence is impossible.- We <lb/>
            may also make a deduction to the impossible in the first figure <lb/>
            by assuming B to be present with every C, for if B is with <lb/>
            every C, but A contingent to every B, A will also be contin­ <lb/>
            t Example (2.) <lb/>
            gent to every C, but it was supposed not to be <lb/>
            present with every C.† Still we must assume <lb/>
            the being present with every, not distinguishing it by time, as <lb/>
            4 Universal <lb/>
            predication has <lb/>
            "now," or " at this time," but simply; for by pro­ <lb/>
            positions of this kind, we also produce syllogisms,2 <note type="footnote"> I i. e. that A is not contingent to every C. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              since when a proposition is taken as to the pre­ <lb/>
              sent it will not be syllogism; since perhaps there <lb/>
              is nothing to hinder " man " from being present <lb/>
              no reference to <lb/>
              time. CY. AId­ <lb/>

              some time or other with every thing moved, viz. if nothing else <lb/>
              is moved, but what is moved is contingent to every "horse," <lb/>
              yet "man" is contingent to no "horse." Moreover, let the <lb/>
              first term be " animal," the middle, "that which is moved," <lb/>
              and the last, "man ;" the propositions will then be alike, but <lb/>
              the conclusion necessary, and not contingent, for "man " is <lb/>
              necessarily "an animal," so that it is evident that the <lb/>
              universal must be taken simply and not deprived <lb/>
              by time.­ <lb/>
              * Example (3.)</p>
          <p>Again, let the proposition A B be universal negative, and <lb/>
            let A be assumed to be present with no B, but <lb/>
            let B contingently be present with every C ; now <lb/>
            2. E pure. A <lb/>
            contingent. <lb/>
            from these positions A must necessarily happen to be present <lb/>
            with no C, for let it not so happen, but let B be supposed to <lb/>
            be present with C, as before ; then A must necessarily be <lb/>
            present with some B, for there is a syllogism in the third <lb/>
            figure, but this is impossible, wherefore A can be contingent <lb/>
            to no U, tor the false and not the impossible being <lb/>
            assumed, the impossible results.† Now this syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is not of the contingent according to the <lb/>
            t Example (4.) <lb/>
            (Vide supra.) <lb/>
            definition, but of what is necessarily present with none, for <lb/>
            this is a contradiction of the given hypothesis, because A was <lb/>
            supposed necessarily present with some C, but the syllogism <lb/>
            per impossible is of an opposite contradiction. Besides, from <lb/>
            the terms it appears clearly that there is no contingent con­ <lb/>
            clusion, for let " crow" stand for A, " that which is intelligent" <lb/>
            for B, and "man" for C ; A is therefore present with no B, <lb/>
            for nothing intelligent is a "crow;" but B is contingent to <lb/>
            every C, since it happens to every "man" to be "intelligent," <lb/>
            but A is necessarily present with no C, where­ <lb/>
            fore the conclusion is not contingent.‡ But <lb/>
            ‡ Example (5.) <lb/>
            neither is the conclusion always necessary, for let A be "what <lb/>
            is moved," B "science," and C "man," A will then be present <lb/>
            with no B, but B is contingent to every C, and the conclusion <note type="footnote"> I Vide Whately's Logic, b. ii. c. 3, sect. 7. <lb/>
            Ex.5. Nothing intelligent is a crow <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            will not be necessary, for it is not necessary that no "man" <lb/>
            should be "moved," but also it is not necessary that a certain <lb/>
            man should be moved; therefore it is clear that the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion is of that which is necessarily present with no one, hence <lb/>
            the terms must be assumed in a better manner.1 But if the <lb/>

            negative be joined to the minor extreme, signify­ <lb/>
            ing to be contingent, from the assumed propositions <lb/>
            there will be no syllogism, but there will be as in the former <note type="footnote"> I That is, instead of science, or an abstract term, we must assume one <lb/>
            which may concur with man, e. g. " scientific," since a man may be <lb/>

              instances, when the contingent proposition is converted. For <lb/>
              let A be present with every B, but B contingent to no C, <lb/>
              now when the terms are thus, there will be nothing necessary <lb/>
              inferred, but if B C be converted, and B be assumed to be <lb/>
              contingent to every C, a syllogism arises as before, since the <lb/>
              terms have a similar position. In the same man­ <lb/>
              ner, when both the propositions are negative, if A <lb/>
              4. Both pre­ <lb/>
              mises negative. <lb/>
              B signifies not being present, but B C to be contingent to no <lb/>
              individual, through these assumptions no necessity arises, but <lb/>
              the contingent proposition being converted, there will be a <lb/>
              syllogism. Let A be assumed present to no B, and B contin­ <lb/>
              gent to no C, nothing necessary is inferred from these; but <lb/>
              if it is assumed that B is contingent to every C, which is <lb/>
              true, and the proposition A B subsists similarly, there will <lb/>
              be again the same syllogism. If however B is assumed as <lb/>
              not present with C, and not that it happens not to be pre­ <lb/>
              sent, there will by no means be a syllogism, neither if the <lb/>
              proposition A B be negative nor affirmative ; but let the com­ <lb/>
              mon terms of necessary presence be "white," "animal," <lb/>
              "snow, and of non-contingency "white, "ani­ <lb/>
              mal," "pitch." * It is evident, therefore, that when <lb/>
              terms are universal, and one of the propositions is <lb/>
              assumed, as simply de inesse, but the other con­ <lb/>
              tingent, when the minor premise is assumed con­ <lb/>
              tingent, a syllogism always arises, except that <lb/>
              sometimes it will be produced from the proposi­ <lb/>
              tions themselves, and at other times from the (con­ <lb/>
              tingent) proposition being converted ; when, how­ <lb/>
              * Example (6.) <lb/>
              5. General law <lb/>
              of mixed syllo­ <lb/>
              gisms ; when <lb/>
              minor premise <lb/>
              is contingent, <lb/>
              a syllogism is <lb/>
              constructed, <lb/>
              either directly <lb/>
              or by conver­ <lb/>
              sion. <lb/>
              ever, each of these occurs, and for what reason, we have <lb/>
              shown. But if one proposition be assumed as universal, and <lb/>
              the other particular, when the universal contin­ <lb/>
              gent is joined to the major extreme, whether it be <lb/>
              affirmative or negative, but the particular is a <lb/>
              simple affirmative de inesse, there will be a perfect <lb/>
              6. Of particu­ <lb/>

              syllogism, just as when the terms are universal, but the <lb/>
              demonstration is the same as before. Now when the major is <lb/>
              2. Major A or <lb/>
              E pure. <lb/>
              universal, simple, and not contingent, but the other <lb/>
              (the minor) particular and contingent, if both <lb/>
              propositions be assumed affirmative or negative, or if one be <lb/>
              affirmative and the other negative, there will always be an <lb/>
              incomplete syllogism, except that some will be demonstrated <lb/>
              per impossibile, but others by conversion of the contingent <lb/>
              3. <lb/>
              proposition, as in the former cases. There will <lb/>
              also be a syllogism, through conversion, when the <lb/>
              universal major signifies simply inesse, or non-inesse, but the <lb/>
              particular being negative, assumes the contingent, as if A is <lb/>
              present, or not present, with every B, that B happens not to <lb/>
              be present with a certain C ; for the contingent proposition <lb/>
              4. <lb/>
              B C being converted, there is a syllogism. Still <lb/>
              when the particular proposition assumes the not <lb/>
              being present with, there will not be a syllogism. Now let <lb/>
              the terms of presence be "white," "animal," "snow," but of <lb/>
              not being present "white," "animal," "pitch," for the demon­ <lb/>
              * Example (7.) <lb/>
              7. If the major <lb/>
              is particular <lb/>
              there will be no <lb/>
              syllogism, nor <lb/>
              if both premises <lb/>
              be particular <lb/>
              or indefinite. <lb/>
              stration must be assumed through the indefinite.* <lb/>
              Yet if the universal be joined to the less extreme, <lb/>
              but particular to the greater, whether negative or <lb/>
              affirmative, contingent or pure, there will by no <lb/>
              means be a syllogism, nor if particular or inde­ <lb/>
              finite propositions be assumed, whether they take <lb/>
              the contingent, or simply the being present with, <lb/>
              or vice versa, will there thus be a syllogism, and the demon­ <lb/>
              stration is the same as before; let however the common terms <lb/>
              of being present with from necessity be "animal," "white," <lb/>
              t Example (8.) <lb/>
              "man;" and of not being contingent "animal," <lb/>
              "white," "garment."† Hence it is evident, that <lb/>

            character.</p>
          <p>WHEN one is a necessary proposition simple, de <lb/>
            inesse, or non-inesse, and the other signifies being <lb/>
            contingent, there will be a syllogism, the terms <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVI.]</note><lb/>
            the minor premise1 is necessary; the conclusion however, when <lb/>
            the terms are affirmative, will be contingent, and not simple, <lb/>
            whether they are universal or not universal. Nevertheless, if <lb/>
            one proposition be affirmative, and the other negative, when <lb/>
            the affirmative is necessary, the conclusion will in like manner <lb/>
            signify the being contingent, and not the not-existing or being <lb/>
            present with; and when the negative is necessary, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion will be of the contingent non-inesse, and of the sim­ <lb/>
            ple non-inesse, whether the terms are universal or not. The <lb/>
            contingent also in the conclusion, is to be assumed in the same <lb/>
            way as in the former syllogisms, but there will not be a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism wherein the non-inesse will be necessarily inferred, for <lb/>
            it is one thing "inesse" not necessarily, and another "non- <lb/>
            inesse" necessarily. Wherefore, it is evident that <lb/>
            when the terms are affirmative, there will not be <lb/>
            a necessary conclusion. For let A necessarily be <lb/>
            present with every B, but let B be contingent to <lb/>
            every C, there will then be an incomplete syllo- <lb/>

              monstration, for this may be shown after the same manner as <lb/>
              in the former syllogisms. Again, let A be contingent to <lb/>
              every B, but let B be necessarily present with every C, there <lb/>
              will then be a syllogism wherein A happens to be present with <lb/>
              every C, but not (simply) is it present with every C, also it will <lb/>
              be complete, and not incomplete, for it is completed by the first <lb/>
              1. Negative <lb/>
              necessary. <lb/>
              propositions. Notwithstanding, if the propositions <lb/>
              are not of similar form, first, let the negative one <lb/>
              be necessary, and let A necessarily be contingent to no B, but <lb/>
              let B be contingent to every C; therefore, it is necessary that <lb/>
              A should be present with no C; for let it be assumed present, <lb/>
              either with every or with some one, yet it was supposed to <lb/>
              be contingent to no B. Since then a negative proposition is <lb/>
              convertible, neither will B be contingent to any A, but A is <lb/>
              supposed to be present with every or with some C, hence B <lb/>
              will happen to be present with no, or not with every C, it <lb/>
              * Example (1.) <lb/>
              was however supposed, from the first, to be pre­ <lb/>
              sent with every C.* Still it is evident, that there <lb/>
              may also be a syllogism of the contingent non-inesse, as there <lb/>
              2. Affirmative <lb/>
              necessary. <lb/>
              is one of the simple non-inesse. Moreover, let <lb/>
              the affirmative proposition be necessary, and let <lb/>
              A be contingently present with no B, but B necessarily pre­ <lb/>
              sent with every C: this syllogism then will be perfect, yet <lb/>
              not of the simple, but of the contingent non-inesse, for the <lb/>
              proposition (viz. the contingent non-inesse) was assumed from <lb/>
              the major extreme, and there cannot be a deduction to the <lb/>
              impossible, for if A is supposed to be present with a certain <lb/>
              C, and it is admitted that A is contingently present with no <lb/>
              B, nothing impossible will arise therefrom. But if the minor <lb/>
              3. Minor nega­ <lb/>
              tive contingent. <lb/>
              premise be negative when it is contingent, there <lb/>
              will be a syllogism by conversion, as in the former <lb/>
              cases, but when it is not contingent, there will not be; nor <lb/>
              when both premises are negative, but the minor not contin­ <lb/>
              gent : let the terms be the same of the simple inesse " white," <lb/>
              t Example (2.) <lb/>
              "anima,""snow," and of the non-inesse white, <lb/>
              It animal," "pitch."†</p>
          <p>The same will also happen in particular syllogisms, for when <lb/>

            ticular syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms. <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            the negative is necessary, the conclusion will be of <lb/>
            the simple non-inesse. Thus if A is contingently <lb/>
            present with no B, but B contingently present with <lb/>
            a certain C. it is necessary that A should not be <pb n="121"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XVI.]</note><lb/>
            present with a certain C, since if it is present with every C, but <lb/>
            is contingent to no B, neither will B be contingently pres( nt <lb/>
            with any A. So that if A is present with every C, B is con­ <lb/>
            tingent with no C, but it was supposed contingent to a cer­ <lb/>
            tain C. When however in a negative syllogism the particular <lb/>
            affirmative is necessary, as for example B C, or <lb/>
            the universal in an affirmative syllogism, e. g. A <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            B, there will not be a syllogism de inesse, the demon­ <lb/>
            stration however is the same as in the former cases. But if <lb/>
            the minor premise be universal, whether affirm­ <lb/>
            ative or negative and contingent, but the major <lb/>
            3. <lb/>
            particular necessary, there will not be a syllogism, let the <lb/>
            terms of necessary presence be "animal," "white," "man," <lb/>
            and of the non-contingent "animal " white, <lb/>
            " garment." * But when the universal is neces­ <lb/>
            *Example (3.) <lb/>
            sary, and the particular contingent, the universal being nega­ <lb/>
            tive, let the terms of presence1 be "animal," "white," <lb/>
            "crow," and of non-inesse "animal," " white," <lb/>
            " pitch." †</p>
          <p>But when (the universal) affirms let the terms <lb/>
            of presence be " animal," " white," " swan," but <lb/>
            of the non-contingent be " animal," " white," <lb/>
            " snow." ‡ Nor will there be a syllogism when in­ <lb/>
            definite propositions are assumed or both particular, <lb/>
            let the common terms, de inesse, be "animal," <lb/>

              that these terms are useful for all.- <lb/>
              From what has been said then it appears that when the <lb/>

              from the above. <lb/>
              (Compare c. 15.) <lb/>
              a syllogism does and does not occur, except that <lb/>
              if the negative proposition be assumed de inesse <lb/>
              there will be a syllogism with a contingent (con­ <lb/>
              elusion), but when the negative is necessary there will be one <lb/>
              of the character of the contingent and of the non-inesse, but <lb/>
              it is clear also that all the syllogisms are incomplete,1 and that <lb/>
              they are completed through the above-named figures.</p>

          <p>IN the second figure, when both premises are as­ <lb/>
            sumed contingent, there will be no syllogism, nei­ <lb/>
            ther when they are taken as affirmative, nor nega­ <lb/>

            signifies the simple inesse, and the other the contingent, if the <lb/>
            affirmative signifies the inesse, there will never be a syllogism, <lb/>
            but if the universal negative (be pure, there will) always (be a <figure type="illustration">

              syllogism). In the same manner, when one premise is assumed <lb/>
              as necessary, but the other contingent; still in these syllogisms <lb/>
              we must consider the contingent in the conclusions, <lb/>
              as we did in the former ones. Now in the first place, <lb/>
              we must show that a contingent negative is not con­ <lb/>
              vertible, e. g. if A is contingent to no B, it is not <lb/>

              vertible. <lb/>
              necessary that B should also be contingent to no A. For let this <lb/>
              be assumed, and let B be contingently present with no A, there­ <lb/>
              fore since contingent affirmatives, both contrary and contra­ <lb/>
              dictory, are convertible into negatives, and B is contingently <lb/>
              present with no A, it is clear that B may be contingently <lb/>
              present with every A; but this is false, for if <lb/>
              this is contingent to all of that, it is not necessary <lb/>
              1. <lb/>
              that that should be contingent to this, wherefore a negative <lb/>
              (contingent) is not convertible. Moreover, there is nothing <lb/>
              to prevent A being contingent to no B, but B not necessarily <lb/>
              present with a certain A, e. g. "whiteness " may happen not <lb/>
              to be present with every "man," (for it may also happen) to <lb/>
              be present; but it is not true to say, that man is contingently <lb/>
              present with nothing " white," for he is necessarily not pre­ <lb/>
              sent with many things (white), and the necessary is not the <lb/>
              contingent. Neither can it be shown convertible per impos­ <lb/>
              sibile, as if a man should think, since it is false that B is con­ <lb/>
              tingently present with no A, that it is true that it <lb/>
              (A) is not contingent to no one (B), for these are <lb/>
              2. <lb/>
              affirmation and negation; but it this be true B is necessarily <lb/>
              present with a certain A, therefore A is also with a certain B, <lb/>
              but this is impossible, since it does not follow if B is not con­ <lb/>
              tingent to no A, that it is necessarily present with a certain A. <lb/>
              ror not to be contingent to no individual, is pre­ <lb/>
              dicated two ways, the one if a thing is necessarily <lb/>
              present with something, and the other if it is <lb/>
              necessarily not present with something. For what <lb/>
              necessarily is not present with a certain A, can­ <lb/>
              not be truly said to be contingently not present <lb/>
              3. Contingency <lb/>
              predicated ne­ <lb/>
              gatively in two <lb/>
              ways-the cha­ <lb/>
              racter of the <lb/>
              consequent <lb/>
              opposition. <lb/>
              with every A; as neither can what is necessarily present <lb/>
              with a certain thing, be truly said to be contingently present <lb/>
              with every thing; if, then, any one thinks that because C is <lb/>
              not contingently present with every D, it is necessarily not <lb/>
              present with a certain D, he would infer falsely, for, per­ <lb/>
              chance, it is present with every D; still because a thing is <pb n="124"/>
               <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
              necessarily present with certain things, on this account, we <lb/>
              say that it is not contingent to every individual. Wherefore <lb/>
              the being present necessarily with a certain thing, and the <lb/>
              not being present with a certain thing necessarily, are op­ <lb/>
              posed to the being contingently present with every individual, <lb/>
              and in like manner, there is a similar opposition to the being <lb/>
              contingent to no individual. Hence it is evident, that when <lb/>
              the contingent and non-contingent are taken, in the manner <lb/>
              we first defined, not only the necessarily being present with <lb/>
              a certain thing, but also the necessarily not being present <lb/>
              with it, ought to be assumed; but when this is assumed, there <lb/>
              is no impossibility to a syllogism being produced, whence it <lb/>
              is evident, from what we have stated, that a negative con­ <lb/>
              tingent is not convertible.</p>
          <p>4. From two <lb/>
            premises uni­ <lb/>
            versal (A) or <lb/>
            (E) contingent <lb/>
            in the 2nd <lb/>
            figure, no syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is con­ <lb/>
            structed.</p>
          <p>This then being demonstrated, let A be as- <lb/>
            Burned contingent to no B, but contingent to <lb/>
            every C; by conversion, therefore, there will not <lb/>
            be a syllogism, for it has been said that a proposi­ <lb/>
            tion of this kind is inconvertible, neither, however, <lb/>
            will there be by a deduction per impossibile. For <lb/>
            B being assumed contingently present with every C, nothing <lb/>
            false will happen, for A may contingently be present with <lb/>
            * Example (1.) <lb/>
            every, and with no C.*1 In short, if there is a <lb/>
            syllogism, it is clear that it will be of the contin­ <lb/>
            gent, (because neither proposition is assumed as de inesse,) <lb/>
            and this either affirmative, or negative; it is possible, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in neither way, since, if the affirmative be assumed, it <lb/>
            can be shown by the terms, that it is not contingently present; <lb/>
            but if the negative, that the conclusion is not contingent, but <lb/>
            necessary. For let A be "white," B "man," and C "horse," A <lb/>
            therefore, i. e. "whiteness," is contingently present with every <lb/>
            individual of the one, though with no individual of the other, <figure type="illustration">

              1. <lb/>
              with no B, but contingent with every C, then by <lb/>
              conversion of the negative, B will be present with <lb/>
              no A, but A is contingent to every C, therefore there is a <lb/>
              syllogism in the first figure, that B is contingent to no C. <lb/>
              So also if the negative be added to C; but if both propositions <lb/>
              be negative, and one signifies the simple, but the other the <lb/>
              contingent non-inesse, from these assumed propositions nothing <lb/>
              necessary is inferred, but the contingent proposition being <lb/>
              converted,1 there is a syllogism, wherein B is contingently <lb/>
              present with no C, as in the former, for again there will be <lb/>
              the first figure. If, however, both propositions be assumed <note type="footnote"> I If the contingent negative proposition be changed into an affirmative. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              affirmative, there will not be a syllogism : let the <lb/>
              terms of presence be "health," "animal," "man," <lb/>
              but of not being present with "health," " horse," <lb/>
              " man."* The same will happen in the case of <lb/>
              particular syllogisms, for when the affirmative is <lb/>
              pure, taken either universally, or particularly, <lb/>
              there will be no syllogism, and this is shown <lb/>
              in like manner through the same terms as be­ <lb/>
              fore.! But when the negative is simple, there <lb/>

              no necessity will result, but the contingent being converted as <lb/>
              before there will be a syllogism. If however the negative <lb/>
              be pure but particular, there will not be a syllogism, whether <lb/>
              the other premise be affirmative or negative. Neither will <lb/>

          <p>IF however one premise signifies the being present <lb/>
            necessarily, but the other contingently, when the <lb/>
            negative is necessary there will be a syllogism, <lb/>
            wherein not only the contingent but also the simple <lb/>
            non-inesse (maybe inferred), but when the affirm a­ <lb/>
            tive (is necessary) there will be no syllogism. For <lb/>
            1. Rule, in <lb/>
            these when the <lb/>
            negative pre­ <lb/>
            mise is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism may be <lb/>
            constructed. <lb/>
            1. Case. <lb/>
            let A be assumed necessarily present with no B, but contingent <lb/>
            to every C, then by conversion of the negative neither will B be <lb/>
            present with any A, but A was contingent to every C, wherefore <lb/>
            there is again a syllogism in the first figure, so that B is con­ <lb/>
            tingently present with no C. At the same time it is shown that <lb/>
            neither is B present with any C, for let it be assumed to be <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_34_fig31.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="128"/>
               <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
              present, therefore if A is contingent to no B, but B is present <lb/>
              with a certain C, A is not contingent to a certain C, but it <lb/>
              was supposed contingent to every C, and it may be shown <lb/>
              after the same manner, if the negative be added to C. Again, <lb/>
              2. Case of a ne­ <lb/>
              cessary affirm­ <lb/>
              ative. <lb/>
              let the affirmative proposition be necessary, but <lb/>
              the other negative and contingent, and let A be <lb/>
              contingent to no B, but necessarily present with <lb/>
              every C ; now when the terms are thus, there will be no syl­ <lb/>
              logism, for it may happen that B is necessarily not present <lb/>
              with C. Let A be " white," B " man," C " a swan;" "white­ <lb/>
              ness," then, is necessarily present with " a swan," but is con­ <lb/>
              tingent to no "man," and " man " is necessarily present with <lb/>
              no "swan;" therefore that there will be no syllogism of the <lb/>
              * Example (1.) <lb/>
              contingent is palpable, for what is necessary is not <lb/>
              contingent.*1 Yet neither will there be a syllogism <lb/>
              of the necessary, for the latter is either inferred from two ne­ <lb/>
              cessary premises, or from a negative (necessary premise) ; be­ <lb/>
              sides, from these data it follows that B may be present with <lb/>
              C, for there is nothing to prevent C from being under B, and <lb/>
              A from being contingent to every B, and necessarily present <lb/>
              with C, as if C is "awake," B "animal," and A "motion;" <lb/>
              for "motion " is necessarily present with whatever is "awake," <lb/>
              but contingent to every " animal," and every thing which is <lb/>
              t Example (2.) <lb/>
              " awake is " an animal."† Hence it appears <lb/>
              that neither the non-inesse is inferred, since if the <lb/>
              terms are thus the inesse is necessary, nor when the enunci­ <lb/>
              ations are opposite,2 so that there will be no syllogism. There <note type="footnote"> 1 Ex. I. It happens that no man is white <lb/>

              is present with no A, and A is contingent with every C, and <lb/>
              the first figure is produced ; the same would also occur if the <lb/>

              4. Case of both <lb/>
              affirmative. <lb/>
              tive, there will not be a syllogism, clearly not of <lb/>
              the non-inesse, nor of the necessary non-inesse, <lb/>
              because a negative premise is. not assumed, nei­ <lb/>
              ther in the simple, nor in the necessary inesse. Neither, <lb/>
              again, will there be a syllogism of the contingent non- <lb/>
              inesse, for necessary terms being assumed, B will not be pre­ <lb/>
              sent with C, e. g. if A be assumed "white," B "a swan," and <lb/>
              C "man;" nor will there be from opposite affirmations, since <lb/>
              B has been shown necessarily not present with C, in short, <lb/>

              syllogisms. <lb/>
              therefore, a syllogism will not be produced.- It <lb/>
              will happen the same in particular syllogisms, for <lb/>
              when the negative is universal and necessary, <lb/>
              there will always be a syllogism of the contingent, <lb/>
              and of the non-inesse, but the demonstration will <lb/>
              be by conversion ; still, when the affirmative (is necessary), <lb/>
              there will never be a syllogism, and this may be shown in <lb/>
              t Example (4.) <lb/>
              ‡ Example (5.) <lb/>
              the same way as in the universals, and by the <lb/>
              same terms.t Nor when both premises are as­ <lb/>
              sumed affirmative, for of this there is the same <lb/>
              demonstration as before,‡ but when both are ne­ <lb/>
              gative, and that which signifies the non-inesse is universal, <lb/>
              and necessary; the necessary will not be concluded through <lb/>
              the propositions, but the contingent being converted, there <lb/>
              will be a syllogism as before. If however both propositions are <lb/>
              laid down indefinite, or particular, there will not be a syllogism, <lb/>
              § Example (6.) <lb/>
              and the demonstration is the same, and by the <lb/>
              same terms. §</p>
          <p>It appears then, from what we have said, that an universal, <lb/>
            and necessary negative being assumed, there is always a <lb/>
            syllogism, not only of the contingent, but also of the simple <lb/>

            non-inesse; but with a necessary affirmative, there <lb/>
            will never be a syllogism ; also that when the <lb/>
            terms subsist in the same manner, in necessary, <lb/>
            as in simple propositions, there is, and is not, a syllogism; <lb/>

            the other, the simple inesse. Still when one premise is as­ <lb/>

            fore ; in these however the contingent must be similarly taken <lb/>
            in the conclusions. First then let the premises <lb/>
            be contingent, and let A and B be contingently <lb/>
            present with every C ; since therefore a particular <lb/>

            mises contin­ <lb/>
            gent. <lb/>
            affirmative is convertible, but B is contingent to every C, <lb/>
            C will also be contingent to a certain B, therefore if A is con­ <lb/>

            necessary also that A should be contingent to a certain B, for <lb/>
            the first figure is produced. If again A is con­ <lb/>

            the necessary will not result, but the propositions <lb/>

              they are so, as in the case of simple incase, there <lb/>
              will, and will not, be a syllogism; for let A be <lb/>
              contingently present with every C, and B present with <lb/>
              a certain C, there will again be the first figure by con­ <lb/>
              version of the particular proposition, since if A is contingent <lb/>

            and another <lb/>
            contingent pre­ <lb/>
            mise. (Vide <lb/>
            supra.) <lb/>
            1st case, Both <lb/>
            affirmative.</p>
          <p>IF however one premise signifies the inesse, but <lb/>
            the other the contingent, the conclusion will be <lb/>
            that a thing is contingent to, and not that it is <lb/>
            present with (another), and there will be a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, the terms subsisting in the same manner as <lb/>
            the previous ones. For, first, let them be affirm­ <lb/>
            ative, and let A be in every C, but B contingent <lb/>
            with every C; B C then being converted there <lb/>
            will be the first figure, and the conclusion will be that A is <lb/>
            contingently present with a certain B, for when one premise <lb/>
            in the first figure signifies the contingent, the conclusion also <lb/>
            2nd, Minor sim­ <lb/>
            ple affirmative, <lb/>
            major contin­ <lb/>
            was contingent. In like manner if the proposition <lb/>
            B C2 be of the simple inesse, but the proposition <note type="footnote"> Predicative."—Averrcis. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 That is, the minor. </note> <pb n="133"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXI.]</note><lb/>
            A C be contingent, and if A C1 be negative, but <lb/>
            B C affirmative, and either of them be pure; in <lb/>
            ;ent and nega. <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            both ways the conclusion will be contingent, since again there <lb/>
            arises the first figure. Now it has been shown that where <lb/>
            one premise in that figure signifies the contingent, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion also will be contingent; if however the negative <lb/>
            be annexed to the minor premise, or both be as­ <lb/>
            sumed as negative, through the propositions laid <lb/>
            down themselves, there will not indeed be a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, but by their conversion 2 there will be, as in <lb/>
            the former cases. <lb/>
            3rd, From a ne­ <lb/>
            gative minor or <lb/>
            from two nega­ <lb/>
            tives, no syllo­ <lb/>
            gism results.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless if one premise be universal and <lb/>
            the other particular, yet both affirmative, or the <lb/>
            4. Cases of <lb/>
            particulars. <lb/>
            universal negative but the particular affirmative, there will <lb/>
            be the same mode of syllogisms; for all are com­ <lb/>
            pleted by the first figure, so that it is evident there <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            will be a syllogism of the contingent and not of the inesse. <lb/>
            If however the affirmative be universal and the negative par <lb/>
            ticular, the demonstration will be per impossible ; <lb/>
            for let B be with every C and A happen not to be <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            with a certain C, it is necessary then that A should happen not <lb/>
            to be with a certain B, since if A is necessarily with every B, <lb/>
            but B is assumed to be with every C, A will necessarily be with <lb/>
            every C, which was demonstrated before, but by hypothesis <lb/>
            A happens not to be with a certain C.</p>
          <p>When both premises are assumed indefinite, or particular, there <lb/>
            will not be a syllogism, and the demonstration is the <lb/>
            same as in universal and by the same terms.­ <lb/>

          <p>1. Rules for <lb/>
            universals in <lb/>
            the third figure, <lb/>
            with one neces­ <lb/>
            sary, and the <lb/>
            other contin­ <lb/>
            gent premise.</p>
          <p>IF one premise be necessary, but the other con­ <lb/>
            tingent, the terms being affirmative there will be <lb/>
            always a syllogism of the contingent; but when <lb/>
            one is affirmative but the other negative, if the <lb/>
            affirmative be necessary there will be a syllogism <lb/>
            of the contingent non-inesse; if however it be <lb/>
            negative, there will be one both of the contingent and of the <lb/>
            absolute non-inesse. There will not however be a syllogism <lb/>
            of the necessary non-inesse, as neither in the other figures. <lb/>
            Let then, first, the terms be affirmative, and let A be neces­ <lb/>
            :. Each propo­ <lb/>
            sition, affirma­ <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            sarily with every C, but B happen to be with every <lb/>
            C ; therefore since A is necessarily with every C, <lb/>
            but C is contingent to a certain B, A will also be <lb/>
            contingently, and not necessarily, with some certain B ; for thus <lb/>
            it is concluded in the first figure. It can be similarly proved <lb/>
            * Example (1.) <lb/>

          <p>Again, let one premise be affirmative, but the <lb/>
            other negative, and let the affirmative be neces­ <lb/>
            sary ; let also A happen to be with no C, but let B <lb/>
            necessarily be with every C ; again there will be the first figure ; 1 <figure type="illustration">

              for the negative premise signifies the being contingent, it is <lb/>
              evident therefore that the conclusion will be contingent, for <lb/>
              when the premises were thus in the first figure, the conclusion <lb/>
              was also contingent. But if the negative premise be neces­ <lb/>
              sary, the conclusion will be that it is contingent, not to be with <lb/>
              something, and that it is not with it; for let A be supposed <lb/>
              necessarily not with C, but contingent to every B, then the <lb/>
              affirmative proposition B C being converted, there will be the <lb/>
              first figure, and the negative premise will be necessary. But <lb/>
              when the premises are thus, it results that A happens not to <lb/>
              be with a certain C, and that it is not with it; wherefore it is ne­ <lb/>
              cessary also that A should not be with a certain B. <lb/>
              When however the minor premise is assumed ne- <lb/>
              3. Vice versâ. <lb/>
              gative there will be a syllogism, if that be contingent by the <lb/>
              premise being converted as in the former cases, but if it be ne­ <lb/>
              cessary there will not be, for it is necessary to be with every, and <lb/>
              happens to be with none ; let the terms of being with every in­ <lb/>
              dividual, be “sleep,” a sleeping horse," "man ;" of <lb/>
              being with none " sleep," a "waking horse," " man."* <lb/>
              * Example (2.)</p>
          <p>It will happen in the same way, if one term be <lb/>
            joined to the middle universally, but the other <lb/>
            partially, for both being affirmative there will be <lb/>
            4. Case of par­ <lb/>
            ticulars. <lb/>
            a syllogism of the contingent, and not of the absolute, also <lb/>
            when the one is assumed as negative but the other affirmative, <lb/>
            and the affirmative is necessary. But when the negative is <lb/>
            necessary, the conclusion will also be of the not being present <lb/>
            with; for there will be the same mode of demonstration, <lb/>
            whether the terms are universal or not universal, since it is <lb/>
            necessary that the syllogisms be completed by the first figure, <lb/>
            so that it is requisite that the same should result, in these, 1 <figure type="illustration">

              as in those.1 When however the negative, universally as. <lb/>
              Burned, is joined to the less extreme, if it be contingent, there <lb/>
              will be a syllogism by conversion, but if it be necessary there <lb/>
              will not be, and this may be shown in the same mode as in <lb/>
              4 Example (3.) <lb/>
              universal, and by the same terms. † Wherefore <lb/>
              in this figure it it is evident, when and how there <lb/>
              will be a syllogism,2 and when of the contingent, and when of <lb/>
              the absolute, all also it is clear are imperfect, and are perfected <lb/>
              by the first figure.</p>

          <p>1. Observations <lb/>
            preliminary to <lb/>
            proving that <lb/>
            every syllogism <lb/>
            results from <lb/>
            universals of <lb/>
            the first figure.</p>
          <p>THAT the syllogisms then in these figures are com­ <lb/>
            pleted by the universal syllogisms in the first <lb/>
            figure, and are reduced to these, is evident from <lb/>
            what has been said ; but that in short every syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is thus, will now be evident, when it shall be <lb/>
            shown that every syllogism is produced by some <lb/>
            one of these figures.</p>
          <p>2 Syllogism <lb/>
            must demon­ <lb/>
            strate the abso­ <lb/>
            lute univers­ <lb/>
            ally or particu­ <lb/>
            larly. Of the os­ <lb/>
            tensive.</p>
          <p>It is then necessary that every demonstration, <lb/>
            and every syllogism, should show either something <lb/>
            inesse or non-inesse, and this either universally <lb/>
            or partially, moreover either ostensively or by <lb/>
            hypothesis. A part however of that which is by <lb/>
            hypothesis is produced per impossible, therefore <lb/>
            let us first speak of the ostensive (syllogisms), and when these <lb/>
            are shown, it will be evident also in the case of those lead­ <lb/>
            ing to the impossibile, and generally of those by hypothesis.</p>
          <p>S. For a aim­ <lb/>
            ple conclusion <lb/>
            we must have <lb/>
            two proposi­ <lb/>
            tions.</p>
          <p>If then it is necessary to syllogize A of B either <lb/>
            as being with or as not being with, we must as­ <lb/>
            sume something of something, if then A be as­ <lb/>
            sumed of B, that which was from the first (pro­ <lb/>
            posed) will be assumed (to be proved), but if A be assumed <lb/>
            of C, but C of nothing, nor any thing else of it, nor of A, there <lb/>
            will be no syllogism, for there is no necessary result from as­ <lb/>
            suming one thing of one, so that we must take another pre­ <lb/>
            mise. If then A be assumed of something else, or something <note type="footnote"> 1 In syllogisms of the third. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. there will be a syllogism from both propositions being contin­ <lb/>
            gent, or from one being pure and the other contingent, or from one neces­ <lb/>
            sary and the other contingent. </note> <pb n="137"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXIII.]</note><lb/>
            else of A, or of C, there is nothing to hinder a syllogism, it <lb/>
            will not however appertain to B I from the assumptions. Nor <lb/>
            when C is predicated of something else, and that of another, <lb/>
            and this last of a third,2 if none of these belong to B, neither <lb/>
            thus will there be a syllogism with reference to B, since in <lb/>
            short we say that there never will be a syllogism of one thing <lb/>
            in respect of another unless a certain middle is assumed, which <lb/>
            refers in some way to each extreme in predication. For a <lb/>
            syllogism is simply from premises, but that which pertains to <lb/>
            this in relation to that, is from premises belonging to this in <lb/>
            relation to that,3 but it is impossible to assume a premise re­ <lb/>
            lating to B, if we neither affirm nor deny any thing of it, or <lb/>
            again of A in relation to B, if we assume nothing common, <lb/>
            but affirm or deny certain peculiarities of each. <lb/>
            Hence a certain middle of both must be taken, <lb/>
            which unites the predications, if there shall be a <lb/>
            syllogism of one in relation to the other; now if <lb/>
            it is necessary to assume something common to <lb/>
            both, this happens in a three-fold manner, (since <lb/>
            4. These con­ <lb/>
            nected by a <lb/>
            middle term; <lb/>
            which con­ <lb/>
            nexion is three- <lb/>
            fold. (Vide <lb/>
            AId rich.) <lb/>
            we either predicate A of C, and C of B, 4 or C5 of both or <lb/>
            both of C,6) but these are the before-mentioned figures—it is <lb/>
            evident that every syllogism is necessarily produced by some <lb/>
            one of these figures, for there is the same reasoning, if A be <lb/>
            connected with B, even through many media, for the figure in <lb/>
            many media will be the same.</p>
          <p>Wherefore that all ostensive syllogisms are <lb/>
            perfected by the above-named figures is clear, also <lb/>
            that those per impossibile (are so perfected) will <lb/>
            appear from these, for all syllogismi concluding <lb/>

            gisms per im­ <lb/>

            is the same <lb/>
            method. <lb/>
            per impossibile collect the false, but they prove by hypothesis <lb/>
            the original proposition, when contradiction being admitted <lb/>
            some impossibility results,7 as for instance that the diameter of <lb/>
            a square is incommensurate with the side, because, a common <lb/>
            measure being given, the odd would be equal to the even. <note type="footnote"> 1 A will not be concluded of B—but something else. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e.

            They collect then that the odd would be equal to the even, <lb/>
            but show from hypothesis that the diameter is incommen­ <lb/>
            surate, since a falsity occurs by contradiction. This then it <lb/>
            I. What this <lb/>
            kind of syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is. <lb/>
            is, to syllogize per impossibile, namely, to show an <lb/>
            impossibility from the original hypothesis, so that <lb/>
            as by reasonings leading to the impossible, an <lb/>
            ostensive syllogism of the false arises, but the original propo­ <lb/>
            sition is proved by hypothesis ; and we have before said <lb/>
            about ostensive syllogisms, that they are perfected by these <lb/>
            figures—it is evident that syllogisms also per impossibile will <lb/>
            be formed through these figures. Likewise all others which <lb/>
            are by hypothesis, for in all there is a syllogism of that which <lb/>
            is assumed, 1 but the original proposition is proved by con­ <lb/>
            fession, or some other hypothesis. Now if this is true, it is <lb/>
            necessary that every demonstration and syllogism should arise <lb/>

            through the three figures before named, and this <lb/>

          <p>MOREOVER it is necessary in every syllogism, that <lb/>
            one term should be affirmative and one universal, <lb/>
            for without the universal there will not be a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, or one not pertaining to the thing proposed, <lb/>
            or the original (question) will be the subject of <lb/>
            petition.2 For let it be proposed that pleasure from music is <note type="footnote">If A is B, then P is Q, <lb/>
            But that P is Q is absurd. <lb/>
            .. If it is absurd to say that P is Q, it is absurd to say that A is B. <lb/>
            . *. A is not B. Q. E. D. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταλαμβαόμενον</foreign>.—For example, in the hypothetical <lb/>
            syllogism-If the soul is moved by itself it is immortal: but it is moved <lb/>
            by itself, . . it is immortal: the assumption is, the soul is moved by <lb/>
            itself. The disjunctive syllogism owes its origin to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">άπαγωγὴ έιςτὸ <lb/>
            άδύνατον</foreign>, one of the principal kinds of hypothetical mentioned by Aris­ <lb/>

            commendable, if then any one should require it to be granted <lb/>
            that pleasure is commendable, and did not add all pleasure, <lb/>
            there would not be a syllogism, but if that a certain pleasure <lb/>
            is so, if indeed it is a different pleasure, it is nothing to the <lb/>
            purpose, but if it is the same it is a petitio principii, this will <lb/>
            however be more evident in diagrams, for instance, let it be <lb/>
            required to show that the angles at the base of an isosceles <lb/>
            triangle are equal.1 Let the lines A B be drawn to the centre of <lb/>
            a circle, if then he assumes the angle A C to be equal to the <lb/>
            angle B D, not in short requiring it to be granted that the angles <lb/>
            of semicircles are equal, and again that C is equal to D, not <lb/>
            assuming the whole (angle) of the section, if besides he assumes <lb/>
            that equal parts being taken from equal whole angles, the re­ <lb/>
            maining angles E F are equal, he will beg the original (question), <lb/>
            unless he assume that if equals are taken from equals the remain­ <lb/>
            ders are equal. Wherefore in all syllogism we must have an <lb/>
            universal; universal is also shown from all universal terms, but <lb/>
            the particular in this or that way, so that if the <lb/>
            conclusion be universal, the terms must of necessity <lb/>
            be universal, but if the terms be universal, the <lb/>
            conclusion may happen not to be universal. It <lb/>
            appears also that in every syllogism either both <lb/>
            premises or one of them must be similar to the <lb/>
            conclusion, I mean not only in its being affirm­ <lb/>
            ative or negative,but in that it is either necessary, <lb/>
            or absolute, or contingent; we must also have <lb/>
            regard to other modes of predication.2 <lb/>
            2. An universal <lb/>
            conclusion fol­ <lb/>
            lows from uni­ <lb/>
            versal premises <lb/>
            but sometimes <lb/>
            only a particu­ <lb/>

            3. One premise <lb/>
            must resemble <lb/>
            the conclusion <lb/>
            in character <lb/>
            and quality.</p>
          <p>In a word then it is shown when there will and will not be a <lb/>
            syllogism, also when it is posse, and when per­ <lb/>
            fect, and that when there is a syllogism it must have <lb/>
            its terms according to some one of the above modes. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion is convey­ <lb/>
            ed by three <lb/>
            terms only­ <lb/>
            proof.</p>
          <p>IT appears that every demonstration will be by <lb/>
            three terms and no more, unless the same con­ <lb/>
            clusion should result through different arguments, <lb/>
            as E2 through A B,3 and through C D,4 or through <lb/>
            A B, A C, and B C, for there is nothing to prevent many <lb/>
            media subsisting of the same (conclusions). But these being <lb/>
            (many), there is not one syllogism, but many syllogisms; or <lb/>
            again, when each of the propositions A B is assumed by syl­ <lb/>
            *F the major, <lb/>
            G the minor. <lb/>
            logism, as A through D E,5 and again B through <lb/>
            F G,* or when the one is by induction,6 but the <lb/>
            other by syllogism. Thus in this manner indeed <lb/>
            there are many syllogisms, for there are many conclusions, as <lb/>
            A and B and C, and if there are not many but one, it is thus <lb/>
            2. The same <lb/>
            conclusion may <lb/>
            arise from <lb/>
            many syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms. <lb/>
            t i. e. that <lb/>
            there should be <lb/>
            more than <lb/>
            three terms. <lb/>
            possible, that the same conclusion may arise <lb/>
            through many syllogisms, but in order that C may <lb/>
            be proved through A B, it is impossible.† For <lb/>
            let the conclusion be E, collected from A B C D, <lb/>
            it is then necessary that some one of these should <lb/>
            be assumed with reference to something else, as a <lb/>
            whole, but another as a part, for this has been <lb/>
            shown before, that when there is a syllogism, some of the <lb/>
            terms should necessarily thus subsist; let then A be thus with <lb/>
            reference to B, from these there is a certain conclusion, which <lb/>
            is either E or C or D, or some other different from these. <note type="footnote"> ing more particularly, the reader is referred to Mansel's, Whately's, and <lb/>
            Hill's Logic. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The Leipsic copy omits the example, and Taylor's reading is some­ <lb/>

            syllogism is proved—E the minor of the same. Though in the first part <lb/>
            E signifies the conclusion of the principal syllogism, yet the conclusion is <lb/>
            at present called C.—Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 As far as induction is logical at all, in its process it is equally formal <lb/>
            with, though it proceeds in an inverse order to, syllogism. It is defined <lb/>
            by Aristotle, proving the major term of the middle by means of the minor. <lb/>
            Anal. Pr. ii. 23. The Sorites is not recognised distinctively by Aristotle, <lb/>
            though, as Melancthon observes, it is implied in Cat. 3, and is alluded to <lb/>
            in this chapter; its distinct exposition is attributed to the Stoics. </note> <pb n="141"/>
             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXV.]</note><lb/>
            Now if E is concluded, the syllogism would be from A B <lb/>
            alone, but if C D are so as that the one is universal, and the <lb/>
            other particular, something also will result from these which <lb/>
            will either be E or A or B, or something else different from <lb/>
            these, and if E is collected, or A or B, there will be <lb/>
            either many syllogisms, or, as it was shown possible, the same <lb/>
            thing will happen to be collected through many terms. If, <lb/>
            however, any thing else different from these is collected, there <lb/>
            will be many syllogisms unconnected with each other; but if <lb/>
            C is not so with respect to D, as to produce a syllogism, they <lb/>
            will be assumed to no purpose, except for the sake of induction <lb/>
            or concealment, or something of the sort. Still if from A B, <lb/>
            not E, but some other conclusion is produced, and from C D, <lb/>
            either one of these, or something different from these, many <lb/>
            syllogisms arise, yet not of the subject, for it was supposed <lb/>
            that the syllogism is of E. If, again, there is no conclusion <lb/>
            from C D, it will happen that they are assumed in vain, and <lb/>
            the syllogism is not of the primary problem, so that it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that every demonstration and every syllogism will be <lb/>
            through three terms only. 1</p>
          <p>This then being apparent, it is also clear that <lb/>
            a syllogism consists of two premises and no more; <lb/>
            for three terms are two premises, unless some­ <lb/>
            thing is assumed over and above, as we observed <lb/>
            at first, for the perfection of the syllogisms. <lb/>
            3. These three <lb/>
            terms are in­ <lb/>
            cluded in two <lb/>
            propositions. <lb/>
            Vide Aldrich <lb/>
            and Whately. <lb/>
            Hence it appears, that in the syllogistic discourse, in which <lb/>
            the premises, through which the principal conclusion is col­ <lb/>
            lected, are not even,—(for it is requisite that some of the <lb/>
            former conclusions should be premises,)—this discourse is <lb/>
            either not syllogistically constructed,2 or has required more <lb/>
            than is necessary to the thesis.</p>
          <p>When then the syllogisms are taken according to the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal propositions, every syllogism will consist of propositions <note type="footnote"> I The prosyllogism, or antecedent syllogism of Aristotle, is a syllogism <lb/>

            which are even, but of terms which are odd for the terms <lb/>
            exceed the premises by one, and the conclusions will be half <lb/>
            part of the premises.' When, however, the conclusion results <lb/>
            through pro-syllogisms, or through many continued middles,2 <lb/>

            as A B through C D, the multitude of terms, in <lb/>
            like manner, will exceed the premises by one, (for <lb/>
            the term interpolated will be added either exter­ <lb/>
            nally or in the middle; but in both ways it will <lb/>
            happen that the intervals are fewer than the terms by one,) <lb/>
            but the propositions are equal to the intervals, the former, <lb/>
            indeed, will not always be even, but the latter odd, but alter­ <lb/>
            nately, when the propositions are even the terms are odd, but <lb/>
            when the terms are even the propositions are odd; for toge­ <lb/>
            ther with the term, one proposition is added wherever the <lb/>

            posite syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms. <lb/>
            term is added.3 Hence, since the propositions <lb/>
            were even, but the terms odd, it is necessary they <lb/>
            should change when the same addition is made; <lb/>
            but the conclusions will no longer have the same <lb/>
            order, neither with respect to the terms, nor to <lb/>
            the propositions, for one term being added, con­ <lb/>
            clusions will be added less than the pre-existent terms by one, <lb/>
            * The minor. <lb/>
            because to the last term alone. there is no con­ <lb/>
            clusion made; but to all the rest, e. g. if D is <lb/>
            added to A B C, two conclusions are immediately added, the <lb/>
            one to A and the other to B. The same occurs in the other <lb/>
            cases also, if the term be inserted in the middle after the same <lb/>
            manner, for it will not make a syllogism to one term alone, so <lb/>
            that the conclusions will be many more than the terms, and <lb/>
            than the propositions.</p>

            of the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion in the se­ <lb/>
            cond figures. <lb/>
            what is in fewer figures, and by fewer cases, is more difficult. <lb/>
            An universal affirmative then is proved through the-first figure <lb/>
            alone, and by this in one way only; but a negative, both <lb/>
            through the first and through the middle, through the first in <lb/>
            one way, but through the middle in two ways ; the particular <lb/>
            affirmative again through the first and through the last, in one <lb/>
            way through the first figure, but in three ways through the <lb/>
            last; lastly, the particular negative is proved in all the figures, <lb/>
            but in the first in one way, in the middle in two ways, and in <lb/>
            the last in three ways. Hence it appears most <lb/>
            difficult to construct an universal affirmative, but <lb/>
            most easy to subvert it, in short, universals are <lb/>
            easier to subvert than particulars, because the <lb/>

            easier of sub­ <lb/>
            version than <lb/>
            particulars. <lb/>
            former are subverted, whether a thing is present with nothing, <lb/>
            or is not with a certain thing, of which the one, namely, the not <lb/>
            being with a certain thing, is proved in all the figures, and the <lb/>
            other, the being with nothing, is proved in two. The same mode <lb/>
            also prevails in the case of negatives, for the original proposition <lb/>
            is subverted, whether a thing is with every, or with a certain <lb/>
            individual, 1 now this was in two figures. In particular problems <lb/>
            there is one way (of confutation), either by showing a thing <lb/>
            to be with every, or with no individual, and parti­ <lb/>
            cular problems are easier of construction, for they <lb/>
            are in more figures, and through more modest In <lb/>
            3. Particulars <lb/>
            easier of con­ <lb/>

            short, we ought not to forget that it is possible to confute <lb/>
            universal mutually through particular problems, and these <lb/>
            through universal, yet we cannot construct universal through <lb/>
            particular, but the latter may be through the former, at the <lb/>
            same time that it is easier to subvert than to construct is plain.</p>

          <p>1. How to pro­ <lb/>
            vide syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms, from <lb/>
            certain princi­ <lb/>
            ples.</p>
          <p>WE must now describe how we may always obtain <lb/>
            a provision of syllogisms for a proposed question, <lb/>
            and in what way we may assume principles about <lb/>
            each, for perhaps it is not only requisite to con­ <lb/>
            sider the production of syllogisms, but also to possess the <lb/>
            power of forming them.</p>
          <p>2. The several <lb/>
            sorts of predi­ <lb/>
            cates. Some <lb/>
            cannot be truly <lb/>
            predicated uni­ <lb/>
            versally, of <lb/>
            other than in­ <lb/>
            dividuals, etc.</p>
          <p>Of all beings then, some are of such a nature <lb/>
            as not to be truly predicated universally of any <lb/>
            thing else, as “Cleon," and “ Callias," that which <lb/>
            is singular,3 and that which is sensible, but others <lb/>
            are predicated of these, (for each of these is man <lb/>
            and animal); some again are predicated of others, <lb/>
            but others not previously of these; lastly, there are some <lb/>
            which are themselves predicated of others, and others of them, <lb/>
            as “ man " is predicated of Callias, and “ animal" of man. That <lb/>
            some things therefore are naturally adapted to be predicated of <lb/>
            nothing is clear, for of sensibles each is almost of such a sort, as <lb/>
            not to be predicated of any thing except accidentally, for we <lb/>
            sometimes say that that white thing is Socrates, and that the <lb/>
            object approaching is Callias. But that we must stop some- <lb/>
            Vide b. i.ch. 19, <lb/>
            Post Anal., et <lb/>
            seq. <lb/>
            where in our upward progression we will again <lb/>
            show, for the present let this be admitted. Of these <lb/>
            things then we cannot point out another predicate, <note type="footnote"> 1 As a digest of the method of proof, we may state that <lb/>
            A is proved in one figure and one mood <lb/>
            E — — two figures and three moods <lb/>
            I — — two — — four <lb/>
            0 — — three — — six. <lb/>
            Thus A is the easiest to overthrow, and the nearest to establish: 0 the <lb/>
            reverse. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Averrois, following the old divisions, commences his 2nd section here <lb/>

            in connexion with singular propositions. See the Thesis appended to <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXVII.]</note><lb/>
            except according to opinion, but these may be predicated of <lb/>
            others, nor can singulars 1 be predicated of others, but others <lb/>
            of them. It appears however that those which are interme­ <lb/>
            diate, are capable in both ways (of demonstration), for they <lb/>
            may be predicated of others, and others of them, and argu­ <lb/>
            ments and speculations are almost all conversant with these.</p>
          <p>Still it is requisite to assume the propositions <lb/>
            about each thing thus:—In the first place, the <lb/>
            subject, (by hypothesis,) the definitions, and such <lb/>
            peculiarities as exist of the thing; next, whatever <lb/>
            2. How to as­ <lb/>
            sume propo­ <lb/>
            sitions as to <lb/>
            these, in order <lb/>
            to inference. <lb/>
            things are consequent to the thing, and which the thing fol­ <lb/>
            lows ; 2 lastly, such as cannot be in it; those however which it <lb/>
            cannot be in are not to be assumed, because of the conversion <lb/>
            of the negative. We must also distinguish in the consequents <lb/>
            what things belong to "what a thing is," what are predicated <lb/>
            as properties,3 and what as accidents; also of these, those which <lb/>
            are (predicated) according to opinion, and those, according to <lb/>
            truth; for the greater number any one has of <lb/>
            these, the quicker will he light upon a conclusion, <lb/>
            and the more true they are, the more will he de- <lb/>
            1. Distinctions <lb/>
            to be drawn. <lb/>
            monstrate. We must too select not those which are conse­ <lb/>
            quent to a certain one, but those which follow the whole thing, <lb/>
            e. g. not what follows a certain man, but what follows every <lb/>
            man, for a syllogism consists of universal propositions. If <lb/>
            therefore a proposition is indefinite, it is doubtful whether it is <lb/>
            universal, but when it is definite, this is manifest. So also we <lb/>
            must select those things the whole of which a thing follows, <lb/>
            for the reason given above, but the whole consequent itself <lb/>
            need not be assumed to follow; I say for instance, (it must not <lb/>
            be assumed) that every " animal " is consequent to " man," or <lb/>
            every science to music, but only that they are simply conse­ <lb/>
            quent, as we set forth,4 for the other is useless and impossible,5 <lb/>
            as that every man" is "every animal," or that justice is <lb/>
            every thing good." To whatever (subject) a consequent is <lb/>
            attached, the sign " every " is added; when however the sub- <note type="footnote"> 1 Taylor here falls into his common mistake of translating <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ</foreign>’ <lb/>

            ject is comprehended by a certain thing,1 the consequent-.; <lb/>
            of which we must assume, those which follow or which do <lb/>
            not follow the universal, we are not to select in these-for <lb/>
            they were assumed in those, since whatever are consequent to <lb/>
            " animal," are also consequent to “ man," and as to whatever <lb/>

            Hill. <lb/>
            things are not absolutely present with in like man­ <lb/>
            ner; but the properties of each thing must be <lb/>
            taken, for there are certain properties in species <lb/>
            not common to genus, since it is necessary that <lb/>
            certain properties should be in different species. Nor are we <lb/>
            to select those in regard to the universal, which the thing com­ <lb/>
            prehended follows, as those which “ man " follows ought not <lb/>
            to be assumed to " animal," for it is necessary if animal fol­ <lb/>
            lows man that it follows all these,2 but these more properly <lb/>
            belong to the selection of the antecedents of " man." 3 We must <lb/>
            also assume those which are generally consequent and antece­ <lb/>
            dent, for of general problems the syllogism also is from propo­ <lb/>
            sitions, all or some of which are general, as the conclusion of <lb/>
            each syllogism resembles its principles. Lastly, we are not to <lb/>
            select things consequent to all, since there will not be composed <lb/>
            a syllogism from them, on account of a reason which will ap­ <lb/>
            pear from what follows.</p>

            that an uni­ <lb/>

          <p>THOSE therefore who desire to confirm any thing <lb/>
            of a certain universal, should look to the subject <lb/>
            matter of what is confirmed, in respect of which <lb/>
            it happens to be predicated ; but of whatever ought <lb/>
            to be predicated, of this, he should examine the <lb/>
            consequents; for if one of these happens to be the <lb/>
            same, one must necessarily be in the other. But <lb/>
            if (it is to be proved) that a thing is not present universally, <lb/>
            but particularly, he must examine those which each follows, 4 <lb/>
            for if any of these is the same, to be particularly present is <note type="footnote"> I i. e. by an universal predicate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Of which man is predicated. </note><note type="footnote"> 3That is, the subjects to man ought to be chosen and assumed per <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXVIII.]</note><lb/>
            necessary ; but when the presence with nothing is necessary, 1 <lb/>
            as to what it need not be present with,2 we must look to those <lb/>
            which cannot be present with it ; 3 or on the contrary, (as regards <lb/>
            that) with which. it is necessary not to be present, we must <lb/>
            look to those which cannot be with it, but as to what ought <lb/>
            not to be present, to the consequents. For whichever of these <lb/>
            are identical, it will happen that the one is in no other, since <lb/>
            sometimes a syllogism arises in the first and at other times in <lb/>
            the middle figure. If however the particular non-inesse (is <lb/>
            to be proved), that with which it ought not to be present, and <lb/>
            those which it follows, are to be looked to ; but of that which <lb/>
            ought not to be present, those must be considered, which it is <lb/>
            impossible can be in it, for if any of these be identical the <lb/>
            particular non-inesse is necessary. What has been said how­ <lb/>
            ever will perhaps be more clear thus. Let the consequents to <lb/>
            A be B, but let those to which it is consequent be C; those <lb/>
            again which cannot be in it, D; again, let the things present <lb/>
            with E be F, and those to which it is consequent, G; lastly, <lb/>
            those which cannot be in it, H. Now if a certain C and a <lb/>
            certain F are identical, it is necessary that A should be with <lb/>
            every E, for F is present with every E, and A with every C, <lb/>
            so that A is with every E; but if C and G are identical, A <lb/>
            must necessarily be with a certain E, for A follows every C, and <lb/>
            E every G. If however F and D are identical, A will be with <lb/>
            no E from a pro-syllogism,5 for since a negative is convertible <lb/>
            and F is identical with D, A will be with no F, but F is with every <lb/>
            E ; again, if B and H are the same, A will be with no E, for B <lb/>
            is with every A, but with no E, for it was the same as H, <lb/>
            and H was with no E. If D and G are identical, A will not <lb/>
            be with a certain E, for A will not be with G, since it is not <lb/>
            present with D, but G is under E, so that neither will it be <lb/>
            with a certain E. Moreover if B is identical with G there will <lb/>
            be an inverse syllogism, for G will be with every A, (since B is <lb/>
            with A,) and E with B (for B is the same as G); still it is <lb/>
            not necessary that A should be with every E, but it is neces- <note type="footnote"> 1 When E was to be proved. </note><note type="footnote"> 2i. e. the subject of the question. </note><note type="footnote"> a Taylor inserts with Buhle here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει̉ς τὰ πομένα</foreign>,which alters the sense. <lb/>

            sary that it be with a certain E, because an universal predi­ <lb/>

            blem to be ex­ <lb/>
            amined.</p>
          <p>Wherefore we must evidently regard what ha­ <lb/>
            been mentioned as to each part of every problem,' <lb/>
            since all syllogisms are from these; but in conse­ <lb/>
            quents, and the antecedents of each thing, we <lb/>
            must look to first elements, and to those which are for the <lb/>
            most part universal, as in the case of E we must look more to <lb/>
            K F than only to F,2 but in the case of A more to K C than <lb/>
            to C only. For if A is present with K C it is also present <lb/>
            with F and with E,3 but if it is not consequent to this, yet it <lb/>
            may be consequent to F; in like manner we must examine <lb/>
            those which the thing itself is consequent to, for if it follows <lb/>
            the primary, it also does those which are included under them, <lb/>
            and if it does not follow these, yet it may those which are <lb/>
            arranged under them.4</p>
          <p>Speculation then, plainly, consists of three terms and two <lb/>
            3. Speculation <lb/>
            consistsof three <lb/>
            terms and two <lb/>
            propositions. <lb/>
            propositions, and all syllogisms are through the <lb/>
            above-mentioned figures; for A is shown present <lb/>
            with every E, when of C and F something iden­ <lb/>
            tical may be assumed. Now this will be the mid­ <lb/>
            dle term,5 and A and E the extremes, and there is the first <lb/>
            figure, but (presence with) a certain thing is shown when C <lb/>
            and G are assumed identical, and this is the last figure, for G <lb/>
            becomes the middle. Again, (presence with) none, when D <lb/>
            and F are identical, but thus also the first figure and the <lb/>
            middle are produced $ the first, because A is with no F, (since <lb/>
            a negative is converted,) but F is with every E ; and the <lb/>
            middle because D is with no A, but with every E. Not to <lb/>
            be present also with a certain one, (is shown) when D and G <lb/>
            are the same, and this is the last figure, for A will be with <lb/>
            no G, and E with every G. Wherefore all syllogisms are <lb/>
            evidently through the above-named figures, and we must not <lb/>
            select those which are consequent to all, because no syllogism <lb/>
            arises from them; as, in short, we cannot construct from con- <note type="footnote"> 1 As to both subject and predicate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 K F is the genus of both K and F, and K C stands in the same rela­ <lb/>

          <p>Tl.at other modes of speculation2 also, as regards selection, <lb/>
            are useless for the construction of syllogism is apparent; for <lb/>
            instance, if the consequents to each are identical, or if those <lb/>
            which A (the predicate) follows, and which can­ <lb/>
            not be with E (the subject), or again those which <lb/>
            cannot concur to be with either, for no syllogism <lb/>
            arises through these. If then the consequents <lb/>
            4. Other modes <lb/>
            than the first <lb/>
            useless, as re­ <lb/>
            gards selection <lb/>
            of the middle. <lb/>
            are identical, as B and F, the middle figure is produced, having <lb/>
            both premises affirmative ; but if those which A follows, and <lb/>
            which cannot be with E, as C and H, there will be the first <lb/>
            figure having the minor premise negative ; again, if those are <lb/>
            identical which cannot be with either, as D and H,3 both pro­ <lb/>
            positions will be negative, either in the first or in the middle <lb/>
            figure : thus, however, there will by no means be a syllogism.</p>
          <p>We see moreover that we must assume in spe­ <lb/>
            culation things identical, and not what are different, <lb/>
            or contrary; first, because our inspection is for <lb/>
            the sake of the middle, and we must take as a <lb/>
            middle, not what is different, but what is identical. <lb/>
            Next, in whatever a syllogism happens to be pro- <lb/>
            5. We must <lb/>
            select in inves­ <lb/>
            tigation, not <lb/>
            that wherein <lb/>
            the terms differ, <lb/>
            but in which <lb/>
            they agree. <lb/>
            duced, from the assumption of contraries, or of those things <lb/>

            gism that A is with no E : this however does not result from <lb/>
            them, but from the above-named mode; for B is with every <lb/>
            A, and with no E, so that B must necessarily be identical <lb/>
            with a certain H. Again, if B and G do not concur to be <lb/>
            with the same thing, (it will follow) that A will not be with <lb/>
            a certain E, and so there will be the middle figure, for B is <note type="footnote"> I That is, he who wishes to conclude a negative must take a middle, <lb/>

            with every A, and with no G,l so that B must necessarily be <lb/>

          <p>SYLLOGISMS which lead to the impossible subsist <lb/>
            in the same manner as ostensive, for these also <lb/>
            arise through consequents, and those (antecedents) <lb/>
            which each follows,2 and the inspection is the <lb/>
            same in both, for what is ostensively demonstrated <lb/>
            may be also syllogistically inferred per impossi­ <lb/>
            bile, and through the same terms, and what is de­ <lb/>
            monstrated per impossible, may be also proved ostensively, <lb/>
            as that A is with no E. For let it be supposed to be with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain E, therefore since B is with every A, and A with a certain <lb/>
            E, B also will be with a certain E, but it was present with none ; <lb/>
            again, it may be shown that A is with a certain E, for if A is with <lb/>
            no E, but E is with every H, A will be with no H, but it was <lb/>
            supposed to be with every H. It will happen the same in other <lb/>
            problems, for always and in all things demonstration per im­ <lb/>
            possible will be from consequents, and from those which each <lb/>
            follows. In every problem also there is the same considera­ <lb/>
            tion, whether a man wishes to syllogize ostensively, or to lead <lb/>
            to the impossible, since both demonstrations are from the same <lb/>
            terms, as for example, if A were shown to be with no E, because <lb/>
            B happens to be with a certain E, which is impossible, if it is as­ <lb/>
            sumed that B is with no E, but with every A, it is evident that <lb/>
            A will be with no E. Again, if it is ostensively collected that A <note type="footnote"> I Waitz incorrectly reads E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. the predicate and subject of the question. </note> <pb n="151"/>

            is with no E, to those who suppose that it is with a certain E, it <lb/>
            may be shown per impossible to be with no E. The like will <lb/>
            also occur in other cases, for in all we must assume some <lb/>
            common term different from the subject terms to which there <lb/>
            will appertain a syllogism of the false, so that this proposition <lb/>
            being converted,1 but the other remaining the same, there will <lb/>
            be an ostensive syllogism through the same terms. <lb/>
            But an ostensive syllogism differs from that per <lb/>
            impossibile, because in the ostensive both premises <lb/>
            are laid down according to truth, 2 but in that <lb/>
            2. Wherein the <lb/>
            ostensive and <lb/>
            per impossibile <lb/>
            syllogisms <lb/>
            differ. <lb/>
            which leads to the impossible one is laid down falsely.3</p>
          <p>These things however will more fully appear by what fol­ <lb/>
            lows, when we come to speak of the impossible, for the pre­ <lb/>
            sent let so much be manifest to us, that both he who wishes <lb/>
            to syllogize ostensively, and per impossibile, must observe <lb/>
            these things. In other syllogisms indeed which are hypo­ <lb/>
            thetical, such as those which are according to transumption, <lb/>
            or according to quality, the consideration will be in the sub­ <lb/>
            ject terms, not in the original ones, but in those <lb/>
            taken afterwards, but the mode of inspection will <lb/>
            be the same; but it is necessary also to consider, <lb/>
            and distinguish, in how many ways hypothetical <lb/>

            we may infer syllogistically after another method, for example, <lb/>
            universals by an hypothetical inspection of particulars, for if <lb/>
            C and H are the same, and if E is assumed to be with H alone, <note type="footnote"> I That is, the proposition being assumed contradicting the conclusion of <lb/>

            the manner in which it was originally enunciated, being at first part of a <lb/>

            A will be with every E; and again, if D and H are the same, <lb/>
            and E is predicated of H alone, (it may be shown) that A is <lb/>
            with no E. Wherefore the inspection must clearly be in this <lb/>
            way after the same manner both in the necessary and contin­ <lb/>
            gent, for the consideration is the same, and the syllogism both <lb/>

            the reasoning is similar in the case of the other predications. <lb/>

          <p>THE way then of proceeding in all (problems), <lb/>
            both in philosophy and in every art and discipline, <lb/>
            is the same, for we must collect about each of them <lb/>
            those things which are with, and the subjects <lb/>
            which they are with, and be provided with as many <lb/>
            as possible of these, considering them also through <lb/>
            three terms in one way subverting, but in another constructing <lb/>
            according to truth (we reason) from those which are truly de­ <lb/>
            scribed to be inherent, but as regards dialectic syllogisms (we <lb/>
            must reason) from probable propositions. Now the princi­ <lb/>
            pies of universal syllogisms have been mentioned, how they <lb/>
            subsist, and how we must investigate them, that we may not <lb/>
            direct our attention to every thing which is said, nor to con­ <lb/>
            structing and subverting the same things, nor both construct­ <lb/>
            ing universally or particularly, nor subverting wholly or par­ <lb/>
            tially, but look to things fewer and definite; as to each <lb/>
            however we must make a selection, as of good or of science. <lb/>
            The peculiar principles indeed in every science are many, <pb n="153"/>

            hence it is the province of experience to deliver <lb/>
            the principles of every thing, for instance, I say <lb/>
            that astrological experience gives the principles <lb/>
            of astrological science, for from phenomena being <lb/>

            ence. <lb/>
            have thus been invented, so also is it in every other art and <lb/>
            science. Wherefore if things are assumed which exist in in­ <lb/>
            dividuals, it is now our duty readily to exhibit demonstrations, <lb/>
            for if as regards history nothing is omitted of what is truly <lb/>
            present with things, we shall be able about every thing of <lb/>
            which there is demonstration to discover and demonstrate this, <lb/>
            and to make that clear which is naturally incapable of demon­ <lb/>
            stration.</p>
          <p>Universally then we have nearly shown how <lb/>

          <p>THAT the division through genera3 is but a cer­ <lb/>

            it in the Analytics as a mere formal method of reasoning, but in the <lb/>
            Topics he gives it an entirely material character. The dialectic of Plato <lb/>
            corresponds more nearly with the metaphysics of Aristotle: again, the <lb/>
            dialectic of Aristotle is an art, but his analytic a science; see note on <lb/>

            tests of definitions when obtained. Amongst the later Peripatetics, di­ <lb/>

            weak syllo­ <lb/>
            gism. <lb/>
            and always infers something of prior matter.1 <lb/>
            Now this has first escaped the notice of all those <lb/>
            who use it, and they endeavour to show that demonstration <lb/>
            about essence and the very nature of a thing is possible, so <lb/>
            that they neither perceive that those who divide happen to <lb/>
            syllogize, nor that it is possible in the manner we have said. <lb/>
            In demonstrations therefore, when it is requisite to infer ab­ <lb/>
            solute presence, the middle term by which the syllogism is <lb/>
            2. In demon­ <lb/>
            stration of the <lb/>
            absolute, the <lb/>
            middle must <lb/>
            be less, and not <lb/>
            universal in re­ <lb/>
            spect of the first <lb/>
            extreme. <lb/>
            produced must always be less, and must not be <lb/>
            universally predicated of the first extreme, but on <lb/>
            the contrary, division takes the universal for the <lb/>
            middle term. For let animal be A, mortal B, im­ <lb/>
            mortal C, and man of whom we ought to assume <lb/>
            the definition D, every animal then comprehends <lb/>
            either mortal or immortal, but this is that the whole of what­ <lb/>
            ever may be A is either B or C. Again, he who divides <lb/>
            man, admits that he is animal, so that he assumes A to be <lb/>
            predicated of D, hence the syllogism is that every D is either <lb/>
            B or C, wherefore it is necessary for man to be either mortal <lb/>
            or immortal, yet it is not necessary that animal should be <lb/>
            mortal, but this is desired to be granted, which was the very <lb/>
            4 Example (1.) <lb/>
            thing which ought to have been syllogistically in­ <lb/>
            ferred.* Again, taking A for mortal animal, B <lb/>
            for pedestrian, C without feet, and D for man, in the same <lb/>
            manner it assumes A to be either with B or C, for every mortal <lb/>
            animal is either pedestrian or without feet, and that A is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of D, for it has assumed that man is a mortal animal, <lb/>
            so that it is necessary that man should be either a pedestrian <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. of universals, or of things more nearly approaching to these. <lb/>
            Ex. 1. Every animal is either mortal or immortal <lb/>
            Every man is an animal <lb/>
            ∴ Every man is either mortal or immortal. <lb/>
            The conclusion here was to have been, that every man is mortal: but he <lb/>
            who divides does not prove this, but desires it to be granted. <lb/>
            Ex. 2. Every mortal animal is pedestrian or without feet <lb/>
            Every man is a mortal animal <lb/>
            ∴ Every man is pedestrian or without feet. <lb/>
            Ex. 3. Every length is or is not commensurable <lb/>

            animal or without feet, but that he is pedestrian is not neces­ <lb/>

            they ought to have proved.* After this manner <lb/>

            remainder of the speculation, since if we have <lb/>
            noticed the production of syllogisms, and have the <lb/>

            our original design will have been completed. At the same <lb/>
            time, what has before been said will happen to be confirmed, <lb/>
            and be more evident that they are thus from what shall now <lb/>
            be said, for every truth must necessarily agree with itself in <lb/>

            Propositions to <lb/>
            be investigated <lb/>
            as to quantity, <lb/>
            &amp;c.</p>
          <p>First then we must endeavour to select the two <lb/>
            propositions of a syllogism, for it is easier to di­ <lb/>
            vide into greater than into less parts,1 and com­ <lb/>
            posites are greater than the things of which they <lb/>
            are composed; next we must consider whether it is in a whole <lb/>
            or in a part, and if both propositions should not be assumed, <lb/>
            oneself placing one of them. For those who propose the uni­ <lb/>
            versal2 do not receive the other which is contained in it, <lb/>
            neither when they write, nor when they interrogate, or pro­ <lb/>
            pose these,4 but omit those5 by which these are concluded, <lb/>
            2nd rule. <lb/>
            Examine their <lb/>
            superfluities <lb/>
            and deficiencies <lb/>
            as to the proper <lb/>
            construction of <lb/>
            syllogism. <lb/>
            and question other things to no purpose. There­ <lb/>
            fore we must consider whether any thing super­ <lb/>
            fluous has been assumed, and any thing necessary <lb/>
            omitted, and one thing is to be laid down, and <lb/>
            another to be removed, until we arrive at two <lb/>
            propositions, for without these we cannot reduce <lb/>
            the sentences which are thus the subjects of question. Now <lb/>
            in some it is easy to see what is deficient, but others escape <lb/>
            us, and seem to be syllogisms,6 because something necessarily <lb/>
            happens from the things laid down, as if it should be assumed <lb/>
            that essence not being subverted, essence is not subverted,? <lb/>
            but those things being subverted, of which a thing consists, <lb/>
            what is composed of these is subverted also; for from these <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. into propositions than into terms. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. the major proposition, which is always universal in the first <lb/>

            particular to universal. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 i. e. the propositions of the principal syllogism. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 i. e. the propositions of the pro-syllogism. This last is the antece­ <lb/>

            minor—the major of the pro-syllogism proving that minor is added; this <lb/>
            major, however, is changed so far, as it is made more universal. </note> <pb n="157"/>

            positions it is necessary that a part of essence should be <lb/>
            essence, yet this is not concluded through the assumptions, <lb/>
            but the propositions are wanting. Again, if because man ex­ <lb/>
            ists, it is necessary that animal should be, and animal exist­ <lb/>
            ing, that there should be essence; then, because <lb/>
            man exists, essence must necessarily be; but this <lb/>
            is not yet syllogistically inferred,1 for the proposi­ <lb/>
            tions do not subsist as we have said they should ;2 <lb/>
            3rd rule. <lb/>
            Consider the <lb/>
            reality of infer <lb/>
            ence. <lb/>
            but we are deceived in such, because something necessary <lb/>
            happens from the things laid down, and because also a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is something necessary. The necessary, however, is <lb/>
            more extensive than the syllogism, for every syllogism is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, but not every thing necessary is a syllogism; so that <lb/>
            if any thing occurs from certain positions, we must not imme­ <lb/>
            diately endeavour to reduce, but first assume two propositions, <lb/>
            then we must divide them into terms, in this manner, that <lb/>
            term we must place as the middle which is said to be in both <lb/>
            propositions, for the middle must necessarily exist in both, in <lb/>
            all the figures. If then the middle predicates, <lb/>
            and is predicated of, or if it indeed predicates, <lb/>
            but another thing is denied of it, there will be the <lb/>
            first figure, but if it predicates, and is denied by <lb/>
            something, there will be the middle figure, and if <lb/>
            other things are predicated of it, and one thing is <lb/>
            4th rule. <lb/>
            Ascertain the <lb/>
            figure to which <lb/>
            properly the <lb/>
            problem be­ <lb/>
            longs, by the <lb/>
            middle. <lb/>
            denied, but another is predicated, there will be the last figure; <lb/>
            thus the middle subsists in each figure. In a similar manner <lb/>
            also, if the propositions should not be universal, for the deter­ <lb/>
            mination of the middle is the same,3 wherefore it is evident, <lb/>
            that in discourse, where the same thing is not asserted more <lb/>
            than once, a syllogism does not subsist, since the middle is <lb/>
            not assumed. As, however, we know what kind of problem <lb/>
            is deduced in each figure,4 in what the universal, and in what <lb/>
            the particular, it is clear that we must not regard all the <lb/>
            figures, but that one which is appropriate to each problem, <lb/>
            and whatever things are deduced in many figures, we may <lb/>

          <p>1. Cause of de­ <lb/>
            ception about <lb/>
            syllogisms— <lb/>
            our inattention <lb/>
            to the relative <lb/>
            quantity of <lb/>
            propositions.</p>
          <p>IT frequently happens then, that we are deceived <lb/>
            about syllogisms, on account of the necessary <lb/>
            (conclusion), as we have before observed, and some­ <lb/>
            times by the resemblance1 in the position of the <lb/>
            terms, which ought not to have escaped us.</p>
          <p>Thus if A is predicated of B, and B of C, there would <lb/>
            appear a syllogism from such terms, yet neither is any thing <lb/>
            necessary produced, nor a syllogism. For let A be that which <lb/>
            always is; B, Aristomenes the object of intellect; and C, <lb/>
            Aristomenes; it is true then that A is with B, for Aristomenes <lb/>
            is always the object of intellect; but B is also with C, for Aristo­ <lb/>
            menes is Aristomenes the object of intellect, but A is not with <lb/>
            C, for Aristomenes is corruptible, neither would a syllogism <lb/>
            be formed from terms thus placed, but the universal proposi­ <lb/>
            tion 2 A B must be assumed, but this is false, to think that <lb/>
            every Aristomenes who is the object of intellect always exists, <lb/>
            when Aristomenes is corruptible. Again, let C be Miccalus, <lb/>
            B Miccalus the musician, A to die to-morrow; B therefore is <lb/>
            truly predicated of C, since Miccalus is Miccalus the musician, <lb/>
            and A is truly predicated of B, for Miccalus the musician may <lb/>
            die to-morrow, but A is falsely predicated of C. This case <lb/>
            therefore is the same with the preceding, for it is not uni­ <lb/>
            versally true that Miccalus the musician will die to-morrow, <lb/>
            and if this is not assumed, there would be no syllogism.4</p>
          <p>This deception arises therefore from a small (matter), since <lb/>
            we concede, as if there were no difference between saying <lb/>

            as if A should be health, B disease, and C man, <lb/>

            rately set out. <lb/>
            for health is with no disease, and again that Bis with every C, <lb/>
            for every man is susceptible of disease, whence it would appear <lb/>
            to result that health can be with no man. Now the reason of this <lb/>
            is, that the terms are not rightly set out in expression, since <lb/>
            those words which are significant of habits being changed, <lb/>
            there will not be a syllogism, as if the word “ well" were <lb/>
            taken instead of "health," and the word "ill" instead of "dis­ <lb/>
            ease," since it is not true to say, that to be well cannot be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with him that is ill. Now this not being assumed, there <lb/>
            is no syllogism except of the contingent,3 which indeed is not <lb/>
            impossible, for health may happen to be with no man. Again, <lb/>
            in the middle figure there will likewise be a falsity, for health <lb/>
            happens to be with no disease, but may happen to be with every <lb/>
            man, so that disease shall be with no man.4 In the third figure <lb/>
            however falsity occurs by the contingent, for it is possible that <lb/>
            health and disease, science and ignorance, in short, contraries, <lb/>
            shall be with the same individual, but it is impossible that <lb/>
            they should be present with each other: this, however, differs <lb/>
            from the preceding observations,* since when <lb/>

            with B through any thing else, for a triangle has of itself two <lb/>

            of contraries there is one science.</p>
          <p>For let A be, there is one science, and B, things <lb/>
            predicated of <lb/>
            the other <lb/>
            " casu recto." <lb/>
            Since either <lb/>
            major or minor <lb/>
            premise, or <lb/>
            both, may have <lb/>
            an oblique <lb/>
            case. <lb/>
            contrary to each other, A then is present with B, not as if <lb/>
            contraries are one science,1 but because it is true in respect of <lb/>
            them, to say that there is one science of them. It sometimes <lb/>
            occurs indeed, that the first is predicated of the middle, but <lb/>
            the middle not of the third, as if wisdom is science, but <lb/>
            wisdom is of2 good, the conclusion is that science is of good: <lb/>
            hence good is not wisdom, but wisdom is science. Some­ <lb/>
            times, again, the middle is predicated of the third, but the first <lb/>
            not of the middle, e. g. if there is a science of every quality <lb/>
            or contrary, but good is a contrary and a quality, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion then is, that there is a science of good, yet neither <lb/>
            good, nor quality, nor contrary is science, but good is these.3 <lb/>
            Sometimes, again, neither the first is predicated of the middle, <lb/>
            nor this of the third, the first indeed being sometimes predi­ <lb/>
            cated of the third, and sometimes not,4 for instance, of whatever <lb/>
            there is science, there is genus, but there is science of good, <lb/>
            the conclusion is that there is a genus of good, yet bone of <lb/>
            these is predicated of any. If, nevertheless, of what there is <lb/>
            science, this is genus, but there is a science of good, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion is that good is genus, hence the first is predicated of <lb/>
            the extreme, but there is no predication of each other.5</p>
          <p>In the case of the non-inesse there must be the <lb/>

            generation of generation, but there is (a motion and genera­ <lb/>

            according to the appellations of the nouns, e. g. <lb/>
            man, or good, or contraries, not of man, nor of good, nor of <lb/>
            contraries, but we must take propositions according to the cases <lb/>
            of each word, since they, are either to this as the equal, or of <lb/>
            this as the double, or this thing as striking, or seeing, or this <lb/>
            one as man, animal, or if the noun falls in any other way, ac­ <lb/>

            science, and when it is shown to be so because it is <lb/>
            good; but if it is shown to be an object of science simply, we <lb/>
            * Example (2.) <lb/>
            must take " being as the middle term ;* if (it is <lb/>
            proved that it may be scientifically known) to be <lb/>
            good, a certain being (must be taken as the middle), For <lb/>
            let A be " science, that it is a certain being," B “ a certain <lb/>
            being," and C " good ;" to predicate then A of B is true, <lb/>
            for there is science of a certain being, that it is a certain <lb/>

            t i. o. good. <lb/>

            hence there will be science of good that it is good, <lb/>
            for the expression “ a certain being" is the sign of peculiar <lb/>
            or proper essence. If, on the other hand, “ being " is set as <lb/>
            the middle, and being simply and not a certain being is added <lb/>
            to the extreme, there will not be a syllogism that there is a <lb/>
            science of good, that it is good, but that it is being : for ex­ <lb/>
            t Example (3.) <lb/>
            ample, let A be science that it is being; B, being ; <lb/>
            and C, good. t In such syllogisms then as are from <lb/>

          <p>Of syllogisms, however, in the middle figure, the <lb/>
            universal will be reduced to the first, but only one <lb/>
            of the particular,1 for let A be with no B, but with <lb/>
            every C, then by conversion of the negative there <lb/>
            will be the first figure, since B will be with no A, <lb/>
            2. Universals <lb/>
            in the second <lb/>
            are reducible <lb/>
            to the first, but <lb/>
            only one par­ <lb/>
            ticular. <lb/>
            but A with every C. Now if the affirmative be added to B, <lb/>
            and the negative to C, we must take C as the first term, since <lb/>
            this is with no A, but A is with every B, wherefore C is with no <lb/>
            B, neither will B be with any C, for the negative is converted. <lb/>
            If however the syllogism be particular, when the negative is <lb/>
            added to the major extreme, it will be reduced to the first <lb/>
            figure, as if A is with no B, but with a certain C, for by con­ <lb/>
            version of the negative there will be the first figure, since B is <lb/>
            with no A, but A with a certain C. When however the affirma­ <lb/>
            tive (is joined to the greater extreme), it will not be resolved, <lb/>
            as if A is with every B, but not with every C, for the proposi­ <lb/>
            tion A B does not admit conversion,2 nor if it were made <lb/>
            would there be a syllogism.</p>
          <p>Again, not all in the third figure will be resolv­ <lb/>
            able into the first,3 but all in the first4 will be <lb/>
            into the third, for let A be with every B, but B with <lb/>
            a certain C, since then a particular affirmative is <lb/>
            convertible, C will be with a certain B, but A was <lb/>
            with every B, so that there is the third figure. Also <lb/>
            3. Of those in <lb/>
            the third figure, <lb/>
            one only, when <lb/>
            the negative is <lb/>
            not universal, <lb/>
            is not reducible <lb/>
            to the first. <lb/>
            if the syllogism be negative, there will be the same result, for <lb/>
            the particular affirmative is convertible, wherefore A will be <lb/>
            with no B, but with a certain C. Of the syllogisms in the last <lb/>
            figure, one alone is not resolvable into the first,5 when the <lb/>
            negative is not placed universal, all the rest however are re­ <lb/>
            solved. For let A and B be predicated of every C, C there­ <lb/>
            fore is convertible partially to each extreme, wherefore it is <lb/>
            present with a certain B, so that there will be the first figure, <lb/>
            if A is with every C, but C with a certain B. And if A is <lb/>
            with every C, but B with a certain C, the reasoning is the same, <note type="footnote"> 1 Viz. Festino and not Baroko. Of these reductions it may be generally <lb/>
            observed, that only negative syllogisms are reducible to the second, and <lb/>
            only particular to the third figure. Barbara, Baroko, and Bokardo cannot <lb/>

            for B reciprocates with C. But if B is with every C, and A with <lb/>
            a certain C, B must be taken as the first term, for B is with <lb/>
            every C, but C with a certain A, so that B is with a certain A; <lb/>
            since however the particular is convertible, A will also be with <lb/>
            a certain B. If the syllogism be negative, when the terms <lb/>
            are universal, we must assume in like manner, for let B be with <lb/>
            every C, but A with no C, wherefore C will be with a certain B, <lb/>
            but A with no C, so that C will be the middle term. Likewise, <lb/>
            if the negative is universal, but the affirmative particular, for <lb/>
            A will be with no C, but C with a certain B ; if however the <lb/>
            * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάλυσις</foreign>. <lb/>
            negative be taken as particular, there will not be <lb/>
            a resolution,* e. g. if B is with every C, but A not <lb/>
            with a certain C, for by conversion of the proposition B C, <lb/>
            both propositions will be partial.</p>
          <p>4. The conver­ <lb/>
            sion of the <lb/>
            minor premise <lb/>
            necessary for <lb/>
            reduction.</p>
          <p>It is clear then, that in order mutually to con­ <lb/>
            vert these figures,l the minor premise must be <lb/>
            converted in either figure, for this being trans­ <lb/>
            posed a transition 2 is effected; of syllogisms in the <lb/>
            middle figure,3 one is resolved,4 and the other is not5 resolved <lb/>
            into the third, for when the universal is negative there is a <lb/>
            resolution, for if A is with no B, but with a certain C, both <lb/>
            similarly reciprocate with A, wherefore B is with no A, but C <lb/>
            with a certain A, the middle then is A. When however A is <lb/>
            with every B, and is not with a certain C, there will not be reso­ <lb/>
            lution, since neither proposition after conversion is universal. <lb/>
            Syllogisms also of the third figure may be resolved into <lb/>
            the middle, when the negative is universal, as if A is with no C, <lb/>
            but B is with some or with every C, for C will be with no A, <lb/>
            but will be with a certain B, but if the negative be particular, <lb/>
            there will not be a resolution, since a particular negative does <lb/>
            not admit conversion.</p>
          <p>5. Those syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms not mu­ <lb/>
            tually reduci­ <lb/>
            ble into the <lb/>
            other figures <lb/>
            which are not <lb/>
            into the first.</p>
          <p>We see then that the same syllogisms6 are not <lb/>
            resolved in these figures, which were not resolved <lb/>
            into the first figures, and that when syllogisms <lb/>
            are reduced to the first figure, these only are con­ <lb/>

          <p>THERE is some difference in the construction or <lb/>
            subversion of a problem, whether we suppose the <lb/>
            expressions “ not to be this particular thing," and <lb/>
            “ to be not this particular thing," have the same, <lb/>
            or different signification, e. g. " not to be white," <lb/>
            1. Difference in <lb/>
            statement aris. <lb/>
            ing from “not <lb/>
            to be " and " to <lb/>
            be not,”—with <lb/>
            the reason. <lb/>
            (Cf. Herm. 6.) <lb/>
            and “ to be not white." Now they do not signify the same <lb/>
            thing, neither of the expression " to be white," is the nega­ <lb/>
            tion "to be not white," but, "not to be white;" and the <lb/>
            reason of this is as follows. The expression "he is able to <lb/>
            walk," is similar to "he is able not to walk," the expression <lb/>
            " it is white " to, " it is not white," and “he knows good," to <lb/>
            " he knows what is not good." For these, " he knows good," <lb/>
            or " he has a knowledge of good," does not at all differ, nei­ <lb/>
            ther “ he is able to walk," and "he has the power of walk­ <lb/>
            ing ;" wherefore also the opposites, " he is not able to walk," <lb/>
            and “ he has not the power of walking," (do not differ from <lb/>
            each other). If then “ he has not the power of walking," <lb/>
            signifies the same as "he has the power of not walking," <lb/>
            these will be at one and the same time present with the same, <lb/>
            for the same person is able to walk, and not to walk, and is <lb/>
            cognizant of good, and of what is not good, but affirmation <lb/>
            and negation being opposites, are not at the same time present <lb/>

            ther is it the same thing to be "not good and " not to be <lb/>
            good," since of things having analogy,2 if the one is different <lb/>
            the other also differs. Neither is it the same to be " not equal," <lb/>
            . and " not to be equal,” 3 for to the one, namely, " to that which <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle demonstrates the difference between infinite affirmation and <lb/>

            but to the other there is nothing subjected, wherefore “ not <lb/>

            or not equal." Besides this expression, " it is not white <lb/>
            wood," and this, " not is white wood," are not present toge­ <lb/>
            ther at the same time, for if it is “ wood not white," it will be <lb/>
            wood ; but "what is not white wood" is not of necessity <lb/>
            “wood,” so that it is clear that of "it is good" the negation is <lb/>
            not “it is not good." If then of every one thing either the affirm­ <lb/>
            ation or negation is true, if there is not negation, it is evident <lb/>
            that there will in some way be affirmation, but of every affirm­ <lb/>
            ation there is negation, and hence of this 1 the negation is, it, it <lb/>
            is not not good." They have this order indeed with respect <lb/>

            firmation and <lb/>
            negation. <lb/>
            to each other: let to be good be A, not to be <lb/>
            good B, to be not good C under B, not to be not <lb/>
            good D under A. With every individual then <lb/>
            either A or B will be present, and (each) with nothing which <lb/>
            is the same and C or D with every individual,2 and with <lb/>
            nothing which is the same, and with whatever C is present, <lb/>
            B must necessarily be present with every individual, for if it <lb/>
            is true to say that " a thing is not white," it is also true to say <lb/>
            that “ not it is white," for a thing cannot at one and the same <lb/>
            time be white and not white, or be wood not white and be <lb/>
            white wood, so that unless there is affirmation, negation <lb/>
            will be present.—C however is not always (consequent) to B, <lb/>
            for in short, what is not wood will not be white wood, on the <lb/>
            contrary, with whatever A is present D also is present with <lb/>
            * c. <lb/>
            t A. <lb/>
            every individual, for either C or D will be pre­ <lb/>
            sent. As however " to be not white" * and “ to <lb/>
            be white," t cannot possibly co-subsist, D will be <lb/>
            present, for of what is white we may truly say, that it is not not <lb/>
            white, yet A is not predicated of every D, for, in short, we can­ <lb/>
            not truly predicate A of what is not wood, namely, to assert <lb/>
            that it is white wood, so that D will be true, and A will not <lb/>
            be true, namely, that it is white wood. It appears also, that <lb/>
            A and C are present with nothing identical, though B and D <lb/>
            may be present with the same. <note type="footnote"> thing " is equal or unequal, because that which is not is neither equal <lb/>

          <p>Privatives also subsist similarly to this position <lb/>
            with respect to attributes,1 for let equal be A, not <lb/>

            similarly true, that, “ not all things are white," or " that not <lb/>
            each thing is white ;” but, " that each thing is not white," or, <lb/>
            "that all things are not white," is false. So also of this <lb/>
            affirmation, “ every animal is white," the negation is not, <lb/>
            "every animal is not white," for both are false, but this, <lb/>
            it not every animal is white." Since however it is clear that <lb/>
            " is not white," signifies something different from " not is <lb/>
            white," and that one is affirmation and the other negation, it <lb/>
            is also clear that there is not the same mode of demonstrating <lb/>
            each, for example,2 " whatever is an animal is not white," or <lb/>
            " happens not to be white;" and that we may truly say, " it <lb/>
            is not white," for this is " to be not white." Still there is <lb/>
            the same mode as to it is true to say it is white or not white, <lb/>
            for both are demonstrated constructively * through <lb/>
            the first figure, since the word “ true " is similarly <lb/>
            arranged with " is," for of the assertion “ it is <lb/>
            true to say it is white," the negation is not, “ it is <lb/>
            true to say it is not white," but " it is not true to <lb/>
            say it is white." But if it is true to say, <lb/>
            "whatever is a man is a3 musician, or is not a <lb/>
            musician,” we must assume that " whatever is an <lb/>
            animal is either a musician or is not a musician,”5 <lb/>
            and it will be demonstrated, but that " whatever <lb/>
            is a man is not a musician," is shown negatively † <lb/>
            according to the three modes6 stated.</p>

            vidual, and again C and D likewise, but A follows C <lb/>
            and does not reciprocate, D will also follow B, and will not <lb/>
            reciprocate, and A and D may be with. the same thing, but B <lb/>
            and C cannot. In the first place then, it appears from this <lb/>
            that D is consequent to B, for since one of C D is necessarily <lb/>
            present with every individual, but with what B is present C <lb/>
            cannot be, because it introduces with itself A, but A and B <lb/>
            cannot consist with the same, D is evidently a consequent. <lb/>
            Again, since C does not reciprocate with A, but C or D is <lb/>
            present with every, it happens that A and D will be with the <lb/>
            same thing, but B and C cannot, because A is consequent to <lb/>
            C, for an impossibility results, 1 wherefore it appears plain <lb/>
            that neither does B reciprocate with D, because it would hap­ <lb/>
            pen that A is present together with D.2</p>

            arising from <lb/>
            not assuming <lb/>
            opposites pro­ <lb/>
            perly.</p>
          <p>Sometimes also it occurs that we are deceived <lb/>
            by such an arrangement of terms, because of our <lb/>
            not taking opposites rightly, one of which must <lb/>
            necessarily be with every individual, as if A and B <lb/>
            cannot be simultaneously with the same, but it is necessary that <lb/>
            the one should be with what the other is not, and again C and D <lb/>
            in like manner, but A is consequent to every C ; for B will hap­ <lb/>
            pen necessarily to be with that with which D is, which is false. <lb/>
            For let the negative of A B which is F be assumed, and again <lb/>
            the negative of C D, and let it be H, it is necessary then, that <lb/>
            either A or F should be with every individual, since either at­ <lb/>
            firmation or negation must be present. Again also, either C <lb/>
            or H, for they are affirmation and negation, and A is by hy­ <lb/>
            pothesis present with every thing with which C is, so that H <lb/>
            will also be present with whatever F is. Again, since of F B, <lb/>
            one is with every individual, and so also one of H D, and H <lb/>
            is consequent to F, B will also be consequent to D, for this <lb/>
            we know. If then A is consequent to C, B will also follow <lb/>
            D, but this is false, since the sequence was the reverse in <lb/>
            things so subsisting, for it is not perhaps necessary that either <lb/>
            A or F should be with every individual, neither F nor B, for F <lb/>
            is not the negative of A, since of " good" the negation is " not <lb/>
            good," and “ it is not good" is not the same with " it is neither <lb/>
            good nor not good." It is the same also of C P <lb/>

          <p>IN how many figures, through what kind and <lb/>
            number of propositions, also when and how a syl­ <lb/>
            logism is produced, we have therefore now ex­ <lb/>
            plained; moreover, what points both the con­ <lb/>
            structor and subverter of a syllogism should <lb/>
            1. Reference t* <lb/>
            the previous <lb/>
            observations. <lb/>
            Universal syl­ <lb/>
            logisms infer <lb/>
            many conclu­ <lb/>
            sions. <lb/>
            regard, as well as how we should investigate a proposed sub­ <lb/>
            ject after every method; further, in what manner we should <lb/>
            assume the principles of each question. Since, <lb/>
            however, some syllogisms are universal, but <lb/>
            others particular, all the universal always con­ <lb/>
            clude a greater number of things, yet of the par- <lb/>
            2. So also do <lb/>
            particular af-. <lb/>
            firmative, but <lb/>
            not the nega­ <lb/>
            tive particular. <lb/>
            ticular, those which are affirmative many things, but the <lb/>
            negative one conclusion only. For other propositions are con­ <lb/>
            verted, but the negative is not converted, but the conclusion <lb/>
            is something of somewhat; hence other syllogisms conclude a <lb/>
            majority of things, for example, if A is shown to be with every <lb/>
            or with a certain B, B must also necessarily be with a certain A, <lb/>
            and if A is shown to be with no B, B will also be with no A, and <lb/>
            this is different from the former. If however A is not with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain B, B need not be not present with a certain A, for it possibly <lb/>
            may be with every A.1 This then is the common <lb/>
            cause of all syllogisms, both universal and par­ <lb/>
            ticular ; we may however speak differently of <lb/>
            universals, for as to whatever things are under <lb/>
            the middle, or under the conclusion, of all there <lb/>
            3. Difference <lb/>
            between uni­ <lb/>
            versals of the <lb/>
            first and those <lb/>
            of the second <lb/>
            figure. <lb/>
            will be the same syllogism, if some are placed in the middle, <lb/>
            but others in the conclusion,2 as, if A B is a conclusion through <lb/>
            C, it is necessary that A should be predicated of whatever is <note type="footnote"> 1 As if A were “man;” a "certain animal," a certain B ; and animal, <lb/>
            B; therefore though " man " is not present with " a certain animal," (e. g. <lb/>
            “ a lion,") yet " animal " is with every " man." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hence three conclusions, he means, may be drawn from the same <lb/>
            syllogism, one of the minor extreme, another of what is under the minor <lb/>
            and the third of what is the subject of the middle. </note> <pb n="176"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            under B or C, for if D is in the whole of B, but B in the <lb/>
            whole of A, D will also be in the whole of A. Again, if E is <lb/>
            in the whole of C, and C is in A, E will also be in the whole <lb/>
            of A, and in like manner if the syllogism be negative; but in <lb/>
            the second figure it will be only possible to form a syllogism <lb/>
            of that which is under the conclusion. As, if A is with no B, <lb/>
            but is with every C, the conclusion will be that B is with no C ; if <lb/>
            therefore D is under C, it is clear that B is not with it, but that <lb/>
            it is not with things under A, does not appear by the syllogism, <lb/>
            though it will not be with E, if it is under A. But it has <lb/>
            been shown by the syllogism that B is with no C, but it was as­ <lb/>
            sumed without demonstration 1 that it is not with A, wherefore <lb/>
            it does not result by the syllogisms that B is not with E. <lb/>
            Nevertheless in particular syllogisms of things under the con­ <lb/>
            clusion, there is no necessity incident, for a syllogism is not <lb/>
            *(<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότασις</foreign>.) <lb/>
            major in let <lb/>
            figure. <lb/>
            produced,2 when this. is assumed as particular, <lb/>
            but there will be of all things under the middle, <lb/>
            yet not by that syllogism, e. g. if A is with every B, <lb/>
            but B with a certain C, there will be no syllogism of what is <lb/>
            placed under C, but there will be of what is under B, yet not <lb/>
            through the antecedent syllogism. Similarly also in the case <lb/>
            of the other figures, for there will be no conclusion of what is <lb/>
            under the conclusion, but there will be of the other, yet not <lb/>
            through that syllogism ; in the same manner, as in universals, <lb/>
            from an undemonstrated proposition, things under the middle <lb/>
            were shown, wherefore either there will not be a conclusion <lb/>
            there,3 or there will be in these also.4</p>

            necessity be either true or false. From true propositions then <lb/>
            we cannot inter a falsity, but from false premises <lb/>
            we may infer the truth, except that not the why,. <lb/>

          <p>First then, that we cannot infer the false from <lb/>

            thing existing, it will happen that something will result from <lb/>
            necessity, since this is not possible, for what results <lb/>
            from necessity is the conclusion, and the fewest <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            things through which this arises are three terms, but two in­ <lb/>
            tervals and propositions. If then it is true that with whatever <lb/>
            B is A also is, and that with whatever C is B is, it is necessary <lb/>
            that with whatever C is A also is, and this cannot be false, for <lb/>
            else the same thing would exist and not exist at the same time. <lb/>
            Wherefore A is laid down as one thing, the two <lb/>
            propositions being co-assumed. It is the same <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            also in negatives, for we cannot show the false from what are <lb/>
            true ; but from false propositions we may collect the truth,3 <lb/>
            either when both premises are false, or one only, and this not <lb/>
            indifferently, but the minor, if it comprehend the whole false, <lb/>
            but if the whole is not assumed to be false, the <lb/>
            true may be collected from either.t Now let A be <lb/>
            with the whole of C, but with no B, nor B with C, <lb/>
            t being as­ <lb/>
            sumed false. <note type="footnote"> I In ch. 2 of 1st book, Post Anal. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Because it is true by hypothesis, but B being denied true, A cannot <lb/>

            table of opposition,) and a proposition is said to be false in part, when <lb/>
            what is partly true and partly false, is affirmed, or denied, universally. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>

            and this may happen to be the case, as animal is with no stone, <lb/>
            nor stone present with any man, if then A is assumed present <lb/>
            with every B, and B with every C, A will be with every C, <lb/>
            * Example (1.) <lb/>
            so that from propositions both false, the conclusion <lb/>
            will be true, since every man is an animal..</p>
          <p>So also a negative conclusion (is attained), for neither A <lb/>
            8. <lb/>
            may be assumed, nor B present with any C, but <lb/>
            let A be with every B, for example, as if, the same <lb/>
            terms being taken, man was placed in the middle, for neither <lb/>

            ¶ Example (2.) <lb/>
            4. <lb/>
            animal nor man is with any stone, but animal is <lb/>
            with every man. Wherefore if with what † it fis <lb/>
            present universally, it is assumed to be present with <lb/>
            none,§ but with what it is not present, we assume <lb/>
            that it is present with every individual, || from <lb/>
            both these false premises, there will be a true con­ <lb/>
            clusion.¶ The same may be shown if each pre­ <lb/>
            mise is assumed partly false, but if only one is <lb/>
            admitted false, if the major is wholly false, as A B, there will <lb/>
            not be a true conclusion, but if B C, (the minor is wholly <lb/>

            a false propo­ <lb/>

            mean by a proposition wholly false that which is <lb/>
            contrary (to the true), as if that was assumed pre­ <lb/>
            sent with every, which is present with none, or that present <lb/>
            with none, which is present with every. For let A be with <lb/>
            no B, but B with every C, if then we take the proposition B <figure type="illustration">

              C as true, but the whole of A B as false, and that A is with <lb/>
              every B, it is impossible for the conclusion to be true, for it <lb/>
              was present with no C, since A was present with none <lb/>
              of what B was present with, but B was with <lb/>
              every C.* <lb/>
              * Example (3.)</p>
          <p>In like manner also the conclusion will be false, <lb/>
            if A is with every B, and B with every C, and <lb/>
            5. <lb/>
            the proposition B C is assumed true, but A B wholly false, <lb/>
            and that A is present with no individual with which B is, for <lb/>
            A will be with every C, since with whatever B is, A also is, <lb/>
            but B is with every C. It is clear then, that, the <lb/>
            major premise being assumed wholly false, whether <lb/>
            it be affirmative or negative, but the other pre­ <lb/>
            mise being true, there is not a true conclusion ; <lb/>
            if however the whole is not assumed false, there <lb/>
            will be. For if A is with every C, but with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain B, and B is with every C ; e. g. animal with <lb/>
            every swan, but with a certain whiteness, and white- <lb/>
            4. When the <lb/>
            major is wholly <lb/>
            false, but the <lb/>
            minor is true, <lb/>
            the conclusion <lb/>
            is false ; but <lb/>
            when the whole <lb/>
            is not false, the <lb/>
            conclusion is <lb/>
            true. <lb/>
            Affirmative. <lb/>
            ness with every swan, if A is assumed present with every B, <lb/>
            and B with every C, A will also be truly present <lb/>
            with every C, since every swan is an animal. t</p>
          <p>So also if A B be negative, for A concurs with <lb/>
            a certain B, but with no C, and B with every C, <lb/>
            t Example (4.) <lb/>
            2. Negative. <lb/>
            as animal with something white, but with no snow, and <lb/>
            whiteness with all snow ; if then A is assumed present <lb/>
            with no B, but B with every C, A will be present <lb/>
            with no C. ‡</p>
          <p>If however the proposition A B were assumed <lb/>
            wholly true, but B C wholly false, there will be a <lb/>
            true syllogism, 1 as nothing prevents A from being <lb/>
            with every B and every C, and yet B with no C, as <lb/>
            is the case with species of the same genus, which <lb/>

            is true. <note type="footnote"> 1 Here is another instance of " syllogism " being employed in its pure <lb/>

              are not subaltern, for animal concurs both with horse and <lb/>
              man. but horse with no man ; if therefore A is assumed pre- <lb/>

              * Example (6.) <lb/>
              sent with every B, and B with every C, the con­ <lb/>
              clusion will be true, though the whole proposition <lb/>
              B C is false.- It will be the same, if the propo­ <lb/>
              sition A B is negative. For it will happen that A will be <lb/>
              neither with any B, nor with any C, and that B is with no C, <lb/>
              as genus to those species which are from another genus, for <lb/>
              animal neither concurs with music nor with medicine, nor <lb/>
              music with medicine: if then A is assumed present with no <lb/>
              t Example (7.) <lb/>
              B, but B with every C, the conclusion will be <lb/>
              true. Now if the proposition B C is not wholly <lb/>
              but partially false, even thus the conclusion will be true. For <lb/>
              nothing prevents A from concurring with the whole of B, <lb/>
              and the whole of C, and B with a certain C, as genus with <lb/>
              species and difference, thus animal is with every man and <lb/>
              with every pedestrian, but man concurs with something, and <lb/>
              not with every thing pedestrian : if then A is assumed pre- <lb/>
              1 Example (8.) <lb/>
              sent with every B, and B with every C, A will <lb/>
              also be present with every C,‡ which will be true. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>The same will occur if the proposition A B be <lb/>
            negative. For A may happen to be neither with <lb/>
            2. Negative. <lb/>
            any B, nor with any C, yet B with a certain C, as genus with <lb/>
            the species and difference which are from another genus. <lb/>
            Thus animal is neither present with any prudence nor with <lb/>
            any thing contemplative, but prudence is with something <lb/>
            contemplative ; if then A is assumed present with no B, but <lb/>
            B with every C, A will be with no C, which will <lb/>
            be true.*</p>
          <p>In particular syllogisms however, when the <lb/>
            whole of the major premise is false, but the other <lb/>
            true, the conclusion may be true ; also when the <lb/>
            major A B is partly false, but B C (the minor) <lb/>
            wholly true ; and when A B the major is true, <lb/>
            but the particular false, also when both are false. <lb/>
            * Example (9.) <lb/>

            there may be <lb/>
            a true conclu­ <lb/>
            sion. <lb/>
            For there is nothing to prevent A from concurring with no <lb/>
            B, but with a certain C, and also to prevent B from being <lb/>
            present with a certain C, as animal is with no <lb/>
            snow, but is with something white, and snow with <lb/>
            1. Affirmative. <lb/>
            something white. If then snow is taken as the middle, and <lb/>
            animal as the first term, and if A is assumed present with the <lb/>
            whole of B, but B with a certain C, the whole proposition <lb/>
            A B will be false, but B C true, also the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion will be true. † <lb/>
            t Example (10.)</p>
          <p>It will happen also the same, if the proposition A B is ne­ <lb/>

              1. Affirmative. <lb/>
              and beauty also may be with something great. If <lb/>
              then A is taken as present with every B, and B <lb/>
              with a certain C, the proposition A B will be partly false; <lb/>

          <p>Again, if A B be true, but B C false, the <lb/>

            from being with the whole of B, and with a certain C, and B <lb/>

            with no number, and is with something white, but number is <lb/>

              biped is with every man, but beauty not with every man, and <lb/>
              beauty with a certain biped. If then A and B are assumed <lb/>
              present with the whole of C, the proposition B C is wholly <lb/>
              true, but A C partly false, the conclusion will also be <lb/>

              one is negative and the other affirmative, for since B may <lb/>
              possibly be with the whole of C, but A with a certain C, when <lb/>
              the terms are thus, A will not be with every B. If B is as­ <lb/>
              sumed present with the whole of C, but A with none, the <lb/>
              negative is partly false, but the other wholly true, the con­ <lb/>
              clusion will also be true. Moreover, since it has been shown <lb/>
              that A being present with no C, but B with a certain C, it is <lb/>
              possible that A may not be with a certain B, it is clear that <lb/>
              when A C is wholly true, but B C partly false, <lb/>
              the conclusion may be true, for if A is assumed <lb/>

            versally,1 as far as regards the setting out of t he <lb/>
            terms; 2 the like also happens in negatives. We <lb/>
            see then that if the conclusion is false, those things <lb/>
            from which the reasoning proceeds, must either <lb/>
            all or some of them be false; but when it (the <lb/>
            conclusion) is true, that there is no necessity, <lb/>
            either that a certain thing, or that all things, <lb/>
            should be true; but that it is possible, when <lb/>
            nothing in the syllogism is true, the conclusion <lb/>
            should, nevertheless, be true, yet not of necessity. The <lb/>
            reason of this however is, that when two things3 so sub­ <lb/>
            sist with relation to each other, that the existence of the one <lb/>
            necessarily follows from that of the other, if the one does not <lb/>
            exist, neither will the other be,5 but if it6 exists that it is not <lb/>
            necessary that the other7 should be. If however the same <lb/>
            thing8 exists, and does not exist, it is impossible that there <lb/>
            should of necessity be the same (consequent);9 I mean, as if <lb/>
            A being white, B should necessarily be great, and A not be­ <lb/>
            ing white, that B is necessarily great, for when this thing A <lb/>
            being white, it is necessary that this thing B should be great, <lb/>
            but B being great, C is not white, if A is white, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that C should not be white. Also when there are two <lb/>
            things, 10 if one is,11 the other 12 must necessarily be, but this not <note type="footnote"> I i. e. partly false. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, the terms being proposed, it may be shown, that we can de­ <lb/>

          <p>THE demonstration of things in a circle, and from <lb/>
            each other, is by the conclusion, and by taking <lb/>
            one proposition converse in predication, to con­ <lb/>

            1. Definition of <lb/>

            monstration— <lb/>
            and example. <lb/>
            syllogism. As if it were required to show that A is with every <lb/>
            C, we should have proved it through B ;2 again,3 if a person <lb/>
            should show that A is with B, assuming A present with C, <lb/>
            but C with B, and A with B; first, on the contrary, he as­ <lb/>
            sumed B present with C. Or if it is necessary to demonstrate <lb/>

            of C, which was the conclusion,5 but B to be present with A, <lb/>

            stration of this <lb/>
            kind not truly <lb/>
            made, except <lb/>
            through con­ <lb/>

            " pro con­ <lb/>
            cesso," only. <lb/>
            if both1 there will be the same conclusion, when <lb/>
            we need another. In those terms then which are <lb/>
            not converted, a syllogism is produced from one <lb/>
            undemonstrated proposition, for we cannot demon­ <lb/>
            strate by this term, that the third is with the mid­ <lb/>
            dle, or the middle with the first, but in those which <lb/>
            are converted we may demonstrate all by each <lb/>
            other, as if A B and C reciprocate; for A C can <lb/>
            be demonstrated by the middle,2 B; again,3 A B (the major) <lb/>
            through the conclusion, and through the proposition B C, (the <lb/>

            the conclusion, and the proposition A B con­ <lb/>

            position C B,* and B At for we use these alone <lb/>
            undemonstrated, if then B is taken as present <lb/>
            with every C,‡ and C with every A, there will <lb/>
            be a syllogism of B in respect to A.§ Again, if <lb/>
            C is assumed present with every A, and A with <lb/>
            every B,|| it is necessary that C should be present <lb/>
            with every B, in both 5 syllogisms indeed, the pro­ <lb/>
            position C A is taken undemonstrated, for the <lb/>
            others were demonstrated. Wherefore if we should show <lb/>
            If The 4th syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, C B A. <lb/>
            this, they will all have been shown by each other. <lb/>
            If then C is assumed present with every B,¶ and <lb/>
            B with every A, both propositions are taken de­ <lb/>
            monstrated, and C is necessarily present with A, hence it is <lb/>
            clear that in convertible propositions alone, demonstrations <lb/>
            may be formed in a circle, and through each other, but in <lb/>
            others as we have said before,6 it occurs also in these 7 that <note type="footnote"> I Premises in the first syllogism </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The first syllogism of a circle, ABC. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The second syllogism, A C B. </note><note type="footnote">4 The sixth syllogism, B A C </note><note type="footnote"> 5 i. e. in the fifth and third. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 One proposition is not demonstrated in a circle. </note><note type="footnote">7 i. e. in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, in which the converse propositions are <lb/>

            and the 6th the minor of the first, but both assume the conclusion of the <lb/>
            first, to which the 2nd adds the converse minor, and the 6th the con­ <lb/>
            verse major of the first: hence the 2nd and 6th prove directly the pro­ <lb/>
            positions of the first, but assume two converse propositions, which have <lb/>
            also to be proved to make the circle complete. This is done by the third </note> <pb n="195"/>

            we use the same thing demonstrated for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of a demonstration. For C is demonstrated <lb/>
            of B,* and B of A,t assuming C to be predicated <lb/>
            of A,t but C is demonstrated of A § by these pro­ <lb/>
            positions, || so that we use the conclusion I for de­ <lb/>
            monstration.</p>
          <p>In negative syllogisms a demonstration through <lb/>
            each other is produced thus: let B be with every <lb/>
            C, but A present with no B, the conclusion that <lb/>

            A. <lb/>
            3. Case of <lb/>
            negatives. <lb/>
            A is with no C. If then it is again necessary to conclude <lb/>
            that A is with no B, which we took before, A will be with no <lb/>
            C, but C with every B, for thus the proposition becomes con­ <lb/>
            verted. But if it is necessary to conclude that B is with C, <lb/>
            the proposition A B must no longer be similarly <lb/>
            converted, for it is the same proposition,¶ that B <lb/>
            ¶ Equipollent. <lb/>
            is with no A, and that A is with no B, but we must assume <lb/>
            that B is present with every one of which A is present with <lb/>
            none. Let A be present with no C, which was the con­ <lb/>
            clusion, but let B2 be assumed present with every of <lb/>
            which A is present with none, therefore B must necessarily <lb/>
            be present with every C, so that each of the assertions which <lb/>
            are three becomes a conclusion, and this is to demonstrate in <lb/>
            a circle, namely, assuming the conclusion and one premise <lb/>
            converse to infer the others Now in particular <lb/>
            syllogisms we cannot demonstrate universal pro­ <lb/>
            position through others, but we can the particular, <lb/>
            and that we cannot demonstrate universal is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, for the universal is shown by universals, <lb/>
            but the conclusion is not universal, and we must <lb/>

            lars the major <lb/>

            proposition is converted since both premises become particular. <note type="footnote"> and fifth syllogisms, the major of the 3rd and the minor of the 5th being <lb/>
            identical, as well as the latter being the converse conclusion of the first, <lb/>
            proved by the 4th. Thus a circle may be divided into two parts, of <lb/>
            which the conclusion of the 1st, 2nd, and 6th are direct, but those of <lb/>
            the 3rd, 4th, and 5th are converse. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Of the 4th, i. e. in order to prove the propositions of the same fourth. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Omitted by Taylor. </note><note type="footnote">a Vide Whately and Hill. Ex. 1. Every B is A <lb/>

            * Example (I.) <lb/>
            first figure is produced, and A will be the middle.* <lb/>
            Nevertheless if the syllogism is negative, we can­ <lb/>
            not demonstrate the universal proposition for the reason ad­ <lb/>
            duced before, but a particular one cannot be demonstrated, if <lb/>
            A B is similarly converted as in universals, but we may show <lb/>
            it by assumption, 1 as that A is not present with something, <lb/>
            but that B is, since otherwise there is no syllogism from the <lb/>

          <p>IN the third figure, when both propositions are <lb/>
            assumed universal, we cannot demonstrate reci­ <lb/>
            procally, for the universal is shown through uni­ <lb/>
            versals, but the conclusion in this figure is always <lb/>
            particular, so that it is clear that in short we can­ <lb/>
            not demonstrate an universal proposition by this <lb/>
            figure. Still if one be universal and the other <lb/>
            particular, there will be at one time and not at <lb/>
            another (a reciprocal demonstration); when then <lb/>
            both propositions are taken affirmative, and the <lb/>

            universal belongs to the less extreme, there will be, but when <lb/>
            to the other, there will not be. For let A be with <lb/>
            every C, but B with a certain (C), the conclusion <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            A B, if then C is assumed present with every A, C has been <lb/>
            shown to be with a certain B, but B has not been shown to be <lb/>
            with a certain C. But it is necessary if C is with a certain B, <lb/>
            that B should be with a certain C, but it is not the same thing, <lb/>
            for this to be with that, and that with this, but it mast be as­ <lb/>
            sumed that if this is present with a certain that, that also is <lb/>
            with a certain this, and from this assumption there is no longer <lb/>

            however B is with every C, but A with a certain <lb/>
            C, it will be possible to demonstrate A C, when C <lb/>
            is assumed present with every B, but A with a certain (B). <lb/>
            For if C is with every B, but A with a certain B, A must <lb/>
            necessarily be with a certain C, the middle is B. And when <lb/>

            the negative is <lb/>
            universal (ex­ <lb/>
            ception). <lb/>
            one is affirmative, but the other negative, and the <lb/>
            affirmative universal, the1 other will be demon­ <lb/>
            strated ; for let B be with every C, but A not be <lb/>
            with a certain (C), the conclusion is, that A is not <lb/>
            with a certain B. If then C be assumed besides <lb/>
            present with every B, A must necessarily not be <lb/>
            with a certain C, the middle is B. But when the <lb/>
            negative is universal, the other is not demon­ <lb/>
            strated, unless as in former cases, if it should be <lb/>
            assumed that the other is present with some individual, of what <lb/>
            this is present with none, as if A is with no C, but B with a <lb/>
            certain C, the conclusion is, that A is not with a certain B. <lb/>
            If then C should be assumed present with some individual of <lb/>
            that with every one of which A is not present, it is necessary <lb/>
            that C should be with a certain B. We cannot however in <lb/>
            any other way, converting the universal proposition, demon­ <lb/>
            strate the other, for there will by no means be a syllogism.2</p>

          <p>It appears then, that in the first figure there is <lb/>
            a reciprocal demonstration effected through the <lb/>
            third and through the first figure, for when the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>CONVERSION is by transposition of the conclusion <lb/>
            to produce a syllogism, either that the major is <lb/>
            not with the middle, or this (the middle) is not with <lb/>
            the last (the minor term).3 For it is necessary <lb/>

            conversion of <lb/>
            syllogism <lb/>

            when the conclusion is converted, and one proposition re­ <lb/>
            mains, that the other should be subverted, for if this (pro­ <lb/>
            position) will be, the conclusion will also be.4 <lb/>
            But there is a difference whether we convert the <lb/>
            conclusion contradictorily or contrarily, for there <lb/>
            is not the same syllogism, whichever way the <lb/>
            conclusion is converted, and this will appear from <lb/>
            what follows. But I mean to be opposed (con- <lb/>

            individual, and to a certain one and not to a certain one, and <lb/>
            contrarily being present with every and being present with <lb/>
            none, and with a certain one, not with a certain <lb/>
            one.,, For let A be demonstrated of C, through <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            the middle B; if then A is assumed present with no C, but <lb/>
            with every B, B will be with no C, and if A is with no C, but <lb/>
            B with every C, A will not be with every B, and not altogether <lb/>
            with none, for the universal was not concluded through the last <lb/>
            figure. In a word, we cannot subvert universally the major <note type="footnote"> I For the major of Cesare is proved in Celarent. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For the minor of Ferison is proved hypothetically.

            third figure, but we must assume both propositions to the <lb/>
            minor term, likewise also if the syllogism is negative. For <lb/>
            let A be shown through B to be present with no C, where­ <lb/>
            fore if A is assumed present with every C,1 but with no B, B <lb/>
            will be with no C, and if A and B are with every C, A will <lb/>
            be with a certain B, but it was present with none.2</p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>If however the conclusion is converted contra­ <lb/>
            dictorily, the (other) syllogisms also will be con­ <lb/>
            tradictory,8 and not universal, for one premise is particular, <lb/>
            so that the conclusion will be particular. For let the syllo­ <lb/>
            gism be affirmative, and be thus converted, hence if A is not <lb/>
            with every C, but with every B, B will not be with every C, <lb/>
            and if A is not with every C, but B with every C, A will not <lb/>

            + Universally. <lb/>
            be with every B. Likewise, if the syllogism be <lb/>
            negative,. for if A is with a certain C,4 but with <lb/>
            no B, B will not be with a certain C, and not <lb/>
            simply t with no C, and if A is with a certain C,5 <lb/>
            and B with every C, as was assumed at first,6 A will be with <lb/>
            a certain B.</p>

          <p>In particular syllogisms, when the conclusion is <lb/>

            sion is produced, since neither can we subvert it <lb/>

            gism be negative, for if A should be assumed present with <lb/>
            every C, both are subverted, but if with a certain C, neither; <lb/>

            I mean by similarly, if the conversion is made <lb/>
            contrarily (we shall subvert it contrarily), but if <lb/>

            not be subverted, for it may and may not be present with a <lb/>
            certain individual. Again, if B is with a certain C, and A <lb/>
            with a certain C, there will not be a syllogism, for neither of <lb/>
            the assumed premises is universal, wherefore A B is not sub­ <lb/>
            verted. If however the conversion is made contradictorily, <lb/>
            both are subverted, since if B is with every C, but A with no <lb/>
            B, A is with no C, it was however present with a certain (C).3 <lb/>
            Again, if B is with every C, but A with a certain C, A will be <lb/>
            with a certain B, and there is the same demonstration, if the <lb/>
            universal proposition be affirmative.</p>

            according to any of the syllogisms, but when con­ <lb/>
            tradictorily, both are in all the modes. For let <lb/>
            A be shown to be with a certain B, and let C be <lb/>
            taken as the middle, and the premises be universal: <lb/>
            if then A is assumed not present with a certain <lb/>

            nor if A is not present with a certain B, but with <lb/>

            There will also be a similar demonstration, if the premises <note type="footnote"> I Because Darii proves a contradictory conclusion to the minor, and <lb/>

            are not universal, for either both must be particular by con­ <lb/>
            version, or the universal be joined to the minor, but thus <lb/>
            there was not a syllogism neither in the first nor in the middle <lb/>
            figure. It however they are converted contra­ <lb/>
            dictorily, both propositions are subverted; for <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            if A is with no B, but B with every C, A will be with no C ; <lb/>
            again, if A is with no B, but with every C, B will be with no <lb/>
            C. In like manner if one proposition is not uni­ <lb/>
            versal ; since if A is with no B, but B with a <lb/>
            3. <lb/>
            certain C, A will not be with a certain C, but if A is with <lb/>
            no B, but with every C, B will be present with no C. So <lb/>
            also if the syllogism be negative, for let A be shown not pre­ <lb/>
            sent with a certain B, and let the affirmative proposition be <lb/>
            B C, but the negative A C, for thus there was a syllogism ; <lb/>
            when then the proposition is taken contrary to the conclusion, <lb/>
            there will not be a syllogism. For if A were with a certain <lb/>
            B, but B with every C, there was not a syllogism <lb/>
            of A and C,*1 nor if A were with a certain B, <lb/>
            but with no C was there a syllogism of B and C,† <lb/>
            so that the propositions are not subverted. When <lb/>
            however the contradictory (of the conclusion is <lb/>
            assumed) they are subverted. For if A is with <lb/>
            every B, and B with C, A will be with every C, <lb/>
            but it was with none.2 Again if At is with every <lb/>

          <p>From what has been said then it seems clear <lb/>
            how, when the conclusion is converted, a syllogism <lb/>
            arises in each figure, both when contrarily and <lb/>
            when contradictorily to the proposition, and that in the first <lb/>
            figure syllogisms are produced through the middle and the <lb/>
            last, and the minor premise is always subverted through the <lb/>
            middle (figure), but the major by the last (figure) : in the se­ <lb/>
            cond figure, however, through the first and the last, and the <lb/>
            minor premise (is) always (subverted) through the first figure, <lb/>
            but the major through the last: but in the third (figure) <lb/>
            through the first and through the middle, and the major pre­ <lb/>
            mise is always (subverted) through the first, but the minor <lb/>
            premise through the middle (figure). What therefore con­ <lb/>
            version is, and how it is effected in each figure, also what <lb/>
            syllogism is produced, has been shown.</p>

          <p>A SYLLOGISM through the impossible is shown, <lb/>
            when the contradiction of the conclusion is laid <lb/>
            down, and another proposition is assumed, and it <lb/>
            is produced in all the figures, for it is like convex <lb/>
            sion except that it differs insomuch as that it is <lb/>
            converted indeed, when a syllogism has been <lb/>
            made, and both propositions have been assumed, but it is de­ <lb/>
            duced to the impossible, when the opposite is not previously <lb/>
            acknowledged but is manifestly true. Now the terms subsist <lb/>
            similarly 1 in both, the assumption also of both is the same, as <lb/>
            for instance, if A is present with every B, but the middle is <lb/>
            C, if A is supposed present with every or with no B, but with <lb/>
            every C, which was true, it is necessary that C should be with <lb/>
            no or not with every B. But this is impossible, so that <lb/>
            the supposition is false, wherefore the opposite 2 is true. It <lb/>
            is a similar case with other figures, for whatever are capable <lb/>
            of conversion, are also capable of the syllogism per impossibile.</p>

            die, and in the third, but is not in the first. For <lb/>
            let A be supposed not present with every B, or <lb/>
            ble per impos­ <lb/>
            sibile. <lb/>
            present with no B, and let the other proposition be assumed <lb/>
            from either part, whether C is present with every A, or B <lb/>
            with every D, for thus there will be the first figure. If then <lb/>
            A is supposed not present with every B, there is no syllo­ <lb/>
            gism,1 from whichever part the proposition is assumed, but if <lb/>
            (it is supposed that A is present with) no (B), when the pro­ <lb/>
            position B D is assumed, there will indeed be a syllogism of <lb/>
            the false, but the thing proposed is not demonstrated. For if <lb/>
            A is with no B, but B with every D, A will be with no D, <lb/>
            but let this be impossible, therefore it is false that A is with <lb/>
            no B. If however it is false that it is present with no B, it <lb/>
            does not follow that it is true that it is present with every B. <lb/>
            But if C A is assumed, there is no syllogism,2 neither when <lb/>
            A is supposed not present with every B, so that it is manifest <lb/>
            that the being present with every, is not demonstrated in the <lb/>
            first figure per impossibile. But to be present with a certain <lb/>
            one, and with none, and not with every is de­ <lb/>
            monstrated, for let A be supposed present with <lb/>
            no B, but let B be assumed to be present with <lb/>
            every or with a certain C, therefore is it neces­ <lb/>
            sary that A should be with no or not with every <lb/>
            C, but this is impossible, for let this be true and <lb/>
            3. But the par. <lb/>
            affir. and univ. <lb/>
            nega. may be <lb/>
            demonstrated, <lb/>
            when the con­ <lb/>
            tradictory of <lb/>
            the conclusion <lb/>
            is assumed. <lb/>
            manifest, that A is with every C, so that if this is false, it <lb/>
            is necessary that A should be with a certain B. But if <lb/>
            one proposition should be assumed to A,3 there will not be <lb/>
            a syllogism,4 neither when the contrary to the conclusion is <lb/>
            supposed as not to be with a certain one, wherefore it appears <lb/>
            that the contradictory must be supposed. Again, let A be sup­ <lb/>
            posed present with a certain B, and C assumed present with <lb/>
            every A, then it is necessary that C should be with a certain B, <lb/>
            but let this be impossible, hence the hypothesis is false, and <lb/>
            if this be the case, that A is present with no B is true. <note type="footnote">1 Because of a particular nega. prem. being inadmissible in the first fig. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Because from the hypothesis being negative it cannot be the minor <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK II.</note><lb/>
            In like manner, if C A is assumed negative; if however the <lb/>
            proposition be assumed to B, there will not be a syllogism, <lb/>
            but if the contrary be supposed, there will be a syllogism, and <lb/>
            the impossibile (demonstration), but what was proposed will <lb/>
            not be proved. For let A be supposed present with every B, <lb/>
            and let C be assumed present with every A, then it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that C should be with every B, but this is impossible, so <lb/>
            that it is false that A is with every B, but it is not yet neces­ <lb/>
            sary that if it is not present with every, it is present with no <lb/>
            B. The same will happen also if the other proposition 1 is <lb/>
            assumed to B, for there will be a syllogism, and the impossible <lb/>
            (will be proved), but the hypothesis is not subverted, so that <lb/>
            the contradictory must be supposed. In order however to <lb/>
            prove that A is not present with every B, it must be supposed <lb/>
            4. Also the par. <lb/>
            neg. is demon­ <lb/>
            strated, but if <lb/>
            the sub-con­ <lb/>
            trary to the <lb/>
            conclusion is <lb/>
            assumed, what <lb/>
            was proposed is <lb/>
            subverted. <lb/>
            present with every B, for if A is present with <lb/>
            every B, and C with every A, C will be with <lb/>
            every B, so that if this impossible, the hypothesis <lb/>
            is false. In the same manner, if the other proposi­ <lb/>
            tion is assumed to B,2 also if C A is negative in <lb/>
            the same way, for thus there is a syllogism, but if <lb/>
            the negative be applied to B, there is no demon­ <lb/>
            stration. If however it should be supposed not present with <lb/>
            every, but with some one, there is no demonstration that it is <lb/>
            not present with every, but that it is present with none, for if <lb/>
            A is with a certain B, but C with every A, C will be with a <lb/>
            certain B, if then this is impossible it is false that A is present <lb/>
            with a certain B, so that it is true that it is present with none. <lb/>
            This however being demonstrated, what is true is subverted <lb/>
            besides, for A was present with a certain B, and with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain one was not present. Moreover, the impossibile does not <lb/>
            result from the hypothesis, for it would be false, since we <lb/>
            cannot conclude the false from the true, but now it is true, <lb/>
            for A is with a certain B, so that it must not be supposed pre­ <lb/>
            sent with a certain, but with every B. The like also will <lb/>
            occur, if we should show that A is not present with a certain <lb/>
            B, since if it is the same thing not to be with a certain indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, and to be not with every, there is the same demon­ <lb/>
            stration of both. <note type="footnote"> I A proposition evidently true. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 If the true proposition becomes the minor </note></p><pb n="207"/>

          <p>It appears then, that not the contrary, but the <lb/>
            contradictory must be supposed in all syllogisms,1 <lb/>
            for thus there will be a necessary (consequence), <lb/>
            and a probable axiom,2 for if of every thing af- <lb/>

            Urination or negation (is true), when it is shown that negation <lb/>
            is not, affirmation must necessarily be true. Again, except it <lb/>
            is admitted that affirmation is true, it is fitting to admit nega­ <lb/>
            tion ; but it is in neither way fitting to admit the contrary, for <lb/>
            neither, if the being present with no one is false, is the being <lb/>
            present with every one necessarily true, not is it probable <lb/>
            that if the one is false the other is true.</p>
          <p>It is palpable, therefore, that in the first figure, all other <lb/>
            problems are demonstrated through the impossible; but that <lb/>
            the universal affirmative is not demonstrated.</p>

          <p>IN the middle, however, and last figure, this3 also <lb/>
            is demonstrated. For let A be supposed not pre­ <lb/>
            sent with every B, but let A be supposed present <lb/>
            with every C, therefore if it is not present with <lb/>

            B, but this is impossible, for let it be manifest <lb/>

            figure A is <lb/>
            proved per ab­ <lb/>

            that C is with every B, wherefore what was supposed is false, <lb/>

            ever the contrary be supposed, there will be a syllogism, and <lb/>
            the impossible, yet the proposition is not demonstrated. For <lb/>
            if A is present with no B, but with every C, C will <lb/>

            with a certain B, let A be supposed present with <lb/>
            no B, but with every C, therefore it is necessary <lb/>

            be with no B, and this is impossible, wherefore it is true that <lb/>
            A is not with every B. Evidently then all syllogisms are <lb/>

          <p>THROUGH the last figure also, (it will be con­ <lb/>
            cluded) in a similar way. For let A be supposed <lb/>
            not present with a certain B, but C present with <lb/>
            every B, A then is not with a certain C, and if <lb/>
            this is impossible, it is false that A is not with a <lb/>
            certain B, wherefore that it is present with every B is true. <lb/>
            If, again, it should be supposed present with none, there <lb/>
            will be a syllogism, and the impossible, but the proposition is <lb/>
            not proved, for if the contrary is supposed there will be the <lb/>
            same3 as in the former (syllogisms). But in order to con­ <lb/>
            clude that it is present with a certain one, this hypothesis <lb/>
            must be assumed, for if A is with no B, but C with a certain <lb/>
            B, A will not be with every C, if then this is false, it is <lb/>
            true that A is with a certain B. But when A is with no <lb/>
            B, let it be supposed present with a certain one, and let C be <lb/>
            assumed present with every B, wherefore it is necessary that <lb/>
            A should be with a certain C, but it was with no C, so that it <lb/>
            is false that A is with a certain B. If however A is supposed <note type="footnote"> I The proposition will not be so much confirmed as subverted, for if 0 <lb/>

            present with every B, the proposition is not demonstrated,1 <lb/>
            but in order to its not being present with every, this hypothesis <lb/>
            must be taken.2 For if A is with every B, and C with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain B, A is with a certain C, but this was not so, hence it is <lb/>
            false that it is with every one, and if thus, it is true that it <lb/>
            is not with every B, and if it is supposed present with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain B, there will be the same things as in the syllogism: <lb/>
            above mentioned.</p>
          <p>It appears then that in all syllogisms through <lb/>
            the impossible the contradictory must be supposed, <lb/>
            and it is apparent that in the middle figure the <lb/>

          <p>A DEMONSTRATION to the impossible differs from <lb/>
            an ostensive, in that it admits what it wishes to <lb/>

            whatever is concluded ostensively can also be proved per im­ <lb/>

            the first figure, <lb/>
            is proved in the <lb/>

            sively, if the <lb/>
            problem be ne­ <lb/>
            gative, and in <lb/>

            ative. <lb/>
            1. * Darii. <lb/>
            For when the syllogism2 is in the first figure,3 the <lb/>
            truth will be in the middle, or in the last, the ne­ <lb/>
            gative indeed in the middle, but the affirmative <lb/>
            in the last. When however the syllogism is in <lb/>
            the middle figure,4 the truth will be in the first in <lb/>
            all the problems, but when the syllogism is in the <lb/>
            last, the truth will be in the first and in the mid­ <lb/>
            dle, affirmatives in the first, but negatives in the <lb/>
            middle. For let it be demonstrated through the <lb/>
            first figure * that A is present with no, or not with <lb/>
            every B, the hypothesis then was that A is with a certain B, <lb/>
            but C was assumed present with every A, but with no B, for <lb/>
            thus there was a syllogism, and also the impossible. But <lb/>
            this is the middle figure, if C is with every A, but with no B, <lb/>
            and it is evident from these that A is with no B. Likewise if it <lb/>
            2. t Barbara. <lb/>
            has been demonstrated to be not with every, for <lb/>
            the hypothesis is that it is with every, but C was <lb/>
            assumed present with every A, but not with every B. Also <lb/>

            also there is the middle figure.‡ . Again, let A be <lb/>

            then is, that it is present with none, but B was <lb/>
            assumed to be with every C, and A to be with <lb/>

            for the hypothesis was that A was with no B, but A was as­ <lb/>

            the syllogism t should be negative,1 the hypothesis <lb/>
            was that A is with a certain B, for A was assumed <lb/>

          <p>Again, in the third figure,* let A be shown to <lb/>

          <p>In the first figure then there is no syllogism <lb/>
            from contradictory propositions, neither affirma­ <lb/>

            figure is not predicated of both (extremes), but <lb/>
            one thing is denied of it, and it is predicated of <lb/>
            another; these propositions however are not con­ <lb/>

            it should be assumed that medicine is not excellent, for A is with <lb/>

            will be a negative, both when the terms are and are not uni­ <lb/>

            a person assumes that all medicine is science, and that no <lb/>
            medicine is science, he would assume B present with every A, <lb/>
            † Example (4.) <lb/>
            and C with no A, so that a certain science will <lb/>
            not be science.† Likewise, if the proposition A <lb/>
            B is not taken as universal, for if a certain medicine is science, <lb/>
            and again no medicine is science, it results that a certain sci­ <lb/>

          <p>We must however understand that it is possible thus to as­ <lb/>
            sume opposites as we have said, that every science is good, <lb/>
            and again, that no science is good, or that a certain science <lb/>
            is not good, which does not usually lie concealed. It is also <lb/>

              no C, or with every C and with no B, or with the whole of <lb/>
              the one, but not with the whole of the other; and again, we <lb/>
              may convert this as to the terms. It will be the same also in <lb/>
              the third figure, so that it is clear in how many ways and in <lb/>
              what figures it is possible for a syllogism to arise through op­ <lb/>
              posite propositions.</p>
          <p>But it is also manifest that we may infer a true <lb/>
            conclusion from false premises, as we have ob­ <lb/>
            served. before, but from opposites we cannot, for <lb/>
            a syllogism always arises contrary to the fact, as <lb/>
            if a thing is good, (the conclusion will be,) that it <lb/>
            is not good, or if it is an animal, that it is not an <lb/>

            evident, that in paralogisms1 there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent a contradiction of the hypothesis arising, <lb/>
            as if a thing is an odd number, that it is not odd, <lb/>
            for from opposite propositions there was a con­ <lb/>

            will be a contradiction of the hypothesis. We must under­ <lb/>
            stand, however, that we cannot so conclude contraries from <lb/>
            one syllogism, as that the conclusion may be that what is not <lb/>
            good is good, or any thing of this kind, unless such a pro­ <lb/>
            position is immediately assumed,2 as that every animal is <lb/>
            white and not white, and that man is an animal.3 <lb/>
            But we must either presume contradiction,. as <lb/>
            that all science is opinion,5 and is not opinion, <lb/>
            and afterwards assume that medicine is a sci­ <lb/>

            begging the question from the beginning, but since <lb/>

            endeavours to demonstrate by itself what cannot be <lb/>
            known by itself, then he begs the original question. <lb/>
            It is possible however to do this so as immediately <lb/>
            to take the thing proposed for granted, and it is <note type="footnote"> tradiction of the conclusion," " proprie syllogismus est adversarium re­ <lb/>

            adapted to be demonstrated by that (which was to be investi. <lb/>
            gated), to demonstrate by these the original proposition; as <lb/>
            if a person should demonstrate A through B, and B through <lb/>
            C, while C was naturally adapted to be proved through A <lb/>
            for it happens that those who thus syllogize, prove <lb/>
            A by itself. This they do,1 who fancy that they <lb/>
            describe parallel lines, for they deceive themselves <lb/>

            they are parallel. Hence it occurs to those who thus syllo­ <lb/>

            will be known through itself, which is impossible.</p>
          <p>If then a man, when it is not proved that A is <lb/>
            with C, and likewise with B, begs that A may be <lb/>

            admitted present with B, it is not yet evident whether he <lb/>
            begs the original proposition, but that he does not prove it is <lb/>
            clear, for what is similarly doubtful is not the principle of <lb/>
            demonstration. If however B so subsists in reference to C <lb/>
            as to be the same,2 or that they are evidently convertible, or <lb/>
            that one is present with the other,3 then he begs <lb/>
            the original question. For that A is with B, may <lb/>
            be shown through them, if they are converted, <lb/>
            but now4 this prevents5 it, yet not the mode ; if <lb/>

          <p>S. This fallacy <lb/>
            may occur in <lb/>
            both the 2nd <lb/>
            and 3rd figures, <lb/>
            but in the case <lb/>

            first.</p>
          <p>If then the petitio principii is to prove by it­ <lb/>

          <p>THAT the false does not happen on account of this <lb/>
            (which we are accustomed to say frequently in <lb/>
            discussion) occurs first in syllogisms leading to <lb/>
            the impossible, when a person contradicts that <lb/>
            which was demonstrated by a deduction to the <lb/>
            impossible. For neither will he who does not con- <lb/>
            1. This hap­ <lb/>
            pens in a de­ <lb/>
            duction to the <lb/>
            impossible, <lb/>
            which is con­ <lb/>
            tradicted not in <lb/>
            offensive de­ <lb/>
            monstration. <lb/>
            tradet assert that it is not (false) on this account, but that <lb/>
            something false was laid down before ;2 nor in the ostensive <lb/>
            (proof), since he does not lay down a contradiction. Moreover <lb/>
            when any thing is ostensively subverted through <lb/>
            A B C,* we cannot say that a syllogism is pro­ <lb/>
            duced not on account of what is laid down, for we <lb/>
            * i. e. osten­ <lb/>
            sively through <lb/>
            those terms. <lb/>
            then say that is not produced on account of this, when this <lb/>
            being subverted, the syllogism is nevertheless completed, <lb/>
            which is not the case in ostensive syllogisms, since the thesis <lb/>
            being subverted the syllogism which belongs to it will no <lb/>
            longer subsist. It is evident then that in syllogisms leading <lb/>
            to the impossible, the assertion, " not on account of this," is <lb/>
            made, and when the original hypothesis so subsists in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the impossible as that both when it is, and when it is <lb/>
            not, the impossible will nevertheless occur.</p>
          <p>Hence the clearest mode of the false not subsist­ <lb/>
            ing on account of the hypothesis, is when the <lb/>
            syllogism leading to the impossible 3 does not con­ <lb/>
            join with the hypothesis by its media, as we have <lb/>
            observed in the t Topics. For this is to assume as <lb/>
            a cause, what is not a cause, as if any one wishing <lb/>

            is by no means whatever connected with what was <lb/>
            stated from the first.1 There is however another mode, if the <lb/>
            impossible should be connected with the hypothesis, yet it does <lb/>
            not happen on account of that, for this may occur, whether we <lb/>
            assume the connexion up or down, as if A is placed present <lb/>

            possible will be <lb/>
            deduced. <lb/>
            thesis is subverted. It is necessary however to <lb/>
            unite the impossible with the terms (assumed) <lb/>
            from the beginning, for thus it will be on account <lb/>
            of the hypothesis ; † as to a person taking the <lb/>
            connexion downward, (it ought to be connected) <lb/>
            with the affirmative term ; for if it is impossible <lb/>
            that A should be with D, when A is removed <lb/>
            there will no longer be the false. But (the connexion being <lb/>
            assumed) in an upward direction, (it should be joined) with the <lb/>
            subject, for if F cannot be with B, when B is subverted, there <lb/>
            will no longer be the impossible, the same also occurs when <lb/>
            the syllogisms are negative.</p>
          <p>It appears then that if the impossible is not connected with <lb/>
            the original terms, the false does not happen on account of <lb/>
            the thesis, or is it that neither thus will the false occur always <lb/>
            on account of the hypothesis ? For if A is placed present not <lb/>
            with B but with K, and K with C, and this with D, thus also <lb/>
            the impossible remains; and in like manner when we take <lb/>
            the terms in an upward direction, so that since the impossible <lb/>
            happens whether this is or this is not, it will not be on account <note type="footnote"> 1 That the diameter of a square is not commensurable with its side <lb/>

            the same impossible is concluded through the re­ <lb/>

            necessary that one or both of these should be false, <lb/>

            to opinion, for example, if the same thing happens <lb/>
            to be present with many things primary,3 and a <lb/>

            person should be ignorant of one, and think that it is <lb/>
            present with nothing, but should know the other. <lb/>
            For let A be present with B and with C, <lb/>
            1. <lb/>
            per se, (that is, essentially,) and let these, in like manner, be <lb/>
            with every D ; if then somebody thinks that A is with every <lb/>
            B, and this with every D, but A with no C, and <lb/>
            this with every D; he will have knowledge ‡ <lb/>

          <p>Again, if one should be deceived about those <lb/>
            things which are from the same class, * as if A is <lb/>
            with B, but this with C, and C with D, and <lb/>
            should apprehend A to be with every B, and again with no <lb/>
            C, he will at the same time both know and not apprehend <lb/>
            its presence. Will he then admit nothing else from these <lb/>
            things, than that he does not form an opinion on what he <lb/>
            knows ? 2 for in some way, he knows that A is with C through <lb/>
            t C being a <lb/>
            part of B. <lb/>
            t i. e. in the <lb/>
            first deception. <lb/>
            2. Case of the <lb/>
            middles in Bar­ <lb/>
            bara and Cela­ <lb/>
            rent, not being <lb/>
            subaltern. <lb/>
            § The major of <lb/>
            Barbara. <lb/>
            || Major of <lb/>
            Celarent. <lb/>
            ¶ The minor of <lb/>
            both. <lb/>
            B, just as the particular is known in the t uni­ <lb/>
            versal, so that what he somehow knows, he ad­ <lb/>
            mits he does not conceive at all, which is impos­ <lb/>
            sible. In what, however, we mentioned before,t <lb/>
            if the middle is not of the same class, it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible to conceive both propositions, according to <lb/>
            each of the media,3 as if A were with every B,§ <lb/>
            but with no C,|| and both these with every D.¶ <lb/>
            For it happens that the major proposition assumes <lb/>
            a contrary, either simply or partially,4 for if with <lb/>
            every thing with which B is present a person thinks A is present, <lb/>
            but knows that B is with D, he also will know that A is with D. <lb/>
            Hence, if, again, he thinks that A is with nothing with which <lb/>
            C is, he will not think that A is with any thing with which <lb/>
            B is, but that he who thinks that it is with every thing with <lb/>
            which B is, should again think that it is not with something <lb/>
            with which B is, is either simply or partially contrary. Thus <lb/>
            however it is impossible to think, still nothing prevents (our <lb/>
            * i. e. B and C. <lb/>
            assuming) one proposition according to each (mid­ <lb/>
            dle),6 * or both according to one, as that A is with <lb/>
            every B, and B with D, and again, A with no C. For a de­ <lb/>
            ception of this kind resembles that by which we are deceived <lb/>
            about particulars, as if A is with every B, but B with every <lb/>
            C, A will be with every C.6 If then a man knows that A is <note type="footnote"> I Taylor says, " co-ordinatum;" Waitz, " ex eadem serie." It is clear, <lb/>
            that subalterns are intended. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For in the major of Celarent, he assumes no C is A, whereas he <lb/>
            knows, as will be shown, that C is A. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 That is, he cannot, at one and the same time, assume both the prop. <lb/>

            with every thing with which B is, he knows also that it is <lb/>
            with C ; still nothing prevents his being ignorant of the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of C, as if A were two right angles, B a triangle, and <lb/>
            C a perceptible triangle.* For a man may think <lb/>
            that C does not exist, knowing that every triangle <lb/>
            * Example <unclear/>(1. <lb/>
            has two (equal to) right angles, hence he will know and be <lb/>
            ignorant of the same thing at once ; for to know <lb/>
            that every triangle has angles equal to two right, <lb/>
            is not a simple thing,f but in one respect arises <lb/>
            from possessing universal science, in another, par­ <lb/>
            ticular science. Thus therefore he knows by uni­ <lb/>
            versal science, that C has angles equal to two right <lb/>
            3. Distinction <lb/>
            between uni­ <lb/>
            versal and par­ <lb/>
            ticular know­ <lb/>
            ledge. <lb/>

            angles, but by particular science he does not know it, so that <lb/>
            he will not hold contraries. In like manner is the reasoning in <lb/>
            the Meno,t that discipline is reminiscence, for it <lb/>
            never happens that we have a pre-existent know­ <lb/>
            ledge of particulars, but together with induction, § <lb/>

              while possessing the universal, yet are deceived <lb/>
              in the particular. It is the same also as to what <lb/>
              we have spoken of, for the deception about the <lb/>
              middle is not contrary to science about syllogism, <lb/>
              nor the opinion as to each of the middles. Still nothing prevents <lb/>
              one who knows that A is with the whole of B, and this again <lb/>
              with C, thinking that A is not with C, as he who knows that <lb/>
              every mule is barren, and that this (animal) is a mule, may think <lb/>
              that this is pregnant; for he does not know that A is with C <lb/>

              from knowing <lb/>
              one prop. and <lb/>
              being ignorant <lb/>
              of the other. <lb/>
              from not at the same time surveying each. Hence <lb/>
              it is evident that if he knows one (of the proposi­ <lb/>
              tions), but is ignorant of the other, he will be de­ <lb/>
              ceived as to how the universal subsists with refer­ <lb/>
              ence to the particular sciences. For we know nothing of those <lb/>
              things which fall under the senses as existent apart from <lb/>
              sense,1 not even if we happen to have perceived it before, un­ <lb/>
              less in so far as we possess universal and peculiar knowledge, <lb/>
              6. Scientific <lb/>
              knowledge is <lb/>
              predicated <lb/>
              triply. <lb/>
              and not in that we energize. For to know is pre­ <lb/>
              dicated triply, either as to the universal or to <lb/>
              the peculiar (knowledge), or as to energizing, so <lb/>
              that to be deceived is likewise in as many ways. <lb/>
              Nothing therefore prevents a man both knowing and being de* <lb/>
              * i. e. so as not <lb/>
              to hold a self­ <lb/>
              ceived about the same thing, but not in a con­ <lb/>
              trary manner,* and this happens also to him, who <note type="footnote">either. What however Aristotle here means is, that scientific knowledge, <lb/>
              or that of particulars, is said of truths deduced from higher truths; hence <lb/>
              to each of these there is a foundation, in universal knowledge (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοει̃ν</foreign>), <lb/>
              viz. we originally begin our speculation upon them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀληθω̃ν καὶ πρώτων</foreign>, <lb/>
              or intuitively perceived truths, though these generals will not of themselves <lb/>
              suffice to prevent error in particulars, seeing that to each of the last its <lb/>
              own peculiar study and examination is appropriately necessary. This is <lb/>
              fully borne out by the relative meanings of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>. The <lb/>
              word “innate” we have inserted from Buhle; by a contrary manner is <lb/>
              not only meant, as Taylor says, " not in a manner contrary to science," <lb/>
              but without holding a contradictory opinion, we may know the general, <lb/>
              yet mistake the particular truth. (Cf. Hill's note on Objective and Sub­ <lb/>

          <p>Notwithstanding, whoever thinks that the very <lb/>
            being of good is the very being of evil, will ap­ <lb/>
            prehend that there is the same essence of good <lb/>
            and of evil; for let the essence of good be A, and <lb/>
            the essence of evil B; and again, let the essence <lb/>

            ception of this <lb/>
            kind, a person <lb/>
            may imagine <lb/>
            that a thing <lb/>
            concurs with <lb/>
            its contrary. <lb/>
            of good be C. Since then he thinks that B and C are the <lb/>
            same, he will also think that C is B; and again, in a similar <lb/>
            manner, that B is A, wherefore that C is A.† <lb/>
            For just as if it were true that of what C is predi­ <lb/>
            t Example (2.) <lb/>
            cated B is, and of what B is, A is ; it was also true that A is <lb/>
            predicated of C; so too in the case of the verb " to opine." <lb/>
            In like manner, as regards the verb "to be," for C and B <lb/>
            being the same, and again, B and A, C also is the same as A. <lb/>
            Likewise, as regards to opine, is then this necessary,4 if any <lb/>
            one should grant the first? but perhaps that is false, that <lb/>
            any one should think that the essence of good is the essence <lb/>
            of evil, unless accidentally,6 for we may opine this in many <lb/>
            ways, but we must consider it better.7 <note type="footnote"> I i. e. he has not considered both propositions together. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. because he thinks the mule parturient. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 i. e. as Taylor says, it is a deceptive syllogism, which proves no mule <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. If the terms <lb/>
            connected by a <lb/>
            certain middle <lb/>
            are converted, <lb/>
            the middle <lb/>
            must be con­ <lb/>
            verted with <lb/>
            both.</p>
          <p>* The major.</p>
          <p>t The minor.</p>
          <p>WHEN the extremes are converted, the middle <lb/>
            must necessarily be converted with both. For if <lb/>
            A is present with C through B, if it is converted, <lb/>
            and C is with whatever A is, B also is converted <lb/>
            with A,. and with whatever A is present, B also <lb/>
            is through the middle C, and C is converted with <lb/>
            B t through the middle A. The same will occur <lb/>
            with negatives, as if B is with C,l but A is not <lb/>
            with B,2 neither will A be with C, if then B is converted with <lb/>
            A, C also will be converted with A. For let B not be with <lb/>
            A,3 neither then will C be4 with A, since B was with every <lb/>
            C, and if C is converted with B, (the latter is also converted <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            with A; for of whatever B is predicated, C also <lb/>
            is, and if C is converted with A, B also is con­ <lb/>
            verted with A, for with whatever B is present, C also is,5 but <lb/>
            3. The mode of <lb/>
            converting a <lb/>
            negative syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, begins <lb/>
            from the con­ <lb/>
            clusion, as in <lb/>
            Barbara. <lb/>
            C is not present with what A is. This also alone <lb/>
            begins from the conclusion, (but the others not <lb/>
            similarly,) as in the case of an affirmative syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, Again, if A and B are converted, and C <lb/>
            and D likewise; but A or C must necessarily be <lb/>
            present with every individual; B and D also will so subsist, <lb/>
            as that one of them will be present with every individual. <lb/>
            For since B is present with whatever A is, and D with what­ <lb/>
            eyer C is, but A or C with every individual, and not both at <lb/>
            the same time, it is evident that B or D is with every indi­ <lb/>

            B also and D are converted, since if B is not present with a <lb/>
            certain thing with which D is, it is evident that A is present <note type="footnote"> I The minor of Celarent. </note><note type="footnote">2 The major of Celarent. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The minor of Camestres. </note><note type="footnote">4 The conclusion of Camestres. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 i. e. every B is C, this is the major of Camestres, inferred from the <lb/>

            with it. But if A is, C also will be, for they are converted, <lb/>
            so that C and D will be present at the same time, but this is <lb/>
            impossible ;1 as if what is unbegotten is incorruptible, and what <lb/>
            is incorruptible unbegotten, it is necessary that what is be­ <lb/>
            gotten should be corruptible, and the corruptible begotten. <lb/>
            But when A is present with the whole of B and C, and is <lb/>
            predicated of nothing else, and B also is with every C, it is <lb/>
            necessary that A and B should be converted, as since A is <lb/>
            predicated of B C alone, but B itself is predicated both of it­ <lb/>
            self and of C, it is evident that of those things of which A is <lb/>
            predicated, of all these B will also be predicated, except of A <lb/>
            itself. Again, when A and B are with the whole of C, and <lb/>
            C is converted with B, it is necessary that A should be with <lb/>
            every B, for since A is with every C, but C with B in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of reciprocity, A will also be with every B. But <lb/>
            when of two opposites A is preferable to B, and <lb/>
            D to C likewise, if A C are more eligible than B <lb/>
            D, A is preferable to D, in like manner A should <lb/>

            to be similarly avoided) and D (to be pursued), for these are <lb/>
            opposed. If then A is similarly eligible with D, B also is simi­ <lb/>
            larly to be avoided with C, each (opposite) to each, in like man­ <lb/>

            gible than the other they) cannot be similarly (eligible), for <lb/>
            (else) B D would be similarly (eligible) (with A C). <lb/>
            If however D is preferable to A, B also is less to be <lb/>
            avoided than C, for the less is opposed to the less, <lb/>
            and the greater good and the less evil are prefer­ <lb/>
            able to the less good and the greater evil, where- <lb/>

            to the less good <lb/>
            and greater <lb/>
            evil. <lb/>
            fore the whole B D is preferable to A C. Now however <lb/>
            this is not the case, hence A is preferable to D, consequently <lb/>
            C is less to be avoided than B. If then every lover accord­ <lb/>
            ing to love chooses A, that is to be in such a condition as to <lb/>
            be gratified, and C not to be gratified, rather than be gratified, <lb/>
            which is D, and yet not be in a condition to be gratified, which <lb/>
            is B, it is evident that A, i. e. to be in a condition to be gratified, <note type="footnote"> I He had before shown B to be predicated of D. universally, though it <lb/>

            are through the <lb/>
            above-named <lb/>
            figures.</p>
          <p>WE must now show that not only dialectic and <lb/>
            demonstrative syllogisms are produced through <lb/>
            the above-named figures, but that rhetorical are <lb/>
            also, and in short, every kind of demonstration <lb/>
            and by every method. For we believe all things <lb/>
            either through syllogism or from induction.</p>
          <p>Induction, then, and the inductive syllogism is to <lb/>
            prove one extreme in the middle through the other,3 as if B is the <lb/>
            middle of A C, and we show through C that A is with B, for <note type="footnote"> I This confirms the opinion of Plato in the Symposium. The demon­ <lb/>
            stration is thus; if of four terms the first is preferable to the 2nd, and <lb/>

            marks) denote the syllogism proper, or reasoning from a whole to its <lb/>
            parts, but comprehends formal reasoning generally, as in Rhet. ii. 25, <lb/>
            Enthymem is spoken of as including example. For induction properly <lb/>
            is an inverted syllogism, which argues from the individuals collected <lb/>
            to the universal or whole class they constitute, whereas syllogism <lb/>
            does just the reverse. Upon the various kinds of induction see Hill's <lb/>
            Logic, 229, where some examples are given; also Mansel's Logic, <lb/>
            Appendix note F. Inasmuch as we seldom can enumerate all the <lb/>
            individuals of a class, we rarely meet with a specimen of perfect in­ <lb/>
            duction, but we agree with Whately in believing, that the cause of <lb/>
            the opposition of induction to syllogism, arises entirely from the inac­ <lb/>
            curacy in the use of the word. Vide Whately, Log. b. iv. c. i. 1. Even <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CHAP. XXIII.]</note><lb/>
            thus we make inductions. Thus let A be long- <lb/>
            lived, B void of bile, C every thing long-lived, as <lb/>
            man, horse, mule; A then- is present with the <lb/>
            whole of C, for every thing void of bile is long- <lb/>
            lived, but B† also, or that which is void of bile, <lb/>
            is present with every C, if then C is converted <lb/>
            with B,t and does not exceed the middle, it is <lb/>
            necessary that A should be with B. For it has <lb/>
            been before shown,1 that when any two things <lb/>
            are present with the same thing, and the extreme <lb/>
            is convertible with one of them, that the other <lb/>
            2. Induction is <lb/>
            proving the <lb/>
            major term of <lb/>
            the middle by <lb/>

            We must however consider C as composed of all <lb/>
            singulars, for induction is produced through § all. <lb/>
            A syllogism of this kind however is of the first, <lb/>
            and immediate proposition ; for of those which <lb/>
            have a middle, the syllogism is through the mid­ <lb/>
            dle, but of those where there is not (a middle) it <lb/>
            is by induction.2 In some way also induction is <lb/>
            opposed to syllogism, for the latter demonstrates <lb/>
            the extreme ∥ of the third through the middle, but <lb/>

          <p>EXAMPLE is when the extreme is shown2 to be <lb/>
            present with the middle through something similar <lb/>
            to the third,3 but it is necessary to know that the <lb/>
            middle is with the third, and the first with what <lb/>
            is similar.4 For example, let A be bad, B to (make war) upon <lb/>
            neighbours, C the Athenians against the Thebans, D the <lb/>
            2. <lb/>

            Thebans against the Phocians. If then we wish <lb/>
            to show that it is bad to war against the Thebans, <lb/>
            we must assume that it is bad to war against <lb/>
            neighbours, but the demonstration of this is from similars, as <lb/>
            that (the war) by the Thebans against the Phocians (was bad). <lb/>
            Since then war against neighbours is bad, but that against <lb/>
            the Thebans is against neighbours, it is evidently bad to war <lb/>
            against the Thebans, so that it is evident that B is with C, <lb/>
            and with D, (since both are to war against neighbours,) and <lb/>
            that A is with D, (for the war against the Phocians was not <lb/>
            advantageous to the Thebans,) but that A is with B will be. <note type="footnote"> pare also the whole chapter with Rliet. b. i. c. 2, b. ii. c. 23; and <lb/>

            enumeration of individuals, whilst example selects single cases; 2nd, <lb/>
            Induction stops at the universal, whilst example infers syllogistically a <lb/>
            conclusion regarding another individual: in fact, example includes an <lb/>
            imperfect (therefore illogical) induction and a syllogism. Sometimes it is <lb/>
            called loosely reasoning from analogy, but as logic recognises only formal <lb/>
            consequence, neither analogy nor example have any logical force. (Vide <lb/>
            Mill's Logic, b. iii. ch.20 ; also Mansel, p. 82.) The distinction is however <lb/>
            better drawn by Hill, p. 243, comprehending, 1st, the antecedent, which in <lb/>

              and by two figures ; in two ways, because every <lb/>
              objection is either universal or particular, and by <lb/>
              because they are used opposite to the proposition, <lb/>
              and opposites * are concluded in the first and third <lb/>
              figure alone. When then a person requires it to <lb/>
              be admitted that any thing is present with every <lb/>
              individual, we object either that it is with none, <lb/>
              or that it is not with a certain one, and of these, <lb/>
              the being present with none, (is shown) by the <lb/>
              first figure,† but that it is not with a certain one <lb/>
              by the last.t For instance, let A be "there is one <lb/>
              science, and B contraries;" when therefore a person advances <lb/>
              that there is one science of contraries, it is objected either <lb/>
              that there is not the same science of opposites, altogether, <lb/>
              § Example (1.) <lb/>
              || Felapton. <lb/>
              ¶ Example (2.) <lb/>
              but contraries are opposites, so that there is the <lb/>
              first figure ;§ or that there is not one science of <lb/>
              the known and of the unknown, and this is the <lb/>
              third figure,|| for of C, that is, of the known, and <lb/>
              of the unknown, it is true that they are contraries, <lb/>
              but that there is one science of them is false.¶ <lb/>
              Again, in like manner in a negative proposition, for if any one <lb/>
              asserts that there is not one science of contraries, we say either <lb/>
              that there is the same science of all opposites, or that there is <lb/>
              of certain contraries, as of the salubrious, and of the noxious ; <lb/>

              that there is therefore (one science) of all things <lb/>
              is by the first figure,* but that there is of certain <lb/>
              by the third.t In short, in all (disputations) it is <lb/>
              necessary that he who universally objects should <lb/>
              apply a contradiction of the propositions to the <lb/>
              universal,‡ as if some one should assert that there <lb/>
              is not the same science of all contraries, (the ob­ <lb/>
              jector) should say, that there is one of opposites. For thus <lb/>
              4. And for that <lb/>
              it is necessary that there should be the first figure, <lb/>
              since the middle becomes an universal to that <figure type="illustration">

               <note type="margin">CHAP. XXVI.]</note><lb/>
              (which was proposed) at first, but he who objects <lb/>
              in part (must contradict that which is universal,§ <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν μερει</foreign>. Vide <lb/>
              note. <lb/>
              § Subject <lb/>
              of which the proposition is stated, as that there is not the same <lb/>
              science of the known, and the unknown, for the <lb/>
              contraries are universal with reference, to these.. <lb/>
              The third figure is also produced, for what is par­ <lb/>
              ticularly assumed is the middle, for instance, the <lb/>
              known and the unknown; as from what we may <lb/>
              infer a contrary syllogistically, from the same we en­ <lb/>
              deavour to urge objections. Wherefore we adduce <lb/>
              then (objections) from these figures only,† for in <lb/>
              these alone opposite syllogisms are constructed, <lb/>
              since we cannot conclude affirmatively through the <lb/>
              middle figure.1 Moreover, even if it were (pos­ <lb/>
              sible), yet the (objection), in the middle figure <lb/>
              would require more (extensive discussion), as if <lb/>
              any one should not admit A to be present with B, <lb/>
              * Contraries <lb/>
              attributed to <lb/>
              the known and <lb/>
              unknown, as <lb/>
              universal to <lb/>
              particular. <lb/>
              5. Objection <lb/>
              adduced in the <lb/>
              first and third <lb/>
              figures alone. <lb/>
              t Hence if the <lb/>
              prop. is nega­ <lb/>
              tive, an objec­ <lb/>
              tion to it cannot <lb/>
              be proper in the <lb/>
              2nd figure since <lb/>
              the objection <lb/>
              ought to affirm. <lb/>
              because C is not consequent to it, (B). For this is manifest <lb/>
              through other propositions, the objection however must not <lb/>
              be diverted to other things, but should forthwith have the <lb/>
              other proposition apparent,3 wherefore also from this figure <lb/>
              alone there is not a sign.4</p>
          <p>We must consider also other objections, as those <lb/>
            adduced from the contrary, from the similar, and <lb/>
            from what is according to opinion,5 also whether <lb/>
            it is possible to assume a particular objection from <lb/>
            the first, or a negative from the middle figure. <lb/>

            margin, since the former approaches nearer to its Aristotelian definition <lb/>
            as a proposition stating a general probability. This indeed is a propo­ <lb/>
            sition nearly, though not quite, universal, and when employed in an <lb/>
            Enthymeme, will form the major premise of a syllogism such as the <lb/>
            following: <lb/>
            Most men who envy, hate. <lb/>
            This man envies: <lb/>
            Therefore this man (probably) hates. </note><note type="footnote"> Aristotle limits it to contingent matter, and its relation to the conclusion <lb/>

            known to be an indication, more or less certain, of the truth of some fur­ <lb/>
            ther statement, whether of a single fact or of a general belief. We say in a <lb/>

            for the Enthymemes drawn from each; it is, in fact, a singular proposition <lb/>
            employed relatively to some other proposition which may be inferred from <lb/>
            it, and will form one premise of a syllogism, which may be in either of <lb/>
            these figures which Aristotle discusses, having respect in this division to <lb/>
            the extent of the so-called middle term, as compared with the other two <lb/>
            terms. In the first and second figures it is the minor premise, in the <lb/>
            third it seems more naturally to belong to the major. Whately con­ <lb/>
            siders the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵκος</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">διοτι</foreign>) of Aristotle to be an a priori argument, which <lb/>

            could not be so employed; he has however glanced at this point but <lb/>
            generally. Aristotle tells us that we may either class <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήριον</foreign>, as he <lb/>
            does in the Rhet. c. 2, as a species of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃ον</foreign>, or contradistinguish two <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃α</foreign>—in necessary matter as in the relation of a particular to an uni­ <lb/>
            versal, or of an universal to a particular, and class the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήριον</foreign> as a <lb/>
            species under a genus. By a reference to Dr. Hessey's Tables the exact <lb/>
            position of each in the enthymematic system may be clearly perceived: <lb/>
            we may merely add that, as propositions, it is no where stated that <foreign xml:lang="grc">εικος</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σημει̃ον</foreign> may not be combined in the same syllogism, and that much <lb/>

            what men know to have generally happened or <lb/>
            not, or to be or not to be ; this is a likelihood, <lb/>
            for instance, that the envious hate, or that lovers <lb/>
            love: but a sign seems to be a demonstrative pro­ <lb/>
            position, necessary or probable, for that which <lb/>
            when it exists a thing is, or which when it has <lb/>
            happened, before or after, a thing has happened, <lb/>
            this is a sign of a thing happening or being. <lb/>
            Now an Enthymemeis a syllogism from likelihoods <lb/>

            Doctor, of the consideration of these elements of Enthymeme, first as <lb/>
            propositions, next as terms. </note><note type="footnote"> In regard to Enthymeme, it is no wonder that difficulties should not <lb/>
            vanish, when even the abandonment of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτελὴς</foreign>, ejected as a <lb/>
            gloss by Pacius, and discountenanced by the best MSS. of the old Latin <lb/>
            version, is still clung to by some authors. Enthymeme is composed of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκότα</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃α</foreign>, and without circumscribing our notion of it within the <lb/>
            limits absurdly laid down of its etymology by Aldrich, we may conceive it <lb/>
            in a general sense as comprehending <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign> of every kind; and at other <lb/>
            times limited to a special kind of syllogism designated rhetorical. Vari­ <lb/>
            ous senses have been attributed to it by Cicero, Quintilian, and others, but <lb/>
            Aristotle in general describes it as one sort of argument on moral matters <lb/>
            distinguished carefully as to its principle from example, a collateral sort of <lb/>
            argument. In the words of Sir W. Hamilton, "Enthymeme is distin­ <lb/>
            guished from pure syllogism as a reasoning of peculiar matter from signs <lb/>
            and likelihoods;" whether therefore a premise of it be suppressed or <lb/>
            not, an argument agreeing with this description is an Enthymeme. The <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδεικτικὴ άναγκαια ἣ ἔνδοξος</foreign>, applied to <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃ον</foreign> as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτασις</foreign>, <lb/>
            do not relate to the modal character of the proposition in itself, but to its <lb/>
            logical validity when the other premise is added, without which addition <lb/>
            expressed or understood, there is no Enthymeme at all. Lastly, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σημει̃ον</foreign> <lb/>
            is called a demonstrative proposition, because it professes to enunciate <lb/>
            what is absolutely true, i. e. what Aristotle calls necessary, (Rhet. i. c. 2,) <lb/>
            the latter word being used in two senses, 1st, of a premise which states <unclear>a</unclear> <lb/>
            fact, 2nd, of a consequence which is logically unassailable. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              wise men are worthy, for Pittacus is a worthy <lb/>
              man, is through the last figure, let A be worthy, <lb/>
              B wise men, C Pittacus. It is true then A and <lb/>
              B are predicated of C, except that they do not as­ <lb/>
              sert the one because they know it, but the other <lb/>
              they assume.† But that a woman is pregnant <lb/>
              because she is pale, would be through the middle figure, for <lb/>
              since paleness is a consequence of pregnancy, and also attends <lb/>
              this woman, they fancy it proved that she is pregnant. Let <lb/>

              3. If one prop. <lb/>
              be enunciated, <lb/>
              there is only a <lb/>
              sign. <lb/>
              A be paleness, to be pregnant B, a woman C.t <lb/>
              If then one proposition should be enunciated, <lb/>
              there is only a sign, but if the other also be <lb/>
              assumed, there is a syllogism, as for instance that <lb/>
              Pittacus is liberal, for the ambitious are liberal, and Pittacus <lb/>
              is ambitious, or again, that the wise are good, for Pittacus is <lb/>
              good and also wise. Thus therefore syllogisms are produced, <lb/>
              4. Syllogism, if <lb/>
              it be true, is in­ <lb/>
              controvertible <lb/>
              in the 1st fig., <lb/>
              but not so in <lb/>
              the last or 2nd <lb/>
              fig. <lb/>
              except indeed that the one in the first figure is in­ <lb/>
              controvertible if it be true, (for it is universal,) <lb/>
              but that through the last is controvertible though <lb/>
              the conclusion should be true, because the syllo­ <lb/>
              gism is not universal nor to the purpose, for if <lb/>
              Pittacus is worthy, it is not necessary that on this <lb/>
              account other wise men also should be worthy. But that <lb/>
              which is by the middle figure is always and altogether con­ <lb/>

            the soul,4 since perhaps one who has learned music <lb/>
            has changed his soul in some respect, but this <lb/>
            passion is not of those which are natural to us, <lb/>

            mal may be <lb/>
            known. <lb/>
            to conjecture from nature. For if a peculiar pas­ <lb/>
            sion is inherent in a certain individual genus, as <lb/>
            fortitude in lions, it is necessary also that there <lb/>
            should be a certain sign, for it is supposed that <lb/>
            they (the body and soul) sympathize with each <lb/>
            other, and let this be the having great extremi­ <lb/>
            ties, which also is contingent to other, not whole, <lb/>
            general For the sign is thus peculiar, because <lb/>
            the passion is a peculiarity of the whole genus, <lb/>
            and is not the peculiarity of it alone,2 as we are <lb/>
            accustomed to say. The same (sign) then will also <lb/>
            be inherent in another genus, and man will be brave, and some <lb/>
            other animal, it will then possess that sign,3 for there was <lb/>
            one (sign) of one (passion). If then these things are so, and <lb/>
            we can collect such signs in those animals, which have one <lb/>
            peculiar passion alone, but each (passion) has its (own) sign, <lb/>
            since it is necessary that it should have one, we may be able <lb/>
            to conjecture the nature from the bodily frame. But if the <lb/>
            whole genus have two peculiarities, as a lion has fortitude and <lb/>
            liberality, how shall we know which of those signs that are <lb/>
            peculiarly consequent is the sign, if either (passion) ? Shall <lb/>

            thing else, but not wholly,4 and in what each is not inherent <note type="footnote"> 1 Other species, he means, also have this sign, but it is not possessed <lb/>

            however that the whole case falls, if the identification of the peculiar <lb/>
            mark with the passion is not fully proved. His further question, of how <lb/>
            we are to apportion each passion to its own mark, when many are pre­ <lb/>
            sent in one genus, seems unanswerable:—yet we have presumed even to <lb/>
            measure the prominence which marks each passion, (if it does mark it,) <lb/>
            and to set one over against the other, e. g. benevolence against destruct­ <lb/>

            is produced <lb/>
            from previous <lb/>

          <p>ALL doctrine, and all intellectual discipline,1 arise <lb/>
            from pre-existent knowledge. Now this is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, if we survey them all, for both mathematical <lb/>
            sciences are obtained in this manner, and also <lb/>
            each of the other arts. It is the same also with <lb/>
            arguments, as well those which result through <lb/>
            syllogisms, as those which are formed through <lb/>
            induction, for both teach through things pre­ <lb/>

            ever to possess previous knowledge in a twofold <lb/>
            respect; for with some things we must pre-sup­ <lb/>
            pose that they are, but with others we must understand what <lb/>

            being called " doctrine ” when applied to teaching, and " discipline " as <lb/>

            which reasons scientifically, deriving the principles of its reasoning from <lb/>

            known, as for instance, (we must pre-assume,) that of every <lb/>
            thing it is true to affirm or deny that it is, but of a triangle, <lb/>
            that it signifies so and so, and of the monad (we must know) <lb/>
            both, viz. what it signifies and that it is, for each of these is <lb/>
            not manifest to us in a similar manner.1 It is possible how <lb/>
            ever to know from knowing some things previously,2 and re­ <lb/>
            ceiving the knowledge of others at the same time, as of things <lb/>
            which are contained under universals, and of which a man <lb/>
            possesses knowledge.3 For he knew before that every tri­ <lb/>
            angle has angles equal to two right angles, but that this which <lb/>
            is in a semi-circle is a triangle, he knew by induction at the <lb/>
            same time. For of some things knowledge is acquired after <lb/>
            this manner, nor is the extreme known through the middle, <lb/>
            as such things as are singulars, and are not predicated of any <lb/>
            subject. Perhaps however we must confess that we possess <lb/>
            knowledge after a certain manner before induction or the as­ <lb/>
            sumption of a syllogism, but in another manner not.4 For <lb/>
            what a man is ignorant about its existence at all, how could <lb/>
            he know at all that it has two right angles ? But <lb/>
            it is evident that he thus knows because he knows <lb/>
            the universal, but singly he does not know it. <lb/>
            Still if this be not admitted, the doubt which is <lb/>
            mentioned in the Meno* will occur, either he will <lb/>
            learn nothing, or those things which he knows,5 <lb/>

            he did not think existed, as therefore not even; and they <lb/>
            solve the ambiguity, not by saying that he knew every duad <lb/>
            to be even, but that he was ignorant as to what they know is <lb/>
            a duad. Nevertheless they know that of which they possess <lb/>
            and have received the demonstration, but they have received <lb/>
            it not of every thing which they know to be a triangle or a <lb/>
            number, but of every number and triangle singly, for no pro­ <lb/>

            know, or the rectilinear figure which you know, but univers­ <lb/>

            learns, in a certain respect knowing and in a certain respect <lb/>
            being ignorant,1 for it is absurd, not that he should in some <lb/>

            he does when he learns it, and in the same manner.</p>

          <p>WE think that we know each thing singly, (and <lb/>

            and those who do know, fancy, the former, that <lb/>
            they in this manner possess knowledge, but those <lb/>

            therefore there is any other mode of knowing we shall tell <lb/>
            hereafter, but we say also that we obtain knowledge through <lb/>

            If then to know is what we have laid down, it is <lb/>

            this kind, and in denominating these, we are accustomed <lb/>
            generally to use this name. But of thesis, that which re­ <lb/>
            ceives either part of contradiction, as for instance, I mean <lb/>
            that a certain thing is, or that it is not, is hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis, but that which is without this, is definition. <lb/>
            For definition is a thesis, since the arithmetician <lb/>
            6. Of hypothe­ <lb/>
            sis. <lb/>
            lays down unity to be that which is indivisible, according to <lb/>
            quantity, yet it is not hypothesis, since what unity is, and <lb/>
            that unity is, are not the same thing.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, since we must believe in and know a thing <lb/>
            from possessing such a syllogism as we call demonstration, and <lb/>
            this is, because these are so, of which syllogism consists-it <lb/>
            is necessary not only to have a previous knowledge of the <lb/>
            first, or all, or some things, but that they should be more known, <lb/>
            for that on account of which any thing exists, always exists itself <lb/>
            in a greater degree ; for example, that on account of which we <lb/>
            love is itself more beloved. Hence if we know and believe <lb/>
            on account of things first, we also know and believe those <lb/>
            first things in a greater degree, because through them (we <lb/>
            know and believe) things posterior. A man however cannot <lb/>
            believe more than what he knows, those things which he does <lb/>
            not know, nor with respect to which he is better disposed <note type="footnote"> I Axioms are common, according to Aristotle, to several classes, but <lb/>
            in the case of a single science need only be assumed to an extent com­ <lb/>
            mensurate with the object-matter of that science. As Mansel well ob­ <lb/>
            serves, the places in which the axioms are mentioned in connexion with <lb/>
            demonstration, have never been satisfactorily explained on the usual <lb/>
            scholastic interpretation. I entirely agree with him, that the supposition <lb/>
            that axioms are virtually, but not actually, employed in demonstration, <lb/>
            and the distinction drawn between immediate propositions and axioms, <lb/>
            are equally unfounded; in fact it subverts Aristotle's own expression. <lb/>

            principles, from which a syllogism of contra-deception may <lb/>

              properly things which result from these, but by hypothesis, <lb/>
              if these exist. Others however assent with re­ <lb/>

              only through demonstration, but that nothing pre­ <lb/>

              for demonstration may be effected in a circle, and (things be <lb/>

              neither is all science demonstrative, but that the science of <lb/>
              things immediate is indemonstrable. And this is evidently <lb/>
              necessary, for if it is requisite to know things prior, and from <lb/>
              which demonstration subsists, but some time or other there is <lb/>
              a stand made at things immediate, these must of necessity be <lb/>

              Hilaire observes, “les propositions immediates," i. e. axioms. The fol­ <lb/>
              lowing is the interpretation by Ammonius of this place. The principle <lb/>
              of science is intellect, not our intellect, but that which is divine and <lb/>

              tens are the boundaries of hundreds, and hundreds of thousands, but the <lb/>
              monad is the common boundary of all numbers; thus also with respect to <lb/>
              things, we may say that the boundaries of sensibles are the celestial <lb/>

              they say nothing else than this is if it is, and in this manner <lb/>
              we may easily demonstrate all things. Nevertheless it is evi­ <lb/>
              dent that this occurs, when three terms are laid down, for to <lb/>
              assert that demonstration recurs through many or through <lb/>

              difference. For when A existing, B necessarily <lb/>
              is, and from this last C, if A exists C will exist, <lb/>
              if then, when A is, it is necessary that B should be, but this <lb/>
              existing, A exists, (for this were to demonstrate in a circle,) <lb/>
              let A be laid down in the place of C. To say therefore that <lb/>
              because B is A is, is equivalent to saying that C is, and this <lb/>
              is to say that A existing C is, but C is the same as A, so that <lb/>
              it happens that they who assert there is demonstration in a <lb/>
              circle, say nothing else than that A is because A is, and thus <lb/>
              we may easily demonstrate all things. Neither however is <lb/>
              this possible, except in those things which follow each other <lb/>

              by one thing, neither one term, nor one thesis being laid <lb/>

            two right angles in a triangle, so far as it is a triangle, for a <lb/>
            triangle is per se equal to two right angles. But universal is <lb/>

            that it has two right angles, but not of any casual figure, nor <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WE ought not to be ignorant that frequently error arises, and <lb/>
            that what is demonstrated is not primarily universal, in so <lb/>
            far as the primarily universal appears to be demonstrated <lb/>
            1. Sources of <lb/>

            demonstration. <lb/>
            Example. <lb/>
            Now we are deceived by this mistake, when <lb/>
            either nothing higher can be assumed, except <lb/>
            the singular or singulars, or when something <lb/>
            else can be assumed, but it wants a name in <lb/>
            things differing in species, or when it happens to be as a <lb/>
            whole in a part, of which the demonstration is made, for <lb/>
            demonstration will happen to particulars, and will be of every <lb/>
            individual, yet nevertheless it will not be the demonstration <lb/>
            of this first universal. Still I say the demonstration of this <lb/>
            first, so far as it is this, when it is of the first universal. If <lb/>
            then any one should show that right lines do not meet, it may <lb/>
            appear to be ( a proper) demonstration of this, because it is in <lb/>
            all right lines, yet this is not so, since this does not arise from <lb/>
            the lines being thus equal, but so far as they are in some way <lb/>
            or other equal. Also if a triangle should be no other than <lb/>
            isosceles, so far as isosceles it may appear to be inherent: <note type="footnote"> I All universals are gained by abstraction, i. e. by separating the phe­ <lb/>
            nomena in which a certain number of individuals resemble each other, <lb/>

            the proper subject itself: 3rd, when the particular is demonstrated be­ <lb/>
            cause the universal has no name: 4th, when we conclude that an universal <lb/>
            demonstration of a thing has been given because the demonstration is of <lb/>
            every individual. or Waitz, p. 387, et seq. </note> <pb n="257"/>

            alternate proportion also, so far as regards numbers and lines <lb/>
            and solids and times (as was once shown separately) it is possi­ <lb/>
            ble at least to be demonstrated of all by one demonstration, but <lb/>
            inasmuch as all these, numbers, length, time, are not one deno­ <lb/>
            minated thing, and differ from each other in species, they were <lb/>
            assumed separately. But now the demonstration is universal, <lb/>
            for it is not in so far as they are lines or numbers, that it is <lb/>
            inherent, but in so far as this thing which they suppose to be <lb/>
            universally inherent. For this reason neither if one should <lb/>
            demonstrate each several triangle by one or another demon­ <lb/>
            stration, that each has two right angles, equilateral, the <lb/>
            scalene, and the isosceles separately, would he yet know that <lb/>
            the triangle (itself) has angles equal to two right, except in a <lb/>
            sophistical manner,* nor triangle universally, <lb/>
            though there should be no other triangle besides <lb/>
            * Vide supra. <lb/>
            these. For he does not know it so far as it is triangle, nor <lb/>
            does he know every triangle, except according to number, <lb/>
            but not every, according to species, even if there be no one <lb/>
            that he does not know.1 When then does he not know uni­ <lb/>
            versally, and when knows he simply? It is clear that if <lb/>
            there is the same essence of a triangle, and of an equilateral <lb/>
            either of each or of all, he knows, †2 but if there is <lb/>
            not the same, but different, and it is inherent so <lb/>
            far as it is triangle, he does not know. 3 Whether <lb/>

            however is it inherent, so far as it is triangle, or so far as it <lb/>
            is isosceles ? And when, according to this, is it primary ? <lb/>
            And of what is the demonstration universally ? It is evident <lb/>
            that it then is, when, other things being taken away, it is in­ <lb/>
            herent in the primary, thus two right angles will be inherent <lb/>
            in a brazen isosceles triangle, when the being brazen and the <lb/>
            being isosceles are taken away, but not if the figure or bound­ <lb/>

          <p>IF then demonstrative science is from necessary <lb/>

            others are they in the very nature of which the subjects are <lb/>
            inherent, of which they are so predicated, that one of opposites <lb/>

            according to accident, but accidents are not ne­ <lb/>
            cessary.</p>
          <p>Either therefore we must say this, or that demonstration is a <lb/>

            wherefore the † syllogism must be from necessary <lb/>

            2. Proof of this. <lb/>
            this is now (the essence) of demonstration. An <lb/>
            indication also that demonstration is from things <lb/>
            necessary is, that we thus object to those who think they de­ <lb/>

            true, as the Sophists (assume) that to know is to possess <lb/>
            knowledge.2 For it is not the probable or improbable, which <note type="footnote"> 1 If things per se or essential are necessary, and the principles of de­ <lb/>

            per se. As Taylor observes, by conversion of the major, Aristotle's argu­ <lb/>
            ment here may become a syllogism in Barbara. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was thus argued by Protagoras ; Whoever knows any thing, pos­ </note> <pb n="259"/>

            also from these; for if he who cannot assign a <lb/>

            it is demonstrated not of necessity, (in this case) he does not <lb/>
            know the cause. For this is not on account of the medium, <lb/>
            for the latter may not exist, yet the conclusion is necessary. <lb/>
            Besides, if some one does not know, though he now <lb/>
            possesses a reason, and is safe, the thing also be- <lb/>
            3. <lb/>
            ing preserved, he not having forgotten it, neither did he be <lb/>
            fore know it. But the medium may perish if it is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary, so that he, being safe, will have a reason, § <lb/>
            the thing being preserved, and yet not know it, <lb/>
            wherefore neither did he know it before.1 But <lb/>

            if the medium is not destroyed, yet may possibly perish, that <lb/>
            which happens will be possible and contingent, it is impossi­ <lb/>
            ble however that one so circumstanced should know. 2</p>
          <p>When therefore the conclusion is from neces­ <lb/>
            sity, there is nothing to prevent the medium <lb/>
            through which the demonstration was made from <lb/>
            being not necessary, since it is possible to syllogize <lb/>
            the necessary even from things not necessary, just <lb/>
            as we may the true from things not true. Still <lb/>
            3. If the con­ <lb/>
            clusion be ne­ <lb/>
            cessary,the pre­ <lb/>

            be so, but when <lb/>
            the latter are so <lb/>
            the conclusion <lb/>
            must be neces­ <lb/>
            sary. <lb/>
            when the medium is from necessity the conclusion is also from <lb/>
            necessity, as the true (results) from the true always: for let <lb/>
            A be of necessity predicated of B, and this of C, then it is <note type="footnote"> sesses science: he who possesses science knows what science is : there­ <lb/>

            to confess that to be possible, viz. that the medium may perish, which is <lb/>
            impossible, and hence that we may be ignorant of what we know. By <lb/>

          <p>I CALL those principles in each genus, the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of which it is impossible to demonstrate. <lb/>
            What then first things,† and such as result from <lb/>
            these signify, is assumed, but as to principles, we <lb/>
            must assume that they are, but demonstrate the <lb/>
            rest, as what unity is, or what the straight and a triangle are ; <lb/>
            it is necessary however to assume that unity and magnitude <lb/>
            exist, but to demonstrate the other things.1</p>
          <p>2. What are <lb/>
            peculiartoeach <lb/>
            science, and <lb/>
            what common.</p>
          <p>Of those which are employed in demonstrative <lb/>
            sciences, some are peculiar to each science, but <lb/>
            others are common, and common according to <lb/>
            analogy, since each is useful, so far as it is in the <lb/>
            genus under science. The peculiar indeed are such as, that <lb/>
            a line is a thing of this kind, and that the straight is, but the <lb/>
            common are, as that if equals be taken from equals the re­ <lb/>
            mainders are equal. Now each of these is sufficient, so far <lb/>
            as it is in the genus, for (a geometrician) will effect the same, <lb/>
            though he should not assume of all, but in magnitudes alone, <lb/>
            and the arithmetician in respect of numbers2 (alone).</p>

          <p>Proper principles, again, are those which are <lb/>
            assumed to be, and about which science considers <lb/>
            whatever are inherent per se, as arithmetic assumes unities, <lb/>
            and geometry points and lines, for they assume that these are, <lb/>
            t They assume <lb/>
            that they are, <lb/>
            and what they <lb/>
            are. <lb/>
            and that they are this particular thing.t But the <lb/>
            essential properties of these, what each signifies, <lb/>
            they assume, as arithmetic, what the odd is, or <lb/>
            the even, or a square, or a cube; and geometry, <note type="footnote"> 1 The above clears Aristotle from the charge unjustly brought against <lb/>
            him by Mill, since the former states here the necessity of assuming the <lb/>
            existence of the subject, as clearly as the latter asserts it. (Vide Mill's <lb/>
            Logic, vol. i.) The principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ὦν</foreign>) from which Aristotle demonstrates <lb/>
            are axioms of which he gives a specimen below: " If equals, &amp;c." <lb/>

            but not always to internal. Whatever things then, being de. <lb/>
            monstrable, a man assumes without demonstration, these, if <lb/>
            he assumes what appear probable to the learner, he supposes, <lb/>
            and this is not an hypothesis simply, but with reference to the <lb/>
            learner alone; but if, there being no inherent opinion, or when <lb/>
            a contrary is inherent, the demonstrator assumes, he requires <lb/>
            the same thing to be granted to him. And in this hypothesis <lb/>
            and postulate differ, for postulate is any thing sub-contrary to <lb/>
            the opinion of the learner, which though demonstrable a man <lb/>
            assumes, and uses without demonstration.</p>

            tion is not hy­ <lb/>

          <p>Definitions then are not hypotheses, (for they <lb/>
            are not asserted to be or not to be,) but hypothe­ <lb/>
            ses are in propositions. Now it is only necessary <lb/>
            that definitions should be understood, but this is not hypothe­ <lb/>
            sis, except some one should say that the verb to hear is hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis. But they are hypotheses, from the existence of which, <lb/>
            in that they are, the conclusion is produced. Neither does <lb/>
            the geometrician suppose falsities, as some say, who assert, <lb/>
            that it is not right to use a false (principle), but that the <lb/>
            geometrician does so, when he calls a line a foot long when <lb/>
            it is not so, or the line which he describes a straight line when <lb/>
            it is not straight. The geometrician indeed concludes nothing <lb/>
            from the lines being so and so, as he has said, but concludes <lb/>
            those, which are manifested through these (symbols). More­ <lb/>
            over postulate and every hypothesis are either as a whole or <lb/>
            as in a part, but definitions are neither of these.1 <note type="footnote"> fitably compare Locke's Essay, b. iv. 5, 5, and 6, 2; also Sanderson. <lb/>

            known. The words in the text are only enunciative of oral as con­ <lb/>

            the internal thought" (p. 4, Intro. Scheme Rhet.). It appears to be, <lb/>
            after all, " splitting a straw;" for such an opinion is not only " absurd," <lb/>

            highly commended by St. Augustine, is not free from much error, <lb/>
            arising from Plato's opinion that the ideas in man's soul are inherently <lb/>
            good. The remark which Aristotle makes in this place, seems chiefly, <lb/>
            as Taylor thinks, to prevent the misconception of Plato's theory, by <lb/>
            those who imagined his ideas to be corporeally separate from matter, <lb/>
            and not incorporeal forms residing in a divine intellect; but the real <lb/>
            case is, that Aristotle elsewhere impugns the doctrine of the idea as not <lb/>
            practical. Vide Ethics, lib. i. c. 6, Browne's note, Bohn's edition; also <lb/>
            Metaphysics, lib. xii. De Anima; Brewer's Ethics; Ritter, vol. ii. The <lb/>
            province of the Platonic dialectic was to investigate the true nature of that <lb/>
            connexion, which existed between each thing and the archetypal form or <lb/>
            idea which made it what it was, and to awaken the soul to a full remem­ <lb/>
            brance of what she had known prior to her being imprisoned in the body. <lb/>
            Hence, dialectic, with Plato, is the science of the immutable, and takes <lb/>
            cognizance of the universal principle; in fact, is an object identical with <lb/>
            the Metaphysics of Aristotle, whereas the dialectic of the latter partook <lb/>
            of the essentially practical nature of his mind, and is merely " the art of <lb/>
            disputing by question and answer." Cf. Gorgias, Theætetus, Meno, and <lb/>

            principles as geometry, as optics, and in like man­ <lb/>

            discussed from geometrical principles and conclu­ <lb/>

            be carried on by the geometrician so far as he is <lb/>
            such; likewise with other sciences. Neither is <lb/>

            with every question, nor is every question about <lb/>

            do well. Again, it is clear that neither does he confute the <lb/>
            geometrician except by accident, so that there cannot be a <lb/>
            discussion of geometry by those who are ignorant of geometry, <lb/>

              * Example (I.) <lb/>
              of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄ</foreign>rt. <lb/>
              sary then that A should be present with C, so <lb/>
              that it is demonstrated that the planets are near.. <lb/>
              This syllogism then is not of the " why," but oi <lb/>
              the "that" (a thing is), for the planets are not near because <lb/>
              they do not twinkle, but they do not twinkle because they are <lb/>
              near. It happens indeed that the one may be proved through <lb/>
              the other, and the demonstration will be of the " why," as let <lb/>
              C be the planets, B to be near, A not to twinkle, B then is <lb/>
              t Example (2.) <lb/>

              present with C, so that A not to twinkle will <lb/>
              be with C.t It is also a syllogism of the " why," <lb/>
              for the first cause was assumed. Again, as they <lb/>
              show the moon to be spherical through increments (of light), <lb/>
              for if what is thus increased be spherical, and the moon is in­ <lb/>
              creased, it is evident that the moon is spherical, thus then a <lb/>
              t i. e. the form­ <lb/>
              er middle be­ <lb/>
              comes the ma­ <lb/>
              jor, and the <lb/>
              former major <lb/>
              becomes the <lb/>
              middle. <lb/>
              § Example (3.) <lb/>
              2. Where the <lb/>
              media do not <lb/>
              reciprocate the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄτι</foreign> is demon­ <lb/>
              strated, also <lb/>
              where the mid­ <lb/>
              dle is external­ <lb/>
              ly placed. <lb/>
              syllogism of the "that" is produced, but if the <lb/>
              middle is placed contrarily,‡ there is a syllogism <lb/>
              of the " why," for it is not spherical on account of <lb/>
              the increments, but from being spherical she <lb/>
              receives such increments: let the moon be C, <lb/>
              spherical B, increase A.§ Where again the media <lb/>
              do not reciprocate,1 and what is not the cause is <lb/>
              more known, the "that" is indeed demonstrated, <lb/>
              but not the " why ;" further, where the middle is <lb/>
              placed externally,2 for in these the demonstration <lb/>
              is of the " that," and not of the "why," as the <lb/>
              cause is not assigned. For example, why does <lb/>
              not a wall breathe ? because it is not an animal, for if this <lb/>
              was the cause of its not breathing, it would be necessary that <lb/>
              animal should be the cause of its breathing, since if negation <lb/>
              is the cause of a thing not being, affirmation is the cause of its <lb/>
              being, thus if the disproportion of hot and cold is the cause <lb/>
              of not being well, the proportion of these is the cause of be­ <lb/>
              ing well. Likewise if affirmation is the cause of being, nega­ <lb/>
              tion is the cause of not being, but in things which have been <lb/>
              thus explained, what has been stated does not occur, for not <note type="footnote"> 1 The cause is the middle, in the demonstration of the " why" and <lb/>

              every animal respires.1 A syllogism of such a cause is never­ <lb/>
              theless produced in the middle figure, for example, let A be <lb/>
              animal, B to respire, C a wall, A then is present with every <lb/>
              B, (for whatever respires is animal,) but with no C, so that <lb/>
              neither is B present with any C, wherefore a wall does not <lb/>
              respire.* Such causes however resemble things <lb/>
              spoken hyperbolically,2 and this is, when we turn <lb/>
              * Example (4.) <lb/>
              aside to speak of the middle, which is more widely extended, <lb/>
              as for instance, that saying of Anacharsis, that amongst the <lb/>
              Scythians there are no pipers, since neither are there any <lb/>
              vines.3</p>
          <p>As to the same science then, and the position <lb/>
            of the media, these are the differences between a <lb/>
            syllogism of, that a thing is, and of why it is, but <lb/>
            in another respect the why differs from the that, <lb/>
            because each is beheld in a different science. Now <lb/>
            such are those things which so subsist with re­ <lb/>
            ference to each other, as that the one is under the <lb/>

            each belonging <lb/>
            to a different <lb/>

            other, such as optics with reference to geometry, mechanics <lb/>
            to the measurement of solids, harmonics to arithmetic, and <lb/>
            celestial phenomena to astronomy. Some of these sciences <lb/>
            are almost synonymous, as astronomy is both the mathematical <lb/>

              is a deception produced through syllogism, and <lb/>
              this happens in two ways, in those things which <lb/>
              are primarily present, or not present; for it hap- <lb/>
              1. Definition of <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄννοταή κατὰ <lb/>
              διάθεσιν</foreign>,and its <lb/>
              kinds. <lb/>
              pens either when one simply apprehends the being present, <lb/>
              or not being present, or when he obtains this opinion through <lb/>
              syllogism: of simple opinion, then, the deception is simple, but <lb/>
              of that which is through syllogism, it is manifold. For let A <lb/>
              not be present with any B individually, if then A is concluded <lb/>
              to be present with B, assuming C as the middle, a person will <lb/>
              be deceived through syllogism. Hence it is possible that both <lb/>
              propositions may be false, but it is also possible that only one <lb/>
              may be so, for if neither A is present with any C, nor C with <lb/>
              any B, but each proposition is taken contrary, both will be <lb/>
              false. But it may be that C so subsists with reference to A <lb/>
              and B, as neither to be under A nor universally (present) with <lb/>
              B, for it is impossible that B should be in a certain whole, <lb/>
              since it was said that A is not primarily present <lb/>
              with it; but A need not be universally present <lb/>
              with all beings, so that both propositions are false. <lb/>
              2. Examples of <lb/>
              affirmative de­ <lb/>
              ception. <lb/>
              Nevertheless, we may assume one proposition as true, not <lb/>
              either of them casually, but the proposition A C, for the pro­ <lb/>
              position C B will be always false, because B is in none; but <lb/>
              A C may be (true), for instance, if A is present individually, <lb/>
              both with C and B, for when the same thing is primarily pre­ <lb/>
              dicated of many things, neither will be predicated of neither ; <lb/>
              it makes no difference however if it (A) be not individually <lb/>
              present with it (C).</p>
          <p>The deception then of being present, is by these <lb/>
            and in this way only, (for there was not a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism of being present in another figure,*) but the <lb/>
            deception of not being present with, is in the first <lb/>
            and middle figure. t Let us first then declare in <lb/>
            how many ways it occurs in the first, and under <lb/>
            what propositional circumstances. It may then <lb/>
            happen when both propositions are false, e. g. if <lb/>
            A is present individually with C and B, for if A <lb/>

            stanced in the <lb/>
            first and middle <lb/>
            figures. <lb/>

            should be assumed present with no C, but C with every B, <lb/>
            the propositions will be false. But (deception) is possible, <lb/>
            when one proposition is false, and either of them casually; <lb/>
            for it is possible that A C may be true, but C B false; A C <lb/>
            true, because A is not present with all beings, but C B false. <pb n="282"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note><lb/>
            because it is impossible that C should be with B, with <lb/>

            at the same time, if both are true, the conclusion <lb/>
            also will be true.† But it is also possible that C <lb/>
            B may be true, when the other proposition is <lb/>
            false, as if B is in C and in A, for one must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily be under the other,§ so that if A should <lb/>
            be assumed present with no C, the proposition <lb/>
            will be false. || It is clear then, that when one <lb/>
            proposition is false, and also when both are, the <lb/>
            syllogism will be false.¶</p>
          <p>In the middle figure, however, it is not possible <lb/>
            that both propositions should be wholly false, for <lb/>
            when A is present with every B, it will be impossible to assume <lb/>

            to be a syllogism. ‡ If then, when they are thus <lb/>
            assumed, they are false, it is clear that, when taken contrarily, <lb/>
            they will subsist vice versa, but this is impossible.1 Still <lb/>
            there is nothing to prevent each being partly false, as if C is <lb/>
            with A, and with a certain B; for if it should be assumed <lb/>
            present with every A, but with no B, both propositions in­ <lb/>
            deed would be false, yet not wholly, but partially. The same <lb/>

            species of A. <lb/>
            will occur when the negative is placed vice versa. § <lb/>
            But it is possible that one proposition, and either <lb/>
            of. them, may be false, for what is present with <lb/>
            every A, will be also with B,ll if then C is as­ <lb/>

            be present with every A; for if with A, it would also be with <lb/>
            B, but it was not present; if then C should be assumed pre­ <lb/>

            B will be true, but the other false.* The same <lb/>
            will happen if the negative is transposed, † for <lb/>
            what is in no A, will neither be in any B ; if then <lb/>
            C is assumed not present with the whole of A, <lb/>

            the major. <lb/>
            but present with the whole of B, the proposition A C will be <lb/>
            true, but the other false.‡ Again, also, it is false <lb/>
            to assume that what is present with every B, is <lb/>
            t Wholly false. <lb/>
            with no A; for it is necessary, if it is with every B, that it <lb/>
            should be also with a certain A; if then C is assumed pre­ <lb/>
            sent with every B, but with no A, the proposition <lb/>
            C B will be indeed true, but C A false. § Hence, <lb/>
            it is evident that when both propositions are false, <lb/>
            f Either wholly <lb/>
            or partially. <lb/>

            both propositions cannot be false, but only the <lb/>

            that through which there is a syllogism of contra­ <lb/>

            I. Case of both <lb/>
            propositions <lb/>
            being false. <lb/>
            as that which is through an appropriate medium, <lb/>
            but if the syllogism should not be through an ap­ <lb/>
            propriate medium,1 when indeed the middle is <lb/>
            under A, but is present with no B, it is necessary that both <lb/>
            propositions should be false. For the propositions must be <lb/>
            assumed contrary to the way in which they subsist, if a syl­ <lb/>
            logism is to be formed,2 for when they are thus assumed both <lb/>
            are false, as if A is with the whole of D, but D present with <lb/>
            no B, for when these are converted, there will be a syllogism, <lb/>
            and both propositions will be false. When however the me­ <lb/>
            dium is not under A, for instance, D, A D will be true, but <lb/>
            * Vide An. <lb/>
            Prior, b. i. ch. <lb/>

            cannot be <lb/>
            wholly false in <lb/>
            the middle <lb/>
            figure, when <lb/>
            deception is <lb/>

            D B false, for A D is true, because D was not in <lb/>
            A, but D B false, because if it were true the con­ <lb/>
            clusion also would be true,* but it was false.</p>
          <p>Through the middle figure however, when de­ <lb/>
            ception is produced, it is impossible that both <lb/>
            propositions should be wholly false, (for when B <lb/>
            is under A, it is possible for nothing to be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with the whole of the one, but with nothing <lb/>
            of the other, as has been observed before, †) but <lb/>
            one proposition may be false whichever may hap­ <lb/>
            pen. For if C is with A and with B, if it be assumed pre­ <lb/>
            sent with A, but not present with B, the proposition A C will <lb/>
            be true, but the other false; again, if C be assumed present <lb/>
            with B, but with no A, the proposition C B will be true, but <lb/>
            the other false.</p>

            also, if the middle be taken from another class, as was ob­ <lb/>

            of necessity remain, but A D be converted, and the decep­ <lb/>
            tion is the same as the former. But when it is not through <lb/>
            an appropriate medium, if D be under A, this. <lb/>
            indeed will be true, but the other † false, for A <lb/>
            may possibly be present with many things which <lb/>

            this t will evidently be always false, (for it is as­ <lb/>
            sumed affirmative for D B may be as well true as <lb/>

            false, since nothing prevents A being present with no D, but <lb/>
            D with every B, as animal with (no) science, but science with <lb/>
            (all) music. Again, (nothing prevents) A from being present <lb/>
            with no D, and D with no B: it is clear then that when the <lb/>
            medium is not under A, both propositions, and either of them, <lb/>
            as it may happen, may be false.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>EVERY syllogism consists of three terms, and one indeed is <lb/>
            able to demonstrate that A is with C from its being present <lb/>
            with B, and this last with C, but the other is negative, having <lb/>
            one proposition (to the effect) that one certain thing is in <lb/>
            another, but the other proposition (to the effect) that it is not <lb/>
            with it. Now it is clear, that the same are principles, and <lb/>
            what are called hypotheses, since it is necessary to demon­ <lb/>
            strate by thus assuming these, 1 e. g. that A is present with C <lb/>
            through B, and again, that A is with B through another me- <lb/>
            1. By those <lb/>
            who syllogize <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ δόξαν</foreign> it is <lb/>
            to be consider­ <lb/>
            dium, and that B is with C in like manner. By <lb/>
            those then who syllogize according to opinion only, <lb/>
            and dialectically, this alone it is clear must be <note type="footnote"> is the separation of one portion of the attributes co-existing in any object <lb/>
            from the rest; hence, in this sense, Aristotle applies the expression here, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ έξ άφαιρέσεως</foreign>, to geometrical magnitudes, because the geometer con. <lb/>
            siders only the properties of the figure, separating them from those of the <lb/>
            material in which it is found. (Cf. An. Post. i. ch. 5.) " Induction," <lb/>
            says Taylor, " is so far subservient to the acquisitions of science, as it <lb/>
            evocates into energy in the soul, those universals from which demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion consists. For the universal, which is the proper object of science, <lb/>
            is not derived from particulars, since these are infinite, and every induc­ <lb/>
            tion of them must be limited to a finite number. Hence the perception <lb/>
            of the all and the every is only excited, and not produced, by induction." <lb/>

            considered, viz. whether the syllogism is produced <lb/>
            from propositions as probable as possible, so that <lb/>
            if there is in reality a medium between A and B, <lb/>
            but it does not appear, he who syllogizes through <lb/>
            ed whether the <lb/>
            syllogisms <lb/>
            arise from pro­ <lb/>
            positions espe­ <lb/>
            cially probable. <lb/>
            this, will have syllogized dialectically. But as to truth, it be­ <lb/>
            hoves us to make our observations from things inherent:1 it <lb/>
            happens thus. Since there is that, which is itself predicated <lb/>
            of something else, not according to accident,. but <lb/>
            I mean by according to accident, as we say some­ <lb/>
            * Cf. ch. 6. <lb/>
            times, that that white thing is a man, not similarly saying, <lb/>
            that a man is a white thing, for man not being any thing else <lb/>
            is white, but it is a white thing, because it happens to a man <lb/>
            to be white:2 there are then some such things as are predi­ <lb/>
            cated per see Let C be a thing of this kind which is not it­ <lb/>
            self present with any thing else, but let B be pri­ <lb/>
            marily t present with this, without any thing else <lb/>
            t Immediately. <lb/>
            between. Again, also let E be present in like manner with <lb/>
            F, and this with B, is it then necessary that this should stop, <lb/>
            or is it possible to proceed to infinity? 3 Once more, if <lb/>
            nothing is predicated of A per se, but A is primarily present <lb/>
            with H, nothing prior intervening, and H with G, and this <lb/>
            with B, is it necessary also that this should stop, or can this <lb/>
            likewise go on to infinity?4 Now this so much <lb/>
            differs from the former, that the one is, whether <lb/>
            it is possible by beginning from a thing of that <lb/>
            kind,t which is present with nothing else, but <lb/>
            something else present with it, to proceed upward <lb/>
            to infinity; but the other is, beginning from that <lb/>
            2. An inquiry <lb/>
            whether a <lb/>
            stated series of <lb/>
            terms proceeds <lb/>
            to infinity. <lb/>
            t i. e. from a <lb/>
            last subject. <lb/>
            which is itself predicated of another, but nothing predicated <lb/>
            of it,§ whether it is possible to proceed to infinity <lb/>
            downward. Besides, when the extremes are finite, <lb/>
            is it possible that the media may be infinite ? I <lb/>
            § A supreme <lb/>
            attribute. <lb/>
            mean, for instance, if A is present with C, but the medium of <lb/>
            them is B, and of B and A there are other media, and of <lb/>
            these again others, whether it is possible or impossible for <lb/>
            these also to proceed to infinity ? To consider this however <note type="footnote"> I Whether the propositions are really immediate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I read this sentence with Buhle, Bekker, and Waits. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 So that a first predicate may not be found. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 So that a last subject may not be found. </note> <pb n="288"/>

            are no first <lb/>
            principles, for <lb/>
            these are inde­ <lb/>
            monstrable. Cf. <lb/>
            Metap. lib. i. <lb/>
            and ii. <lb/>
            3. The same as <lb/>
            to negatives. <lb/>
            is the same as to consider whether demonstra­ <lb/>
            tions proceed to infinity,* and whether there is <lb/>
            demonstration of every thing,t or whether there <lb/>
            is a termination (of the extremes) relatively to <lb/>
            each other.</p>
          <p>I say also the same in respect of negative syl­ <lb/>
            logisms and propositions, for instance, whether A <lb/>
            is primarily present with no B, or there will be a <lb/>
            certain medium with which it was not before present, as if G <lb/>
            (is a medium), which is present with every B; and again, <lb/>
            t So Waitz and <lb/>
            Bekker; but <lb/>
            Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle read <lb/>
            "not present." <lb/>
            4. The doubt <lb/>
            does not exist <lb/>
            in the case of <lb/>
            reciprocals. <lb/>
            with something else prior to this, as whether (the <lb/>
            medium is) H, which is present with every G; for <lb/>
            in these also, either those are infinite with which <lb/>
            first they are t present, or the progression stops. <lb/>
            The same thing however does not occur in <lb/>
            things which are convertible, since in those which <lb/>
            are mutually predicated of each other, there is <lb/>
            nothing of which first or last a thing is predi­ <lb/>
            cate; for in this respect all things subsist similarly with <lb/>
            respect to all, whether those are infinite, which are predi­ <lb/>
            § The predi­ <lb/>
            cates and sub­ <lb/>
            jects. <lb/>
            cate of the same, or whether both § subjects of <lb/>
            doubt are infinite, except that the conversion can­ <lb/>
            not be similarly made; but the one is as accident, <lb/>
            but the other as predication.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. whether there may be found a last subject, which is the bound­ <lb/>

            adapted to reciprocals, when one is per se predicated of the other, ano <lb/>
            the other from accident. Excluding the last, the inquiry is whether the <lb/>
            subjects and predicates which are so per se, are finite or infinite. A <lb/>

          <p>THAT media cannot be infinite, if the predica­ <lb/>

            example. <lb/>
            when A is predicated of F, the media are infinite, that is <lb/>
            B,* it evidently may be possible that from A in a <lb/>
            descending series, one thing may be predicated of <lb/>
            another to infinity, (for before we arrive at F, there <lb/>

            over, that the wood is great, and that the man walks, yet <lb/>
            there is a difference between speaking in this way and in <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle calls those arguments logical which are not derived from the <lb/>
            nature of a thing, but analytical are opposed to them, because they re­ <lb/>

            accurate demonstration, which depends upon the true principles of the <lb/>

            that. For when I say that that white thing is wood, then 1 <lb/>
            say that what happens to be white is wood, but what is white <lb/>
            is not, as it were, a subject to wood, since neither being white, <lb/>
            nor what is a certain white thing, became wood, so that it is not <lb/>

            the man is white, to whom it happens to be a musician, <lb/>
            but wood is the subject which became (white), not being any <lb/>

            That which is predicated is as white, but that of <lb/>

            cated of simply, and not according to accident, for thus demon­ <lb/>
            strations demonstrate. Therefore when one thing is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of one, it will be predicated either in respect of what a <lb/>
            thing is, or that it is a quality, or a quantity, or a relative, <lb/>
            or an agent, or a patient, or that it is some where, or at <lb/>
            some time.</p>

            define what the <lb/>
            subject is, or <lb/>
            are accidents.</p>
          <p>Moreover, those which signify substance, sig­ <lb/>
            nify that the thing of which they are predicated, <lb/>
            is that which it is, or something belonging to it, <lb/>
            but whatever do not signify substance, but are <lb/>
            predicated of another subject, which is neither the thing itself, <lb/>
            nor something belonging to it, are accidents, as white is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of man, since man is neither white, nor any thing <lb/>
            which belongs to white, but is perhaps animal, for man is <lb/>
            that which is a certain animal. Such as do not signify sub­ <lb/>
            stance it is necessary should be predicated of a certain sub­ <lb/>
            ject, and not be something white, which is white, not being <lb/>
            any thing else. For, farewell to ideas, for they are mere <lb/>
            § Cf. ch. 11. <lb/>

            predicated ? It has been shown that these will not be infinite, <lb/>
            neither in a descending nor in an ascending progression, as <lb/>
            for instance, man is a- biped, this an animal, this something <lb/>
            else ; neither can animal be predicated of man, this of Callias, <lb/>
            this of something else,. in respect to what a thing <lb/>
            is. For we may define the whole of this to be <lb/>
            substance, but we cannot penetrate infinites by <lb/>
            perception, † wherefore neither are there infinites <lb/>
            upwards or downwards, for we cannot define that <lb/>

            are incapable <lb/>

            mutually predicated of each other as genera, for genus would <lb/>
            be a part itself, neither will quality nor any of the other cate­ <lb/>
            gories be (mutually) predicated, except by accident, for all <lb/>
            these are accidents, and are predicated of sub­ <lb/>
            stances. But neither will there be infinites in <lb/>
            ascending series,t for of each thing, that is predi­ <lb/>
            cated, which signifies either a certain quality, or <lb/>
            a certain quantity, or something of this kind, or <lb/>
            those which are in the substance, but these are <lb/>
            finite, and the genera of the categories are finite, <lb/>

            and to the scalene triangle, the possession of an­ <lb/>
            gles equal to two right, is inherent according to <lb/>
            something common, † for it is inherent so far as <lb/>
            each is a certain figure,‡ and not so far as it is <lb/>

            versal and the particular, and having explained this, speak of <lb/>
            what is called direct demonstration, and that to the impossible.</p>
          <p>Perhaps then to some considering the matter <lb/>
            in this way, the particular may appear the better, <lb/>

            we know it per se, than when through something else, (as we <lb/>
            know Coriscus is a musician, when we know that Coriscus is <lb/>
            a musician rather than when we know that a man is a musi­ <lb/>
            cian, and likewise in other things,) but the universal demon­ <lb/>
            strates because a thing is something else, not because it is that <lb/>
            which it is, as that an isosceles triangle (has two right angles), <lb/>
            not because it is isosceles, but because it is a triangle,) but the <lb/>
            particular demonstrates because a thing is what it is, if then <lb/>
            the demonstration per se is preferable, and the particular is <lb/>
            such rather than the universal, particular demonstration would <lb/>
            be the better. Besides, if the universal is nothing else than <note type="footnote"> I It is the subject of the negative conclusion, of which D is denied. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A middle will never be assumed above the greater or less extreme, <lb/>

            which there is no deception than that through which there is, <lb/>
            but universal demonstration is of this sort, (since men pro­ <lb/>

            arguments. does not apply more to universal than <lb/>
            to particular demonstration ? For if the possession <lb/>
            of angles equal to two right angles is inherent, not in respect <lb/>
            of isosceles, but of triangle, whoever knows that it is isosceles <lb/>
            knows less essentially2 than he who knows that it is triangle. <lb/>
            In short, if not so far as it is triangle, he then shows it, there will <lb/>
            + Supply-in­ <lb/>
            herent, or is de­ <lb/>
            monstrated so <lb/>
            far as it is tri­ <lb/>
            angle. <lb/>
            t So that all <lb/>
            species of it are <lb/>
            synonymously <lb/>
            called triangle. <lb/>
            not be demonstration, but if it is,7 whoever knows <lb/>
            a thing so far as it is what it is, knows that thing <lb/>
            more.3 If then triangle is of wider extension <lb/>
            (than isosceles), and there is the same definition,t <lb/>
            and triangle is not equivocal, and the possession <lb/>
            of two angles equal to two right angles is inhe­ <lb/>
            rent in every triangle, triangle will have such <lb/>
            angles, not so far as it is isosceles, but the isosceles will have <lb/>
            them, so far as it is triangle. Hence he who knows the uni- <note type="footnote"> 1 They who employ universal demonstration do not keep within the <lb/>
            exact limits of demonstration, but appear to go beyond them in the same <lb/>
            way as those who reason <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ του ἀνἀ λόγον</foreign>, for if they have demon­ <lb/>
            strated any thing of lines, body, etc., they apply the proof as equally con­ <lb/>

            knows particularly, hence too the universal is better than the <lb/>
            particular demonstration. Moreover if there is one certain <lb/>
            definition, and no equivocation, the universal will <lb/>
            not subsist less, but rather more than certain par- <lb/>
            2. <lb/>
            ticulars, inasmuch as in the former there are things incorrupt­ <lb/>
            ible, but particulars are more corruptible.1 Besides, there is <lb/>
            no necessity that we should apprehend this (universal) to be <lb/>
            something besides these (particulars), because it shows one <lb/>
            thing, no more than in others which do not signify substance, <lb/>
            but quality, or relation, or action, but if a person thinks thus, <lb/>
            it is the hearer, and not demonstration, which is to blamed</p>
          <p>Again, if demonstration is a syllogism, showing <lb/>
            the cause and the why, the universal indeed is <lb/>
            rather causal, for that with which any thing is <lb/>
            essentially present, is itself a cause to itself,* but <lb/>
            the universal is the first,† therefore the universal <lb/>
            is cause. Wherefore the (universal) demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion is better, since it rather partakes of the cause <lb/>
            and the why, besides up to this we investigate the <lb/>
            3. Universal <lb/>
            alone is cogni­ <lb/>

            Again, by how much more things are according <lb/>
            to the particular, do they fall into infinites, but <lb/>
            the universal tends to the simple and the finite, <lb/>
            so far indeed as they are infinite, they are not subjects of <lb/>
            science, but so far as they are finite they may be known, <lb/>
            wherefore so far as they are universal, are they more objects <lb/>
            5. Universal <lb/>
            tend to the aim­ <lb/>
            ple and finite, <lb/>
            hence are <lb/>
            more scientific. <lb/>
            t i. e. if one is <lb/>
            more, the other <lb/>
            is more. <lb/>
            of scientific knowledge, than so far as they are <lb/>
            particular. Universals however are more demon­ <lb/>
            strable, and of things more demonstrable Is there <lb/>
            pre-eminent demonstration, for relatives are at <lb/>
            one and the same time more,t whence the uni­ <lb/>
            versal is better, since it is demonstration pre- <lb/>
            eminently. Besides, that demonstration is prefer­ <lb/>
            able, according to which this and something else are known, <lb/>
            to that, by which this alone is known, now he who has the uni­ <lb/>
            versal knows also the particular, but the latter does not know <lb/>
            the universal, wherefore even thus the universal will be more <lb/>
            6. They come <lb/>
            closer in de­ <lb/>
            monstration to <lb/>
            the principle. <lb/>
            eligible. Again, as follows: it is possible rather <lb/>
            to demonstrate the universal, because a person <lb/>
            demonstrates through a medium which is nearer <lb/>
            to the principle, but what is immediate is the <lb/>
            nearest and this is the principle; if then that demonstration <lb/>
            which is from the principle is more accurate than that which <lb/>
            is not from the principle, the demonstration which is in a <lb/>
            greater degree from the principle, is more accurate than that <lb/>
            which is from it in a less degree. Now the more universal is <lb/>
            of this kind, wherefore the universal will be the better, as if <lb/>
            it were required to demonstrate A of D, and the media should <lb/>
            be B C, but B the higher, wherefore the demonstration <lb/>
            through this is more universal. <note type="footnote">I A verbose exemplification of the terse truism of Swift, that " we un­ <lb/>

          <p>Some of the above arguments are logical, it is <lb/>
            chiefly clear however that the universal is more <lb/>
            excellent, because when of two propositions we <lb/>
            have that which is the prior,* we also in a certain <lb/>
            degree know and possess in capacity that which <lb/>
            is posterior; thus if a man knows that every tri­ <lb/>
            angle has angles equal to two right, he also in a <lb/>
            certain respect knows in capacity that an isosceles <lb/>
            7. The uni­ <lb/>
            versal is above <lb/>
            all superior, in <lb/>
            that it compre­ <lb/>
            hends the par­ <lb/>

            these cannot be perceived by sense, it is plain that neither <lb/>
            can scientific be possessed through sense. In fact, it is clear, <lb/>

            observing this frequently to happen, by investigation of the <lb/>
            universal, we should obtain demonstration, for the universal <lb/>
            is manifest from many singulars, but is valuable, because it <lb/>
            discloses the cause, wherefore the universal (knowledge) about <lb/>
            such things, of which there is another cause, is more honour­ <lb/>

          <p>THAT there should be the same principles of all <lb/>
            syllogisms is impossible, first (this will be seen) <lb/>
            by those who consider logically. For some syl­ <lb/>
            logisms are true, others false, since it is possible <lb/>
            to conclude the true from the false, yet this but <lb/>
            rarely happens, for instance, if A is truly predicated of C, but <lb/>
            the middle B is false, for neither is A present with B nor B with <lb/>
            ‡ Example (1.) <lb/>
            C ‡ If however the media of these propositions <lb/>
            are assumed, they will be false, because every <lb/>
            false conclusion is from false principles, but the true from <lb/>
            true principles, and the false and the true are different. <lb/>
            Next, neither are the false (deduced) from the same (princi­ <lb/>
            ples) with themselves, for they are false and contrary to each <lb/>

              that justice should be injustice or timidity, that man should <lb/>
              be a horse or an ox, or that the equal should be greater or less. <lb/>
              From these positions indeed (we may prove it) <lb/>
              thus,* since neither are there the same principles <lb/>
              of all the true (conclusions), for the principles of <lb/>
              many are different in genus, and are not suitable, <lb/>
              * i. e. that <lb/>
              there are not <lb/>
              the same prin­ <lb/>
              ciplea of all <lb/>
              things. <lb/>
              as units do not suit points, for the former have not position, <lb/>
              but the latter have it. At least it is necessary to adapt <lb/>
              (either) to media or from above or below, or to have some <lb/>
              terms within but others without. 1 † Nor can <lb/>
              there possibly be certain common principles from <lb/>
              which all things may be demonstrated: I mean <lb/>
              by common as to affirm or to deny every thing, for <lb/>

              the genera of beings are different, and some are present with <lb/>
              quantities, but others with qualities alone, with which there <lb/>
              is demonstration through the common. Again, principles are <lb/>
              not much fewer than conclusions, for the propositions are <lb/>
              principles, but the propositions subsist when a term is either <lb/>
              assumed or introduced. Moreover, conclusions are infinite, <lb/>
              but terms finite; besides, some principles are from necessity, <lb/>
              but others contingent.</p>
          <p>To those therefore who thus consider, it will be <lb/>
            impossible that there should be the same finite <lb/>
            principles when the conclusions are infinite, but <lb/>

            that these are the principles of geometry, but these <lb/>
            of reckoning, ‡ and these of medicine, what is this <lb/>

          <p>THE object of scientific knowledge and science <lb/>
            (itself) differs from the object of opinion, and from <lb/>
            opinion, because science is universal, and subsists <lb/>
            through things necessary, and what is necessary <lb/>
            cannot subsist otherwise than it does: some <lb/>
            things however are true, and subsist, yet may possibly subsist <lb/>

            sary proposition. This also agrees with what <lb/>
            appears, for both opinion is unstable, and its na­ <lb/>
            ture is of this kind,' besides, no one thinks that <lb/>

            impossible for a thing to subsist otherwise than it does, but <lb/>
            when he thinks that it is indeed thus, yet that nothing hinders * <lb/>
            it being otherwise, then he thinks that he opines; <lb/>

          <p>How then is it possible t to opine and know <lb/>

            he knows he may opine ? for both he who knows <lb/>
            and he who opines will follow through media till <lb/>
            they come to things immediate, so that if the former <lb/>
            knows, he also who opines knows. For as it <lb/>
            is possible to opine that a thing is, so likewise <lb/>
            why it is, and this is the medium. Or t if he so <lb/>
            conceives things which cannot subsist otherwise, <lb/>
            as if he had the definitions through which the <lb/>

            through the immediate, he will only opine that they are. <lb/>
            Still opinion and science are not altogether conversant with <lb/>
            the same thing, but as both the true and the false opinion are <lb/>
            in a manner about the same thing, thus also science and <lb/>
            opinion are conversant with the same.1 For as some say that <lb/>
            true and false opinion are of the same; absurd consequences <lb/>
            * Cf. Met. b. <lb/>
            iii. ch. 5. <lb/>
            follow both in other respects, and also that he <lb/>
            who opines falsely does not opined * Now since <lb/>
            the same thing is stated in several ways, in one <lb/>
            way there may be, and in another there cannot be (a true <lb/>
            and false opinion of the same). For to opine truly that the <lb/>
            diameter of a square is commensurate with its side, is ab­ <lb/>
            surd, but because the diameter about which there are (con­ <lb/>
            trary) opinions is the same thing, thus also they are of the <lb/>
            same thing, but the essence of each according to the definition <lb/>
            is not the same.3 In like manner also knowledge and opinion <lb/>
            are conversant with the same thing, for the former is so con­ <lb/>
            versant with animal as that it is impossible animal should not <lb/>
            exist, but the latter so as that it may possibly not exist, as if <lb/>
            the one should be conversant with that which is man essen­ <lb/>
            tially, but the other with man indeed, yet not with what is <lb/>
            t But accident­ <lb/>
            ally. <lb/>
            4. We cannot, <lb/>
            at one and the <lb/>
            same time, <lb/>
            know, and <lb/>

            man essentially;† tor it is the same thing, that is, <lb/>
            man, but not the same as to the manner.</p>
          <p>From these then it is clearly impossible to opine <lb/>
            and know the same thing at the same time, for <lb/>
            otherwise at one and the same time a man might <lb/>
            have a notion that the same thing could and could <lb/>
            not subsist otherwise, which is impossible. In different (men) <lb/>
            indeed each (of these) may be possible about the same thing, <note type="footnote"> 1 Science is however distinguished from opinion, by the certainty of its <lb/>
            subject: error also consists with certainty of the subject, but opinion <lb/>
            cannot consist with it. Vide Mansel's note, p. 102; Sanderson's defini­ <lb/>

            and demonstrative syllogism, as enunciative of opinion and science, the <lb/>

            why it is, if it is, what it is. For when we in­ <lb/>

            to a number (as whether the sun is eclipsed or not) <lb/>
            we investigate the that, and a sign of this is that <lb/>
            when we have found that it is eclipsed we desist from our in­ <lb/>
            quiries, and if we knew from the first that it is eclipsed, we <lb/>
            do not inquire whether it is so. But when we know the <lb/>

            there is, or is not, a centaur or a God. I say if <lb/>
            there is or is not, simply, 1 and not if it is white <lb/>

            that the question or TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζητύμενον</foreign>here, has a more extensive application <lb/>

            is simply, then we inquire whether there is a <lb/>
            medium of it or not, but when knowing, either <lb/>
            that it is, or if it is, either in part or simply,1 we <lb/>
            concerning the <lb/>
            middle term, if <lb/>
            there be one, <lb/>
            and what it is. <lb/>
            again investigate why it is, or what it is, then we inquire <lb/>
            what the middle is. But I mean by the that if it is in a <lb/>
            part and simply, in a part indeed (as) is the moon eclipsed or <lb/>
            increased ? for in such things we inquire if a thing is or is <lb/>
            not; but simply (as) if there is a moon or not, or if night is <lb/>
            or not.* In all these inquiries it occurs that we <lb/>
            investigate either if there is a middle or what the <lb/>
            middle is, for the cause is the middle, and this is <lb/>
            investigated in all things. Is there then an <lb/>
            eclipse ? is there a certain cause or not ? after this, <lb/>
            when we know that there is, we inquire what <lb/>
            this is. For the cause of a thing not being this or <lb/>
            * A question of <lb/>
            the whole, not <lb/>
            of an accident. <lb/>
            2. The middle <lb/>
            is that which. <lb/>
            expresses the <lb/>
            cause why the <lb/>
            major is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of the <lb/>
            minor. <lb/>
            that, but simply substance, or not simply, but something of <lb/>
            those which subsist per se, or accidentally, is the middle. I <lb/>
            mean by what is simply (substance) the subject, as the moon, or <lb/>
            the earth, or the sun, or a triangle, but by a certain thing, (as) <lb/>
            an eclipse, equality, inequality † it it is in the <lb/>
            middle or not.‡ For in all these it is evident that <lb/>
            what a thing is and why it is are the same; what <lb/>
            is an eclipse ? a privation of light from the moon <lb/>
            through the interposition of the earth. Why is <lb/>
            there an eclipse, or why is the moon eclipsed? <lb/>

            triangle. <lb/>

            because its light fails through the interposition of the earthy <lb/>
            What is symphony? a ratio of numbers in sharp and flat. <lb/>
            Why does the sharp accord with the flat ? because the sharp <lb/>
            and flat have the ratio of numbers. Do then the sharp and <lb/>
            flat accord ? is there then a ratio of them in numbers ? as­ <lb/>
            suming that there is, what then is the ratio ?</p>
          <p>That the inquiry is of the middle those things <lb/>
            prove whose middle falls within the cognizance of <lb/>
            the senses, since we inquire when we have not a <lb/>
            sensible perception, as of an eclipse, whether it is <lb/>
            or not. But if we were above the moon we should <lb/>
            not inquire neither if, nor why, but it would be <lb/>
            immediately evident, as from sensible perception <lb/>
            we should also obtain knowledge of the universal; <lb/>
            3. We do not <lb/>
            investigate the <lb/>
            middle, if the <lb/>
            thing itself, <lb/>
            and its cause, <lb/>
            fall within the <lb/>

            subjects doubting first about these. But let the <lb/>
            commencement of the future (doubts) be that <lb/>
            which is most appropriate to the following discussion, since <lb/>
            1. We cannot <lb/>
            know by defi­ <lb/>
            nition every <lb/>
            subject capable <lb/>
            of demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            perhaps a man might doubt whether it is possible <lb/>
            to know the same thing, and according to the <lb/>
            same by definition and demonstration, or whether <lb/>
            it is impossible ? For definition seems to be of <lb/>
            what a thing is, but every thing which signifies) <lb/>
            what a thing is, is universal and affirmative, but some syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms are negative, others not universal; for instance, all those <lb/>
            in the second figure are negative, but those in the third not <lb/>
            universal. Next, neither is there definition of all affirmatives <lb/>
            in the first figure, as that every triangle has angles equal to <lb/>
            two right angles; the reason of this is, because to know <note type="footnote"> 1 By sensible perception that of the universal is produced. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, how definition is reduced to demonstration, for every de­ <lb/>
            finition is either the principle or the conclusion of demonstration, or it <lb/>

            scientifically that which is demonstrable, is to possess de­ <lb/>
            monstration, so that if there is demonstration in regard to <lb/>
            things of this kind, there can evidently not be also definition <lb/>
            of them, for a person might know by definition without de­ <lb/>
            monstration, since nothing prevents the possession of it at one <lb/>
            and the same time. A sufficient evidence of this is also <lb/>
            derived from induction, for we have never known by de­ <lb/>
            finition, any of those which are inherent per se nor which are <lb/>
            accidents ; besides, if definition be a certain indication of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, it is evident that such things are not substances.</p>
          <p>Clearly then, there is not definition of every <lb/>
            thing of which there is also demonstration, but <lb/>
            what, is there then demonstration of every thing <lb/>
            of which there is definition or not ? there is one <lb/>
            reason and the same also of this.. For of one <lb/>
            thing, so far as it is one, there is one science, so <lb/>
            2. Nor by de­ <lb/>
            monstration all <lb/>
            those which are <lb/>
            capable of de­ <lb/>
            finition. <lb/>
            * Proposed <lb/>
            above. <lb/>
            that if to know that which is demonstrable be to possess <lb/>
            demonstration, an impossibility would happen, for he who <lb/>
            possesses definition would know scientifically without de­ <lb/>
            monstration. Besides, the principles of demonstration are <lb/>
            definitions, of which it has been shown before, there will not <lb/>
            be demonstrations, † since either principles will be <lb/>
            demonstrable, and principles of principles, and this <lb/>
            would proceed to infinity, or the first (principles) <lb/>
            will be indemonstrable definitions. <lb/>
            t See Part i. <lb/>
            ch. 3 and 22.</p>
          <p>Yet if there are not of every thing and the <lb/>
            same, may there not be definition and demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion of a certain thing and the same ? or is it im­ <lb/>
            possible ? since there is not demonstration of what <lb/>
            3. In fact, no­ <lb/>
            thing capable <lb/>
            of definition <lb/>
            admits de­ <lb/>
            monstration. <lb/>
            there is definition, ror definition is of what a thing is, <lb/>
            and of substance, but all demonstrations appear to suppose <lb/>
            and assume what a thing is, as mathematics, what is unity <lb/>
            and what an odd number, and the rest in like manner. More­ <lb/>
            over every demonstration shows something of somewhat, as <lb/>
            that it is, or that it is not, but in definition one thing is not <lb/>
            predicated of another, as neither animal of biped, <lb/>
            nor this of animal, nor figure of superficies, for su­ <lb/>
            perficies is not figure, nor figure superficies. Again, <lb/>
            it is one thing to show what a thing is, but an­ <lb/>
            other to show that it is, definition then shows what <lb/>
            a thing is, but demonstration that this thing, either <lb/>
            4. One part of a <lb/>
            definition is <lb/>
            not predicated <lb/>
            of another. <lb/>

            collect by a syl­ <lb/>

          <p>LET then so far these things be matters of doubt, <lb/>
            but as to what a thing is whether is there, or is <lb/>
            there not, a syllogism and a demonstration of it, as <lb/>
            the present discussion supposed ? for a syllogism <lb/>
            shows something in respect of somewhat through <lb/>
            a medium, but the (definition) what a thing is, <lb/>
            is both peculiar and is predicated in respect of what it is. <lb/>
            ∥ The nature <lb/>
            of the thing <lb/>
            and that of <lb/>
            which it is the <lb/>
            nature. <lb/>
            § A B C. <lb/>
            Now it is necessary that these should reciprocate : ∥ <lb/>
            for if A is the property of C, it is evidently alsc <lb/>
            that of B, and that of C, so that all § reciprocate <lb/>
            with each other. Nevertheless, if A is present <lb/>
            with every B in respect of what it is, and uni­ <lb/>
            versally B is predicated of every C in respect of what it is, it <lb/>
            is also necessary that A should be predicated of C in the ques­ <lb/>
            tion what it is. Still if some one should assume without this <lb/>
            reduplication,2 it will not be necessary that A should be predi­ <lb/>

            wherefore B will also be the definition of C, hence if both <lb/>
            signify what a thing is, and what the very nature of it is, <lb/>
            there will be the very nature of a thing prior in the middle <lb/>
            term. Universally also, if it is possible to show what man <lb/>
            is, let C be man, but A what he is, whether biped animal, <lb/>
            or any thing else ; in order then that a conclusion should be <lb/>
            drawn, A must necessarily be predicated of every B, and of <lb/>
            this there will be another middle definition, so that this also <lb/>
            will be a definition of a man, wherefore a person assumes <lb/>
            what he ought to show, for B also is the definition of <lb/>
            a man.</p>
          <p>We must however consider it in two proposi­ <lb/>
            tions, and in first and immediate (principles), for <lb/>
            2. A twofold <lb/>
            consideration. <lb/>
            what is stated becomes thus especially evident: they there­ <lb/>
            fore who show what the soul is, or what man or any thing <lb/>
            else is, by conversion, beg the question,' as if a man should <lb/>
            assume the soul to be that which is the cause to itself of <lb/>
            life,. and that this is number moving itself he <lb/>
            must necessarily so assume as a postulate that the <lb/>
            soul is number moving itself, as that it is the <lb/>
            same thing. For it does not follow if A is con­ <lb/>
            * The minor. <lb/>
            t The major, <lb/>

            sequent to B, and this to C, that A will therefore be the <lb/>
            definition of the essence of C, but it will be only possible to <lb/>
            say that this is true, nor if A is that which is predicated <lb/>
            essentially of every B. For the very nature of animal is <lb/>
            predicated of the very nature of man, since it is true that <lb/>
            whatever exists as man, exists as animal, just as every man <lb/>
            is animal,) yet not so, as for both to be one thing.‡ <lb/>
            If then a person does not assume this, he will not <lb/>
            ‡ Because one <lb/>
            is genus, the <note type="footnote"> 1 In the minor in fact the terms so reciprocate as to become identical, <lb/>
            and the very nature of a thing, and that of which it is the very nature, are <lb/>
            the same. The whole argument goes to show that no definition, as such, <lb/>
            can be proved, but the endeavour necessarily results in a petitio principii, <lb/>
            and the reason is simply because a definition can be predicated essentially <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντῳ̃ τί ἐστι</foreign>) of nothing but that, of which it is the definition; and since. <lb/>
            to prove a conclusion concerning the essence, the premises must be of the <lb/>
            same character, the assumed middle must be identical with the minor, <lb/>
            and the major premise with the conclusion. The argument is used <lb/>

            pedestrian, biped, without wings. Why? according to each <lb/>
            addition,2 for he will state and show by division as he thinks <lb/>

            say that there is the same definition of brassy For <lb/>
            neither do definitions demonstrate that it is possi­ <lb/>
            ble for that to be which is asserted, nor that that <lb/>
            thing is, of which they say there are definitions, 1 <lb/>
            but it is always possible to say why.¶</p>
          <p>If then he who defines shows either what a <lb/>
            thing is or what the name signifies, except there <lb/>
            is, by no means (an explanation) of what a thing <lb/>
            is, definition will be a sentence signifying the same <lb/>
            thing as a name, but this is absurd. 2 For in the first place <note type="footnote"> the definition of substances is determined by the formal cause, in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the essential constituents of the general notion, the possession of <lb/>
            which entitles the individual to be reckoned under it. Aristotle makes <lb/>
            summa genera, and individuals alone indefinite. Locke avers that simple <lb/>

            there would be a definition of non-essences and of nonentities, <lb/>
            since it is possible even for non-entities to have a signification. <lb/>
            Again, all sentences will be definitions, for we might give a <lb/>
            name to any sentence, so that we might all discuss in definitions, <lb/>
            and the Iliad would be a definition. Besides, no science would <lb/>
            demonstrate that this name signifies this thing, neither there­ <lb/>

          <p>From these things therefore it appears that <lb/>
            neither definition nor syllogism are the same <lb/>

            thing, moreover that definition neither demon­ <lb/>

            what a thing is. Now since it is the same thing as we have <lb/>
            said to know what a thing is, and to know the cause where­ <lb/>
            fore * it is, and the reason of this is, that there is a <lb/>

            this is possible, discussing it again from the be­ <lb/>
            ginning. For as we investigate why a thing is, <lb/>
            when we know that it is, but sometimes those <lb/>
            become evident at the same time, but it is not <lb/>
            possible to know why it is, prior to knowing that <lb/>
            it is, it is clear that in like manner the very nature <lb/>
            of a thing, or what it is, cannot be known, with­ <lb/>
            out knowing that it is, since it is impossible to <lb/>
            know what a thing is, when ignorant if it is. § <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς του̃</foreign> ri <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϭτιν ἀποδειξεως συμπέρασμα</foreign>, is to be regarded as nominal, or <lb/>

              animal, and soul, because it moves itself. As regards then <lb/>
              whatever we know accidentally that they are, it is by no means <lb/>
              necessary that we should possess any thing by which to know <lb/>
              what they are, for neither do we (really) know that they are, <lb/>
              and to inquire what a thing is, when we do not know that it <lb/>
              is, is to inquire about nothing. In those things however of <lb/>
              which we know something, it is easy (to inquire) what they <lb/>
              are; hence as we know that a thing is, so also are we disposed <lb/>
              to know what it is, now of those things, of whose essential <lb/>
              nature we know something, let this be first an example, an <lb/>
              eclipse A, the moon C, the opposition of the earth <lb/>
              B.* To inquire then whether there is an eclipse <lb/>
              * Example (I.) <lb/>
              or not, is to inquire whether B is or not, but this does not <lb/>
              at all differ from the inquiry if there is a reason of it, and if <lb/>
              this is, we say that that also is. Or we (inquire) of which con­ <lb/>
              tradiction there is a reason, whether of possessing, or of not <lb/>
              possessing, two right angles, but when we have discovered, <lb/>
              we know at the same time, that it is, and why it is, if it is <lb/>
              inferred through media ;† but it it is not so in­ <lb/>
              ferred, we know the that, but not the why. Let <lb/>
              C be the moon, A an eclipse, not to be able to <lb/>
              produce a shadow when the moon is full and <lb/>

              not yet so, and that there is an eclipse, we indeed know, but <lb/>
              what it is we do not know.‡ Yet as it is clear <lb/>

              We have shown therefore thus, how what a <lb/>

              fore there is neither syllogism nor demonstration <lb/>
              of what a thing is, still it will become evident <lb/>
              through syllogism, and through demonstration; <lb/>
              and hence without demonstration it is neither <lb/>
              possible to know what a thing is, of which there is another <lb/>
              cause, nor is there demonstration of it, as we have already <lb/>

          <p>SINCE definition is said to be a sentence (ex­ <lb/>
            planatory) of what a thing is, it is evident that <lb/>
            one definition will be of what a name signifies, or <lb/>
            another nominal sentence, as what a thing signi- <lb/>
            1. Definition <lb/>
            either explains <lb/>
            the name of a <lb/>
            thing; <lb/>
            fies, which is so far as it is a triangle, which when we know <lb/>
            that it is, we inquire why it is.1 Still it is difficult thus to <lb/>
            assume things, the existence of which we do not know, and <lb/>
            the cause of this difficulty has been explained before, because <lb/>
            neither do we know whether it is or is not, except accidentally. <lb/>
            One sentence is indeed in two ways, the one by conjunction, <lb/>
            as the Iliad, but the other from signifying one thing of one, <lb/>
            not accidentally.</p>
          <p>The above-named then is one definition of a <lb/>
            definition, but the other definition is a sentence <lb/>
            showing why a thing is, so that the former <lb/>
            2. Or shows its <lb/>
            cause. A dis­ <lb/>
            tinction drawn. <lb/>
            signifies, but does not demonstrate, but the lattel will evi­ <lb/>
            dently be, as it were, a demonstration of what a thing is, dif­ <lb/>
            fering from demonstration in the position (of the terms). For <lb/>
            there is a difference between saying, why does it thunder ? and <lb/>
            what is thunder ? for thus a person will answer, because fire <lb/>
            is extinguished in the clouds; but what is thunder ? the sound <lb/>
            of fire extinguished in the clouds; hence there is the same <lb/>
            sentence spoken in another manner, and in the one way there <lb/>
            is a continued demonstration, but in the other there is a de- <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Aldrich, Hill's and Whately's Logics upon nominal and real <lb/>
            definition. With regard to the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος ἕτερος, ὀνοματώδης</foreign>, <lb/>
            (oratio diversa nominalis, Buhle,) Trendelenburg's, (Elementa, 55,) the <lb/>
            literal rendering, gives the idea that nominal as well as real defini­ <lb/>
            tions must be sentences, but Mansel thinks the context seems rather to <lb/>
            mean " a definition of the signification of a name, or of another sentence <lb/>
            having the force of a name;” yet on the other hand fairly allows that in <lb/>
            this way the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερος</foreign> “ is superfluous," and the example given " un­ <lb/>
            intelligible." There is no doubt therefore that by <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος ὀνοματώδης</foreign> is <lb/>
            meant a sentence whose signification, like that of a single noun, is one; <lb/>
            a description which includes all real definitions, of which the example is <lb/>
            a specimen. We subjoin the places he refers to: Int. v. 2; Metap. vi. 4, <lb/>

            in case,† and a third is the conclusion of the de­ <lb/>
            monstration of what a thing is. Wherefore, from <lb/>
            what we have said, it is evident how there is, and <lb/>
            how there is not, a demonstration of what a thing <lb/>
            is, also of what things there is, and of what there is not; more­ <lb/>

            definition referred to here, the reader will find ample information in <lb/>

            sechsten, Versammlung deutscher Philoll. und Schulmm. Cassel, 1344, <lb/>
            p. 84—89. Although Aristotle allows any of the four to be used as a mid­ <lb/>
            dle term, yet it by no means follows that each may be a definition of <lb/>
            the major, for while he has not decidedly expressed his opinion, it is <lb/>
            probable that he regarded the formal cause only, as available for defini­ <lb/>
            tion. For not only has a material cause no place in attributes, but in <lb/>
            physical substances (Metap. vii. 4); in this chapter he gives a material <lb/>
            cause, instanced as a middle term, as in fact identical with the formal. <lb/>
            The efficient and final causes seem, as Mansel says, to be excluded, as <lb/>
            not being contemporaneous with their effects, so that from the existence <lb/>
            of the one we cannot certainly infer that of the other. Vide Waitz, vol. <lb/>

            it is necessary that that should be, is not from <lb/>
            one proposition being assumed, but from two at <lb/>

            this one therefore being assumed,¶ there is neces­ <lb/>
            sarily a conclusion, which is evidently thus: Why <lb/>
            is the angle a right one in a semicircle, or from <lb/>
            the existence of what, is it right ? * Let then A be <lb/>
            a right angle, B the half of two right angles, and <lb/>
            the middle <lb/>
            term. <lb/>

            the right angle is inherent in C, i. e. in the angle of a semi­ <lb/>
            circle ; for this angle is equal to A, but C is equal to B, for it <lb/>
            is the half of two right angles ; B then being the half of two <lb/>
            right angles, A is inherent in C, and this was for <lb/>
            the angle in a semicircle to be a right angle.† <lb/>
            This t however is the same as the explanation of <lb/>
            the essence of a thing, § because definition signifies <lb/>
            this, but the cause of the essence of a thing has <lb/>
            been shown to be the middle. || Why was there a <lb/>

            || Ch. 8, and 10. <lb/>
            cause of waging war with the Athenians ? Because the latter <lb/>
            with the Eretrians attacked Sardis; this was the first cause of the <lb/>
            movement. Let war then be A, first made the attack B, the <lb/>
            Athenians C, B then is present with C, i. e. to have first made <lb/>
            the attack is present with the Athenians, but A is also with B, <lb/>
            for they make war with the aggressors, A then is present with <lb/>

            is present with the Athenians, for they were the aggressors. <lb/>

            ner, in respect to the having been, and the will <lb/>
            be, generated. In the case of things which are not simul­ <lb/>
            taneous, are there in a continued time, as it seems to us, dif­ <lb/>
            ferent causes of different things ? for instance, is another thing <lb/>
            having been generated the cause of this thing having been <lb/>
            generated, and another thing which will be, the cause that <lb/>
            this will be, and of this being, something which was generated <lb/>

            foundation was <lb/>
            laid from the <lb/>

            tween the <lb/>
            before ? the syllogism however is from what was <lb/>
            afterwards generated. † And the principle of these <lb/>
            are those things which have been generated, <lb/>
            wherefore the case is the same as to things <lb/>
            which are generated. From the prior indeed <lb/>
            there is no (syllogism), as that this thing was <lb/>
            afterwards generated, because that thing was <lb/>
            generated,‡ it is the same also in regard to the <lb/>
            future. For whether the time be indefinite or <lb/>
            definite, § it will not result that because that thing <lb/>
            was truly said to have been generated, this which <lb/>
            is posterior is truly said to have been generated, <figure type="illustration">

              since in the interval it will be false to say this,1 <lb/>
              when already another thing- has been produced. <lb/>
              The same reasoning also happens to what will be, <lb/>
              nor because thatf was produced, will this t be, as <lb/>
              the middle must be generated at the same time;2 <lb/>
              of things that have been that which has been, <lb/>
              of the future the future, of what are produced <lb/>

              it is the me­ <lb/>
              dium. <lb/>
              produced at one and the same time. Moreover neither can the <lb/>
              interval § be indefinite, nor definite,3 since it will <lb/>
              be false to assert it in the interval ;4 but we must <lb/>
              consider what is connected with it, so that after the <lb/>
              § Between the <lb/>
              past and fu­ <lb/>
              ture. <lb/>
              having been generated, to be generated may exist in things.5 <lb/>
              Or is it evident that what is generated is not connected with <lb/>
              what was generated ? for the past does not cohere with what <lb/>
              was generated, since they are terms and individuals. As then <lb/>
              neither points are mutually connected, those things which <lb/>
              have been produced are not so, for both are indivisible; nor <lb/>
              for the same reason does that which is, cohere with that which <lb/>
              has been generated, for that which is generated is divisible, <lb/>
              but that which has been is indivisible. As a line then is to <lb/>
              a point, so is that which is to that which was generated, for <lb/>
              infinite things which have been, are inherent in <lb/>
              that which is; || we must however enunciate these <lb/>
              matters more clearly in the universal discussions <lb/>
              about motion.¶</p>
          <p>Concerning then the manner in which, when <lb/>
            there is a successive generation, the middle cause <lb/>
            subsists, let so much be assumed, for in these also <lb/>
            it is necessary that the middle and the first should <lb/>
            be immediate, thus A was generated because C <lb/>

            C, because it is nearer to the now, which is the principle of <lb/>
            time, but C was generated if D was, hence from D having <lb/>
            been, it is necessary that A should have been. The cause how­ <lb/>
            ever is C, for from D having been, it is necessary that C <lb/>
            should have been generated, but C having been, A must of <lb/>
            necessity have been produced before. When however we <lb/>
            thus assume the middle, will (the process) at any time stop <lb/>
            at the immediate, or on account of the infinity will a medium <lb/>
            always intervene ? for, as we have stated, what has been ge­ <lb/>
            nerated is not connected with what has been ; nevertheless we <lb/>

            Bekker. <lb/>
            must commence at least from the immediate * and <lb/>
            from the first now.1 Likewise with regard to the <lb/>
            “ will be," for if it is true to say that D will be, <lb/>
            it is necessary that, prior to this, it should be true <lb/>
            to say that A will be, the cause however of this is C, for if D <lb/>
            will be, prior to it C will be, but if C will be, prior to it A <lb/>
            will be. Likewise also in these the division is infinite, for <lb/>
            things which will be, are not mutually coherent, but an im­ <lb/>
            mediate principle must also be assumed in these. It is thus <lb/>
            in the case of works, if a house has been built, stones must <lb/>
            necessarily have been cut, and formed; and why this ? because <lb/>
            the foundation must of necessity have been laid, if the house <lb/>
            was built, but if the foundation was laid, stones must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily have been prepared before. Again, if there shall be a <lb/>
            house, in like manner there will be stones prior to this, still <lb/>
            the demonstration is in like manner through a medium, for <lb/>
            the foundation will have a prior subsistence.</p>

          <p>Notwithstanding, since we see in things which <lb/>

            this happens when the middle and the extremes fol­ <lb/>

            this however was shown in the first treatise,‡ viz. <lb/>
            that the conclusions are converted; § but the case <lb/>
            of being in a circle is thus. In works it appears <lb/>
            after this manner, when the earth has been moist­ <lb/>
            ened, vapour is necessarily produced, from the <lb/>
            production of this, there is a cloud, from this last, water, and <lb/>
            from the presence of this, the earth is necessarily moistened, <lb/>

            in a circle, for any one of these existing, another is, :.nd if <lb/>
            that is, another, and from this, the first.</p>
          <p>There are some things which are generated <lb/>
            universally, (for always, and in every thing, they <lb/>
            either thus subsist, or are generated,) but others <lb/>
            not always, but for the most part; thus not every <lb/>
            vigorous man has a beard, but this is generally <lb/>
            the case, now of such things it is necessary that <lb/>
            the medium also should be for the most part; for <lb/>
            7. Of things <lb/>
            which are not <lb/>

            but usually, the <lb/>
            principles <lb/>
            should be non- <lb/>
            necessary, but <lb/>
            for the most <lb/>
            part true. Cf. <lb/>
            Wallis, iii. 23. <lb/>
            if A is universally predicated of B, and this of C universally, <lb/>
            it is necessary that A also should be predicated always, and <lb/>
            of every C, (for the universal is that which is present with <lb/>
            every individual and always,) but it was supposed to be for <lb/>
            the most part, wherefore it is necessary that the medium also, <lb/>
            B, should be for the most part: hence of those which are for <lb/>
            the most part, the principles are immediate, as many as thus <lb/>
            subsist for the most part, or are generated.</p>

            ample, number, the odd is present with every triad, <lb/>
            the first in both ways, both as not being mea­ <lb/>
            sured by number and as not being composed of <lb/>
            numbers.2 Now therefore the triad is this, viz. <lb/>
            the first odd number, and the first in this way, for <lb/>
            each of these is present, the one with all odd numbers, but <lb/>
            the last also with the dual, yet all of them (together) with <lb/>
            ‡ Last book, <lb/>
            ch. 4. <lb/>
            none (but the triad). Since however we have <lb/>
            shown above,‡ that those things which are predi­ <lb/>
            cated in respect of what a thing is are necessary, <lb/>
            but universals are necessary, but what are thus assumed of a <lb/>
            triangle, or any other thing, are assumed in respect to what a <lb/>
            thing is, thus from necessity the triad will be these things. That <lb/>
            his however is its essence appears from this, since it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, unless the very nature of a triad were not this, that this <lb/>
            should be a certain genus, either denominated or anonymous. <lb/>
            It will be therefore of wider extension than to be with a triad <lb/>
            alone, for let the genus be supposed of that kind as to be more <lb/>
            widely extended according to power, if then it is present with <lb/>
            nothing else than individual triads, this will be the essence of <lb/>
            the triad. Let this also be supposed, that an ultimate predi­ <lb/>
            cation like this of individuals is the essence of each thing, <lb/>
            wherefore in like manner, when any thing is thus demon­ <lb/>
            strated, it will be the essence of that thing.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless it is right when any one is con­ <lb/>

            extensive with the subject, he is there apparently speaking not of the <lb/>
            specific difference per se, but of the difference regarded as dividing the <lb/>

            It is not at all necessary that he who defines and <lb/>

            something else than this. In the first place then this is false, for <lb/>
            it is not something else according to every difference, since there <lb/>

          <p>In order to frame definition by divisions, we <lb/>
            must attend to three things, viz. to assume the <lb/>
            things predicated in respect of what a thing <lb/>
            is; to arrange these, which shall be first or se­ <lb/>
            cond ; and that these are all. Now the first of <note type="footnote"> I We find from the scholia that Aristotle here glances at Speusippus: he <lb/>
            proceeds to show that it does not signify to the proper knowledge of the <lb/>
            thing defined, whether a person knows, or does not know, other things in­ <lb/>
            cluded in either species; since if he carries on division he will arrive at those <lb/>
            which have no difference, and will then have attained the desired definition. </note> <pb n="343"/>

            these arises from our being able as syllogistically <lb/>
            to collect accident, that it is inherent,* so to con­ <lb/>
            struct through genus.t There will however be a <lb/>
            proper arrangement if what is first be assumed, <lb/>

            and this will be if that be taken which is consequent to all, <lb/>
            but all not consequent to it; for there must be something of <lb/>
            this kind. This then being taken, there must now be the <lb/>
            same method in the things inferior, since the second will be <lb/>
            that which is first of the rest, and the third that which is first <lb/>
            of the following, for what is superior being taken away, what­ <lb/>
            ever succeeds will be the first of the others; there is also <lb/>
            similar reasoning in the other cases. Still that all these should <lb/>
            be, is clear from assuming what is first in the division, that <lb/>
            every animal is either this or that,t but this is <lb/>
            inherent; § and again the difference of this whole 1 <lb/>

            thing is, nor is any thing deficient, for it would <lb/>
            be either genus or difference. Both the first then <lb/>
            is genus, and this assumed together with differ­ <lb/>
            ences, but all the differences are contained, for <lb/>
            there is no longer any posterior difference.¶ <lb/>
            Otherwise the last. would differ in species, this <lb/>
            however has been shown not to differ. t</p>
          <p>Still we must investigate, looking to those which <lb/>
            are similar and do not differ, first (considering) what <lb/>
            that is which is the same in all these, then again <lb/>
            in other things which are in the same genus with <lb/>

            follow every bird, and so always that which is nearest,3 for <lb/>
            we shall evidently now be able to say why things are present, <lb/>

          <p>SOME one may perhaps doubt concerning cause <lb/>
            and that of which it is the cause, whether when <lb/>
            the effect is inherent, the cause also is inherent, <lb/>
            as if the leaves fall from a tree, or there is an <lb/>
            eclipse, will there also be the cause of the eclipse, <lb/>
            or of the fall of the leaves ? As if the cause of <lb/>
            this, is the having broad leaves, but of an eclipse <lb/>
            ]. Solution of a <lb/>
            difficulty-the <lb/>
            middle term <lb/>
            should always <lb/>
            express the <lb/>
            cause of the in­ <lb/>
            ference. (Cf. <lb/>
            Aldrich's Log., <lb/>

            ed. and Wallis's <lb/>
            Log.) <lb/>
            the interposition of the earth, for if this be not so, something <lb/>
            else will be the cause of these, and if the cause is present, at <lb/>
            the same time the effect will be, thus if the earth be interposed, <lb/>
            there is an eclipse, or if a tree have broad leaves, it sheds <lb/>
            them. But if this be so, they would be simultaneous, and de­ <lb/>
            monstrated through each other, for let the leaves to fall be A, <lb/>
            the having broad leaves B, and a vine C, if then A is present <lb/>
            with B, (for whatever has broad leaves sheds them,) but B is <lb/>
            present with C, for every vine has broad leaves, A is present <lb/>
            with C, and every vine sheds its leaves, but the cause is B, <note type="footnote"> word signifies the effect produced from a thing being surrounded by its <lb/>
            contrary. Thus why is hail produced ? Because the cold is contracted by <lb/>
            the surrounding heat. Why are subterranean places cold in summer and <lb/>
            hot in winter ? Because in winter the heat is contracted on account of <lb/>
            the surrounding cold, and in summer the cold, on account of the sur­ <lb/>

            and there is more rain during the decrease of the moon, because when <lb/>

            * Example (1.) <lb/>
            the middle.- We may also show that the vine <lb/>
            has broad leaves, from its shedding them, for if <lb/>
            D be what has broad leaves, E to shed the leaf, F a vine, E <lb/>
            then is present with F, (for every vine sheds its leaf,) but D <lb/>
            with E, (for every thing which sheds its leaf, has broad <lb/>
            leaves, every vine then has broad leaves, the cause is, its <lb/>
            t Example (2.) <lb/>
            shedding them.† Nevertheless if they cannot be <lb/>
            the cause of each other, (since cause is prior to <lb/>
            that of which it is the cause,) the cause of an eclipse indeed <lb/>
            is the interposition of the earth, but an eclipse is not the <lb/>
            cause of the earth interposing. If then the demonstration by <lb/>
            cause (shows) why a thing is, but that which is not through <lb/>
            cause, that it is, one knows1 indeed that the earth is inter­ <lb/>
            posed, but why it is, he does not know.2 Yet that an <lb/>
            eclipse is not the cause of the interposition, but this of an <lb/>
            eclipse, is plain, since in the definition of an eclipse, the in­ <lb/>
            terposition of the earth is inherent, so that evidently that is <lb/>
            known through this,3 but not this through that.4</p>
          <p>2. There is <lb/>
            only one cause <lb/>
            of one and the <lb/>
            same thing, <lb/>
            from which it <lb/>
            is inferred.</p>
          <p>Or may there be many causes of one thing ? <lb/>
            for if the same thing may be predicated of many <lb/>
            primary, let A be present with B a first, and <lb/>
            with C another first, and these with D E, A then <lb/>
            will be present with D E, but the cause why it is <lb/>
            with D will be B, and C the cause why it is with E, hence <lb/>

            but all together reciprocate, and are of similar ex­ <lb/>

            with D, wherefore it is necessary that A should <lb/>

            knowledge of immediate principles, both whether <lb/>
            it is the same or not the same, * also whether there <lb/>
            is a science of each or not, t or a science of one, <lb/>
            but a different kind (of science) of another, and <lb/>
            whether non-inherent habits are ingenerated,t or <lb/>
            when inherent are latent.2 If then, indeed, we <lb/>
            possess them,§ it is absurd, for it happens that it <lb/>
            (the principle) escapes those who have a more <lb/>

            innate power, which they call sensible percep­ <lb/>
            tion,* but sense being inherent in some animals, <lb/>
            a permanency of the sensible object is engen­ <lb/>
            dered, but in others it is not engendered.! Those, <lb/>
            therefore, wherein the sensible object does not re­ <lb/>
            main, either altogether or about those things which <lb/>
            do not remain, such have no knowledge with­ <lb/>
            out sensible perception, but others when they per­ <lb/>
            ceive, retain one certain thing in the soul.t Now <lb/>
            since there are many of this kind, a certain differ­ <lb/>

            membrance of the same thing, we get experience, <lb/>
            for many remembrances in number constitute <lb/>
            one experience. From experience, however, or <lb/>
            from every universal being at rest in the soul,. <lb/>
            that one besides the many, which in all of them is <lb/>
            one and the same, the principle of art and science <lb/>
            arises, if indeed it is conversant with generation, † <lb/>
            of art, but if with being, of science.1 Neither, <lb/>
            therefore, are definite habits inherent,‡ nor are <lb/>
            they produced from other habits more known, <lb/>
            but from sensible perception, as when a flight <lb/>

            another stands, and then another, until the fight is restored. <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Trendelenb. c. i. p. 137; Aldrich, Hill, and Mansel upon In­ <lb/>

            But the soul has such a state of being, as enables <lb/>
            it to suffer this,. what, however, we have before <lb/>
            said, but not clearly, let us again explain. When <lb/>

            It is manifest then that primary things become <lb/>
            necessarily known to us by induction, for thus <lb/>
            sensible perception produces the universal. But <lb/>
            since, of those habits which are about intellect, <lb/>
            by which we ascertain truth, some are always <lb/>
            true, but others admit the false, as opinion, and <lb/>

            and of the rational, some are always true, as intellect and science, <lb/>
            others are sometimes true, as opinion and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμός</foreign>, i. e. reasoning about <lb/>

            If then we have no other true genus (of habit) <lb/>
