          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1092, the fifteenth indiction, <lb/>
            Henry, son of King William, by God's help and the sup­ <lb/>
            port of his friends, obtained possession of the castle of <lb/>
            Domfront, and began from thence to urge strong claims to <lb/>
            his hereditary rights. This prince, being the youngest, did <lb/>
            not receive fraternal treatment from his brothers, but was <lb/>
            compelled to seek the aid of foreigners, such as the French <lb/>
            and Bretons, as if he had been himself an alien, and was <lb/>
            harassed by many vicissitudes of fortune during five years.1 <lb/>
            At length, by God's providence, the inhabitants of Dom­ <lb/>
            front, pitying the misfortunes of the illustrious exile, sent <lb/>
            one Harecher2 to invite him out of France, and, giving him <note type="footnote">1 Reckoning from the death of William the Conqueror. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " This person," says M. Le Provost, " was not called Harecher, but <lb/>
            Achard." Mr. Stapleton thinks that our author was correct in writing it <lb/>
            Harecherius, and considers that word synonymous with Archarius, which <lb/>
            frequently appears in the Rolls of the Exchequer. We find there a Richard <lb/>
            Archarius, or Archer, and a Richard de Domfront, whom he considers the <lb/>
            same person. This inhabitant of Domfront received from the gratitude of <lb/>
            Henry 1. seven manors in Berkshire. This grant is made to him under <lb/>
            the name of Robert the Archer, and Henry calls him magister meus. <lb/>
            Wace, who calls him Haschier, adds that it was to Paris he went to give <lb/>
            the invitation to the young prince. He was descended from another <lb/>
            Achard, who appears as witness to the charter of foundation of Lonlai in <lb/>
            1026, with this description: Achardus dives, miles de Donnifronte. </note><note type="footnote">VOL. III. </note><note type="footnote"> B </note><pb n="2"/>

            Belèsme, by whom they had been long grievously oppressed, <lb/>
            and declared Henry their lord. The prince forthwith took <lb/>
            arms against Robert, count of Normandy, and made repri­ <lb/>
            salt; for his own banishment by pillaging and burning the <lb/>
            country; taking many captives, and throwing them into <lb/>
            prison. Among these was a man named Rualod from the <lb/>
            territories of St. Evroult, who was lodged in the castle of <lb/>
            Domfront. The prisoner, sitting by the fireside, for it was <lb/>
            in the winter, began to invoke St. Evroult in his tribulation, <lb/>
            thus addressing him: " I beseech thee, holy Evroult, the <lb/>
            friend of God, to deliver me from this captivity. Thou <lb/>
            knowest that I have always served thee faithfully." Having <lb/>
            said this, he suddenly fell asleep, when, lo! he felt some one <lb/>
            take his hand and begin to pull him. Upon his waking, he <lb/>
            found himself entirely free from pain, for he was so feeble <lb/>
            that he could not walk without some one's help, having <lb/>
            received injury by falling from the horse on which he was <lb/>
            bound. He began now to consider what he could do to <lb/>
            escape from his prison. He had noticed that the knight <lb/>
            who brought him there had firmly closed the gate which led <lb/>
            to the garden with a bolt. But faith giving him courage, he <lb/>
            approached the gate and seized the bar which fastened it, <lb/>
            when, strange to say, the bolt, which was so strongly fixed, <lb/>
            fell to the ground. Having opened the gate, he proceeded <lb/>
            to the end of the little garden, but on arriving there he saw <lb/>
            a number of soldiers standing in the courtyard. However, <lb/>
            he stretched out his hand, saying, "St.Evroult, be my guide," <lb/>
            and so, with bare feet and having only his shirt and cloak <lb/>
            on, passed through the crowd of soldiers, as if they had lost <lb/>
            their sight. None of them asked who he was, or whither <lb/>
            he was going. I think that they were prevented seeing him <lb/>
            by the power of the most blessed saint. About six o'clock, <lb/>
            the fugitive, looking back, perceived the knight who had <lb/>
            made him prisoner galloping after him; whereupon, being <lb/>
            much terrified, he concealed himself in a thicket of under­ <lb/>
            wood, which happened to be in sight. The knight riding <lb/>
            up to the spot, inquired of some husbandmen who were <lb/>
            ploughing a neighbouring field, if they had seen any one <lb/>
            running that way, but they, fear putting them on their <lb/>
            guard, denied having noticed any one, although they had <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1093.] </note> <lb/>
            seen him well enough. The knight having left the spot, the <lb/>
            captive rose from his lurking place, and, with the help of <lb/>
            God and St. Evroult, reached his home in safety, where be <lb/>
            lived till my time. I heard what I have related from his <lb/>
            own mouth, and as he was an honest and worthy man, I <lb/>
            have no scruple in crediting it.</p>

            <title type="sub">CH. XX. Philip I. of France carries off and marries Ber­ trade, wife of the count of Anjou, repudiating his queen Bertha—He is excommunicated—Philip and Bertrade reconciled to the count—His children—List of French bishops.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ABOUT this time a disgraceful and troublesome affair <lb/>
            happened in France. Bertrade, countess of Anjou, appre­ <lb/>
            hensive that her husband would treat her as he had done <lb/>
            two other wives, and abandon her to shame like a vile harlot, <lb/>
            in the conscious pride of her high birth and great beauty, <lb/>
            sent a confidential messenger to Philip, king of France, <lb/>
            disclosing to him what was passing in her mind. She pre­ <lb/>
            ferred leaving her husband voluntarily, and taking another, <lb/>
            to being repudiated by him and exposed to contempt. The <lb/>
            dissolute king, on learning the lascivious woman's desires, <lb/>
            consented to her proposals, and received her on her arrival <lb/>
            in France, after having escaped from her husband, with open <lb/>
            arms.' In short, he divorced his noble and excellent wife <lb/>
            Bertha,2 daughter of Florence, duke of Frisia, who had <lb/>
            borne him two children, Lewis and Constance, and married <lb/>
            Bertrade, who had lived nearly four years with Fulk of <lb/>
            Anjou.' Odo, bishop of Bayeux, celebrated this execrable <lb/>
            marriage,5 and received from the adulterous king the churches <note type="footnote">1 Bertrade withdrew privately from the church of St. John at Tours <lb/>
            during the ceremony of consecrating the holy water on Saturday, June 4, <lb/>
            1093, and hastened to join the king who was waiting for her at a short <lb/>
            distance. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bertha, daughter of Florence, count of Holland, and Gertrude of <lb/>
            Saxony, was married to Philip about the year 1072. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Lewis the Fat. </note><note type="footnote"> * In 1089. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 It is not exactly known who celebrated this marriage. According to <lb/>
            William of Malmesbury it was William Bonne-Ame, archbishop of Rouen, <lb/>
            which might account for his suspension by Pascal II. This solution would <lb/>
            be perfectly satisfactory, were it not for the long interval which elapsed <lb/>
            between the fault and its punishment, very different from the practice of </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII. CH.XX."/> <lb/>
            of the city of Mantes, which he held for some time as the <lb/>
            reward of his ill-omened service. No French bishop could <lb/>
            be persuaded to consecrate so detestable an union, but, <lb/>
            adhering to the rules of ecclesiastical discipline, they all <lb/>
            chose to please God rather than man, and concurred in one <lb/>
            universal anathema against the shameful marriage. Thus <lb/>
            the bold harlot left one adulterous husband, the count of <lb/>
            Anjou, and clung to another, the king of France, to the hour <lb/>
            of his death. Thus, alas! the throne of France was dis­ <lb/>
            graced by the abominable sin of adultery, and violent threats <lb/>
            and great preparations for war between these powerful <lb/>
            rivals were the consequence. But the feud between them <lb/>
            was allayed by the dexterity of female cunning, Bertrade's <lb/>
            ready wit finding means to effect a reconciliation so perfect <lb/>
            that she brought them together at a splendid banquet,1 in <lb/>
            which she served them with her own hands with consummate <lb/>
            grace, to their great satisfaction.2 Pope Urban sent legates <lb/>
            from the apostolical see into France, and both by letters and <lb/>
            the remonstrances of the priests, rebuked the erring king, <lb/>
            censuring him severely for having repudiated his lawful wife, <lb/>
            and united Himself to an adulteress, against the laws of God.3 <note type="footnote"> the court of Rome at this period. On the other hand it is not more easy <lb/>
            to explain the pope's indulgence to the bishop of Bayeux, if he was the <lb/>
            guilty person. But Urban II., in a letter to Reynold, archbishop of <lb/>
            Rheims, describes this marriage ceremony to have been performed by <lb/>
            Ursion, bishop of Senlis. In that case we may suppose that the archbishop <lb/>
            of Rouen, and bishop of Bayeux, only sanctioned it with their presence. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Ambosque simul ad mensam discumbere faceret et node sequenti <lb/>
            ambobus in unâ conclavi stratâ prœpararet. This curious addition <lb/>
            is supplied by the MS. which belonged to Christina, queen of Sweden. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The count of Anjou, whose indignation was at first exhibited in the <lb/>
            grossest manner, treated the affair, in the end, very differently. Philip <lb/>
            and Bertrade paid him a visit at Angers on Wednesday, October 6, 1106, <lb/>
            and were received by him with great honours, in which not only the laity, <lb/>
            but, what is more extraordinary, the clergy, took part. M. Le Prevost, <lb/>
            however, is of opinion that Bertrade did not descend from her royal <lb/>
            dignity to serve at table the vassal she honoured with a visit; and he <lb/>
            observes that there is no other instance of a queen of France having given <lb/>
            such service, even to her husband. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The first excommunication against the adulterers was pronounced at <lb/>

            But King Philip, hardened in his iniquity, and like the deaf <lb/>
            adder which shuts her ears to the voice of the charmer, <lb/>
            treated with contempt the exhortations of the fathers who <lb/>
            corrected him, and remained sunk in the foul pit of adultery <lb/>
            for a long period; two sons, Philip and Florus,1 being the <lb/>
            fruit of this illicit intercourse. He was therefore placed <lb/>
            under an interdict for nearly fifteen years, while Urban and <lb/>
            Paschal were popes of Rome.2 During all this time, he <lb/>
            never wore his crown or royal robes, nor celebrated any <lb/>
            festival in kingly state. Wherever he went, in every city <lb/>
            and town of France, as soon as the clergy received intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of his arrival, the bells ceased to be rung, and the <lb/>
            regular chants of the clergy were suspended. In consequence <lb/>
            there was general mourning, and divine worship was per­ <lb/>
            formed in private as long as the princely sinner sojourned in <lb/>
            the diocese. However, in deference to his royal dignity and <lb/>
            by licence from the bishops, whose sovereign he was, a <lb/>
            chaplain was allowed him, by whom he heard mass performed <lb/>
            with his household.</p>
          <p>About this time France was famous for several pious and <lb/>
            learned bishops. The aged Leuter 3 filled the metropolitan <lb/>
            see of Bourges, and Daimbert that of Sens.4 The illustrious <lb/>
            Reynold was archbishop of Rheims,5 and at his death was <lb/>
            succeeded by Ralph, surnamed Le Vera.6 The learned Ives <lb/>
            at the council of Potters, the 18th of November, 1100. Nothwithstanding <lb/>
            the promise of separation given at the council of Beaugenci (July 30, 1104), <lb/>
            absolution was not renewed until the fourteenth council of Paris (Dec. 2, <lb/>
            1110), where the promise was confirmed on oath. <note type="footnote"> 1 Philip, count of Mantes, and lord of Meun in Berri. Florus (Fleuri) <lb/>

            the archbishop1 assembled a synod of bishops and abbots at <lb/>
            Rouen, and during several days held consultations with his <lb/>
            suffragans on urgent ecclesiastical affairs. At that time <lb/>
            Ralph, bishop of Coutances,2 came to the lodgings of Serlo, <lb/>
            bishop of Séez, who was the wiser of the two, and con­ <lb/>
            versing with him on various subjects, received full explana­ <lb/>
            tions. At last, among other things, the bishop of Coutances <lb/>
            said: " We have in our city a church built in ancient times, <lb/>
            and dedicated to St. Peter the Apostle,3 where many miracles <lb/>
            were formerly wrought by divine power. Health was <lb/>
            frequently restored to the sick, and lighted candles were <lb/>
            often seen to fall from on high. A certain nun, who passed <lb/>
            for being eminently pious, daily frequents this church, and <lb/>
            relates that she was a constant witness of these prodigies. <lb/>
            In order to furnish an undoubted proof of her story, on one <lb/>
            occasion, when she was keeping solitary watch in a chapel <lb/>
            [within the church], and she saw a lighted candle let down <lb/>
            from above without human aid, she reverently approached <lb/>
            the high altar, and extinguishing the candle, wrapped it in a <lb/>
            clean napkin, and deposited it in her chest. At a suitable <lb/>
            time she told what she had seen, and opened her chest to <lb/>
            exhibit the token, but she found only ashes to show that the <lb/>
            candle had been lighted, for it was entirely burnt out with­ <lb/>
            out injury to the napkin and other things contained in the <lb/>
            chest.</p>
          <p>Lately, also, while the people were celebrating the feast <lb/>
            of St. Peter the Apostle in the same church, and the clergy <lb/>
            assembled in the choir were performing vespers, all present <lb/>
            saw three wax candles, burning brightly, descend from above <lb/>
            upon the altar, and were struck with wonder at so strange a <lb/>
            prodigy. The candles burned until the end of matins, and <lb/>
            were not entirely consumed until the dawn of day. The <lb/>
            tapers stood in due order upon the altar, but did not touch <lb/>
            the altar cloth. The centre one was large and square, the <lb/>
            two others were less and round. The news of this occur­ <lb/>
            rence was spread throughout the city, and almost all the <note type="footnote"> 1 William Bonne-Ame, archbishop of Rouen, July, 1079—February 9, <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. VIII. CII.XXII."/> <lb/>
            clergy and laity flocked after vespers were over to see the <lb/>
            extraordinary spectacle. No one ventured to touch the <lb/>
            candles, but on the square one the clerks read the following <lb/>
            writing: on the first side,' “ Send, Peter, wrath from <lb/>
            heaven ;” on the second, “ ....1 the people from sin; " on <lb/>
            the third, " Have mercy on them ;”on the fourth, " Tears." <lb/>
            The letters were well formed and could be read with ease, <lb/>
            and the learned carefully inquired the meaning of the <lb/>
            inscription; and, adding words understood, which were <lb/>
            necessary to complete the sense, they interpreted it according <lb/>
            to the best of their judgment. It appeared to them that <lb/>
            God thus spoke to Peter, who is the governor of the earth, <lb/>
            the judge of the world, and the bearer of the keys of the <lb/>
            celestial kingdom : " Peter, send thy wrath from heaven, that <lb/>
            it may be poured forth on the ... people (that is, the <lb/>
            people totally lost in sin). I should have mercy on them if <lb/>
            they offered me the tears of a true penitence." The words <lb/>
            of God, indeed, are not subject to the rules of grammar, <lb/>
            and cannot be forced to follow the idioms of human <lb/>
            language. We have been much terrified at Coutances by <lb/>
            this revelation; and feel that perils are impending over us <lb/>
            in these plagues and storms of war, and are apprehensive <lb/>
            that still worse may happen in future."</p>
          <p>Ralph, bishop of Coutances, relating this story, his hearers <lb/>
            were struck with astonishment, and soon afterwards many <lb/>
            calamities ensued from wars, and tempests, and famine. <lb/>
            The bishop himself died soon afterwards, and a destructive <lb/>
            pestilence raged throughout his diocese.</p>

            were treated for three years as part of the royal domains. <lb/>
            At last, the blessed Anselm, abbot of Bec, by God's provi­ <lb/>
            dence, was appointed his successor, and governed the <lb/>
            church seventeen years, during which he suffered severe <lb/>
            trouble and adversity.</p>
          <p>At that time much wickedness began to prevail, and <lb/>
            greatly increased in violence. The men attached to military <lb/>
            service first set the example of departing from the habits of <lb/>
            their fathers in their dress and manner of wearing the hair, <lb/>
            which was soon followed by the burghers and country folk, <lb/>
            and almost all the common people. Offences against the <lb/>
            laws of God becoming flagrant, the divine judgments <lb/>
            severely punished the guilty with a variety of calamities <lb/>
            which they well merited.</p>
          <p>At that time,1 Malcolm, king of Scotland, revolted against <lb/>
            the king of England, and refused to render him the homage <lb/>
            he owed him. But King William having, as before related, <lb/>
            been reconciled with his brother Robert in Normandy, he <lb/>
            brought him over on his return to make head against <lb/>
            the faithless traitors who had conspired against their royal <lb/>
            master. Assembling the whole military force of England,2 <lb/>
            he led them as far as the great river which is called in the <lb/>
            Scottish tongue, Watra; 3 but finding it impossible to cross, <lb/>
            he encamped on the shore. The king of Scots held the <lb/>
            other bank with his troops ready for battle, and sent envoys <lb/>
            with this message to the king of England: " King William, <lb/>
            I owe you nothing except war, if you provoke me to it by <lb/>
            your outrages. But if I see Robert, the eldest son of the <lb/>
            late King William, I am ready to pay him the homage which <lb/>
            is due to him." This message being delivered, a council <lb/>
            was held, in consequence of which Duke Robert crossed <note type="footnote"> 1 During the vacancy of the see of Canterbury, May 24, 1089—Dec. 4, <lb/>

            with great courtesy, and entertained him amicably three <lb/>
            days. He then conducted the duke to the top of a lofty <lb/>
            hill, from whence, on a plain below, a large body of men was <lb/>
            to be seen; he then led him to a spot between two hills, <lb/>
            and pointed out a still larger army on the level ground. <lb/>
            " Supported," he said, " by these numerous bands of my <lb/>
            Scottish subjects, I am prepared to give a good reception to <lb/>
            your brother, if he dares to cross over the Firth. I wish <lb/>
            he may attack us, that he may feel the points of our spears. <lb/>
            I am willing to confess that when King Edward gave me his <lb/>
            niece Margaret in marriage, he conferred on me the county <lb/>
            of Lothian.2 King William afterwards confirmed what his <lb/>
            predecessor had granted, and commended me to you as his <lb/>
            eldest son. The engagements made with you I am ready to <lb/>
            keep, but I promised nothing and I owe nothing to your <lb/>
            brother. ' No man,' as Christ says, ' can serve two <lb/>
            masters.'" Robert replied, "What you say is true; but <lb/>
            there have been changes in the state of affairs, and my <lb/>
            father's former arrangements have been much shaken. Now, <lb/>
            therefore, illustrious king, be persuaded by me; return with <lb/>
            me to my brother, and you will receive from him kindness and <lb/>
            many benefits ; he is a nearer neighbour to you, and more <lb/>
            powerful and rich than I am." The king of Scots trusted in <lb/>
            these promises, and having had several conferences with <lb/>
            William Rufus, made peace with him. Having disbanded <note type="footnote"> 1 The Saxon Chronicle associates Edgar Atheling in this mediation with <lb/>
            Malcolm, his brother-in-law, at whose court he had taken refuge when <lb/>
            William Rufus seized the domains in Normandy granted him by Robert <lb/>
            Curthose. The duke also at this time reconciled the king to Edgar. <lb/>
            Robert quitted England on the 23rd of December, in great dudgeon at his <lb/>
            brother's refusal to perform the conditions of their treaty. </note><note type="footnote"> Though the name of Lothian is now restricted to some fertile districts <lb/>
            in the south of Scotland, all the country between the Tweed and the Firth <lb/>
            of Forth was so called in early times. It was formerly held under the <lb/>
            crown of England, and formed during the Heptarchy part of the kingdom <lb/>
            of Northumbria. The union of this part of Scotland with England, as well <lb/>
            as its being held in fealty by the kings of Scots, commenced as early as the <lb/>
            reign of King Edgar (956—975). The Firth of Forth, mentioned in a <lb/>
            preceding note, was the proper boundary between the two kingdoms. The <lb/>

            Robert de Mowbray and his nephew Morel with some men- <lb/>
            at-arms, who lay in ambush for him, and murdered him.3 <lb/>
            The king of England and his great nobles hearing of this, <lb/>
            were deeply distressed, being ashamed that so foul and cruel <lb/>
            a deed should be done by Normans. An old crime was re­ <lb/>
            newed in modern times, for as Abner son of Ner, returning <lb/>
            in peace from David's house, was treacherously slain by Joash <lb/>
            and Abisha, so King Malcolm peaceably returning from the <lb/>

          <p>Margaret, the queen of Scotland, alarmed at the distress­ <lb/>

            David,4 entreated them to give them the honours due to the <lb/>
            king's sons. The council receiving her supplication with <lb/>
            great favour, she ordered great numbers of the poor to be <lb/>
            assembled, and distributed among them all her treasures, for <lb/>

            was still more eminent for her great worth and the sanctity <lb/>

            distributed her wealth to the poor, she entered a church <lb/>

            and afterwards I Comb-Kill, one of the Hebrides, was founded by St. <lb/>
            Columba towards the end of the sixth century. He began his mission <lb/>
            from Ireland, A.D. 565; Bcde's Eccl. Hist. Antiq. Lib. p. 113; Mr. Ste­ <lb/>
            phenson's calculations making it two years sooner. The island is very <lb/>
            small, being only two miles long by one wide, and containing, according to <lb/>
            the Saxon Chronicle, only five hides of land, enough to support five <lb/>
            families. The venerable ruins of the monastery still attract tourists. The <lb/>
            island of Iona was also called Sodorensis, a descriptive epithet borrowed <lb/>
            from the Scandinavian language (Sodor-inch, the southern island), which <lb/>
            was also applied to the whole group by its Norwegian conquerors, and <lb/>
            even the Isle of Man was comprised in it. In consequence the bishop, <lb/>
            who resided in the monastery of St. Columba, took the title of episcopus <lb/>
            Sodorensis, or more rarely, episcopus Manniæ et insularum. This bi­ <lb/>
            shopric, founded by the Norwegians, was suffragan to the metropolitan see <lb/>
            of Drontheim until, in 1260, Magnus IV. of Norway ceded these islands <lb/>

            usurped authority, opposed him with great cruelty, and at <lb/>

            of Henry, king of England, by a concubine.2 On his death <lb/>

          <p>David, the youngest of the three brothers, prudently <lb/>

            married the daughter of Earl Waltheof, and Judith the <lb/>

            that the priest fell dead, and his intestines were horribly <lb/>
            exposed before the altar. This ruffian was afterwards housed <lb/>
            by Earl David in England, for. the love of God, and, with <lb/>
            his little daughter, sufficiently supplied with food and clothes, <lb/>
            yet he cruelly tore with the iron fingers which he used <lb/>
            because he was maimed, the bowels of the young son of his <lb/>
            benefactor, only two years old, pretending to caress Him; <lb/>
            and thus, at the devil's instigation, suddenly scattered the <lb/>
            intestines on the lap of the nurse who was suckling the child. <lb/>
            Such was the end of the eldest of David's offspring. The <lb/>

          <p>THE great body of the Normans who, becoming rich in <lb/>

            filled with arrogance, were still urged onward by the incen­ <lb/>

            source of envy and grief that William Rufus was distinguished <lb/>
            for his courage and merit, and fearing no one, governed all <lb/>
            his subjects with a firm hand. In their insolence they <lb/>
            leagued together and formed a foul conspiracy against the <lb/>
            king, and disregarding the fealty which they had sworn to <lb/>
            their lord, fell into the disgraceful crime of treason.</p>
          <p>Robert, son of Roger de Mowbray,2 was distinguished for <lb/>
            his great power and wealth; his bold spirit and military <lb/>
            daring caused him to hold his fellow nobles in contempt, and <lb/>
            inflated with empty pride he disdained obedience to his. <lb/>

            strength, of a dark complexion and covered with hair, his <lb/>
            disposition bold and crafty, his features melancholy and harsh. <lb/>
            He reflected more than he talked, and scarcely ever smiled <lb/>
            when he was speaking. He possessed two hundred and <lb/>

            he bequeathed to his nephew Robert, earl of Northumberland.'</p>
          <p>In order to extend his territories, and that he might <lb/>
            strengthen himself by alliances with the most powerful of <lb/>
            his countrymen connected with him by ties of affinity, Robert <lb/>
            married a noble lady who was daughter of Richard do Laigle,2 <lb/>
            and niece of Hugh, earl of Chester, by his sister Judith. <lb/>
            He therefore took the lead among his fellow conspirators in <lb/>
            a fruitless project, and broke into open rebellion.</p>
          <p>Four large ships, called canards, sailed from Norway to <lb/>
            England, and failing into the hands of Robert and his nephew <lb/>
            Morel and their retainers, the peaceable merchants were <lb/>
            stripped with violence of all they possessed. Having lost <lb/>
            their goods, they went to court and in deep distress laid a <lb/>
            complaint of their injuries before the king. William imme­ <lb/>
            diately commanded the earl in positive terms to restore <lb/>
            to the merchants without delay all that he had abstracted <lb/>
            from them; but the order was treated with supreme COil­ <lb/>

            his own treasury.3 He then summoned Robert to answer in <lb/>
            his court, but he refused to attend.</p>
          <p>The king being satisfied of the perverse temper of this <lb/>
            fierce baron, collected troops and led a strong force against <lb/>
            him. When he approached the borders of Robert's territories, <lb/>

            pardoned the suppliant, and anxiously waited the fulfilment <lb/>

            murder the king, the troops passed the ambuscade without <lb/>
            molestation, and laid siege to the strong castle of Bamborough. <lb/>
            That fortress being impregnable, the marshes and waters and <lb/>
            other impediments to a march with which it is surrounded, <lb/>
            rendering it inaccessible, the king caused a new fortification to <lb/>
            be erected for the defence of the province and to shut in the <lb/>
            enemy, and placed a garrison in it well supplied with arms and <lb/>
            provisions. Those who were in the secret of the conspiracy and <lb/>
            their partisans, fearing detection, observed silence, and in great <lb/>
            alarm mingled with the royal troops and gladly entered the <lb/>

            officers and the other English nobles to urge forward theworks <lb/>
            of the new fortification in which their people were employed <lb/>
            with the utmost despatch; meanwhile Robert saw from his <lb/>
            battlements, in deep tribulation, the works which were being <lb/>

            king, after escaping the snare laid for him, took successively Newcastle <lb/>
            and Tynemouth, making prisoners the brothers and bravest supporters of <lb/>
            Robert de Mowbray, and then shut him up in Bamborough Castle, where <lb/>
            he took refuge, building a fort opposite to it to shelter the besieging army, <lb/>
            which he called Mal-Voisin. Having organized this system of blockade, <lb/>
            the king crossed the Humber to wait the result, Robert, imprudently <lb/>
            leaving his retreat, was pursued and obliged to throw himself into a <lb/>
            monastery, where he made a desperate resistance during six days. At last <lb/>
            he was wounded and taken prisoner. After Michaelmas the king, returning <lb/>

            to Windsor, where he was confined the rest of his life. These events took <lb/>
            place in the year 1025, and, notwithstanding their importance, did not <lb/>

          <p>Exulting in his triumph over the rebels, the king rewarded <lb/>
            his friends, brought the factious to justice, and on conviction <lb/>
            punished them in various ways. He entirely disinherited <lb/>
            Roger de Lacy,' expelled him from England, and gave his <lb/>
            inheritance to his brother who had faithfully kept his fealty. <lb/>

            So in many other cases, he punished the malcontents by <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1094,2 the rebellion in England <lb/>
            was suppressed, and the authority of William in his father's <lb/>
            kingdom was firmly established, with no one able to resist <lb/>
            it. But Normandy was miserably disturbed, and its inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants exposed to alarms and commotions in every quarter, <lb/>
            and Duke Robert, while insurrection was rife, was sunk in <lb/>
            despicable sloth. At this time 3 sharp hostilities took place <lb/>
            between William de Breteuil and Ascelin Goel, the origin of <lb/>
            which was as follows. William, Goël's brother, a young <lb/>
            knight, had insulted a female at Pacy; on her complaint <lb/>
            William de Breteuil, as became a just lord, gave an equitable <lb/>
            decision against the insolent young knight. Upon this <note type="footnote"> 1 William, second of the name, count d'Eu. The mutilation be suffered <lb/>

            Ascelin was incensed with his lord, because he had compelled <lb/>
            his brother to answer the charge in public. Not long <lb/>
            afterwards he seized the castle of Ivri by an ingenious <lb/>
            stratagem, and gave it to Robert duke of Normandy, from <lb/>
            whom William de Breteuil redeemed it for a large sum of <lb/>
            money. In consequence of this enterprise there was a <lb/>
            great feud between them, and each tried to injure the other.</p>
          <p>In the month of February,1 Ascelin called to his aid <lb/>
            Richard de Montfort and the retainers of King Philip, and <lb/>
            engaging in battle with William, his lord, who advanced <lb/>
            against him, defeated him and made him a captive, putting <lb/>
            his troops to flight with the loss of some who were taken <lb/>
            prisoners. Elated with this victory, he became exceedingly <lb/>
            arrogant, and cruelly tormented his lord and Roger de Glos <lb/>
            and his other captives. He kept them in close confinement <lb/>
            in his castle of Breval for three months, and often in the <lb/>
            severest weather, during winter, exposed them in their <lb/>
            shirts, well soaked in water, at a window in the highest <lb/>
            stage of the tower to the blasts of the north or south winds, <lb/>
            until their only covering was frozen into a sheet of ice round <lb/>
            their bodies. At length, by the interference of friends, <lb/>
            peace was concluded between them, and William was let out <lb/>
            of prison on these conditions ;-he gave his daughter Isabel <lb/>
            in marriage to Goel, and delivered to him three thousand <lb/>
            livres, with horses and arms and many other things, promis­ <lb/>
            ing also to surrender the castle of Ivri.2 On these terms <lb/>
            William was liberated; but the peace was of short duration.</p>
          <p>The year following,3 William, who could never rest, renewed <lb/>
            his hostilities, and established a fortified post with a garrison <lb/>
            in the convent of monks which Robert d'lvri had founded in <lb/>
            honour of the Virgin Mary.4 Upon this Goël who held the <lb/>
            castle led a body of troops to the convent, now alas! become <lb/>

            being excessive, in his sharp attack fire was thrown into the <lb/>
            inclosure, and the church and dwellings of the monks, with <lb/>
            their goods, became a prey to the destroying flames. On <lb/>
            this occasion William Alis,l and Arnold son of Popelin,2 and <lb/>
            eight other soldiers were taken prisoners, who being thrown <lb/>
            into Goël's dungeons, were a long time victims of his <lb/>
            cruelty. William de Breteuil made his escape with some <lb/>
            difficulty, and used every effort to revenge himself for his <lb/>
            great losses. , This powerful lord experienced the greatest <lb/>
            indignation that his own vassal should make such aggres­ <lb/>
            sions on his territories, and that his means were so much <lb/>
            augmented during three years by the ransoms of his captives <lb/>
            and the pillage of the country people. At length he engaged <lb/>
            to pay Philip, king of France, seven hundred livres, as well <lb/>
            as large sums of money to Robert duke of Normandy, and <lb/>
            many others, if they would faithfully succour him, and the <lb/>
            enemy's forces were subdued.</p>
          <p>In consequence, during Lent,3 the king of France and the <lb/>
            duke of Normandy laid siege to Breval, and assaulted it for <lb/>
            nearly two months. The priests, with their parishioners, <lb/>
            brought their banners, and the abbots assembling their vas­ <lb/>
            sals joined the besieging army.4 At the same time Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme furnished a most ingenious machine such as his <lb/>
            talent for engineering had invented at the siege of Jerusalem. <lb/>
            He caused engines to be built which were impelled on wheels <lb/>
            against the enemy's fortifications, he hurled vast stones as <lb/>
            projectiles into the besieged place and among the garrison, <lb/>
            instructed the besiegers in making assaults so as to destroy <lb/>
            the trenches and the palisades surrounding a fortress, and <lb/>
            to shatter the roofs of the houses upon the inhabitants, until <lb/>
            overwhelmed with calamities, the enemy, should be forced <lb/>
            to surrender.</p>

            Breteuil with his counsels and his forces, more than all his <lb/>
            fellows. Goël was a most desperate free-boater, daring and <lb/>
            crafty, and a violator of churches. He had noble and brave <lb/>
            kinsmen, by whose aid he had fortified the castle of Breval <lb/>
            in an uninhabited forest country, and with their courage and <lb/>
            succour he had manfully sustained the burden of such <lb/>
            frequent hostilities. But now finding that so many great <lb/>
            and valiant princes were firmly leagued against him, he sued <lb/>
            for peace with his lord, who was also his father-in-law. His <lb/>
            proposals were willingly acceded to by William de Breteuil, <lb/>
            and in consequence Goël restored to him the castle of Ivri, <lb/>
            which had so long been a cause of trouble to kings and <lb/>
            dukes.</p>
          <p>This is the famous castle, of great size and strongly forti­ <lb/>
            fied, which was built by Alberede wife of Ralph, count of <lb/>
            Bayeux,' and which Hugh, bishop of Bayeux,2 and brother <lb/>
            of John, archbishop of Rouen held for a long time against all <lb/>
            the efforts of the dukes of Normandy. It is said that Albe­ <lb/>
            rede, having completed this fortress with vast labour and <lb/>
            expense, caused Lanfred, whose character as an architect <lb/>
            transcended that of all the other French architects at <lb/>
            that time, and who after building the castle of Pithiviers3 <lb/>
            was appointed master of these works, to be beheaded, that <lb/>
            he might not erect a similar fortress any where else. She <lb/>
            also, in the end, was put to death by her husband on account <lb/>
            of this same castle of Ivri, having attempted to expel him <lb/>

          <p>Peace having been restored between these stubborn <lb/>
            combatants, much to the satisfaction of their neighbours, <lb/>
            Robert de Belèsme only felt himself deeply aggrieved <lb/>
            because he had not been invited to take part in the consult­ <lb/>
            ations, lest- he should create difficulties, although he had <lb/>
            taken the lead in the warlike preparations, in the hope that <lb/>
            his fierce and determined enemy might be subdued and <lb/>
            crushed. The skill and formidable power of Robert had <lb/>
            given him the pre-eminence among the besiegers, and he had <lb/>
            struck terror by his wonderful machines into the bold and <lb/>
            crafty freebooter, who till that time had been used to laugh <lb/>
            at kings and dukes in his secure retreat, and to mock the <lb/>
            enemies he baffled by all sorts of manoeuvres. This knight <lb/>
            finding concord restored among such discordant elements, <lb/>
            collected his forces without delay, and letting no one know <lb/>
            his crafty design, made a hasty countermarch, and fell <lb/>
            suddenly on Robert Giroie at St. Generic The garrison of <lb/>
            the castle, supposing that Robert was engaged with duke <lb/>
            Robert in the general expedition against Breval, had gone <lb/>
            forth from the place, and were scattered over the country in <lb/>
            false security, according as each man's fancy led him. But <lb/>
            when the wily master of stratagem suddenly appeared at the <lb/>
            head of his troops, hoping by a sudden assault to effect an <lb/>
            entrance into the castle and overpower those who were left <lb/>
            within, by God's intervention Circle was in time to meet <lb/>
            the attack, having thrown himself and his retainers with <lb/>
            great expedition into the place, so that Belèsme was greatly <lb/>
            mortified at being foiled in his expectation of taking it by <lb/>
            surprise. He then converted his enterprise into a predatory <lb/>
            excursion, killing one soldier, and doing much damage. <lb/>
            His mischievous and perfidious designs being thus discovered <lb/>
            open hostilities ensued. Giroie had auxiliary support from <note type="footnote"> I Mortalis mortalem in mortem impellit an alliteration such as the <lb/>

            lords, and ravaged the whole country about Alen9on for <lb/>
            three months. At that time Henry, son of William the <lb/>
            Great, king of England, possessed Domfront, and made war <lb/>
            on Robert de Belèsme, from whom he had wrested that <lb/>
            castle, as well as on the king and the duke, who had com­ <lb/>
            pelled him to become an exile from his native land.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of the month of July, Robert Giroie, <lb/>
            with Prince Henry's retainers and other troops, made an <lb/>
            irruption into Belèsme’s territories, and having swept off <lb/>
            much booty, pursued the enemy at the head of his forces; <lb/>
            but as be was conducting his allies towards their home, and, <lb/>
            absorbed in cheerful conversation with his friends and <lb/>
            acquaintance, accompanied them to some distance from St. <lb/>
            Céneri, a sudden report was spread there that he was killed. <lb/>
            Presently great lamentations and loud outcries were heard <lb/>
            in the castle, the garrison were struck with terror, and lost <lb/>
            their wits and powers of resistance. Paganus de Montdou­ <lb/>
            bleau,2 and Rotrou de Montfort,3 and some others who were <lb/>
            charged with its defence, abandoned the place ; and, favouring <lb/>
            Belèsme, as some say, left the castle without any one to <lb/>
            guard it, though no person molested them. Radegunde, <lb/>
            Giroie's wife, turned pale at the fearful rumour, but <lb/>
            determined, while waiting for their confirmation, to remain <lb/>
            in the castle with her attendants. What, however, could a <lb/>
            lone woman do against stubborn men determined to have <lb/>
            their own way. Meanwhile, Robert de Belèsme’s attention <lb/>
            was attracted by the disorderly shouts of those who were <lb/>
            leaving the place, and immediately coming up and finding it <lb/>
            deserted by its defenders, he easily forced an entrance, and, <lb/>
            giving it up to pillage, then set fire to it. The assailants <lb/>
            found within pots full of meat boiling on the fires, and the <lb/>
            tables covered with cloths, and spread with dishes of food. <note type="footnote"> I Sillé-le-Guillaume, at equal distances between Alençon and Mayenne, <lb/>

            Some monks of Seéz removed the arm of St. Céneri from <lb/>
            the church, and reverently translated it to their abbey of St. <lb/>
            Martin. The rest of this saint's relics are preserved at <lb/>
            Château Thierri, on the river Marne, and are venerated by <lb/>
            the French with great devotion.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Giroie had parted from his friends in high <lb/>
            spirits, and was engaged in meditating, alas ! in vain, on fresh <lb/>
            inroads on his enemy's territories, when, as no human power is <lb/>
            durable, he was suddenly shocked by the melancholy tidings <lb/>
            he received. The noble knight had lost his inheritance by a <lb/>
            sudden mischance, and was now compelled to seek an asylum <lb/>
            among strangers. His wife, Radegunde, a prudent and <lb/>
            excellent woman, died the same year, and their son William, <lb/>
            a child, soon followed his mother to the grave. The boy <lb/>
            was retained as a hostage by Robert de Belèsme, who, it is <lb/>
            reported, caused him to be poisoned by Robert de Poillé.1</p>
          <p>Overwhelmed by so many calamities, Giroie took refuge <lb/>
            with his friends, and receiving comfort and aid from his <lb/>
            kinsmen and associates, hope for the future sprung up in his <lb/>
            mind. The year following he fortified a castle at Montagu,2 <lb/>
            and took fierce revenge on Robert de Belèsme, who, in great <lb/>
            fury, hastened to the duke, and prevailed with him by his <lb/>
            complaints and promises to invest the castle of Montagu <lb/>
            with the forces of Normandy. Then Geoffrey of Mayenne, <lb/>
            and other nobles of Maine, presented themselves to the duke, <lb/>
            and with smooth words interceded on Giroie's behalf. <lb/>
            They succeeded in obtaining from him the terms, that on <lb/>
            his demolishing the castle he had lately erected, his whole <lb/>
            inheritance should be restored to him in peace: which was <lb/>
            done accordingly.</p>
          <p>As the weather becoming fair, after violent storms, fills <lb/>
            men with joy, so divine justice chastises the guilty, while <lb/>
            mercy and loving kindness comforts the afflicted, sanctifies <lb/>
            the penitent, and rewards them when cleansed from their <lb/>
            sins.</p>
          <p>Taught by his severe misfortunes, Giroie returned thanks to <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably Poillé in La Flèche. The name of Eudes de Poillé appears <lb/>

            God, by whose aid after many trials he had recovered bis <lb/>
            ancient lordship ; he lived nearly thirty years afterwards <lb/>
            through many changes of fortune, good and bad. He <lb/>
            married Felicia, daughter of Warner de Connéri,1 who bore <lb/>
            him three sons, and as many daughters; William, Robert, <lb/>
            and Matthew ; Agatha, Damata, and Aveline.</p>
          <p>The count de Belèsme urged forward the demolition of <lb/>
            the new castle, with all his influence, employing the peasants <lb/>
            from all his own lordships and the neighbourhood in the <lb/>
            compulsory duty 2 of working at its destruction. The <lb/>
            vassals of St. Evreux took no part in this labour, because <lb/>
            they owed no service to the count, upon which he was greatly <lb/>
            incensed with the monks, and did them great injuries for a <lb/>
            whole year. He compelled by violence the tenants of St. <lb/>
            Evroult to work at the fortifications of his own castles, <lb/>
            carrying off the goods of those who shrunk from the labour; <lb/>
            and he even threatened to lay the abbey in ruins, unless they <lb/>
            submitted to his will in all things as their lord. His fury at <lb/>
            last grew to such a pitch, that he insolently ravaged all the <lb/>
            domains belonging to the church in his neighbourhood. <lb/>
            This so much impoverished the monks, that abbot Robert <lb/>
            was compelled to implore assistance in England from King <lb/>
            William, for the support of the poor brothers who were <lb/>
            deprived of their necessary food by the tyrant's ravages. <lb/>
            His hand was also cruelly heavy on other households of God <lb/>
            who lived under him or in his neighbourhood, and he often <lb/>
            destroyed them by inflicting losses and ill treatment on them <lb/>
            without mercy. This is witnessed by the monks of Séez, <lb/>
            Troarne, and Mans, who by his cruelties and exactions were <lb/>
            frequently made to tremble with anger and grief.</p>
          <p>Robert de Belèsme also grievously oppressed the bishop­ <lb/>
            ric of Séez against all right and justice, asserting that it <lb/>
            was granted by Duke Richard to his grandfather William de <lb/>
            Belèsme, on pretence of which he subjected its ecclesiastical <note type="footnote"> I A bourg in the department of the Sarthe. It appears that its present <lb/>
            lord was not called Warner, but Avesguard de Connére. There is a <lb/>

            in which he mentions his wife Brille, and his daughter Felicia and Robert <lb/>

            possesions to many vexatious claims and much loss. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the venerable bishop Serlo excommunicated the <lb/>
            count, and laid all his territories under an interdict, forbid­ <lb/>
            ing the offices of holy worship to be performed, or even the <lb/>
            burial of the dead. However, Robert, who for his cruelty <lb/>
            was justly surnamed Talvas,1 hardening his heart like Pharaoh, <lb/>
            was softened neither by the bishop's stripes or emollients, <lb/>
            but went on daily adding to the number of his iniquities. <lb/>
            Like Ishmael, he let loose his armed bands against all his <lb/>
            neighbours, kept the monks and clergy and unarmed people <lb/>
            in constant terror by his cruel tyranny, and miserably <lb/>
            persecuted them by his frequent ravages and insults. In <lb/>
            such times as those, the severest censure of the church could <lb/>
            have no effect on a man who plumed himself on his secular <lb/>
            power, and whose savage and infamous conduct rendered him <lb/>
            insupportable to his associates, friends, and vassals. He <lb/>
            thought little of depriving men of their sight, or mutilating <lb/>
            them by amputating their hands or feet, but his great <lb/>
            delight was, like Phalaris the Sicilian, to invent new and <lb/>
            unheard-of modes of torturing his wretched victims. Those <lb/>
            who were thrown into his dungeons on any charge he exposed <lb/>
            to unutterable torments more cruel than Nero, Decius, or <lb/>
            Diocletian, making their sufferings the subject of jest and <lb/>
            laughter with his parasites.2 He gloried in the pain <lb/>
            he inflicted on his prisoners, and was well pleased to be <lb/>
            accused of barbarity for the excessive rigour of his punish- <lb/>
            merits, preferring the pleasure of so doing, to the increase <lb/>
            of his treasures by permitting the ransom of his captives. <lb/>
            Many, by God's help, escaped from his dungeons and after­ <lb/>
            wards took severe revenge for their sufferings, from whom, if <lb/>
            he had been accessible to reason and touched with humanity, <lb/>
            he might have received large sums and honourable services. <lb/>
            The terror of multitudes, he was himself afraid of them, and <lb/>
            he had suspicions of so many persons that his days and <lb/>
            nights were passed in alarms, and he could hardly believe that <lb/>
            any one was faithful to him. He was, indeed a brave and <note type="footnote"> 1 This name was given to an ancestor of Robert's on account of a <lb/>

            daring soldier, and was distinguished for his genius and <lb/>
            eloquence as well as his courage, but he spoilt all by his <lb/>
            excessive ambition and cruelty, and clouded the gifts which <lb/>
            God had bestowed on him with the blackest crimes. His <lb/>
            insolence and covetousness involved him in frequent wars with <lb/>
            his neighbours, but he was often defeated and escaped with <lb/>
            loss and disgrace. This is well known by the inhabitants of <lb/>
            the Corbonnois and Maine, by his Norman neighbours, and <lb/>
            nearest of all by the people of Exmes, who remained the <lb/>
            victors when the tyrant fled. This was happily experienced <lb/>
            by Geoffrey, earl of Morton, and his son Rotro, as well as by <lb/>
            Elias of Maine, and other neighbouring lords, against whom <lb/>
            he was always engaged in destructive hostilities, but at whose <lb/>
            hands, by God's help, he suffered worse in return. He <lb/>
            possessed thirty-four strongly fortified castles, and he had <lb/>
            many thousand men under his dominion, yet Hugh de <lb/>
            Nonant,1 his neighbour, the poor master of a small castle, <lb/>
            resisted him many years, and frequently caused him great <lb/>
            losses and injuries.</p>
          <p>Robert de Belesme had married Agnes, daughter of Guy, <lb/>
            count de Ponthieu, by whom he had William Talvas the <lb/>
            heir of all his domains. The cruel husband did not respect <lb/>
            his noble wife as he should have done on account of this <lb/>
            precious child; on the contrary, he overwhelmed her with <lb/>
            afflictions as if she had been a despicable mistress; and even <lb/>
            confined her a long time like a thief, in the castle of Belèsme. <lb/>
            At length she secretly effected her escape from her prison, <lb/>
            by the aid and contrivance of a faithful chamberlain, and fled <lb/>
            to Adela countess of Chartres,2 and from thence sought refuge <lb/>
            in Ponthieu, never to return to her tyrant.</p>
          <p>Normandy was often afflicted by the cruel enterprises of <lb/>
            this butcher, and Maine, with its immediate neighbourhood, <lb/>
            was a prey to the pillage, fire, and slaughter, which accom­ <lb/>
            panied his movements. The bishops and monks, on whose <lb/>
            lands he erected castles, cried to the Lord of Sabaoth, when <lb/>
            they saw the possessions of the saints diminished and wasted <lb/>

            two eldest brothers having, as I have said, divided the whole, <lb/>
            as well on this side of the sea as the other. However, Roger <lb/>

            knights and men of worth, by their father's advice, married <lb/>

            was always true to his fealty to his lords the dukes of <lb/>

            when his military career was ended, in the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Pierre-de-Preaux. That house was founded by his father, <lb/>
            Humphrey do Vieilles, on his own domains,4 and he had <lb/>
            enriched it after his father's death with large possessions <lb/>

            Arnulph married the daughter of a king of Ireland. See the note, vol. ii. p. <lb/>
            203, as to the titles and possessions of these young lords. The forfeiture was <lb/>

            and Roger himself, his brother, who was advanced in years, <lb/>
            made a good end in that monastery, some years after his <lb/>
            profession as a monk. He left his sons, Robert and Henry, <lb/>
            the appointed heirs of his domains, who by the grace of God <lb/>
            have become very eminent in the present age. Distinguished <lb/>
            by the friendship and intimacy of kings and powerful earls, <lb/>
            they married noble and fruitful wives, and, surrounded by <lb/>
            promising children of both sexes, they were loaded with <lb/>
            riches and honours. Robert became earl of Mellent in the <lb/>
            Vexin, as heir to Hugh, his mother Adeline's brother, and <lb/>
            in England fortunately received from King Henry a grant <lb/>
            of the earldom of Leicester with many other rich favours.1 <lb/>
            His brother Henry earned the earldom of Warwick by his <lb/>
            valour and loyalty,2 and obtained for wife the beautiful <lb/>
            Margaret, daughter of Geoffrey, earl of Morton, whose <lb/>
            character for piety and excellence is well known through <lb/>
            all the neighbouring countries, and ranks her among the <lb/>
            most eminent women. She bore her husband two sons, <lb/>
            Roger, and Robert de Neubourg who became illustrious in <lb/>
            England and Normandy during the reign of King Henry. <lb/>
            These earls had naturally a great regard for the abbey of <lb/>
            Préaux, which their ancestors had founded on an admirable <lb/>
            situation near a sea-port,3 and not far from Pont-Audemer, <lb/>
            where the Risle flows in a rapid current towards the sea.4 <lb/>
            Monks were assembled there for the praise and worship of <lb/>
            Almighty God, and piously instructed by wise and religious <lb/>

            Bec in 1090 by his brother Gilbert. It is probable that Robert de Beau­ <lb/>

            to those who read it who was the first abbot of Préaux, and <lb/>
            how he was distinguished: " Under this tomb rests Abbot <lb/>
            Ansfrid, a good and pious man, a dove without spot. He <lb/>
            zealously fulfilled the demands of the divine law, which was <lb/>
            his rule and study. He was the support of the weak, the <lb/>
            adviser of the doubtful, feet to the lame, eyes to the blind, <lb/>
            and the pilgrim's staff. The sun had blazed thirty days in <lb/>
            the constellation of Pisces, when Abbot Ansfrid departed. <lb/>
            God give him rest!”1</p>
          <p>Richard de Fourneaux 2 governed this monastery in. later <lb/>
            times,3 he was admitted to the profession of a monk in the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Vigor at Bayeux by Robert de Tombelene. <lb/>
            But bishop Odo, who founded the new monastery, becoming <lb/>
            a sorrowful prisoner in the dungeon of King William, and <lb/>
            Robert the Philosopher being returned to the abbey at <lb/>

            1094, though some of them occurred in his own neighbourhood. </note><note type="footnote"> In the beginning of the year, Robert sent envoys to England to inform <lb/>
            his brother that, chagrined by his refusal to execute the treaty they had <lb/>
            agreed on, he should recommence hostilities. William went to Hastings <lb/>
            on the 1st of February to attend the consecration of Battle Abbey, and <lb/>
            crossed the channel in the middle of Lent. The barons who had sworn to <lb/>
            the treaty offended William, who retired in dudgeon to Eu, while Robert <lb/>
            returned to Rouen. The king, by largesses and promises, assembled a <lb/>
            large body of troops, and renewed his understanding with some of the <lb/>
            Norman lords. He then took by assault the castle of Bures, treating the <lb/>
            garrison with great severity. In short, he left no stone unturned to drive <lb/>
            his brother to extremity. Meanwhile Robert demanded aid from King <lb/>
            Philip, who took the town of Argentan from William's partizans, and <lb/>
            made a number of prisoners, while Robert reduced the strong castle of <lb/>
            Homme in the Cotentin, where William Peverell commanded a garrison <lb/>
            of eight hundred troops. This fortress did not belong to William, but to <lb/>
            his brother Prince Henry, with whom he was then on terms of amity. <lb/>
            The gold of the king of England, scattered freely, put an end to this <lb/>
            prosperous career of his enemies, and induced the king of France to retire <lb/>
            suddenly to his own dominions. It is very singular that the siege of <lb/>
            Argentan should pass without notice by an historian who lived within ten <lb/>

            one of them, who was very learned in sacred literature, when <lb/>
            the young flock was scattered, sought out a company of <lb/>

            of God, by whom Richard was highly enlightened and <lb/>
            enriched with the fulness of sound doctrine. On the death <lb/>
            of Abbot Geoffrey,3 Richard was elected to succeed him at <lb/>
            Préaux and, having governed the convent nearly twenty- <lb/>
            four years in the times of Duke Robert and King Henry, <lb/>
            then died. He was deeply read in the holy scriptures, from <lb/>
            his youth he walked in the way of the ancient fathers <lb/>
            chanting psalms, he kindly broke the mystical bread in the <lb/>
            house of the Lord to the hungry children, and distributed it <lb/>
            with joy freely to those who stretched out their hands, and <lb/>
            used authority to make those partake of it who refused or <lb/>
            were careless. He dedicated a Commentary on Genesis to <lb/>
            Maurice the learned abbot of bt. Lomer at Blois, and wrote <lb/>
            another for Master4 Adelelm, a very learned priest, who was <lb/>
            also a monk of St. Germer, and grew old devoutly serving <lb/>
            the Holy Trinity with the monks of Fécamp. He wrote an <lb/>
            excellent exposition on the Parables:; of Solomon for Pontius, <lb/>
            the illustrious abbot of Cluni, and lucidly commented on <lb/>
            Ecclesiastes, the Canticles, and Deuteronomy, for other <lb/>

          <p>Nicholas, priest and abbot of the monastery dedicated to <lb/>
            the holy bishop St. Ouen, was third son of Richard III., <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, and distinguished for great benevolence, <lb/>
            charity, and other virtues; his eminence in the church of <lb/>
            God continuing till four years after the death of his cousin <lb/>
            King William. Compelled by his uncle, Duke Robert, to <lb/>
            embrace the monastic life, he made his profession when yet <lb/>
            a boy in the abbey of Fécamp under Abbot John. Some <lb/>
            years afterwards, while still young, he was advanced by <lb/>
            Duke William to the government of the same abbey. Peing <lb/>
            raised to this eminence, be strove rather to be the benefactor <lb/>
            than the superior of those who were under his rule both <lb/>
            within and without the convent. Having undertaken a <lb/>
            pilgrimage to Jerusalem and prayed at the sepulchre of our <lb/>
            Lord, on his return, he died in the fifty-sixth year1 of his <lb/>

            February] and being interred in the church of St. Peter the <lb/>

            Mary, mother of God,2 there waits the better life of the <lb/>
            resurrection. There is erected over his grave a beautiful <lb/>
            tomb of painted wood, at the top of which Maurice the monk <lb/>
            elegantly inscribed the following epitaph in letters of gold :—</p>
          <p>" Nicholas, the flower and glory of monks, beloved and <lb/>
            lamented, whose remains are here deposited, lives with the <lb/>

            government of the abbey of St. Ouen nearly twenty years.3 <lb/>

            to the convent; for he undertook the charge of the works in <lb/>
            the church, which on account of its vast scale of grandeur <lb/>
            had been for some time suspended.1 He made large dona­ <lb/>
            tions to it from the fortune of Alberede la Grosse, in whose <lb/>
            service he was, who having died on the holy pilgrimage <lb/>
            bequeathed her wealth to him. With this and the aid of <lb/>
            other pious and charitable gifts, he laboured towards the <lb/>
            completion of the noble work. Abbot Helgot died on the <lb/>
            twelfth of the calends of December [20th of November], and <lb/>
            having been interred before the altar of St. Stephen the <lb/>
            protomartyr which stands in the vestibule on the north side, <lb/>
            William Balot,2 who had been a monk of the same convent <lb/>
            from his childhood, succeeded him in the government and <lb/>
            held it for nearly fourteen years. In his time the great <lb/>
            church, of which Abbot Nicholas had laid the foundation, <lb/>
            was at length, after great difficulty, completed at the end of <lb/>
            seventy years, and consecrated by Archbishop Geoffrey, <lb/>
            with many others of the prelates and inferior clergy on the <lb/>
            sixteenth of the calends of November [17th October].3</p>
          <p>The same year Abbot William died, and Ragenfrid, a <lb/>
            monk of the same house, succeeded him,4 in whose time the <lb/>
            cloisters and other buildings for the use of the monks were <lb/>
            completed with great magnificence. At the same period <lb/>
            Fulbert, archdeacon and dean of Rouen, fell sick, and <note type="footnote"> 1 It is very possible that part of the church now standing was the work <lb/>
            of Gilbert. It is true that the abbey was destroyed by fire in 1136, but <lb/>
            it can scarcely be supposed that it was entirely laid in ruins, and the <lb/>
            existing portions of the church appear to present rather the character of <lb/>
            the eleventh century than that of an advanced period of the twelfth. The <lb/>
            north chapel, in the vestibule which led to the cloisters, alluded to a few <lb/>

          <p>THE happy decease of the fathers who depart in Christ <lb/>
            fills their loving children on earth with sorrow; for notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the undoubting belief that they are exalted to the <lb/>
            heavenly kingdom, their removal is affectionately lamented <lb/>
            from apprehensions of the excessive desolation of those who <lb/>
            are left exiles here below. But the divine mercy often <lb/>
            visits the church, consoling it by the invisible influences of <lb/>
            God's loving kindness, and sending it courageous champions, <lb/>
            daily strengthens it for the conflict. Thus the prophet says, <lb/>
            " Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children.”1 When <lb/>
            the apostles were translated to heaven, they were succeeded <lb/>
            by apostolical doctors, who were eminent for their acts and <lb/>
            words in the courts of Jerusalem, and still offer to God the <lb/>
            acceptable fruits of their labours. Iniquity abounding in <lb/>
            the world, the devotions of the faithful in religion still more <lb/>
            increased, and the harvest was multiplied in the field of the <lb/>
            Lord. Monasteries were built everywhere in the woods <lb/>
            and the fields, and tribes of cowled monks, with new rites <lb/>
            and clad in vestments of various fashions, traverse the world. <lb/>
            Their dress is generally white, to distinguish themselves <note type="footnote"> 1 Psalm xliv. 17. </note> <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VIII. CH.XXVI. </note> <lb/>
            from other men and make themselves remarkable. Black <lb/>
            denotes humility in several places of the Holy Scriptures; <lb/>
            and therefore the religious in their zeal have hitherto joy­ <lb/>
            fully adopted that colour. But now black, which the old <lb/>
            fathers used as a token of their humility, the regular clergy <lb/>
            in their copes, and the monks in their cowls, is rejected by <lb/>
            the moderns, in ostentation of greater righteousness, aud <lb/>
            they try to distinguish themselves from others by the <lb/>
            peculiar cut of their garments.' I believe that voluntary <lb/>
            poverty, contempt of the world, and true religion inspire <lb/>
            the greater part of them, but many hypocrites and seducing <lb/>
            pretenders are mingled with them, as tares among the <lb/>
            wheat. Paganus, a canon of Chartres, surnamed Bolotinus, <lb/>
            has lately published a fine poem in Adonic verse,2 in which <lb/>
            he has cleverly and fully exhibited their superstitions veiled <lb/>
            with hypocrisy. I propose myself to unfold in the present <lb/>
            history how and by whom the changes in the ancient fashion <lb/>
            began lately to spread, because I think that these details <lb/>
            may be acceptable to my readers in future times.</p>
          <p>There is a place in Burgundy, called Molême,3 of which <lb/>
            Reynold, bishop of Langres4 said: " The love of Molême <lb/>
            almost conferred the grace of baptism.”3</p>
          <p>In the time'of Philip, king of France, the venerable abbot <lb/>
            Robert built a monastery there,6 and inspired by the grace <lb/>
            of the Holy Spirit, assembled disciples of devoted piety, <lb/>
            and instructed them with kindness in the pursuit of virtue <lb/>
            in a state of holy poverty, according to the usage of other <lb/>
            religious houses. After some years he studied carefully the <lb/>
            rule of St. Benedict, and having also examined the writings <lb/>
            of other holy fathers, he assembled the brethren, and thus <lb/>
            addressed them, " My dear brethren, we have made our <lb/>
            profession according to the rule of St. Benedict, but it <lb/>
            appears to me that we do not observe it in its integrity. <lb/>
            We follow many practices which are not found there, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ordericus himself, as a Benedictine monk, wore the black habit of <lb/>
            that order. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This poem is lost. Query, read Belotinus, or Balotenus 9 </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Molême, near Châtillon. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Reynold, of the family of the counts of Bar-sur-Seine and Tonnerre, <lb/>

             <pb n="41"/>
            we negligently omit many which it has enjoined. We do <lb/>
            not labour with our hands as we read that the holy fathers <lb/>
            did. If you do not believe what I say, my friends, read the <lb/>
            acts of St. Anthony, Macarius, Pacomius, and, above all, <lb/>
            of the doctor of the Gentiles, Paul the apostle. We are <lb/>
            supplied with an abundant maintenance in food and clothing <lb/>
            from the tithes and oblations of the churches, and, either <lb/>
            by address or violence, we appropriate what belongs to the <lb/>
            priests. I therefore should wish that we keep the entire <lb/>
            rule of St. Benedict, being careful to deviate from it neither <lb/>
            to the right hand or the left. Let us procure what is <lb/>
            necessary for food and raiment by the labour of our hands. <lb/>
            Let us give up the use of coverings for the thighs, and <lb/>
            linen and furs, and relinquish tithes and oblations to the <lb/>
            clergy who serve the parishes. Thus, treading in the steps <lb/>
            of the fathers, we shall labour with zeal to follow <lb/>
            Christ."</p>
          <p>The convent of monks did not agree to these proposals ; <lb/>
            they objected to innovations which would alter their usages, <lb/>
            the examples and precepts of their predecessors, whose lives <lb/>
            were rendered illustrious by evident miracles, and who trod <lb/>
            in the footsteps of venerable men. They said: " We have <lb/>
            long followed the way of life, in which the holy fathers <lb/>
            formerly lived religiously in France, whose sanctity was <lb/>
            testified to be well pleasing to God, by miracles both during <lb/>
            their lives and after their interment. As to your rebuke, <lb/>
            venerable father, because we have departed from the rigour <lb/>
            of the monastic rule, and do not walk in the rough path of <lb/>
            the Egyptian monks who dwelt in the Thebaid and the Holy <lb/>
            Land, among barbarous nations in ancient times, reflect care­ <lb/>
            fully on the sufficient reason.</p>
          <p>" No doctor can justly require the faithful to endure in <lb/>
            times of tranquillity, all the sufferings which the holy martyrs <lb/>
            were compelled to undergo in the heathen persecutions, <lb/>
            since they themselves did not voluntarily submit before <lb/>
            those persecutions to the same suffering which afterwards <lb/>
            they necessarily endured when contending for their faith. <lb/>
            This was plainly intimated by our Lord to St. Peter, <lb/>
            ‘ When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself and walkedst <lb/>
            whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou <lb/>
            shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, <lb/>
            her <lb/>
            ;ic <lb/>
            m( <pb n="42"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.VIII. CH.XXVI. <lb/>
            </note>and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.”1 Consider well, <lb/>
            according to the precepts of the divine law with what <lb/>
            discretion you ought to direct those in the way of God, <lb/>
            who have voluntarily quitted the depraved world, and desire <lb/>
            to lead a better life under your government. With what <lb/>
            reason can it be approved that those who of their own free <lb/>
            will are seeking to change their evil courses for good, should <lb/>
            be driven to the dens of Paul or Anthony. To escape from <lb/>
            being put to death, and in terror even of their own relations, <lb/>
            these hermits fled from their parental homes. A prudent <lb/>
            physician gives his patient soothing prescriptions, for fear that <lb/>
            if he should torment him in his weakness with severe <lb/>
            medicines, instead of being cured, he should escape altogether <lb/>
            out of his hands. No considerate persons will lay an <lb/>
            insupportable burden on weak shoulders, lest the weary <lb/>
            bearer, sinking under his load, perish in the way."</p>
          <p>The monks making this open resistance, Abbot Robert <lb/>
            said to them; " I mention the inimitable life of the <lb/>
            Egyptian hermits as an example of excellence, but I do not <lb/>
            thence impose on you any violent exactions ; I only propose <lb/>
            it in the way of salutary persuasion. But I invite you to <lb/>
            observe the rule of St. Benedict in all its parts, which I <lb/>
            know you to transgress in many things, notwithstanding <lb/>
            you profess it. I therefore dread lest the wrath of the <lb/>
            supreme Judge should be let loose upon us in the last <lb/>
            judgment for our short comings."</p>
          <p>To this, the monks replied, " Our blessed father Benedict, <lb/>
            as is known to all, sent into France St. Maur, the prior of <lb/>
            his -monastery, whom he had educated from childhood, and <lb/>
            gave him the book of discipline which the servant of God <lb/>
            had written with his own hand, and he granted to the French <lb/>
            monks through him a pound of bread and half a pint of <lb/>
            wine. St. Maur meeting with a kind reception from King <lb/>
            Theodebert, spent the rest of his life in France, and, by the <lb/>
            aid of Florus, a counsellor of the king's, built a monastery <lb/>
            at a place called Glanfeuil,2 where he instructed one hundred <lb/>
            and forty monks in the rules of his order. The discreet <note type="footnote"> I John xxi. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 St. Maur arrived at Glanfeuil in 543. It is not clear how Anjou <lb/>
            could have belonged to Theodebert, king of Austrasia, but the fact seems <lb/>
            certain from the testimony of a contemporary biographer. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            father St. Maur did not imitate the usages of the monks in <lb/>
            Egypt, who are exposed to the excessive heat of the climate, <lb/>
            but kindly took into consideration the habits of the French, in­ <lb/>
            habitants of the west, who often shudder in the frosts of winter. <lb/>
            And so he was instructed by his spiritual master; for thus <lb/>
            saith St. Benedict:—‘ Let the garments given to the monks <lb/>
            be suitable to the nature of the place they inhabit, and the <lb/>
            temperature of the air. Those who live in cold climates <lb/>
            require more, those in warm climates less. This is left to the <lb/>
            abbot's discretion.' So also he makes prudent and con­ <lb/>
            siderate regulations respecting food and drink, and other <lb/>
            human wants, that all may be done according to measure, <lb/>
            with due regard to the weak, and without murmurings. <lb/>
            He also expressly admonishes the abbot to make allowance <lb/>
            for infirmities ; he ordains that such work or employment <lb/>
            should be enjoined on the weak and delicate, that they shall <lb/>
            neither be idle, nor worn and overdone by excessive labour. <lb/>
            Paul and Anthony, and many others, who first retired into <lb/>
            the desert, and built themselves monasteries in the recesses <lb/>
            of the wilderness, driven to it by fear of the heathen, as <lb/>
            we said before, chose an extremely rigorous course of life, <lb/>
            and, assisted by God's grace, converted the necessity into <lb/>
            an act of free will. Afterwards their laudable example <lb/>
            increased the number of those who renounced the world, <lb/>
            and founded various institutions according to the difference <lb/>
            in places and men's habits. But, says St. Gregory, where <lb/>
            the faith is one, diversity of customs in the holy church <lb/>
            matters not. Men in general, where the climate is warm, <lb/>
            wear no trowsers, but, like women, wear loose robes which <lb/>
            reach to the ankles. The convents of monks which rose <lb/>
            and became established in those countries do not reject this <lb/>
            habit, but on the contrary adopt it. But in the climate of <lb/>
            the west, all men wear trowsers, and they cannot be dispensed <lb/>
            with, neither on account of the cold nor for decency's sake. <lb/>
            For these reasons that is the custom in our order, nor can <lb/>
            we consent, as it is becoming and serviceable, to depart from <lb/>
            it. So of all the rest, learned doctors, our predecessors in <lb/>
            this holy discipline, have supplied us with good reasons for <lb/>
            their observance. In Italy and Palestine, and some other <lb/>
            countries, olive trees abound, and men making use of the <lb/>
            fruit are not obliged to have recourse to fat in cooking their <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.VIII. CH.XXVI. </note> <lb/>
            food, which is here considerately allowed to us, who have no <lb/>
            oil of olives.</p>
          <p>" Further, it is made a subject of severe rebuke by many <lb/>
            persons that we are not daily employed in working with our <lb/>
            hands; but we boldly set against this our devoted labour in <lb/>
            the offices of divine worship, which we were taught on our <lb/>
            profession by duly authorized masters, experienced in the <lb/>
            daily services of our holy religion. The kings, Dagobert and <lb/>
            Theodoric, and the emperor Charlemagne, and other kings <lb/>
            and emperors, in their devotion, founded monasteries, and <lb/>
            made ample provision from their revenues for the food and <lb/>
            raiment of the servants of God; attaching to these institu­ <lb/>
            tions a sufficient number of servants for the full performance <lb/>
            of exterior offices, while they assigned to the monks the <lb/>
            duty of being entirely devoted to reading, to prayers for <lb/>
            their benefactors and the celebration of the divine mysteries. <lb/>
            In consequence, the practice is in France, both from the <lb/>
            foundations of the kings and long custom, that the peasants <lb/>
            should carry on the works of husbandry, as it is their <lb/>
            business to do, and servants perform all ministerial offices, <lb/>
            while the monks, who have voluntarily withdrawn from the <lb/>
            vanities of the world, should serve as militants the King of <lb/>
            kings, shut themselves up in their cloisters, free from intru­ <lb/>
            sion, like king's daughters, penetrate the mysteries of the <lb/>
            divine word by diligently reading it, and making it the <lb/>
            subject of their constant meditations, observe a profitable <lb/>
            silence, closing their mouths against a depraved and idle con­ <lb/>
            versation but chanting day and night the Psalms of David <lb/>
            and other mystical songs to the Creator's praise; and be daily <lb/>
            engaged, according to the precepts of the fathers, in other <lb/>
            decent and fitting employments, as circumstances require. <lb/>
            Hitherto such are the labours of the monks in the west, and <lb/>
            every one sees and knows that such ought to be the nature <lb/>
            of their occupations. God forbid that the peasants, whose <lb/>
            proper lot is daily toil, should abandon themselves to sloth, <lb/>
            and with lascivious indolence spend their time in laughter and <lb/>
            idle merriment; on the other hand, far be it from illustrious <lb/>
            knights, acute philosophers, and accomplished scholars, <lb/>
            because they have renounced the world, to be bound to <lb/>
            occupy themselves in servile and unbeseeming pursuits and <lb/>
            occupations, like vile slaves. The tithes and oblations of the <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            faithful are by common consent appropriated to the clergy <lb/>
            and ministers of God for their own sustenance, as St. Paul, <lb/>
            the apostle said to the Corinthians: ' They which minister <lb/>
            about holy things live of the things of the temple, and they <lb/>
            which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar.’1 So <lb/>
            the Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel <lb/>
            should live by the gospel. As for us, we belong to the <lb/>
            clergy by our order and office, and we offer service, as <lb/>
            ministers, to the great High-priest, who has entered into the <lb/>
            heavens, that we may obtain the lot of our heavenly inhe­ <lb/>
            ritance, through his mediation. We therefore have a right <lb/>
            to hold ecclesiastical benefices, and by common agreement, <lb/>
            we are determined to retain them. It is perfectly well <lb/>
            known to your holiness, reverend father, that we have learnt to <lb/>
            preserve these rules from former monks who lived religiously, <lb/>
            and we possess them as heirs to their order and profession. <lb/>
            As long as we find the monks of Cluni and Tours, and the <lb/>
            other clergy maintaining, these institutions we shall not <lb/>
            depart from them; for we are unwilling to be condemned <lb/>
            by our brethen, far and wide, as reckless innovators and <lb/>
            inventors of novel practices."</p>
          <p>The monks constantly repeating these declarations and <lb/>
            others of the same description, the abbot, persisting in his <lb/>
            opinion, withdrew from them with twelve:: of the number <lb/>
            who agreed with him, and was a long time before he could <lb/>
            find a suitable place for himself and his companions where <lb/>
            they might observe the rule of St. Benedict to the letter, as <lb/>
            the Jews kept the law of Moses. At last, Eudes, duke of <lb/>
            Burgundy, son of Henry, took pity on them, and gave them <lb/>
            an estate called Cisterce in the diocese of Châlons.3 Abbot <lb/>
            Robert and his select brethren, dwelt for some time in this <lb/>
            desert, and beginning to build a monastery in which they <lb/>
            might live a religious life under the strictest rule, found, by <lb/>

            and aid. The pope, with paternal kindness, took the case of <lb/>
            both parties into consideration. In virtue of his apostolical <lb/>
            authority he enjoined Abbot Robert to return to his first <lb/>
            convent and to govern it according to its rule, to prevent its <lb/>
            dissolution, appointing a substitute in the new monastery <lb/>
            he had begun, selected from those he thought qualified. He <lb/>
            further decreed that every monk should at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of his profession, choose the institutions under which <lb/>
            he proposed to live, and should adhere to them without <lb/>
            change ever afterwards.</p>
          <p>That able pope issued on this occasion a decree to the <lb/>
            following effect: " The utmost care must be taken lest a <lb/>
            horrible schism be nourished in the house of God and it <lb/>
            should grow and be spread abroad to the general injury; and <lb/>
            on the other hand, that the grace which is given from on <lb/>
            high for the salvation of souls be not impiously extinguished. <lb/>
            We therefore provide from our fatherly affection, and ordain <lb/>
            by our apostolical authority, that the monks of Molème who <lb/>
            prefer the general rules of the monastic order shall inviolably <lb/>
            observe them, and not presume to desert their own convent <lb/>
            and adopt other customs. As for the Cistericans who make <lb/>
            a boast of keeping the rule of St. Benedict in all particulars, <lb/>
            let them not by another change return to a system which <lb/>
            they now hold in contempt. Steadfastness in a convent, and <lb/>
            perseverance in every good way are most laudable and to be <lb/>
            firmly maintained, because they are acceptable to the Creator <lb/>
            who requires in sacrifice even the rump of the victim,2 and <lb/>
            is agreeable to men who are roused to excellence by having <lb/>
            before their eyes models of holiness."</p>
          <p>Thus compelled, Abbot Robert returned to Moleme3 and <lb/>
            there served God worthily to the end of his days.4 He <note type="footnote"> I The infant society was organized, and the new statutes adopted, on <lb/>

            chose as his vicar for the affairs of Citeaux, Alberic, a man <lb/>
            of deep piety, and appointed him abbot, to govern John and <lb/>
            Ildebode,1 both of Arras, and the rest of the twenty-two <lb/>
            Cistercian brothers. He dwelt there ten years in great <lb/>
            penury, and, with his fraternity, laboured painfully in the <lb/>
            service of God, from whom he confidently expected an ines­ <lb/>
            timable recompence. On his death he was succeeded by <lb/>
            Stephen, an Englishman of great religion and learning, who <lb/>
            for more than twenty-four years was eminent for his doctrine <lb/>
            and good deeds.2 In his time the monastery in the wilder­ <lb/>
            ness received a great increase. Guv, abbot of Trois-Fontaines3 <lb/>
            was chosen abbot of Citeaux, while Stephen was still living, <lb/>
            and by his desire; and not long afterwards the venerable <lb/>
            Stephen departed this life. Guy, having accepted the office, <lb/>
            performed it with little credit for two years, at the end of <lb/>
            which he as foolishly resigned it.4 Thereupon the young <lb/>
            Reynold, son of Milo, count of Bar-sur-Seine, was elected <lb/>
            abbot, and consecrated by Walter, bishop of Chalons.</p>
          <p>It is now thirty-seven years since Abbot Robert settled at <lb/>
            Cîteaux,5 and in this short time so great a concourse of <lb/>
            monks has been drawn thither, that sixty-five monasteries <lb/>
            have been founded, all subject with their abbots to the <lb/>
            superior abbot of Citeaux. All the monks of the Cistercian <lb/>
            order wear neither trowsers nor robes of fur; they abstain <lb/>
            from fat and flesh-meat, and by their worth shine like lights <note type="footnote"> 1 John was one of the six monks who quitted Molême in 1098 with <lb/>

          <p>AT the same time flourished Andrew, a venerable monk of <lb/>
            Vallambrosa,1 who built the abbey of Chezal-Benedict, in <lb/>
            the territory of Bourges, teaching his disciples to serve God <lb/>
            in great poverty and continence of life. He was a native of <lb/>
            Italy, of profound learning, and well fitted to gain souls for <lb/>
            Christ, through his grace.</p>
          <p>Aldebert, abbot of Dol, was now promoted to the arch­ <lb/>
            bishopric of Bourges,2 a prelate endowed with great virtues, <lb/>
            who by word and deed bore testimony of holiness to those <lb/>
            who desired to become followers of Christ. Garnier de <lb/>
            Montmorillon, this archbishop's brother,3 was a gallant <lb/>
            knight, who afterwards enlisted in the service of God, and <lb/>
            was nearly sixty years a monk of Maison-Dieu.4 While he <lb/>
            was yet in the world, in his military career, he was on one <lb/>
            occasion returning from a pilgrimage to the shrine of <lb/>
            St. James, when, on entering a wood in company with his <lb/>
            squire only, he suddenly encountered a sick mendicant who <lb/>
            asked for alms. The knight not having any money ready at <lb/>
            hand, piously gave him his rich gauntlets, which were a <lb/>
            present from his mistress. Some time afterwards, as a de­ <lb/>
            vout servant of God was praying in his oratory after matins, <lb/>
            an angel appeared to him in a vision, and gave him special <lb/>

            was given him: "He it is," replied the angel, "who has <lb/>
            sent me to you with this commission whom Martin clothed <lb/>
            with part of his mantle, and to whom Garnier gave his <lb/>
            gloves." The brother related this to his abbot, and it was <lb/>
            plain to the older monks that the message had reference to <lb/>
            the story of St. Martin, who, when only a catechumen at <lb/>
            Amiens, rent his cloak and gave part of it to a poor man <lb/>
            for Christ's sake ; but as to Garnier's gauntlets, no account <lb/>
            of the circumstance had as yet got abroad. At last he told <lb/>
            with great simplicity to some persons who asked him about <lb/>
            it, how he had done the good deed to a poor man for the <lb/>
            love of Christ; and, upon learning from them the revelation <lb/>
            which had been made, gave thanks to God, who is never <lb/>
            wanting to those who act aright.</p>
          <p>About this time Bernard, abbot of Quincé,1 retired from <lb/>
            Poitiers, because he had refused to subject his monastery, <lb/>
            which had been independent to that time, to the abbey of <lb/>
            Cluni. Being, as the scripture says of the just man, " bold <lb/>
            as a lion,” 2 Bernard pleaded the cause of his independence <lb/>
            against Pope Paschal before a council at Rome, and <lb/>
            because the pope did not grant him perfect redress, appealed <lb/>
            to the judgment of God. The pope reverenced his deter­ <lb/>
            mined conduct, and begged him to remain at Rome to assist <lb/>
            in the administration of ecclesiastical affairs. The abbot <lb/>
            however chose to withdraw from all worldly cares,3 and <lb/>
            travelled through many countries in company with some <lb/>
            monks whose zeal led them to follow him.4 At last, after <lb/>
            much journeying, he visited the venerable bishop Ives, who <lb/>
            graciously received him, and settled him and his monks on <lb/>
            the territory of the church of Chartres, where he built a <lb/>
            monastery dedicated to St. Saviour in a woody district <note type="footnote"> 1 Bernard, a native of Ponthieu, was abbot of St. Cyprian at Poitiers <lb/>

            Bernard, the island of Chaufei, near Granville, where he had resided <lb/>
            before he was raised to the dignity of abbot; then the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Fougères; then Arcisses, near Nogent-le-Rotrou; then, finally, he settled <lb/>
            at Tiron, in the commune of Gardais, first temporarily in 1107, and at last <lb/>

            called Tiron. A multitude of the faithful of both orders <lb/>
            flocked to him, and lather Bernard received in his loving <lb/>
            embraces all who were ready to make their profession, <lb/>
            enjoining them to practise in his new monastery the occu­ <lb/>
            pations which each of them had learnt. In consequence <lb/>
            there readily assembled about him workmen, both smiths <lb/>
            and carpenters, sculptors and goldsmiths, painters and <lb/>
            masons, vine-dressers and ploughmen, with skilled artificers <lb/>
            in various branches of labour. They diligently employed <lb/>
            themselves in the tasks assigned them by the abbot, and <lb/>
            turned their gains to the common advantage. Thus where <lb/>
            lately robbers sheltered themselves in a frightful forest, and <lb/>
            cut the throats of unwary travellers, on whom they rushed <lb/>
            unawares, a stately abbey was, by God's help, quickly <lb/>
            reared. Theobald, count palatine, and his mother, Adèle, <lb/>
            Rotro, count de Mortain, and his mother, Beatrix,1 with <lb/>
            many natives of Chartres, Dreux, and the Corbonnois, both <lb/>
            gentle and simple, as well as the Christian people of the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, finding the simplicity and worth of the good <lb/>
            monks, paid them great respect, in the fear of the Lord, <lb/>
            and rendered them effectual aid, both by their encourage­ <lb/>
            ment and their contributions, in adding strength to the <lb/>
            citadel which they had begun to build in the cause of God.</p>
          <p>The venerable Vitalis,2 who was formerly chaplain of <lb/>
            Robert, count de Mortain,3 and a canon of the church of <lb/>
            St. Evroult at Mortain,4 divested himself of the burden of <lb/>
            worldly cares and riches, and resolving to bear Christ's easy <lb/>
            yoke in -the footsteps of the apostles, retired for some time <lb/>
            into a desert with some devout recluses. In this solitude <lb/>
            he got rid of his former habits of indulgence, and learnt to <lb/>
            submit to strict discipline. At last he remarked the village <lb/>
            of Savigni,5 where he found vast ruins of some ancient <lb/>

            the holy and undivided Trinity in a neighbouring wood, <lb/>
            choosing it for the abode of himself and his disciples. He <lb/>
            determined not to adopt the customs of the monks of Cluni, <lb/>
            or others who had been long subject to the monastic rule, <lb/>
            but embraced the institutions of the new societies, so far as <lb/>
            he approved of them. Vitalis was deeply imbued with erudite <lb/>
            learning ; his courage and eloquence were remarkable ; and <lb/>
            he was firm in carrying into effect whatever he proposed. <lb/>
            Sparing neither high nor low in his public discourses, he <lb/>
            raised his voice like the trumpet spoken of by the prophet <lb/>
            Isaiah, showing the people of the Lord their transgressions <lb/>
            and the house of Jacob their sins.1 Kings and dukes <lb/>
            showed him honour, and multitudes hastened at the dawn <lb/>
            of day to listen to his words, and hearing from his mouth <lb/>
            the sins they had secretly committed, retired in sorrow and <lb/>
            confusion from his presence. Every rank in society was <lb/>
            pricked to the heart by his just reproofs; all the world <lb/>
            trembled before his rebukes; and crowds of both sexes were <lb/>
            filled with shame at the misdoings he revealed. He laid <lb/>
            bare the inmost recesses of vice, and awakened the conscience <lb/>
            by his strictures to a sense of the most secret faults. It <lb/>
            was thus that he subdued the pride of the great, and <lb/>
            softened the obduracy of the vulgar crowd, while he made <lb/>
            ladies of rank who were vain of their delicate robes of silk <lb/>
            and the fine wool of Canusa,2 to tremble before the sword of <lb/>
            God's word which threatened their vices, smote their con­ <lb/>
            sciences stained with sin, and struck them with alarm by <lb/>
            the awful thunder of the divine justice. Multitudes profited <lb/>
            by the admonitions of the accomplished preacher, and many <lb/>
            were led to become his disciples in the monastery he built, <lb/>
            and in which he waged the fight of faith for seven years,3 <lb/>
            making a good end of an excellent life. After lying sick <lb/>
            for a short time, he was carried into his oratory, where he <lb/>
            made faithful confession, and received the viaticum of the <lb/>
            holy communion, at the matins of the Virgin Mary: when <lb/>

            and as all present were repeating the Amen, his spirit fled.1 <lb/>
            On his death, he was succeeded by Geoffrey of Bayeux, a <lb/>
            monk of Cerisi, who made very unreasonable innovations, <lb/>
            and imposed a heavy yoke on the necks of his disciples.2</p>
          <p>I have recorded for the benefit of posterity, these accounts <lb/>
            of the modern institutions, the founders of which prefer <lb/>
            their new inventions to the traditions of their predecessors, <lb/>
            calling other monks secular, and presuming to condemn <lb/>
            them as transgressors of the ancient rules. When I reflect <lb/>
            on the zeal and strictness of their lives, I cannot severely <lb/>
            condemn them, nor do I esteem them above our old and <lb/>
            tried fathers. They are ignorant, I think, that St. Columbam <lb/>
            a native of Ireland, was a contemporary of St. Benedict,3 <lb/>
            and quitting his home and country, crossed over to France <lb/>
            with some eminent monks, and being hospitably received by <lb/>
            Childebert, king of the Franks, son of Sigebert, built the <lb/>
            monastery of Luxeuil in Burgundy.' Being afterwards <lb/>
            expelled by Queen Brunichild, he retired into Italy, and <lb/>
            being received by Aigilulph, king of the Lombards, founded <lb/>
            the abbey of Bobbio.5 The labours of this holy father <lb/>
            were most eminent; and gloriously crowned with miracles <lb/>
            in the sight of the people, and inspired by the Spirit of God, <lb/>
            he published a monastic rule, and was the first to introduce <lb/>
            it into France. Many monks of great celebrity issued from <lb/>
            that school, and shed light on the world by their virtues, <lb/>
            like stars in the firmament. Eustace of Luxeuil, Agilus of <lb/>

            companions and disciples, inasmuch as they were neighbours <lb/>
            and received from them the rule of St. Benedict, as well as <lb/>
            the precepts of other doctors, written for edification; so far, <lb/>
            however as they were not contrary to the statutes of their <lb/>
            own master the excellent Columban. From him, indeed, <lb/>
            they learned the forms and order of divine service, and the <lb/>
            prayer for all conditions of men in the church of God, and <lb/>
            assumed the black dress and other distinctions which they <lb/>
            used for the sake of religion and decency, and which <lb/>
            their successors to the present day desire to regard with <lb/>
            respect.</p>
          <p>What was the character of this great doctor, St. Columban, <lb/>
            in the sight of God and man, the book containing his life, <lb/>
            full of signs and miracles, sufficiently exhibits. Frequent <lb/>
            mention is made in his acts of St. Ouen, archbishop of <lb/>
            Rouen, of Eloi, bishop of Noyon, and of other persons who <lb/>
            gathered around him, and by his instructions obtained the <lb/>
            tranquillity which virtue gives.</p>
          <p>Although recently occupied in writing the history of <lb/>
            the abbey of St. Evroult, I have now taken a survey, as if <lb/>
            I had been wrapt in a vision, of the vast kingdoms of the <lb/>
            earth, so that, wandering far and wide in my discourse, and <lb/>
            embracing many subjects, I have made an extensive digression. <lb/>
            Wearied by this long excursion, I now return to my home <lb/>
            at St. Evroult, and shall close the present book by relating <lb/>
            briefly somewhat of our own affairs.</p>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord, 1098, the first indiction, Hugh de <lb/>

            He then received the monastic robe from Geoffrey of Orleans, <lb/>
            prior of St. Evroult, who had been lately sent by Abbot <lb/>
            Roger to England, to give him succour; and he died six days <lb/>
            afterwards, that is, on the calends of March [the 22nd <lb/>
            February].1 His body, preserved in salt, and well sewn up <lb/>
            in an ox-hide, was conveyed to Normandy by Bernard and <lb/>
            David, monks of St. Evroult, and honourably interred by the <lb/>
            abbot and convent, on the south side of the chapter house, <lb/>
            near the tomb of Abbot Mainier. Arnold of Rhuddlan,2 <lb/>
            his nephew, caused a marble slab to be laid over his grave, <lb/>
            and Vitalis3 furnished the following epitaph in heroic <lb/>
            verses :- <lb/>
            With years and glory compassed, HUGH the brave <lb/>
            Beneath this marble finds an honoured grave; <lb/>

            Shield of his friends, and terror of his foes. <lb/>
            Here he, with gifts and lands, and service due, <lb/>
            Decked and enriched the shrine of St. Evroult. <lb/>

          <p>Adeliza, wife of Hugh de Grantmesnil, had died at Rouen <lb/>

            and was interred in the chapter house at St. Evroult on the <lb/>
            right of Abbot Mainier. This lady was daughter of Ivo, <lb/>
            Count de Beaumont, by Judith, her mother. She bore her <lb/>
            husband six sons and as many daughters, whose fates were <lb/>
            subject to the fleeting changes of human affairs.</p>
          <p>Robert, the eldest, was thrice married1 before he advanced <lb/>
            in years, but the ample patrimony he inherited from his father <lb/>
            slipped through his hands. At last he died on the calends <lb/>
            of June,2 thirty eight years after his father, and was buried <lb/>
            with his two wives, Agues and Emma, in the chapter house <lb/>
            at St. Evroult. His brother William stood high at the court <lb/>
            of King William, by whom he was so much beloved that <lb/>
            he offered him his niece, daughter of Robert, earl of Morton, <lb/>
            that he might attach the young man to him by the honour <lb/>
            of so near an alliance. But the proud youth rejected the <lb/>
            royal offer, and from love of change went to Apulia, <lb/>
            with Robert Giffard, and several others, and marrying <lb/>
            Mabel, surnamed Courte Louve, daughter of Robert <lb/>
            Guiscard,4 received fifteen castles as her dowry. He died <lb/>
            there after his return from Antioch, leaving two sons, <lb/>
            William and Robert, heirs of his estates.5</p>
          <p>Hugh, a brave and excellent knight, died young, and <lb/>
            was interred with honour in the chapter house at St. <lb/>
            Evroult.6</p>
          <p>Ivo held for some time his father's domains in England, <lb/>
            but afterwards in the time of King Henry, he pledged them <note type="footnote"> and yet she is said to have been interred by his side. The author may, <lb/>
            however, have spoken of the state of things existing at the time he wrote ; <lb/>
            and Adeliza's death in 1085 is rather confirmed by the circumstance of the <lb/>
            manor of Brockbourne in Hertfordshire, which she held directly from <lb/>
            King William, having been given to the monks of Bermondsey by her son <lb/>

            Jerusalem. In the first crusade he suffered much, as well <lb/>
            as his companions, at Antioch; and in the second he <lb/>
            died.'</p>
          <p>Alberic, the youngest son, had his youth devoted to the <lb/>
            study of letters, but when he grew up, he renounced the <lb/>
            profession of a learned clerk, and embraced the career of arms, <lb/>
            in which he endeavoured to distinguish himself by actions <lb/>
            of signal bravery.2 He wounded Tancred, son of the Good <lb/>
            Marquis, a hero illustrious for his great achievements; who <lb/>
            was lame, in consequence, the rest of his life.3</p>
          <p>All these sons of Hugh de Grantmesnil, were in person tall <lb/>
            and handsome, as well as of great courage; but fortune <lb/>
            persecuted them, and neither of them, except Robert, enjoyed <lb/>
            a long life, nor a continuance of peace and prosperity. <note type="footnote"> 1 The disgraceful manner in which he withdrew from the dangers and <lb/>
            privations of the first Crusade is described in book ix.; and it is surprising <lb/>
            that with his painful experience, he should have embarked a second time <lb/>
            in such an enterprise. He left two sons, Jvo and Hugh. Petronilla, <lb/>
            Hugh's daughter, and great grand-daughter of the founder of the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, married the earl of Leicester, who in her right had all that <lb/>
            remained of the inheritance of this family in Normandy and England. <lb/>
            Robert, earl of Leicester, son of the Countess Petronilla, made a charter <lb/>

          <p>THE Eternal Creator wisely orders the revolutions of time <lb/>
            and of human affairs, not disposing and altering them at the <lb/>
            pleasure of senseless mortals, but his providence preserves, <lb/>
            and his strong hand, and stretched-out arm, fitly carries for­ <lb/>
            ward and dispenses all. This is plainly seen in the changes <lb/>
            of winter and summer, and not less felt in cold and heat; we <lb/>
            perceive this in the origin and decay of all things, and the <lb/>
            infinite variety of the works of God. Hence arise the <lb/>
            numerous narratives of events which are daily occurring in <lb/>
            the world, and materials are abundantly offered for eloquent <lb/>
            historians to dwell upon. I reflect profoundly on these <lb/>
            things, and commit the result of my meditations to writing; <lb/>
            because in our days we have an unexpected revolution, and <lb/>
            a noble theme for marvellous tales is offered to the pen of <lb/>
            the writer.</p>
          <p>Lo! the crusade to Jerusalem is entered on by the inspi­ <lb/>

            together from many nations into one vast body, and are led <lb/>
            in one united army to fight against the infidels1 in the East. <lb/>
            The holy Sion is delivered by her sons who have hastened to <lb/>

            and foully polluted the sanctuary of God. The execrable <lb/>
            Saracens3 had, by permission of divine Providence, long since <lb/>
            crossed the border of Christendom, seized on the holy places, <lb/>
            murdered the Christian inhabitants, and defiled with their <lb/>
            abominations all that is sacred; but after a long period they <lb/>

            excitement, but by the simple admonition of Pope Urban,1 <lb/>
            he assembled the Christians of the West, from the ends of <lb/>
            the earth, and the isles of the sea, as he brought the Hebrews <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1094, the second indiction, <lb/>
            tumults and wars spread desolation over the greatest part of <lb/>
            the world, and pitiless mortals inflicted on each other <lb/>
            enormous calamities by rapine and slaughter. Iniquity <lb/>
            abounded on all sides, and involved those who abandoned <lb/>
            themselves to it in endless sufferings. The grass of the earth <lb/>
            was burnt up by excessive drought, which destroyed the corn <lb/>
            and pulse, so that a severe famine ensued.1</p>
          <p>The emperor Henry attacked the Roman church, but by <lb/>
            God's providence was compelled to yield to the numbers who <lb/>
            undertook her defence. Pope Urban held a council at <lb/>
            Piazenza, in which the peace of the church and other pressing <lb/>
            affairs were carefully considered.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 This melancholy picture appears to he somewhat overcharged. The <lb/>
            populations of the west were habitually the prey of so many devastations, <lb/>
            that the year 1094 does not seem to have been particularly distinguished, <lb/>
            except by a pestilence which extended its ravages to France, but which <lb/>
            was a greater scourge to Bavaria and the banks of the Rhine. The <lb/>
            Chronicle of St. Stephen of Caen speaks also of a great drought and <lb/>
            famine, but refers them to the year 1091 ; while that of St. Brieuc, on <lb/>

            Conrad. wh7 had commenced hostilities against him, caused himself to be <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1095, the third indiction, on <lb/>
            Wednesday before the nones [4th] of April, on the <lb/>
            twenty-sixth day of the moon, innumerable spectators <lb/>
            in France witnessed such a prodigious commotion among <lb/>
            the stars, that, but for their brightness, it might have been <lb/>
            mistaken for a thick shower of hail. Many thought that the <lb/>
            constellations had fallen, and that the scripture was fulfilled, <lb/>
            which predicted when and wherefore the stars should fall <lb/>
            from heaven.</p>
          <p>Gilbert, bishop of Lisieux, who was now an old man <lb/>
            and a good physician as well as deeply skilled in other <lb/>
            sciences,' had long been in the habit of regularly observing <lb/>
            the stars at night, carefully noting their courses, like an acute <lb/>
            astrologer. The able naturalist perceiving this prodigy in <lb/>
            the heavens, called up the watchman who guarded the house <lb/>
            while the other servants were asleep, and said to him: " Do <lb/>
            you see, Walter, this remarkable appearance ?" The mart <lb/>
            replied: " I see it, my lord, but I know not what it portends." <lb/>
            The old prelate answered: " It prefigures, I think, the <lb/>
            emigration of people from one country to another. Many <lb/>
            will depart never to return, until the stars come back to their <lb/>
            places in the heavens, from which as it appears they are <lb/>
            clearly wandering. Others will remain fixed in their high <lb/>
            and lofty sphere, like bright stars shining in the firmament." <note type="footnote"> men. The ambassadors of the emperor of the East attended the council <lb/>
            to implore the succour of the Latin Christians against the Turks, who had <lb/>
            overrun almost all Asia Minor, and threatened Constantinople itself. It <lb/>
            was in consequence of this, and on the present occasion, that Pope Urban <lb/>
            first proposed the Crusade. </note><note type="footnote"> I From cur author's character, in a former chapter (vol. ii. p. 121), of <lb/>

            more than usually brilliant. Little did the philosophical prelate know of <lb/>

            This Walter, who was of Cormeilles, related to me a long <lb/>
            time afterwards what he had heard from the mouth of the <lb/>
            able physician concerning the falling stars, at the very <lb/>
            moment the phenomenon was observed.</p>
          <p>Philip, king of France, carried off Bertrade, the wife of <lb/>
            the count of Anjou, and having repudiated his own illus­ <lb/>
            trious queen, made a shameful marriage with the adulteress. <lb/>
            He would not abandon this dishonourable connection, <lb/>
            notwithstanding the censures of the French bishops on the <lb/>
            criminal pair, the one for having deserted his wife, the other <lb/>
            her husband, and the king sunk into age and infirmities in <lb/>
            all the corruption of his foul adultery.1</p>
          <p>During King Philip's reign, Pope Urban undertook a <lb/>
            journey to France, and consecrated the altar of St. Peter at <lb/>
            the abbey of Cluni, and many churches dedicated to the <lb/>
            saints; and, by his apostolical authority, granted them <lb/>
            privileges to the honour of Christ. Then a dreadful pesti­ <lb/>
            lence raged among the population in Normandy and France, <lb/>
            so that numbers of houses were swept of their inhabitants, <lb/>
            while, at the same time, a severe famine wasted the people.</p>
          <p>The same year, the fourth indiction, in the month of <lb/>
            November, Pope Urban assembled the bishops of France <lb/>
            and Spain in a great council at Clermont,3 a city of Auvergne, <lb/>
            anciently called Arverne.4 He reformed many things on <lb/>

            the sacred synod Jerusalem prostrate, and the holy places, <lb/>
            where Christ and his disciples walked in the flesh, profaned <lb/>
            and trodden down. Then many of his audience were moved <lb/>
            by sympathy and compassion for their afflicted brethren <lb/>
            to weep with him. The eloquent preacher addressed his <lb/>
            hearers in a long and excellent discourse, in which he <lb/>
            exhorted the princes of the West, with their subjects and <lb/>

            assuming the badge of the holy cross on their right shoul­ <lb/>

          <p>" The Turks and Persians," said Pope Urban, " the <lb/>
            Arabians and Saracens, have seized Antioch, Nice, and <lb/>
            Jerusalem itself,' ennobled by the tomb of Christ, with other <lb/>
            Christian cities, and have now turned their immense power <lb/>
            against the empire of the Greeks. They are in complete <lb/>
            possession of Palestine and Syria, which they have already <lb/>
            subjugated, destroying the churches, and butchering the <lb/>
            Christians like sheep. In the churches, where the divine <lb/>
            sacrifice was once celebrated by the faithful, the gentiles <lb/>
            now stable their horses, introducing their superstitions and <lb/>
            idolatries, have shamefully expelled the Christian religion <lb/>
            from the temples dedicated to God. The domains given for <lb/>
            the support of the saints, and the endowments of the nobles <lb/>
            for the sustenance of the poor, are usurped by pagan <lb/>
            tyranny, and converted by these cruel masters to their own <lb/>
            use. They have dragged away many captives into far <lb/>
            distant countries, the seats of barbarism, and yoking them <lb/>
            with thongs, set them to labour in the fields, compelled <lb/>
            them to plough the land like oxen, and to undergo other <lb/>
            toils befitting beasts rather than men. Worn down with <lb/>
            the fatigue of such employments, our brethren are flogged <lb/>
            with whips, urged with goads, and abominably subjected to <lb/>

          <p>No sooner had Pope Urban eloquently poured forth these <lb/>
            complaints in the ears of Christians,2 than, by the inspiration <lb/>
            of God's grace, thousands were inflamed with excessive zeal <lb/>
            for undertaking the enterprise, and resolved to sell their <lb/>
            lands and leave all they had for the sake of Christ. Rich <lb/>
            and poor, monks and clerks, townsmen and peasants, were <lb/>
            all seized with wonderful ardour to march to Jerusalem or <lb/>
            to succour those that became pilgrims. Husbands were <lb/>
            ready to leave their beloved wives at home, and wives were <lb/>
            equally desirous to leave their children and all their sub­ <lb/>
            stance, and accompany their husbands on the journey. <lb/>
            Estates of great value were sold for a trifle, and arms were <lb/>
            purchased to inflict divine vengeance on the Saracens. <lb/>
            Robbers, pirates, and other criminals, touched by the grace <lb/>
            of God, rose from the depths of iniquity, confessed and <lb/>
            renounced their sins, and, to make satisfaction to God for <lb/>
            them, joined the ranks of the pilgrims. The prudent pope <lb/>
            stirred up all who were able to bear arms, to fight against <lb/>
            the enemies of God, absolving by his authority all penitents <lb/>
            from the hour they should take the cross from their sins, <lb/>
            and releasing them from all obligations of fasting and other <lb/>
            mortifications of the flesh. For he wisely considered, like <lb/>
            a kind and prudent physician, that those who went on the <lb/>
            pilgrimage would be constantly harassed on the road by <lb/>
            difficulties of all kinds, and exposed to daily chances both <lb/>
            for good or evil, for which the worthy servants of Christ <lb/>
            should be purified from all the corruptions of sin. <note type="footnote"> 1 Among the numerous discourses attributed by the historians of the <lb/>
            first Crusade to Urban II. at the council of Clermont, there are three <lb/>
            which have the character of authenticity. The first, which is rather the <lb/>
            fragment of an allocution particularly addressed to the French than a <lb/>

            from a lofty scaffold in the market place of Clermont. The city was filled <lb/>

          <p>While the pope was solemnly preaching in the council, <lb/>
            and vehemently exhorting the sons of Jerusalem to hasten <lb/>
            to deliver their holy mother, a man of high character, <lb/>
            Adhemar,1 bishop of Puy, rose from his place before all the <lb/>
            assembly, and approaching the successor of the apostles <lb/>
            with a cheerful countenance, bent his knee, and entreated <lb/>
            permission to go, and the pope's benediction ; both which he <lb/>
            obtained to the joy of all. Thereupon the pope issued a <lb/>
            decree enjoining all the pilgrims to obey the bishop, and <lb/>
            constituting him apostolical vicar in the expedition ; for he <lb/>
            was a prelate of consummate ability, great courage, and <lb/>
            singular industry.</p>
          <p>The envoys of Raymond Berenger, count of Tholouse,2 <lb/>
            presently appeared, and announced to the pope that their <lb/>
            master, with many thousands from his dukedom, would join <lb/>
            the Crusade, and stated to the council that he had already <lb/>
            assumed the cross. Lo ! thanks be to God, two leaders <lb/>
            voluntarily presented themselves with alacrity to take the <lb/>
            command of the Christian pilgrims. In this case, the <lb/>
            priestly and princely powers, the order of the clergy and <lb/>
            that of the laity, united to be the conductors of the people <lb/>
            of God. The bishop and the count remind us of Moses <lb/>
            and Aaron, who were also aided by the divine support. <lb/>

            brought synodal letters to their brother bishops. In <lb/>
            consequence, Archbishop William convoked a synod at <lb/>
            Rouen, to consult with his suffragan bishops on the wants <lb/>
            of the church. Having assembled at Rouen, in the month <lb/>

            council of Clermont, and, ratifying the apostolical decrees, <lb/>
            made a record to the following purpose for a perpetual <lb/>
            memorial ;­ <lb/>
            " 1. The holy synod has decreed that the truce of God <lb/>
            shall be strictly observed from the Sunday before the <lb/>
            beginning of Lent to sunrise on Monday after the octave 01 <lb/>
            Whitsuntide; also from Wednesday before Advent at <lb/>

            Monday ;2also on all the feasts of St. Mary, and their vigils, <lb/>
            and all feasts of the apostles, and their vigils; so that no <lb/>
            one shall assault, or wound, or slay another, or take pledge3 <lb/>

            the week for carrying on hostilities. This was so totally inconsistentwith <lb/>
            the military spirit of the age, that the canon, by attempting too much, <lb/>
            became quite nugatory, as our author states in the succeeding chapter, in <lb/>
            commenting on the decrees of this council, promulgated by the synod of <lb/>

            of a gage or pledge of battle. M. Le Provost considers it an ordinary <lb/>

            them in any manner or at any time whatever.'</p>

            twelve years and upwards, shall swear to observe faithfully <lb/>
            this institution of the truce of God as it is here appointed, <lb/>

            without subterfuge, and according to my conscience. So <lb/>
            help me God, and these saints.’2</p>
          <p>“ 4. Likewise, the holy synod bath decreed that excom­ <lb/>
            munication shall be pronounced on all who refuse to take this <lb/>
            oath, or shall violate this decree; as well as on those who <lb/>
            have any communication with them, or sell them goods, <lb/>
            whether workmen, or other tradesmen ; and also priests who <lb/>
            shall permit them to communicate, or perform any divine <lb/>
            office for them. Excommunication shall also be extended <lb/>
            to all forgers, thieves, and receivers of stolen goods, and to <lb/>
            freebooters banded together in strongholds for the purpose <lb/>
            of pillaging, and to all lords who shall shelter them in their <lb/>

            shall have the same fiefs in their possession as they had in <lb/>
            the time of King William, with the same rights and customs, <lb/>
            and that no layman shall have any share in the third part of <lb/>

            Also, that no man shall wear long hair, but every one shall <lb/>
            have it cut short as becomes a Christian;1 otherwise he <lb/>
            shall be sequestrated from entering the doors of holy mother <lb/>
            church, and no priest shall perform any divine office for him <lb/>
            or assist at his burial. Let no layman assume episcopal <lb/>
            rights, or the jurisdiction which belongs to the cure of souls.2</p>

            the sacred chrism, should be placed within those which are <lb/>
            unhallowed, and may belong to a murderer, an adulterer, or <lb/>
            one who has committed some other grievous sin.3 If, however, <lb/>
            a priest holds of a layman any fief which is not ecclesiastical, <lb/>

            barons, and the people throughout the country engaged in <lb/>
            enterprises of violence and robbery, so that the whole land <lb/>
            was devastated by ravages and flames. A great number of <lb/>
            the inhabitants were driven from their homes, and the <lb/>
            parishes being depopulated, the priests sought safety in <lb/>
            flight from their ruined churches.</p>
          <p>The Normans are a turbulent race, and, unless restrained <lb/>
            by a firm government, are always ready for mischief. In <lb/>
            all societies wherever they are found, they struggle for the <lb/>
            mastery, and disregarding all the sanctions of truth and <lb/>
            good faith, are incessantly actuated by a fiery ambition. <lb/>
            The French, the Bretons, the Flemings, and the other <lb/>
            neighbours of the people of Normandy, have but too often <lb/>
            had reason to be sensible of this, and the Italians, Lombards, <lb/>
            and Anglo-Saxons, have suffered from it even to extermina­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>The origin of the Trojans may be traced, as it is reported, <lb/>
            to the barbarous tribes of the Scythians; and after the <lb/>
            ruin of Troy, Antenor, the Phrygian, penetrated into <lb/>
            Illyrium, and sought for a long time a settlement for him­ <lb/>
            self and his companions in exile. At last, he fixed his abode <lb/>
            on the shore of the Northern ocean, and having with his fellow <lb/>
            emigrants colonized the sea-coast, they left their possessions <lb/>
            to their heirs. The race thus sprung from the Trojans, took <lb/>
            the name of Danes, from Danus, son of Antenor.3 They <note type="footnote"> 1 1094-1133. </note><note type="footnote">2 1093-1110. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This fabulous account of the origin of the Danes from Trojan <lb/>

            were always a fierce and warlike people and governed by <lb/>
            powerful kings; but it was long before they submitted to <lb/>
            receive the Christian faith. Rollo, one of their bravest <lb/>
            chiefs, with the Normans, were of this race; and being the <lb/>
            first who subjugated Neustria, it took from them the name <lb/>
            of Normandy, Norman signifying in English, Northman. <lb/>
            Norman means therefore a man of the north, whose rude <lb/>
            assaults have proved not less destructive to their dainty <lb/>
            neighbours than the nipping blasts of the north wind to <lb/>
            tender flowers. To this day their descendants inherit the <lb/>
            native fierceness of the race and their ardour for war, so <lb/>
            that they never suffer the tillers of the soil or even their <lb/>
            own governors to have any peace in their homes.</p>
          <p>After Rollo, a succession of valiant dukes commanded the <lb/>
            warlike Normans; namely, William Long-sword, Richard <lb/>
            the elder, Richard II., son of Gunner, and his two sons, <lb/>
            Richard the younger and Robert of Jerusalem, and then <lb/>
            William the Bastard. This duke, the last in order of time, <lb/>
            surpassed all his predecessors in his warlike achievements <lb/>
            and grandeur, and at his death left the duchy of Normandy to <lb/>
            Robert, and the kingdom of England to William. But Robert, <lb/>
            a weak prince, degenerated from the vigour of his ancestors, <lb/>
            and sunk in sloth and luxury, had more fear of his own <lb/>
            subjects than they had of him, and consequently a mis­ <lb/>
            chievous insubordination gained ground in every part of his <lb/>
            territories. One of his brothers, Prince Henry, had posses­ <lb/>
            sion of Damfrout, a very strong castle, from whence he held <lb/>
            great part of Normandy in subjection either by his policy <lb/>
            or his arms, and befriended his brother or opposed him, <lb/>
            according to his own pleasure. The other brother, who was <lb/>
            king of England, held more, I think, than twenty castles in <lb/>
            Normandy, and attached to his cause either by fear or <lb/>

            of cogent, people scrambled for the hairs plucked from the tail of his <lb/>
            mule. Our author is incorrect in describing him here as a monk ; he did <lb/>
            not embrace the religious life until after his return from the Holy Land, <lb/>
            when he founded a priory of regular canons at Neumostier (Novum Monas­ <lb/>
            terium), in the suburbs of the town of Huy, in the bishopric of Liege, <lb/>
            where he died the 6th of June, 1115, at the age of 62 years. He was, <lb/>

            called the Hermit, which did not mean that he had embraced the life of an <lb/>
            anchorite, but was his family name. His father Reginald l'Ermite had <lb/>
            borne it before him, and it was preserved by his descendants. Several <lb/>

            Germans, who had outstripped him, and received the <lb/>
            emperor's orders to make provision for the expected army. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, he gave them permission to traffic in the city, as <lb/>
            was just, but he prohibited them from crossing the straits of <lb/>
            St. George,2 until the great body of the pilgrims for which <lb/>
            they were waiting should come up. "If," he said, "you do <lb/>

            or general, were under no regular discipline, but lived by <lb/>

            selling it, pillaging the palaces of the rich, and abandoning <lb/>
            themselves to all sorts of misconduct. The emperor, <lb/>
            learning this, was much incensed at the ingratitude with <lb/>
            which his kindness was repaid : he therefore expelled them <lb/>
            from the city, and compelled them to cross over the strait. <lb/>
            Having accomplished the passage, they again committed great <lb/>
            outrages on the Christian population, devastating their lands, <lb/>
            as if they were an enemy's army, and setting fire to their <lb/>
            houses and churches. At length they reached Nicomedia, <lb/>

            to betray his comrades to them. In consequence, Reynold <lb/>
            marched out of the place at the head of a large body of the <lb/>
            Christians, pretending that he intended to give battle to the <lb/>
            Turks, instead of which, he went over to them. The rest <lb/>
            were forced to surrender on very dishonourable terms, most <lb/>
            of them shamefully apostatizing from the faith of Christ. <lb/>
            Those however who refused to renounce their religion were <lb/>
            put to death, exposed as marks to be shot by arrows, <lb/>
            separated from one another, sold for a trifle, or dragged into <lb/>
            captivity with Count Berthold. The Christians suffered <lb/>
            this first defeat on the third of the calends of October, <lb/>
            [29th September], and in this manner the Germans and <lb/>
            other nations were carried captives to Chorasan and Aleppo. <lb/>
            But those who held firm their faith in Christ found rest in <lb/>
            a glorious death. <note type="footnote"> 1 This could not be Soliman, the founder of the Turkish dynasty of the <lb/>

            town of Civitot,2 which the emperor Alexius had lately <lb/>
            founded, intending to place in it the English refugees after the <lb/>
            conquest of William the Bastard, but in consequence of the <lb/>
            assaults of the Turks he had left it unfinished. Soliman, <lb/>
            however, elated with his victory over the Allobroges3 and <lb/>
            Germans, and breathing slaughter marched to Civitot, which <lb/>
            is not far from Nice, and confident of victory, made a bold <lb/>
            attack on the French. Peter had already returned to Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople, as his throng of pilgrims paid no attention to his <lb/>
            commands. The sudden charge of the Turkish cavalry took <lb/>
            by surprise Walter,4 a distinguished knight, who commanded <lb/>
            a body of troops, and he was slain with many of his followers, <lb/>
            after a slight resistance.5 His brother William and some <lb/>
            others were wounded, and the Turks struck off the bead of <lb/>
            a priest while he was celebrating mass. Such of the survivors <lb/>
            as were in a condition to make their escape fled towards the <lb/>
            city, or concealed themselves in the marshes, woods, and <lb/>
            mountains. Some few continued to hold the castle and <lb/>
            killed many of their assailants. The Turks collected a vast <lb/>
            quantity of wood in the neighbourhood, and made preparations <lb/>
            for burning the place and the thousands who were shut up <lb/>
            in it. But the Christians, driven to despair, boldly anticipated <lb/>
            the manoeuvre, and sallying forth threw fire among the faggots, <lb/>
            and thus escaped the peril of being burnt. Many fell on <lb/>
            both sides; this happened in the month of October. A great <lb/>

            squires purveyed all that was necessary for the army, passing <lb/>
            to and fro in the neighbourhood of the city to procure fodder <lb/>
            and whatever they wanted in thoughtless security, but the <lb/>
            Turkopoles and Petscheneye,1 laid wait for them, by the <lb/>
            emperor's order, and many were daily cut off. No one <lb/>
            suspected any treachery on his part, as he had voluntarily <lb/>
            offered them hospitality ; but the duke was in great distress <lb/>
            at the loss of his people by the insidious attacks of the <lb/>
            Turcopoles. In consequence, Baldwin marched out of the <lb/>
            camp for the protection of his followers, and discovering the <lb/>
            enemy who laid in wait for them, attacked them suddenly <lb/>
            and overpowering them killed some, and carried off sixty <lb/>
            whom he delivered as prisoners to his brother. When <lb/>
            the emperor heard this, he was much incensed, and began to <lb/>
            contrive mischief to the pilgrims, but the wary duke was on <lb/>
            his guard against treachery, and withdrawing from the city <lb/>
            pitched his tents on the same spot where they stood at first. <lb/>
            Night coming on, his camp was attacked by the emperor's <lb/>
            order and the army exposed to serious loss. But the <lb/>
            prudent duke, expecting a surprise, had posted the <lb/>
            sentries for the night round the camp with great care, giving <lb/>
            them orders to be on the alert. The assailants therefore <lb/>
            met an instant repulse; seven of them were killed, and the <lb/>
            duke pursued the rest with great vigour to the city gates. <lb/>
            Returning to his camp, he remained there five days, during <lb/>
            which the emperor was employed in devising means for <lb/>
            annoying the Christians, while the duke was anxiously con­ <lb/>
            sulting with his confederates. The emperor decided on prohi­ <lb/>
            biting the passage of the duke's troops through the imperial <lb/>
            city, the duke resolved to wait the arrival of reinforcements <lb/>
            from the chiefs who were on their march. At length the crafty <lb/>
            and politic emperor, who left no device untried, came to terms <lb/>
            with the duke, assuring him, that if he would cross over the <lb/>
            strait2 he would find him abundant supplies of provisions, and <lb/>
            would supply money for satisfying all who were in want of <lb/>
            their pay; he took an oath also that the duke should have <lb/>
            nothing to fear from him. The designing prince contrived <note type="footnote"> 1 The Turcopoles were light cavalry of Turkish race, or a mixed breed, <lb/>

            stantinople, that he might not have the advantage of the <lb/>
            counsels and aid of the princes who were expected. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the duke crossed over; after having sworn to the <lb/>
            emperor, and received from him the same pledge of fidelity <lb/>
            to their mutual promises.</p>
          <p>Advancing from Adrianople,1 Bohemond halted his troops <lb/>
            in a valley, and eloquently addressing them recommended <lb/>
            them to act with prudence, and, remembering that their <lb/>
            pilgrimage was undertaken in the cause of God, to restrain <lb/>
            themselves from laying violent hands on the houses and <lb/>
            property of the Christians ; but, having God always before <lb/>
            their eyes, the rich among them should help the poor, and the <lb/>
            strong the weak, supporting them for the love of God, with their <lb/>
            strength and their money. From this valley they marched <lb/>
            to Castoria, where they kept our Lord's nativity with great <lb/>
            solemnity. They halted there some days, but the inhabitants <lb/>
            would have no dealings with them, as they greatly needed, <lb/>
            regarding them not as pilgrims, but as cut-throats and <lb/>
            oppressors. In consequence they were reduced to such <lb/>
            want that they were compelled to carry off oxen, horses, or <lb/>
            asses, and everything eatable they could lay hands on. <lb/>
            Departing from Castoria,2 they pitched their camp in <lb/>
            Pelagonia,3 and finding there a strong castle belonging to <lb/>
            the heretics4 which was well stored with all kinds of supplies, <note type="footnote"> 1 Bohemond arrived by sea near Adrianople, in Albania, in the month <lb/>

            with towers. It was occupied by Bohemond from 1081 to 1084, while he <lb/>
            was engaged in war with Alexius, for his father, Robert Guiscard. It <lb/>
            should seem that in 1096 he only encamped under the walls; and it may <lb/>
            be easily conceived that the inhabitants, remembering the sufferings that <lb/>

            they assaulted it on all sides at once, and setting fire to it <lb/>
            consumed the place and the inhabitants, leaving nothing but <lb/>
            ruins. The pilgrims indeed held Jews, heretics, and Sara­ <lb/>
            cens in equal odium, calling them all the enemies of God. <lb/>
            They then arrived on the bank of the river Vardari,1 which <lb/>
            Bohemond forded with part of his troops, but Count Rosinolo <lb/>
            with the rest halted on the other side. The emperor's <lb/>
            cavalry, who hovered in the rear of the expedition, no sooner <lb/>
            saw the Christian army divided than they fell with great <lb/>
            fury on Count Rosinolo and his division. Tancred however, <lb/>
            who had not advanced far on the other side, perceiving the <lb/>
            conflict, put spurs to his horse and fording again, or rather <lb/>
            swimming across, the river flew like lightning to the rescue <lb/>
            of the count. Two thousand troops quickly followed <lb/>
            Tancred in re-crossing the river, and speedily putting the <lb/>
            Turcopoles to rout drove them off and gained a glorious <lb/>
            victory. Some fell in the skirmish, but many more were <lb/>
            taken prisoners and carried bound before Bohemond. Being <lb/>
            interrogated why they engaged in these hostilities, although <lb/>
            he was at peace with their emperor, they replied: "We are in <lb/>
            the emperor's pay, and do what he commands ?" This battle, <lb/>
            unprovoked by the Christians, was fought on Wednesday <lb/>
            the first day of Lent.2 Bohemond was extremely indignant <lb/>
            at the emperor's peridy, but he smothered his resentment, <lb/>
            and dismissed his prisoners without punishment, though not <lb/>
            without warning them by severe threats, not to molest his <lb/>
            people again. "We are," he said to his confidential friends, <lb/>
            "on the point of passing near the emperor's capital, and we <lb/>
            had better restrain our anger, and strive as far as possible <lb/>
            to give him no cause for being exasperated against us. It is <lb/>
            an extreme folly for a man to be inflamed with passion, when <lb/>
            there is no means of taking vengeance, while it is the part of <lb/>
            self-possession to dissemble as long as no opportunity is <lb/>
            afforded of obtaining satisfaction. A prudent man will <lb/>
            postpone for a season what he cannot accomplish at once. <lb/>
            He is doubly guilty, both of baseness and cowardice, who <lb/>
            makes loud threats when he cannot strike, and who, when he <lb/>
            can, passes over the insults he has received. If it is in our <note type="footnote"> 1 The Vardari, the principal river of Macedonia, runs into the gulf of <lb/>

            Such were his words; and then silently repressing any angry <lb/>
            invectives, he forwarded a message to the emperor begging a <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1097, the fifth indiction, Robert, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, Hugh the Great,' Stephen of Blois, and <lb/>
            Robert the Fleming, with other men of rank, who had <lb/>
            assembled from various countries, and spent the winter in <lb/>
            Italy with their troops, joyfully took advantage of the <lb/>
            favourable season of spring, and crossing the Adriatic joined <lb/>
            their forces to those of Mark Bohemond in Macedonia.2 At <lb/>
            the sight of so great a body of nobles united for one object, <lb/>
            and such incomparable valour sincerely devoted to the work <lb/>
            of the Lord, there was great exultation among all present <lb/>
            who were his faithful servants. The emperor Alexius had <lb/>
            already felt the weight of the Cisalpine arms,3 and he was <lb/>
            therefore in no little alarm when he received intelligence of <lb/>
            the approach of so many barons. Considering, however, by <lb/>
            what contrivance he could elude the danger, he came to the <lb/>
            determination of betraying them under the appearance of <lb/>
            giving them a peaceable reception. This prince was wily, <lb/>
            plausible in speech, liberal enough, and deeply skilled in the <lb/>
            art of deceiving. He, therefore, sent envoys to the noble <lb/>
            pilgrims, humbly begging that the peace might not be <lb/>
            broken, offering them a free passage through his dominions, <lb/>
            and promising on oath to supply them with all things neces­ <lb/>
            sary for their subsistence. Duke Bohemond, who had <lb/>
            already sufficient experience of the emperor's craftiness, and <lb/>
            had twice defeated him in battle, gave no credence to his <note type="footnote"> 1 As it has been already remarked, we must detach Hugh the Great <lb/>

            lay siege to Constantinople, a measure which he showed to <lb/>
            be most advantageous by the clearest arguments. The Franks <lb/>
            however replied: " We have left our possessions, and have <lb/>
            voluntarily embarked in this expedition, that, for the love of <lb/>
            Christ, we may confound the Infidels and liberate the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians. But the Greeks are Christians, and we are therefore <lb/>
            for making peace with them, and even restoring to them <lb/>
            what they have lost by the Turks. The sagacious Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond was therefore compelled by the counsels of the Franks <lb/>
            to conclude a peace with the Greek emperor,' to the great <lb/>
            injury, as it turned out, of the Christian cause. On being <lb/>
            called upon, the emperor assumed the appearance of acting <lb/>
            with great favour towards the chiefs, and sent his master of <lb/>
            the palace,2 who was in his entire confidence, with other <lb/>
            envoys, to Bohemond, to conduct him safely through the <lb/>
            country, and to provide him everywhere with the supplies <lb/>
            he might need. In short, the Crusaders marching forward <lb/>
            pitched their camp from place to place as circumstances <lb/>
            required, and, passing by the city of Serra,3 arrived at Rusa.4 <lb/>
            Having obtained from the Greeks, while there, all that they <lb/>
            wanted in sufficient abundance, the pilgrims pitched their <lb/>
            tents on Wednesday before Easter.5 Bohemond, now <lb/>
            leaving his troops, hastened forward with a small retinue to <lb/>
            have an audience with the emperor. Meanwhile, Tancred <note type="footnote"> 1 It was not in a personal conference, but by his envoys, while Godfrey <lb/>
            was treating with Alexius, that Bohemond urged him to break off the <lb/>
            negociation, and attempt the conquest of Constantinople. It is not, there­ <lb/>
            fore, quite correct to state that Bohemond was compelled by the other <lb/>
            chiefs to come to terms with Alexius, but only that he failed of preventing <lb/>
            their treating with the Greek emperor. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For Corpalatium, read Curopalatium. They were in the number of <lb/>

            led the Christians, who were much exhausted by their <lb/>
            journey, another way through a rich valley, where they <lb/>
            obtained refreshments for their wearied bodies, and cele­ <lb/>
            brated the feast of Easter. Alexius, learning the arrival of <lb/>
            Bohemond, the great object of his alarm, as he had twice <lb/>
            triumphed over him, gave him an honourable reception, and <lb/>
            made abundant provision for his entertainment outside the <lb/>
            city in a manner becoming to both parties.'</p>
          <p>In the interim, Duke Godfrey, leaving his comrades <lb/>
            on the other side of the straits, had returned to Constanti­ <lb/>
            nople, in consequence of the emperor's having neglected to <lb/>
            furnish them with the supplies he had promised. The <lb/>
            bishop of Puy and the count of Tholouse, having left <lb/>
            behind them the mob they led, were also at Constanti­ <lb/>
            nople. The emperor, following the advice of the Greeks, <lb/>
            who were in great alarm lest the Franks should make a <lb/>
            combined movement and pillage their property, com­ <lb/>
            municated with these great lords separately, requiring each <lb/>
            of them to pay him homage and fealty. He promised, if <lb/>
            they consented to this, to give them pay and supplies, and <lb/>
            marching in person for their support to assist them with <lb/>
            his whole forces. The Franks now found themselves in a <lb/>
            very difficult position; they were unwilling to take the oath <lb/>
            of fealty, and yet without it the Greeks would not grant <lb/>
            them a free passage. They had no desire to war with a <lb/>
            Christian people, but they were not permitted to march <lb/>
            through their country peaceably. On the other hand, they <lb/>
            shrank from retracing their steps and returning home with­ <lb/>
            out effecting their object. At length, driven by necessity, <lb/>
            they guaranteed to the emperor Alexius his life and crown, <lb/>
            swearing to make no attempt on either so long as he kept <lb/>
            faith with them. The count of Tholouse resisted longer <lb/>
            than the rest, and even anxiously sought how he might be <lb/>
            avenged of the emperor. However the general opinion of <lb/>
            the chiefs prevailed, though it was not without difficulty <lb/>
            they diverted the angry count from his purpose. He, there­ <lb/>
            fore, submitted to the oath, but he was never induced to do <note type="footnote"> 1 We are informed by a contemporary writer, that the emperor granted <lb/>
            to Bohemond a territory in Romania, fifteen days' journey long by eight <lb/>

            homage.1 Orders were now given for embarking the army. <lb/>
            Tancred had arrived in the interim with the troops he com­ <lb/>
            manded, but hearing that Alexius had exacted an oath of <lb/>
            fealty from the chiefs, he mingled among the common <lb/>
            soldiers with Richard de Principatu, and having immediately <lb/>
            set sail, passed the straits in great haste. Bohemond and <lb/>
            the count of Tholouse remained until the emperor gave <lb/>
            them satisfaction about the supplies. Duke Godfrey and <lb/>
            others went to Nicomedia, and remained three days with <lb/>
            Tancred. Then the duke, finding that there was no road <lb/>
            over which it would be possible that so vast and mighty a <lb/>
            multitude could travel, sent forward three thousand men to <lb/>
            remove rocks and level the approaches to the mountains. <lb/>
            These pioneers, armed with hatchets, axes, mattocks, and <lb/>
            tools of all sorts for clearing away the bushes and under­ <lb/>
            wood, and levelling the precipitous mountain passes, levelled <lb/>
            a road for the main body, and fixing signals on the heights <lb/>
            to prevent those who followed from losing their way, arrived <lb/>
            at Nice in Bithynia.</p>

          <p>TilE camp was marked out on the day before the nones <lb/>
            [6th] of May, and the tents of the forces of the West <lb/>
            being pitched, siege was laid to Nice, the capital of Bithynia, <lb/>
            a city so strongly fortified by lofty walls and a lake2 which <lb/>
            washes them on one side, as to appear impregnable. At <lb/>
            first there was so great a scarcity of bread in the camp until <lb/>
            the emperor's supplies arrived, that if a loaf could be found, <lb/>
            it was worth twenty or thirty pence. But God providing <lb/>
            for his people, Bohemond soon made his appearance with a <lb/>
            great convoy, both by sea and land. The scarcity was <lb/>
            therefore converted into great plenty throughout the Chris­ <lb/>
            tian army. The attack on the city was commenced on <note type="footnote"> 1 All that could be wrung from the count was a promise on oath to <lb/>
            engage in no enterprise against the emperor's life or the integrity of his <lb/>
            states, which was far short of the oath of fealty; and even this was yielded <lb/>
            upon the implied condition of the sworn promise simultaneously given by <lb/>
            Alexius to join the crusade in person. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The lake Ascanius. </note> <pb n="94"/>

            Ascension Day,1 by erecting great engines of war to the <lb/>
            height of the fortifications. This assault continued for two <lb/>
            days, employed in endeavouring to batter down the walls. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, the Gentiles within the place resisted the attack <lb/>
            with great resolution, manfully defending their dwellings and <lb/>
            households by hurling stones and darts on the assailants, <lb/>
            while, protecting themselves with their shields, they boldly <lb/>
            exposed themselves to the shower of missiles which were <lb/>
            launched against them. The Franks, on their side, left <lb/>
            nothing untried; covering themselves with their shields <lb/>
            closely wedged, like the shell of a tortoise, from which the <lb/>
            enemy's iron hailstorm glanced off, they wearied the besieged <lb/>
            with incessant assaults. Meanwhile, the citizens sent <lb/>
            messengers imploring succour from their neighbours and <lb/>
            countrymen: "Hasten," they said, " to our aid! You can <lb/>
            enter without apprehension at the south gate, which is not <lb/>
            yet blockaded." But, by God's help, their hopes were frus­ <lb/>
            trated ; for the same day, the Saturday after the Ascension, <lb/>
            the bishop of Puy and the count of Tholouse arrived in the <lb/>
            camp, and the guard of the south gate was entrusted to <lb/>
            them by the other chiefs. The count, therefore, fell <lb/>
            suddenly on the Saracens as they advanced in blind security, <lb/>
            and his whole force, in bright array, repelled the undisci­ <lb/>
            plined horde of barbarians. The Saracens were routed with <lb/>
            disgrace, having lost many of their people, and the Franks <lb/>
            gained an easy victory. Again the citizens of Nice sum­ <lb/>
            moned their allies, assuring them on oath of the certainty of <lb/>
            their being successful; and they came boldly, furnished with <lb/>
            ropes to bind the Christians they expected to make captives. <lb/>
            But the Franks encountered the attack of the Gentiles in a <lb/>
            close column, and then charging them, routed and defeated <lb/>
            them a second time with great slaughter, and returned in <lb/>
            triumph to their camp. After this, Count Raymond and <lb/>
            Bishop Aimar, with their troops, made great exertions, and <lb/>
            assaulted the place in various ways, while, on their side, <lb/>
            the besieged citizens obstinately resisted all their attacks.</p>
          <p>At length, the Christian chiefs held a meeting, and deter­ <lb/>
            mined and agreed on a plan for carrying on the siege of <lb/>
            Nice. On one side the attack was entrusted to Bohemond <lb/>
            and Tancred, near whom was posted Duke Godfrey and his <note type="footnote"> 1 The 7th of May. </note> <pb n="95"/>

            brothers.1 Next was Robert, count of Flanders, a brave <lb/>
            soldier and most daring knight.2 Near him were stationed <lb/>
            Robert, duke of Normandy, Stephen, count of Chartres, <lb/>
            Hugh, count of St. Pol, Conan the Breton, son of Count <lb/>
            Geoffrey,3 Ralph de Guader,4 and Roger de Barneville,5 with <lb/>
            their respective followers. The count of Tholouse and the <lb/>
            bishop of Puy kept guard at the south gate. The place was <lb/>
            now so blockaded that there was no ingress or egress except <lb/>
            by the lake which washed the walls on one side. This was <lb/>
            securely navigated by the Gentiles in full view of the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians, and supplies were thus constantly introduced into the <lb/>
            place. However, the Christian army had laudably formed <lb/>
            the siege of Nice, and had skilfully disposed against it their <lb/>
            well-formed camps and stately tents in the name of Christ. <lb/>
            Splendid as was their array in arms, they were still more <lb/>
            distinguished by the lustre of their virtues. They went <lb/>
            forth to battle pure in their conduct, strong in limb, and <lb/>
            stout in heart. Carefully watching for the good of their <lb/>
            souls, they refrained from all fleshly lusts and forbidden <lb/>
            indulgences. The chiefs fought in the ranks; and, while <lb/>
            they commanded and encouraged others, mounted guard like <lb/>
            common sentinels. All things were had in common. The <note type="footnote"> 1 Bohemond and Tancred were stationed near the north gate of the <lb/>

            conducted himself as such in passing through the same provinces, and <lb/>

          <p>Meanwhile, the Turks laboured hard in defence of their <lb/>
            city, and freely went to and fro on the lake in sight of the <lb/>
            Christians. The Franks were much disturbed at this, and <lb/>
            consulted how they might deprive the Turks of the command <lb/>
            of the lake. In consequence they sent envoys to Constan­ <lb/>
            tinople, and proposed to the emperor with great ability what <lb/>
            they had planned against the enemy. The emperor on <lb/>
            hearing their proposition gave it his immediate approval, and <lb/>
            ordered that everything should be done as they requested. <lb/>
            By his command a number of oxen were hastily collected, <lb/>
            and swift vessels sailed for the port of Civitot. The Tur­ <lb/>
            copoles were also ordered to be in readiness. The boats <lb/>
            being then placed on waggons, and drawn by the oxen, with <lb/>
            vast toil, to the shore of the lake, were, during the night, <lb/>
            launched into the water, and manned by the Turcopoles. <lb/>
            At the first dawn of day, they were discovered advancing <lb/>
            in order towards the city. The citizens were astonished at <lb/>
            seeing from their battlements the lake covered with boats, <lb/>
            and began to think that perhaps succour was at hand from <lb/>
            that quarter. But when the truth appeared, they were struck <lb/>
            with consternation, and sunk into utter despair. There was <lb/>
            no hope of safety now that the city was beset both by land <lb/>
            and water. They therefore despatched messengers to the <lb/>
            emperor, earnestly beseeching him to spare them in their <lb/>
            low estate, and, by taking possession of the city which they <lb/>
            were ready to surrender to him, save them from the enemy, <lb/>
            so that they might not be exposed to pillage by foreigners. <lb/>
            On receiving this message, the emperor being secretly jealous <lb/>
            of the success of the Christians (as the event proved), yielded <lb/>
            to the entreaties of the besieged, and gave orders to Tatan' <lb/>
            his general, who had been despatched after the Crusaders <note type="footnote"> 1 This officer was not called Tatan, but Tatius. He was the son of a <lb/>
            Saracen, taken prisoner by John Comnenus, and brought up as a slave, <lb/>

            of the imperial household. The Latin historians of the Crusades, who <lb/>

            with forty thousand troops, as well as to his other officers, <lb/>
            to bring to Byzantium in safety those citizens of Nice who <lb/>
            were ready to surrender themselves and their property, and <lb/>
            to be careful that no.injury was done to the city. All was <lb/>
            done as the emperor commanded, the city was given up to <lb/>
            him, and the Gentile people were conducted uninjured to the <lb/>
            imperial city. The emperor treated the vanquished with <lb/>
            great generosity, giving them their liberty, and making the <lb/>
            poor Christians liberal presents. The city being thus surren­ <lb/>
            dered, the Crusaders drew off their forces. Numbers perished <lb/>
            there by famine and the sword, or other means, who we believe <lb/>
            attained the glory of martyrdom, as they offered their lives <lb/>
            on behalf of their persecuted brethren. Many of the Gentiles <lb/>
            also fell in various ways, whose bodies lay buried on all sides. <lb/>
            The Crusaders were detained before the place seven months <lb/>
            and three days,1 and after the city was given up to the em­ <lb/>
            peror turned their steps sorrowfully another road. In truth <lb/>
            they sorely repented having wasted so much time on the siege, <lb/>
            without having reduced the city to submit to their power as <lb/>
            a place taken by assault. If the enemy's property had fallen <lb/>
            into their hands, the necessities of the indigent would have <lb/>
            been alleviated, and some portion of the expense they had <lb/>
            incurred would have been repaid. The Crusaders did not <lb/>
            patiently bear the order of Alexius2 that they should not take <note type="footnote"> 1 The historians of the Crusades vary considerably in their accounts <lb/>
            of the duration of the siege of Nice. From those of the best informed it <lb/>

            Peter Tudebode speaks of seven weeks. Our author, who assigns it a <lb/>
            much longer continuance (52 days), has been guilty of two serious omissions, <lb/>
            that of the attack of Kilidge Arslan, to force the Crusaders to raise the <lb/>

            even to take them into his regular pay), to receive from them an important <lb/>
            city, only lately detached from his dominions, in a better condition than a <lb/>

            For ourselves, we confess, with all respect for the feeling which dictated <lb/>

            so much time, so many valuable lives, and so much treasure, in the siege <lb/>
            of Nice, if the emperor was to reap the fruits of the enterprise; nor why, if <lb/>
            it was necessary in a military point of view to dislodge the Turks in order <lb/>
            that this strong fortress might be the base of future operations, it ought not <lb/>
            to have been made the seat of a principality, vested in one of the Christian <lb/>
            chiefs, like Antioch and Edessa, instead of being entrusted to so perfidious <lb/>
            an ally as the Greek emperor. As to the question of humanity, it is <lb/>

            rated from each other into two bodies, and they spent two <lb/>
            days in their march. In one division, there were Bohemond, <lb/>
            Robert the Norman, Stephen, count of Blois, Tancred, Hugh <lb/>
            de St. Pol, Gerard de Gournai, Walter de St. Valleri <lb/>

            Riou de Loheac,5 Alan, steward of Dol,6 and several more. <lb/>
            In the other division were the count of Tholouse and the <lb/>

          <p>The same week, the Turks assembled to attack Bohe­ <lb/>

            trusting in their vast superiority of numbers, charged the <lb/>

            and they were inflamed with rage against the foreigners <lb/>
            who had dared to take Nice and ravage their territories. In <lb/>
            their ranks were to be seen Turks and Saracens, Persians <lb/>

            the innumerable hosts of the enemy threatening and insult­ <lb/>

            the glorious conflict. He also despatched swift messengers <lb/>
            to his confederates who were parted from him at some little <lb/>
            distance, urging them to hasten with all speed to his succour. <lb/>
            He commanded the foot soldiers to pitch their tents with <lb/>
            rapidity and judgment, and the cavalry to follow him and, <lb/>
            encountering the pagans, to stand, and maintain the con­ <lb/>
            flict with unabated vigour. Meanwhile the Turks rushed <lb/>
            on with horrid cries,1 and attacked the Christians with great <lb/>
            resolution, shooting their arrows, throwing their darts, and <lb/>
            some of them engaging in close fight. There was no respite <lb/>
            for the harassed crusaders, even when their bodies were reeking <lb/>
            with blood and sweat. But the Franks stood the brunt of <lb/>
            the attack without recoiling ; sometimes prudently avoiding <lb/>

            sw.ord-in-hand, expecting the arrival of the other division, <lb/>
            and never yielding a foot of ground. They sustained this <lb/>

            The women rendered essential service to the combatants by <lb/>
            running to them with pitchers of water when they were <lb/>
            dying of thirst, and giving them encouraging words, the <lb/>
            field of battle being the burning desert. The conflict was <lb/>
            maintained on both sides with the utmost desperation, and <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> JULY, 1097.] </note>Meanwhile, the other division of the army discredited the <lb/>
            account given by Bohemond's messengers, questioning the <lb/>
            reality of the attack: for they thought that there was no <lb/>
            nation which would venture to engage with even a tenth <lb/>
            part of their force. When, however, the intelligence was <lb/>
            spread among the troops, and one messenger followed <lb/>
            another with news of the battle,1 Duke Godfrey, a knight <lb/>
            always the first in action, and Count Stephen, who was <lb/>
            remarkable for his prudence and caution, together with <lb/>
            Hugh the Great, and Baldwin and Stephen, all men of great <lb/>
            intrepidity, galloped forward with their respective retainers. <lb/>
            The bishop of Pay, and Raymond, count of Tholouse, <lb/>
            marched in the rear. The crusaders, already engaged, and <lb/>
            who were now exhausted with fatigue, wondered how such <lb/>
            countless hordes could have fallen upon them so suddenly <lb/>
            and unexpectedly, and whence they came; for the dense <lb/>
            mass covered the hills and valleys, and where there was any <lb/>
            level ground it was swept by their squadrons of cavalry. <lb/>
            Still, by God's help, the Christians fought stoutly, and the <lb/>
            affair came to mortal combat at close quarters, sword- <lb/>
            in-hand. But now their comrades who had been called to <lb/>
            the rescue suddenly made their appearance. The bishop of <lb/>
            Puy, with the large body of troops under his command, <lb/>
            threatened the enemy's rear; on one side the count of <lb/>
            St. Giles, Baldwin and Eustace, galloped forward at full <lb/>
            speed. Duke Godfrey charged the right flank, having with <lb/>
            him Hugh the Great, and Robert the Fleming, a soldier <lb/>
            always prompt in action ; while Robert the Norman, Stephen <lb/>
            Count de Blois, Tancred, and Bohemond, still held the <lb/>
            ground on which they had long borne the brunt of the con­ <lb/>
            flict. The Gentiles, finding themselves now unexpectedly <lb/>
            attacked in the rear as well as in the front, were thrown <lb/>
            into confusion and took to flight without offering any fur­ <lb/>
            ther resistance. The swords of the Christians swept their <lb/>
            ranks, and multitudes perished by death in every shape. <lb/>
            Those who were able escaped to their fortresses. Thousands <lb/>
            of the barbarians fell, after fiercely combating the crusaders <lb/>
            and maintaining an obstinate conflict the whole of the day. <note type="footnote">1 Arnold de Rouex, chaplain to the duke of Normandy, conveyed the <lb/>

            horse and foot, fell in the battle. The Turks are as dexte­ <lb/>
            rous in their mode of fighting as they are daring, wielding <lb/>

            the Christians returned to spoil the enemy's camp, in which <lb/>
            they found large quantities of silver and gold. They col- <lb/>
            1ected a great number of beasts of burden, mules, horses, <lb/>
            oxen, camels, sheep, and asses, and stripped the tents of <lb/>
            their various furniture, returning to their own camp laden <lb/>
            with booty in triumph and inexpressible joy. The report of <lb/>
            this great victory spreading among strange and distant <lb/>
            nations deterred them from hostilities against the Christians, <lb/>
            whose glory was thus published in the ears of remote <lb/>
            people. All were struck with terror at their achievements, <lb/>
            and were in alarm lest they should be attacked in return.</p>
          <p>On his flight from Nice, Soliman fell in with a tribe of <lb/>
            ten thousand Arabs, to whom he described in glowing <lb/>
            colours the excessive bravery, the indomitable resolution and <lb/>
            the vast numbers and rich equipments of the Crusaders; by <lb/>
            which account he prevailed with them to join him in his <lb/>

            other Gentiles, when they came to towns and places inha­ <lb/>
            bited by the Syrian Christians, cunningly said to them: <lb/>

            their towns, and pillaged their dwellings and churches, <lb/>
            carrying off whatever valuables they possessed, as well as <lb/>
            their sons and daughters. Preceding the march of the <lb/>
            Franks, they carried on this deception, until it came to the <lb/>
            ears of the Crusaders, and they hastened to pursue them.1 <lb/>
            They now entered on an arid and uninhabitable region, in <lb/>
            which they were reduced to the last extremity by hunger <lb/>
            and thirst. If they chanced to light upon a spot where corn <lb/>
            had been sown, but was yet unripe, they plucked the ears, <lb/>

            of their beasts of burden. Famous knights were compelled <lb/>
            to march on foot, while those who had the means procured <lb/>
            oxen to carry themselves and their effects instead of car­ <lb/>
            riages. Not long afterwards they reached a fertile district, <lb/>
            abounding in food and all good things, except that it did not <lb/>
            afford a fresh supply of horses. Arriving at Iconium,3 they <lb/>
            filled their skins with water by the advice of the natives, <lb/>
            and after a day's march reached the banks of a river where <lb/>
            they halted two days to refresh themselves. The light <lb/>

            hands of the Christians, and they spent four days in it. <lb/>
            Tancred and Baldwin now'took a different route from the <lb/>

            night, the consideration of the affair was deferred till the <lb/>

            came to the camp, and surrendering themselves and their <lb/>
            property, chose Tancred for their prince. This gave rise to <lb/>
            a serious dispute between the Christian chiefs, Baldwin, who <lb/>
            commanded the largest part of the troops, contending for <lb/>
            giving up the place to plunder, or at least for requiring one <lb/>
            half of all it contained. On the other hand, Tancred, whose <lb/>
            character was moderate, preferred abandoning the conquest <lb/>
            of the city to pillaging the citizens who had so readily com­ <lb/>
            mitted themselves to his care. He, therefore, gave the <lb/>
            signal for the march, and at the sound of the trumpets drew <lb/>
            off his forces, somewhat annoyed, and Baldwin alone occu­ <lb/>

            count of Tholouse that the Turks who were in possession of <lb/>
            Antioch, had deserted it, and fled. Consulting, therefore, <lb/>

          <p>AT the first dawn of day, the army struck their tents and <lb/>

            on Wednesday the twelfth of the calends of November <lb/>
            [the 21st of October],3 that they pitched their camp before <lb/>
            the city, and they blockaded it strictly until the third of the <lb/>
            nones [the 3rd] of June, on the side of three of the gates <lb/>
            The other quarter of the city4 was not invested, because it <lb/>

            besiegers could establish themselves. The consternation into <lb/>
            which the inhabitants of Antioch and their neighbours were <lb/>
            thrown was such that no one dared to encounter the pur­ <lb/>
            veyors' for the Christian army; all was quiet therefore for <lb/>
            nearly fifteen days. The country about Antioch, being a <lb/>
            fertile valley, is very productive, being full of vineyards, <lb/>
            abounding with corn and fruit, and shady groves, and pleasant <lb/>
            gardens, and rich meadows. A number of Armenian and <lb/>
            Syrian Christians who were at the beck of the Turks, pretend­ <lb/>
            ing to make their escape from the place, went boldly to the <lb/>
            camp, as mendicants, and having remarked what was passing <lb/>
            returned and reported it to the Turks, to the great injury <lb/>
            of the Crusaders.2 For the garrison of Antioch having thus <lb/>
            learnt the plans of their enemies, began to grow bold, straiten­ <lb/>
            ing the pilgrims by attacks, cutting off those who were not <lb/>
            on their guard, and molesting them by robberies and other <lb/>
            means. They beset all the roads in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            and shut out the Christians from receiving any supplies by <lb/>
            sea or over the mountains ; so that those who were encamped <lb/>
            without the place were blockaded worse than those within. <lb/>
            There was a castle in the neighbourhood called Arech,3 pretty <lb/>
            well fortified, from which the Turks made irruptions on the <lb/>
            Christians, many of whom perished by the secret attacks of <lb/>
            the country people. The Christian chiefs, being much grieved <lb/>
            at this, marched out of their camp, and offering battle to the <lb/>
            Turks pretended to fly and artfully led them to the spot where <lb/>
            Bohemond and his troops were placed in ambush. Two <lb/>

            of a force of twenty thousand men, both cavalry and infantry <lb/>

            The Arabs and Turks from Jerusalem and Damascus, and <lb/>
            other cities of various provinces, had assembled in a body <lb/>
            for the relief of Antioch.3 Hearing, therefore, that the <lb/>

            in the hope of being able to crush them, as they reckoned <lb/>
            them to be few in number and mere adventurers. They <lb/>
            consequently in the darkness of the night, posted two bodies <lb/>
            of troops in ambuscade, one in front the other in the rear of <lb/>
            the crusaders. But the warlike Count of Flanders and <lb/>

            crusaders. On that occasion the Ishmaelites fought with <lb/>
            great fury, and many of the Christians were slain. The <lb/>

            ascended some other lofty hills. But the country was now <lb/>
            so devastated that many returned empty. Their toil had <lb/>

            so many thousand souls any great length of time. Some <lb/>
            began to think of deserting the camp. William Carpenter <lb/>
            and Peter the Hermit crept out by stealth, but Tancred <lb/>
            discovered and arrested them, and after a sharp rebuke <lb/>
            compelled them to return to the army. Bohemond also, <lb/>
            before whom they were brought, gave them bitter words and <lb/>
            treated them with the contempt they deserved.1 Men and <lb/>
            horses were now in equal want of food, and despair of relief <lb/>
            began to prevail. So many of the horses had failed that in <lb/>
            the whole of that immense army, scarcely a thousand <lb/>
            mounted knights and men-at-arms could be found. Tatan, <lb/>
            the Greek, the commander of the emperor's troops, was so <lb/>
            appalled by the prospect of perishing in the common cala­ <lb/>
            mity, that he undertook a mission to the emperor, and after <lb/>
            making great promises to assist his companions as soon as <lb/>
            he could, took his leave and never returned.2 He faithfully <lb/>
            reported to his master Alexius the courage and constancy, <lb/>
            and the great privations of the besiegers, and exhorted Guy, <lb/>
            son of Duke Guiscard,3 and the noble chiefs of the Franks <lb/>
            who had followed the first crusaders with numerous troops, <lb/>
            but were honourably detained by the emperor at Constanti- <note type="footnote"> 1 Every kind of reproach was heaped upon the deserters. William <lb/>
            Carpenter, viscount of Melun, was reminded in no gentle terms of the <lb/>
            dishonourable termination of his campaign against the Moors in Spain : <lb/>
            " Probably, wretch, you were ready to betray these knights and soldiers of <lb/>
            Christ, as you did before in Spain," were the words of Bohemond. </note><note type="footnote"> Guy Troussel was also one of the deserters, and soon afterwards <lb/>
            succeeded in making his escape, though he had taken the most solemn <lb/>

            distinctly how matters stood, the emperor assembled a <lb/>
            powerful force, and put himself in march with a large convoy <lb/>
            of provisions to succour the crusaders; but evil counsels, as <lb/>
            will appear hereafter, prevented the accomplishment of his <lb/>
            laudable enterprise.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the crusaders, reduced to extremity, deserted <lb/>
            privately, every one going where he thought he could find <lb/>
            the means of existence ; but no one dared to make for the <lb/>
            sea-coast, as the roads and paths on that side were strictly <lb/>
            watched. Fresh reports were also brought that a countless <lb/>
            host of Turks were advancing, and that the whole army was <lb/>
            threatened with immediate destruction. It was said that <lb/>
            the numbers of the enemy were so great that a space measur­ <lb/>
            ing several furlongs square would not contain them. The <lb/>
            crusaders trembled with alarm, and many of them drooped <lb/>
            their fainting heads. But the nobles still dared to talk of <lb/>
            fighting; and assembling in council mutually encouraged <lb/>
            each other. Finding this, the wise Bohemond warmly con­ <lb/>
            gratulated them, and proposing judicious measures, encou­ <lb/>
            raged them to resistance with much eloquence. He gave <lb/>
            orders that the infantry should remain in the camp and <lb/>
            narrowly watch the city gates, lest if they were opened the <lb/>
            citizens might make sallies at pleasure. All the knights <lb/>
            then armed themselves, invoking the name of the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus, and having strengthened their good resolutions by <lb/>
            receiving the holy sacrament, set forward, followed by the <lb/>
            lamentations of all orders. No one had any assurance of his <lb/>
            own safety, whether priest or woman, common soldier or <lb/>
            knight. Both parties despaired of ever seeing each other <lb/>
            again. Those who were dear to each other embraced by <lb/>
            turns, and all were melted to tears. The knights established <lb/>
            themselves on the bank of the river anciently called Daphne,1 <lb/>
            which flows between Antioch and a lake, having heard that <lb/>
            the Turks had collected their forces at the castle of Arech, on <lb/>
            the further side of the Iron Bridge. The watchful chiefs of <lb/>
            the crusaders assembled before day-light, and at the first <lb/>
            blush of dawn sent out wary horsemen to reconnoitre the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Daphne, now called the Doueir, is two hours' march from <lb/>

            enemy. They soon returned shouting that the Turks were <lb/>
            at hand, and were formed in two strong divisions ; they had <lb/>
            seen them moving rapidly forward from the other bank of <lb/>
            the river. The Christian chiefs then discussed the order of <lb/>
            battle, which they determined to leave altogether to Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond's judgment. He therefore divided his force into six <lb/>
            troops, five of which were to advance and bear the brunt of <lb/>
            the enemy's onset, repelling it by a spirited charge, while <lb/>
            Bohemond, with his own troop, was to bring up the rear at <lb/>
            a short distance, as a reserve to support the others as <lb/>
            occasion required, and in case the Turks should rout the <lb/>
            foremost troops to be ready to meet the full tide of the <lb/>
            battle. The clarions sounded the charge, and it was echoed <lb/>
            back by the trumpets of the Christian cavalry, and with <lb/>
            loud cries on both sides the fierce battle began. Both <lb/>
            parties closed hand-to-hand; armour clashed against armour, <lb/>
            and shield against shield, and swords were hacked against <lb/>
            broken spears. The reserves of the Turks were brought up <lb/>
            and made a desperate charge on the Christians. The Franks <lb/>
            could not sustain such attacks from so many assembled <lb/>
            nations, and began to stagger and give way. The cries were <lb/>
            fearful, and the air was darkened by clouds of whizzing darts. <lb/>
            Bohemond who saw the whole, watching it as if he was all <lb/>
            eyes, cried with a groan, “Christ, support thy faithful ones!" <lb/>
            He then added, " Robert (Robert Fitz- Gerard carried his <lb/>
            pennon1), put spurs to your horse, and hasten undaunted to <lb/>
            the succour of the Christians, who are giving way! Remem­ <lb/>
            ber, I pray you, our race, and do not tarnish the glorious <lb/>
            name of Frenchmen! Be confident that we shall speedily <lb/>
            have aid from Heaven, but it is God's will, that like brave <lb/>
            champions, we should merit as well as receive the reward of <lb/>
            courage."</p>
          <p>Robert having devoutly fortified himself with the sign of <lb/>
            the cross, galloped forward, surrounded by an auxiliary <lb/>
            troop, and like a brave knight fell on the fiercest of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Bohemond's pennon was red, the colour of the ensigns of Normandy <lb/>

            Turks, closing with the infidels so near that the fringe of <lb/>
            Bohemond's pennon floated in their faces, and they recoiled <lb/>
            a few paces as he shouted his war cry. The Franks regained <lb/>
            their courage at this desperate charge and the cries which <lb/>
            accompanied it, and made a combined attack on the Turkish <lb/>
            squadrons. Loud was the clash of arms, and sparks were <lb/>
            struck from the brazen helmets; wounds followed wounds <lb/>
            and the earth was dyed with purple blood. On every side <lb/>
            were seen intestines torn out, decapitated heads and dis­ <lb/>
            membered bodies. The Turks were struck with panic, and <lb/>
            their troops at first staggered and then took to flight, pur­ <lb/>
            sued by the Franks beyond the Iron-bridge. The Turks lost <lb/>
            a vast number of horsemen, but there was no infantry engaged. <lb/>
            The crusaders returned in triumph to their camp, bringing <lb/>
            with them a number of horses of which they had the greatest <lb/>
            need, and much spoil which they had taken in the battle. <lb/>
            The Turks retired, shamefully discomfited, to their castle of <lb/>
            Arech which they dismantled and burnt, and then continued <lb/>
            their retreat. The Armenians and Syrians, discovering this, <lb/>
            made haste to occupy the defiles, and put many of them to <lb/>
            the sword, but some they brought away alive. They also <lb/>
            gave up the castle of Arech to the crusaders. The Franks <lb/>
            brought into the camp a hundred heads of the slain, for the <lb/>
            encouragement of their own army and to terrify the besieged. <lb/>
            All this was seen by the envoys of the emir of Babylonia, <lb/>
            who had been sent on a mission to Antioch, and pitched <lb/>
            their tents near the crusaders' camp.1 The troops who had <lb/>
            remained in their intrenchments during the battle were <lb/>
            engaged all day in assaulting the garrison of Antioch, and <lb/>
            constantly watched the three gates of the city to prevent <lb/>
            their making sallies. The battle was fought on Tuesday, <lb/>
            the ides2 of February [9th] being the day preceding the first <lb/>
            day of Lent.</p>
          <p>Though the people of Antioch had been defeated in every <lb/>
            engagement, and they had sustained considerable losses by <lb/>
            death, wounds or captivity, the numbers of the citizens were <lb/>
            so great, that being now inflamed to the highest pitch of fury <lb/>
            their attacks on the Christians were more impetuous, they <note type="footnote"> 1 The ambassadors of Aboulcassam Mostali, the sixth Fatimite Sultan <lb/>

            never suffered the camp to be at rest, but made frequent <lb/>
            sallies in which blood was continually shed. Besides this, <lb/>
            the crusaders were under many disadvantages, being neither <lb/>
            able to raise the siege nor to leave the camp for any consi­ <lb/>
            derable distance. The country round was become such a <lb/>
            desert that it yielded them no means of subsistence, while <lb/>
            the Turks who knew its resources better were able to <lb/>
            procure supplies, and always ready to fall on the Christians <lb/>
            by surprise. Moreover, there was not a city, castle or town, <lb/>
            nor man nor woman, nor any living creature that was not <lb/>
            in hostility to the crusaders. All access was obstructed, <lb/>
            that traders might not come and traffic with them, so that <lb/>
            they were exposed to the horrors of famine.</p>
          <p>In consequence, the nobles anxiously consulted on the <lb/>
            means of relieving the people, and determined to fortify a <lb/>
            mosque in order to interdict the Turks from passing the <lb/>
            bridge.1 It was resolved that Duke Bohemond and Raymond, <lb/>
            count of Tholouse, should proceed to Port St. Simeon,2 and <lb/>
            bring up the troops who were waiting there to join in the <lb/>
            siege. Those who remained in the camp set to work in a <lb/>
            body, and under arms, to begin building the fort.3 On the <lb/>
            other hand, the Turks equal in numbers and not less deter­ <lb/>
            mined than the Franks attacked the workmen, and their <lb/>
            onset was so severe that they drove them off and killed <lb/>
            many of them. Discovering also that two of the principal <lb/>
            chiefs had left the camp for the port of St. Simeon, they <lb/>
            laid in wait for them on a well-chosen spot and made a fierce <lb/>
            attack. The Saracens aimed at the Christians with arrows, <note type="footnote"> 1 The mosque, where we shall presently find the Mussulmans burying <lb/>

            all the Crusaders assisted in the operations, which consisted in throwing up <lb/>
            an immense earthwork as well as a wall and two towers. It appears from <lb/>
            this that it was rather an entrenched camp than a fort or castle, and the <lb/>

            them down without mercy, and uttered loud cries, gnashing <lb/>
            their teeth. A body of men were returning with the chiefs <lb/>
            who were neither well armed nor used to war. The small <lb/>
            band of crusaders were unable to withstand the fierce attack <lb/>
            of their raving enemies, and after losing more than a thou­ <lb/>

            shortest road, arrived before the count of Tholouse, and <lb/>
            gave an exact statement of the losses he had incurred. The <lb/>
            crusaders were more exasperated than alarmed at the <lb/>
            intelligence ; and, roused to vengeance for the loss of their <lb/>
            comrades, made a general attack on the Turks with great <lb/>
            spirit. On both sides they fought resolutely. The Turks <lb/>
            had crossed the bridge, when the Christians boldly met <lb/>
            them, and, contrary to their expectations, received them <lb/>
            with great fury, and falling upon them, forced them to seek <lb/>
            safety in flight, but there was no possibility of escaping the <lb/>
            swords of their pursuers. In the rear of the fugitives there <lb/>
            was a narrow bridge, over a deep and rapid river.1 There <lb/>
            was no other passage; no one could ford, and few could <lb/>
            swim across the stream in the neighbourhood of the bridge. <lb/>
            Great numbers of the Turkish horsemen crowded together on <lb/>
            the crown of the arch, and the Franks, eager for victory and <lb/>
            revenge of their comrades' deaths, cut them down as if they <lb/>
            were beasts of prey. In their insatiable fury they charged <lb/>
            with their lances and engaged in close combat with their <lb/>
            swords. Some they forced into the river, and others they <lb/>
            mortally wounded. The stream was dyed with blood, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The thickest of the fight appears to have been on the bridge itself, <lb/>
            which was not yet commanded by the works in progress, under the count <lb/>
            of Tholouse. </note> <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CII.IX. </note> <lb/>
            the bank was encumbered with corpses. The gallant God­ <lb/>
            frey drove his sword across the back of a warrior of enormous <lb/>
            stature, who wore golden armour, as if he had been a <lb/>
            succulent leek. The head, and shoulders, and upper part <lb/>
            of the body, as far as the belt, fell into the river, while the <lb/>
            lower part remained on his spirited horse, which, no longer <lb/>
            held by the reins, but still pricked by the spurs, galloped <lb/>
            through the foremost of the throng of fugitives to the city <lb/>
            gate.1 All who were on the battlements and bulwarks <lb/>
            witnessing this spectacle were filled with dismay, and, amid <lb/>
            their grief, told strange tales of the wonderful exploit of the <lb/>
            stout knight. A day of death in every form, a day in which <lb/>
            scarce any of the assembled multitudes would escape with <lb/>
            their lives, lowered upon the pagans. From the tops of the <lb/>
            towers and walls, the women looked down on the disasters <lb/>
            of their countrymen, and envied the successes of the Franks. <lb/>
            In that battle twelve chiefs, who are called emirs, and <lb/>
            fifteen hundred distinguished horsemen were slain, the rest <lb/>
            were deterred by their fears from attacking the Christians. <lb/>
            Night put an end to the conflict, and the crusaders, rejoicing <lb/>
            in the name of Christ, returned triumphantly to their <lb/>
            camp, bringing with them many horses and much booty. <lb/>
            The next day the Turks collected their dead, and interred <lb/>
            them in a mosque over the bridge, before the city gate. <lb/>
            They buried with them their mantles and rich garments, <lb/>
            adding, for the use of the deceased, their bows and quivers, <lb/>
            and a large quantity of bezants. The Crusaders discovering <lb/>
            this, dug up the bodies, and, having pillaged all the valuables, <lb/>
            threw the mortal remains with contempt into one deep <lb/>
            grave. They also drove to the city gate four mules' loads <lb/>
            of the heads of the slain, to the inexpressible grief of the <lb/>
            citizens and the Babylonish envoys.</p>
          <p>Three days afterwards, the crusaders began to erect the <lb/>
            fortifications which have been already mentioned, and con­ <lb/>
            structed them of stones removed from the graves they had <note type="footnote"> I Henry of Huntingdon and Matthew Paris, who both relate this asto­ <lb/>

            disturbed.' When the works were sufficiently advanced, <lb/>
            the Franks began to restrain the enemy within narrower <lb/>
            bounds. They also commanded free communication with <lb/>
            the hilly country, and were able to procure more liberal <lb/>
            supplies of forage and other provender. Still they had not <lb/>
            as yet pitched their tents on the other side the river, and the <lb/>
            Turks had free egress in that quarter.2</p>
          <p>A fort was therefore erected by common consent on the <lb/>
            other side of the river,3 and the magnanimous Tancred <lb/>
            engaged with the chiefs of the Franks to undertake to <lb/>
            guard it, all the others declining its custody. Putting him­ <lb/>
            self, therefore, at the head of his fellow soldiers and retainers, <lb/>
            he manned the works, closely blockaded the city, and kept <lb/>
            strict watch over the roads and approaches. One day he <lb/>
            caught the Syrians and Armenians conveying, as they were <lb/>
            wont, large stores of supplies into the place, and instantly <lb/>
            attacking them, got possession of the whole convoy, which <lb/>
            he conducted in triumph to the camp. The inhabitants of <lb/>
            Antioch and their adherents became now much alarmed, <lb/>
            having suffered such frequent disasters and losses.' The <note type="footnote"> 1 The tombstones of the Turkish cemetery furnished the materials for <lb/>

            Peter Tudebode calls the devil's temple. Our author omits mentioning the <lb/>
            conflicts which took place on the bridge after these works were completed, <lb/>
            as well as that at the same time they erected this fortification, the crusaders <lb/>
            blocked up with timber and masses of rock, the bridge at the Dog-gate, <lb/>
            which stood at the N.W., opposite the camp of the count of Tholouse, by <lb/>
            which the besieged were constantly making very annoying and murderous <lb/>
            sallies. This bridge formed a causeway over a marsh which lay between <lb/>
            the city gate and the camp of the Crusaders. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author here makes a serious mistake. The formation of the <lb/>
            entrenched camp entrusted to the count of St. Giles, had for its express <lb/>
            object to exclude the besieged from the right bank of the Orontes, in which <lb/>
            it succeeded; and it is of that he means to speak, as Tancred's fort was <lb/>
            erected on the other side of the river. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This was another fort constructed, not as our author says, on the other <lb/>

            ruins are still called the convent of St. George, which was probably the <lb/>
            name of the monastery. Tancred engaged to build and defend it for 400 <lb/>
            silver marks. According to William of Tyre, he would have 100 marks <lb/>
            for the building, and 40 marks per month for the pay of the garrison. </note><note type="footnote"> 4. Ordericus, as well as most historians of the crusades, have neglected to <lb/>

            </note>Franks were of a fierce spirit, naturally daring, and well <lb/>
            trained in the art of war, and in consequence had manfully <lb/>
            undertaken this expedition into distant regions and among <lb/>
            strange nations. In their difficulties they had recourse to <lb/>
            God, invoked his aid in seasons of distress, and did frequent <lb/>
            penitence for their human infirmities.</p>
          <p>One Pirrus Datianus,1 of Turkish origin, who held three <lb/>
            towers in the city of Antioch, had formed a connection with <lb/>
            Bohemond, of whom he had heard good reports, by means <lb/>
            of confidential messengers who went to and fro between <lb/>
            them. They had even frequent conferences through faithful <lb/>
            interpreters, and signals, which were agreed on. Bohemond <lb/>
            on some occasions tried to convert this person to Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity; sometimes he used all the arguments he could think <lb/>
            of to induce him to betray the city to the besiegers, and left <lb/>
            no means untried which would suggest themselves to a man <lb/>
            of sagacity. At one time he impressed on him the calamities <lb/>
            which impended on the citizens, at another he invited him <lb/>
            to become a Christian by holding forth the rich rewards <lb/>
            which were promised by the Divine goodness. At last <lb/>
            Pirrus was persuaded by his noble friend to give him <lb/>
            possession of the three towers,2 promising also to deliver <lb/>
            his son as an hostage, and recommending him to lose no <lb/>
            time in completing the enterprise. The prudent Bohemond <lb/>
            concealed the secret satisfaction he now felt, and suffered <lb/>
            no signs of it to appear in his countenance and conversation. <lb/>
            He discoursed with the chiefs on the difficulty of taking the <note type="footnote"> ever, one of the most interesting episodes connected with the siege of <lb/>
            Antioch. According to Gilon's metrical narrative, the wife of this warrior <lb/>
            must have been a daughter of Hugh the Great, named Humberge, who is <lb/>
            not mentioned by the genealogists. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Read Phirouz, and see in Ralph of Caen the motives which that <lb/>

            These two towers, the ruins of which may still be seen, were not as lofty as <lb/>
            those on the south ramparts, and might be escaladed without much <lb/>
            difficulty. That of the Three Sisters is the first to the south of the gate of <lb/>

            city, the weariness of the protracted siege, and the exemplary <lb/>
            constancy of the victorious army, and he proposed that the <lb/>
            dominion of Antioch and its territory should be conferred, <lb/>
            by common consent of the chiefs, on that one of their <lb/>
            number who should obtain possession of it either for money, <lb/>
            or by force of arms, or by fair means, or stratagem. The <lb/>
            chiefs were far from lending a willing ear to this proposition, <lb/>
            alleging that it should belong to them all, as they had con­ <lb/>
            tributed by their joint exertions to the success of the <lb/>
            enterprise. After hearing the opinion of several of his <lb/>
            companions, Bohemond observed a prudent silence, waiting <lb/>
            for a favourable opportunity of accomplishing his object. <lb/>
            Soon afterwards common report, the forerunner of evil, <lb/>
            noised in the camp that the Turks, Publicans,1 Azulans, <lb/>
            Azimites,2 and several other heathen nations, were on the <lb/>
            march, and had leagued to make war on the crusaders. <lb/>
            The truth of these reports of imminent peril was soon con­ <lb/>
            firmed by messengers who could be depended on. Thereupon <lb/>
            the Christian chiefs, having consulted together, made a <lb/>
            voluntary offer to Bohemond in the following terms: " You <lb/>
            see the critical position of affairs; if, therefore, you can get <lb/>
            possession of the city either by fair words or for money, <lb/>
            with all the assistance we can give you, it shall be yours by <lb/>
            common consent, save only the fealty which, with your <lb/>
            approbation, we swore to the emperor. If he keeps his <lb/>

            the Manichees, who took the name of Paulicians, from one Paul, who <lb/>
            had introduced some innovations into their creed. Being favoured by the <lb/>
            emperor Nicephorus (802—July 25, 811) they founded a small state in <lb/>
            Armenia. But, being persecuted by his successor in 812, and the empress <lb/>
            Theodora in 848, they placed themselves under the protection of the <lb/>
            caliphs, who gave them settlements in Cappadocia and Armenia the Less. <lb/>
            There is a very curious letter from Lewis the Younger to the pope (Hist. <lb/>
            de Fr., xv. 790), which proves that the doctrines of this sect had not only <lb/>
            reached the coast of France, which was always in communication with the <lb/>
            East, but had penetrated into the most northern provinces of the kingdom. <lb/>
            Several Manichean and Gnostic, sects were also introduced in consequence <lb/>
            of the crusades, and planted in various parts of the country. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Azimitea, a name given by the schismatic Greeks to the Latin catholics, <lb/>

          <p>In consequence, Bohemond had frequent communications <lb/>
            with Pirrus, who, nothing loth, sent him his son as hostage. <lb/>
            Let your herald," said he, " proclaim aloud throughout <lb/>

            tion to-day for entering the country of the Saracens to- <lb/>

            our project will be concealed from both sides. When our <lb/>
            people understand that the main body of the enemy is gone <lb/>
            on a distant expedition, the strictness of their night-watch <lb/>
            will be relaxed; do you then hasten with great secrecy to fix <lb/>
            scaling-ladders to the walls, and without making any noise, <lb/>
            mount boldly, and take possession of the towers I have pro­ <lb/>
            mised to deliver to you. Then take your measures for com­ <lb/>
            pleting the enterprise; use your swords, and be not so <lb/>
            stupid as to neglect any thing which ought to be done. I <lb/>
            shall remain on the watch myself, alive to all that passes, <lb/>
            and anxiously expecting your arrival."</p>
          <p>Bohemond, therefore, ordered his herald, who was called <lb/>
            Mala-Corona, to proclaim through the camp that all the <lb/>
            troops were to proceed on the morrow to ravage the enemy's <lb/>
            country. However, he entrusted the entire secret to Duke <lb/>
            Godfrey, to the count of Flanders, and the duke of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, and the count of Thoulouse, and bishop of Puy, and <lb/>
            some of the other chiefs; Tancred and his counsellors had <lb/>
            been privy to the whole affair from the beginning.”1 Ste­ <lb/>
            phen of Chartres was absent, being, as he said, detained by <lb/>

            before dawn near the city, having reached it by the nearest <lb/>
            roads. Meanwhile, Bohemond gave directions to his chosen <lb/>
            followers to convey with great caution the scaling-ladders he <lb/>
            had prepared to the wall, and mounting them confidently <lb/>

            of Paganus was the first to mount, though in considerable <lb/>
            trepidation; he was followed by Fulcher of Chartres,1 Roger <lb/>
            de Barneville, Geoffrey Parented, de Castro Secred,2 and <lb/>
            others to the number of about sixty, who were cautiously <lb/>
            admitted by Pirrus and lodged in his towers. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, he saw that no more followed, he was in great distress, <lb/>
            and exclaimed, it is said, in his mother-tongue: Heu! Heu! <lb/>
            Mikro Francos echomen ;3 that is, we have few Franks. Upon <lb/>
            this the Lombard hastily descended the ladder, and called <lb/>
            from above to Bohemond, who was waiting below: " What <lb/>
            are you doing ? Are you asleep ? Send up instantly all <lb/>
            you intend, for we are already in possesion of these towers <lb/>

              thought, and a great number mounting the ladder, estab­ <lb/>
              lished themselves on the summit, and occupied, under the <lb/>
              guidance of Pirrus, seven more towers. Cutting down <lb/>
              every one they found within, they spread themselves along <lb/>
              the walls, and rushed shouting through the streets, giving <lb/>
              no quarter to all they met. The inhabitants, weary with <lb/>
              the evils of a long siege, were roused with difficulty, and <lb/>
              issued from their houses half asleep and unarmed. In this <lb/>
              drowsy condition, and confused by the shouts of the assail­ <lb/>
              ants they rushed wildly out, unprepared for action, and, not <lb/>
              knowing what was going on, mistook enemies for friends; <lb/>
              so that wherever they appeared, they were struck down and <lb/>
              butchered like sheep. Even the uterine brother of Pirrus <lb/>
              was killed among the rest.' Meanwhile, so many crowded <lb/>
              on the ladder to mount the walls, that it slipped down and <lb/>
              was broken, so that none of the others who were waiting <lb/>
              below at the foot of the walls could render any assistance to <lb/>
              their comrades fighting above. But in their distress, a <lb/>
              remedy was supplied by the mercy of God; for by his pro­ <lb/>
              vidence they found not far from the ladder, on feeling to <lb/>
              the left, a gate2 which they had seen some days before when <lb/>
              reconnoitring the ground, and breaking it down forced an <lb/>
              entrance. Then the cries grew louder, and the Christians <lb/>
              had freer scope for fighting their way, while the Turks, over­ <lb/>
              come with sleep and wine, were plunged into the deeper sleep <lb/>
              of death. Endeavouring to escape the perils that threatened <lb/>
              then., they encountered the Christian troops, and when <lb/>
              seeking to avoid their attacks, rushed on immediate death <lb/>
              in some other quarter. By Bohemond's orders his standard <lb/>

            with their whole force. Wherever the Turks were found con­ <lb/>

            wealthy, and ambitious of glory. He had received permission <lb/>

            confidence in his resources, having countless multitudes of <lb/>
            many nations under his command. The king of Damascus' <lb/>
            and the emir of Jerusalem,3 were his allies, and Turks and <lb/>
            Agarenes, Arabs and Publicans, Azimites, Curds and Persians, <lb/>
            with three thousand Agulans followed his standard. The <lb/>
            Agulans wore steel armour, impenetrable by arrows or darts, <lb/>
            and used no other arms but swords in their battles. This <lb/>

            bound with iron fetters and found in chains at the end of <lb/>
            the war.4 The Agarenes took some miserable arms from a <lb/>
            few poor wretches, such as a rusty sword, a small lance, and <lb/>
            a useless bow, and sent them in derision of the Franks, to <lb/>

            arrived on foot, their hands and feet excoriated, with many <lb/>

            their alarming reports, giving out that the Turks had <lb/>
            re-taken Antioch and massacred all the Christians. On <lb/>

            cables, and leaving their anchors, put out to sea, hoisting <lb/>
            their sails obliquely to the wind; others, more slow in <lb/>
            their movements, dissembled their intentions; but all were <lb/>
            filled with alarm and consternation. In the midst of this, <lb/>
            the Turks who watched the coast, suddenly made their <lb/>
            appearance, and putting to the sword the timid sailors, <lb/>
            unprepared for defence, pillaged the ships which remained <lb/>
            in port, and setting them on fire, massacred the cowards <lb/>
            without ceremony.</p>
          <p>The brave defenders of the city stood their ground all <lb/>
            day against the attacks of the Turks, and by a sudden <lb/>
            thought of the chiefs, ran up a loose wall of rough stones <lb/>
            without mortar between the town and the citadel.2 This <lb/>
            useful barricade afforded shelter to the Christians in their <lb/>
            defence of the place, while it seriously checked the assaults <lb/>
            of the Turks. The Franks manned the wall with great <lb/>
            zeal, constantly armed for battle, and neither indulging in <lb/>
            sleep, nor occupying themselves with any other cares. <lb/>

            a serene countenance commanded the priest to publicly <lb/>
            rebuke the people and call them to repentance; and then, <lb/>
            when they were truly converted, to promise in the name <lb/>
            of God that divine help should be afforded them in their <lb/>
            need within five days. The priest affirmed his report of <lb/>
            this vision on oath upon the holy gospels and the crucifix, <lb/>
            before the bishop of Puy and all the people. The multitude <lb/>
            immediately gave way to lamentations, and exhorted <lb/>
            one another to the confession of their sins. They were <lb/>
            seen on all sides praying in the churches, with tears in <lb/>
            their eyes and ashes on their heads and naked feet, implor­ <lb/>
            ing help and counsel from the Lord. The chiefs all swore, <lb/>
            by a unanimous resolution, that not one of them while he <lb/>
            lived would retire from the confederation until he had <lb/>
            reached Jerusalem and kissed the holy sepulchre of Christ. <lb/>
            Tancred also swore that as long as he had fifty soldiers he <lb/>
            would never abandon the expedition to Jerusalem. This <lb/>
            declaration much animated the Christians, restoring their <lb/>
            courage and filling them with joy.</p>
          <p>Peter Abraham, a Provencal clerk, related the following <lb/>
            vision to his companions. " During the siege of Antioch," <lb/>
            he said, " when we were undergoing much suffering and <lb/>
            severe privations, St. Andrew the apostle appeared to me, <lb/>
            and upon my asking his name, told it, and taking me to the <lb/>
            church of St. Peter in this city,1 pointed to a certain spot, <lb/>
            and said, ' I wish you to know that when you shall be in <lb/>
            possession of Antioch, you will find here the spear which <lb/>
            pierced the Lord the Saviour's side on the cross. This <note type="footnote"> I AT. Pojoulat could find no vestiges of this church, nor, indeed, of any <lb/>
            other remains of the Christian monuments in Antioch. </note> <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin"> 1098.] </note> <lb/>
            weapon is very holy, and the Christians ought especially to <lb/>
            revere it.' With these words tlfe apostle vanished, and I <lb/>
            had not confidence enough in any one to reveal the vision. <lb/>
            On the city being taken, the apostle again appeared to me <lb/>
            and said, ' Faint-hearted man, why have you not removed <lb/>
            the spear ?' I replied, ‘ My lord, if I should tell of it, who <lb/>
            would believe me ?' ' Despair not,' said the apostle, ‘ but <lb/>
            know for certain that all I have said and shown you is very <lb/>
            true. This revelation will confer great benefits on the <lb/>
            harassed Christians, as it will inspire them with a holy <lb/>
            confidence in this spear. Within five days the Lord will <lb/>
            visit them, and deliver them by his power from the hands <lb/>
            of their enemies.'" Peter made known this divine revelation <lb/>
            to his companions, but the people disbelieved him, and <lb/>
            laughed at his assertions. However he persisted in them, <lb/>
            and confirmed them by his oath, and the people at last <lb/>
            placed confidence in him, and recovered courage to bear <lb/>
            their sufferings.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Turks in the castle made frequent sallies <lb/>
            on the Franks, which they resisted with all their might. <lb/>
            In the first conflict Roger de Barneville was slain,2 and <lb/>
            buried by the Christians in the church of St. Peter, with <lb/>
            deep sorrow, for he was a Norman of great distinction, and <lb/>
            a handsome and gallant knight. On one occasion, the <lb/>
            Turks blockaded three Christians in one of the towers, and <lb/>
            the Franks, worn out with their distresses, could afford them <lb/>
            no relief. However, two of them though severely wounded, <lb/>
            contrived to make their escape from the tower, and Hugh <lb/>
            de Forsennat, a brave warrior belonging to the troop of Good­ <lb/>
            frey de Monte-Scabioso, was left alone, and stoutly defended <lb/>
            himself the whole day. He cut down two Turks with <lb/>
            his own hand, having no one to support him, and singly <lb/>
            withstood the attacks of his assailants. He was, indeed, a <lb/>
            bold and resolute man, and deserved praise more than any <lb/>
            of the combatants. But the spirit of our people must have <lb/>
            been then broken by their severe disasters, when they saw <lb/>
            a comrade fighting all day single-handed without attempting <lb/>
            to succour him, and heard his cries without answering them. <note type="footnote"> 1 It was not by the Turks from the citadel, but those who were encamped <lb/>
            outside the walls, in one of whose attacks Roger de Barneville fell as curly <lb/>
            us the 6th of May, probably in the marsh near the Dog',,-gate. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            When the chiefs summoned the soldiers to action, they did <lb/>
            not appear; when the trumpets sounded, they concealed <lb/>
            themselves in the houses. Nay, helpless and fainting, they <lb/>
            shrunk from the contest they had long desired, and were so <lb/>
            disheartened and reckless that they desired death.</p>
          <p>Bohemond and the other chiefs, perceiving that the <lb/>
            courage of the troops had so entirely failed that they could <lb/>
            not even prevail on them to man the wall between the castle <lb/>
            and the city, set fire to the town in order to drive the <lb/>
            skulking cowards from the houses and hiding places in which <lb/>
            they concealed themselves.1 The fire was lighted in that <lb/>
            part of the city where the palace of Cassian towered over <lb/>
            the rest, and it continued burning from the third hour of <lb/>
            day to midnight. About two thousand houses and churches <lb/>
            were laid in ruins. At last, the flames went out in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the wind becoming calm. When the fire <lb/>
            penetrated to the lodgings of the Christians, after hastily <lb/>
            snatching up their booty, they were now compelled to join <lb/>
            their chiefs, who assigned to each his station at the city <lb/>
            gates to keep watch and ward. Then a severe conflict took <lb/>
            place between the Franks and the Turks in the citadel; <lb/>
            they came to close quarters and fought hand to hand, nor <lb/>
            was the battle interrupted for a moment. The Turks being <lb/>
            superior in numbers, better fed, and engaging by turns in <lb/>
            successive divisions, left no means of annoyance untried, <lb/>
            boldly rushed on the Franks, threw themselves fearlessly <lb/>
            into the midst of the fight, and encouraged one another. <lb/>
            The Franks, on the other hand, beyond measure distressed, <lb/>
            could hardly stand, and no respite was allowed them <lb/>
            either to take food or rest. They therefore commenced <lb/>
            carrying up a lofty wall cemented with lime, as the Turks <lb/>
            had easily thrown down the other built of loose stones.</p>
          <p>One night a blazing light was seen hanging in the heavens <lb/>
            in the western quarter,2 which seemed to fall on the Turkish <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Ralph of Caen, it was the count of Flanders who set fire <lb/>
            to the city, but Peter Tudehode, an eye-witness, asserts positively that this <lb/>
            measure was adopted by Bohemond, as our author intimates. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This phenomenon, perhaps the aurora-borealis, was also visible in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy ; Ralph of Caen was eye-witness of it. According to Florence of <lb/>

            after the period assigned here. </note> <pb n="133"/>

            citadel and rage within it, and although it did no injury to <lb/>
            the Gentiles, it filled them with alarm and disquietude. <lb/>
            To the Christians it afforded comfort and joy; and both <lb/>
            the people took it for a sign from heaven. The garrison of, <lb/>
            the citadel spent the whole day in hurling spears and darts, <lb/>
            and inflicted wounds upon wounds. The besiegers had so <lb/>
            closely invested the city from without that by day there was <lb/>
            no possibility of ingress or egress ; some however contrived <lb/>
            to go out by night, but by stealth, and with much appre­ <lb/>
            hension. The famine continually increased and tormented <lb/>
            the Christians beyond all belief; many indeed died of hunger. <lb/>
            A small cake baked on the embers, if perchance it could be <lb/>
            procured, cost a bezant. The flesh of horses and asses was <lb/>
            esteemed a dainty fit for an emperor, fowls were worth fifteen <lb/>
            pence each. An egg sold for,twopence, a walnut for a <lb/>
            farthing, and the vilest commodities fetched several staters. <lb/>
            It would be wearisome to detail the various sufferings, <lb/>
            miseries, and torments, which the Christian soldiers endured <lb/>
            for the thirty-six days1 they were blockaded in the place. <lb/>
            It was by such trials that the Almighty proved his champions, <lb/>
            trying them in the furnace of affliction to purge them from <lb/>
            their guilt, in order to give them a glorious triumph when <lb/>
            purified from their sins.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Stephen, count of Chartres, had retired to <lb/>
            Alexandretta for the recovery of his health,2 and was detained <lb/>
            there for some time, as it is said, by sickness. The crusaders <lb/>
            impatiently waited his return, as all the chiefs looked to him <lb/>
            as their prime leader and counsellor ;3 for he was a man of <lb/>
            great eloquence and singular ability. Having heard that <lb/>
            the Turks had invested the city, he cautiously ascended the <note type="footnote"> 1 This computation is much too low; the crusaders were blockaded in <lb/>
            Antioch nearly two months. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See before p. 122, where our author raises the same doubt whether the <lb/>
            sickness was not pretended. Alexandretta is called by the Turks Scande­ <lb/>
            roun, giving its name to the gulf at the bottom of which it is built, on the <lb/>
            opposite shore to Antioch. At any rate, it was a bad place to choose for <lb/>
            the re-establishment of health. Its neighbourhood to pestilential marshes <lb/>
            makes it quite uninhabitable at present during the heats of summer. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Stephen, count of Chartres and Blois tells his wife Adele, in his letter <lb/>

            hills above Alexandretta, which is not very far from Antioch, <lb/>
            and saw from the heights the innumerable tents of the Turks, <lb/>
            and their forces covering the plains like the sand on the sea <lb/>
            shore; nor could he fail of comprehending the condition of <lb/>
            the small body of crusaders shut up in the beleaguered city. <lb/>
            This spectacle filled him with such consternation, that he fled <lb/>
            with his attendants from the spot in the utmost haste, and, <lb/>
            using great precaution, returned to his fortress, which he <lb/>
            stripped of everything. He then retreated in the direction <lb/>
            in which the emperor Alexius was advancing with a powerful <lb/>
            army to the relief of the besieged, and, falling in with him <lb/>
            at the town of Philomenes,1 called him aside and thus <lb/>
            addressed him: "You have received certain intelligence of <lb/>
            the capture of Antioch by the crusaders, but the Turks <lb/>
            retain possession of the citadel which is very strong and <lb/>
            commands the town. They also blockade and besiege our <lb/>
            troops who are in the occupation of the place, or I should <lb/>
            rather say they have taken it by assault and put the Christians <lb/>
            to the sword. Look, therefore, to your own safety and that <lb/>
            of your troops."</p>
          <p>Guy, Bohemond's brother, and numbers both of Franks <lb/>
            and Greeks were hastening to the succour of the besieged, <lb/>
            but the emperor, summoning them to his presence announced <lb/>
            his determination. He then issued orders for the retreat of <lb/>
            the whole army, laying waste all the country round, and <lb/>
            making the inhabitants retire into Bulgaria, so that if the <lb/>
            Turks should attempt to pursue them they might fail of <lb/>
            finding subsistence in the depopulated region. The sad news <lb/>
            too easily promulgated by the credulous count, plunged the <lb/>
            people of God in the deepest affliction. For three days the <lb/>
            bishops, abbots, and priests, discontinued the prayers and <lb/>
            praises of divine worship and abandoned themselves to sighs <lb/>
            and groans. The emperor, giving too much credence to the <lb/>
            report of Stephen of Chartres, returned to Constantinople, <lb/>
            and the glory of victory and triumph over the Turks was <lb/>
            reserved for others to whom it rightfully belonged. The <lb/>
            Franks retreated with the utmost reluctance bitterly lament­ <lb/>
            ing the order, and many of the poorer pilgrims died here and <lb/>
            there on the road.</p>
          <p>Guy, Robert Guiscard's son, poured forth unceasing <note type="footnote"> 1 Philomelium, near Antiochetta. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> JUNE, 1098.] </note> <lb/>
            lamentations for the fate of his brother and his friends, so as <lb/>
            to draw tears both from his acquaintance and from strangers. <lb/>
            while at the same time he overwhelmed Stephen of Chartres <lb/>
            with reproaches. However, he had no choice but to return, <lb/>
            sorrowing, with the emperor and his auxiliary forces.</p>
          <p>And now the soldiers of God in Antioch, being reduced to <lb/>
            the last extremity, placed all their hopes in heaven, and <lb/>
            consulted with confidence on the means of discovering the <lb/>
            holy spear. In consequence they assembled in the church <lb/>
            of St. Peter, and long disputes were held respecting the place <lb/>
            where it was to be found. At length the opinion of the <lb/>
            majority prevailed, and thirteen strong and laborious men <lb/>
            were employed in carefully digging. They turned up the <lb/>
            soil from morning until evening, and at last found the spear <lb/>
            in the presence of the same Peter to whom it had been <lb/>
            revealed.1 It was lifted from the spot among general acclama­ <lb/>
            tions, crowds of people running to see it, and covering it <lb/>
            with kisses of devotion. Their joy was so great, that, no <lb/>
            longer dispirited, they forgot their griefs, and from that <lb/>
            moment took courage to think of war.</p>
          <p>The Christians agreed in council that two enterprising <lb/>
            men, Peter the Hermit and Herluin, who spoke the Turkish <lb/>
            language, should proceed on a mission to Curboran, and, on <lb/>
            the part of God and his people, enjoin him and his followers <lb/>
            to retire peaceably with all they possessed from the city which <lb/>
            St. Peter the apostle had converted to Christ. They added <lb/>
            that if the Turks aspired to the sacrament of baptism, the <lb/>
            Christians would receive them as real brothers, and would <lb/>
            make a treaty of perpetual peace with them: if not they <lb/>
            might arm themselves and prepare for battle, if they dared.2 <lb/>
            Curboran received with disdain the message of the envoys, <lb/>
            and, utterly rejecting the proposal that he should embrace <lb/>
            Christianity, he treated the crucified King with contempt, <lb/>
            called St. Peter a superstitious impostor, and said that our <lb/>
            religion was a most absurd sect. He called on the Christians <note type="footnote"> 1 The discovery was made, according to Peter Tudebode, on the 14th of <lb/>
            June; others say the 19th. Bohemond's excellent arguments against the <lb/>

            our author. </note> <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            to believe in Mahomet, and recommended them, if they con­ <lb/>
            temned his faith to take to flight. The envoys, proceeding <lb/>
            on their journey in return, hastily made their appearance, <lb/>
            and assured the Christian army that a battle was at hand. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the famine increased, and fear of the Turks still <lb/>
            somewhat unmanned the courage of the timid. Having at <lb/>
            length completed a fast of three days enjoined by the priests, <lb/>
            and chanted litanies in processions to the churches, while every <lb/>
            Christian man prepared himself for death by taking the host <lb/>
            as a viaticum, the crusaders were arrayed for battle, being <lb/>
            formed into seven divisions in the heart of the city.</p>
          <p>In the first division, Hugh the Great, with Robert earl of <lb/>
            Flanders, took the command of thirty thousand Frenchmen <lb/>
            and Flemings.</p>
          <p>In the second division were stationed Duke Godfrey and <lb/>
            Eustace his brother with Count Conon1 and thirty thousand <lb/>
            of the bravest warriors of Germany, Lorraine. and Boulogne.</p>
          <p>In the third division Duke Robert was at the head of his <lb/>
            Normans, with fifteen thousand troops from Maine, Anjou, <lb/>
            Brittany, and England.</p>
          <p>The fourth division included Aimar, bishop of Puy, with <lb/>
            the rest of the bishops and ecclesiastics, among whom was <lb/>
            Peter Abraham, who bore the lance of our Lord;2 the <lb/>
            crusaders being desirous to have it carried before them, and <lb/>
            believing that it was their great safeguard and protection.</p>
          <p>In the fifth division was Rainald,3 a valiant count, with four <lb/>
            thousand men of Teutonic and Bavarian race. <note type="footnote"> 1 Con on, the first count of Montagu, mentioned in history, was son of <lb/>
            Gozelon, count of Bohagne, who died in 1064, and Ermentrude d'Harenzey. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding the silence of the French genealogists it seems certain <lb/>
            that Conon was brother-in-law of Godfrey and Baldwin, by his marriage <lb/>
            with their sister Ida of Boulogne. This nobleman, who appears to have <lb/>
            returned from the Holy Land with his son Lambert and Peter the Hermit <lb/>
            in 1101, died the 30th of April, 1105, at the castle of Dolhain, near <lb/>
            Liege, and was buried at Dinant. The castle of Montagu stood on the <lb/>
            banks of the Ourthe. between Marche and La Roche, in the province of <lb/>
            Luxembourg. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was Raymond d'Agiles, the historian of this crusade, and canon of <lb/>
            Puy, and Adhemar's chaplain, who carried the holy lance. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This is incorrect. At first there were only six divisions, and Peter <lb/>

          <p>The seventh was under the command of Bohemond, duke <lb/>
            of Apulia, and numbered thirty thousand Lombards and <lb/>
            Italians. This division was the last to march out of the city, <lb/>

          <p>Raymond, count of Tholouse,1 remained with twenty <lb/>
            thousand troops to guard the city, and prevent any assault <lb/>
            by the Gentiles, who, to the number of many thousands, <lb/>
            occupied the camp of St. Peter near the walls. While the <lb/>
            Christians marched out, the bishops and priests exhorted <lb/>

            souls the powerful succour of the merciful God, a gentle <lb/>
            rain fell from the skies, its still drops moistening and <lb/>
            refreshing the horses and riders like morning dew. The <lb/>
            steeds gave token of their satisfaction by beginning to <lb/>
            neigh, and the spirits of the horsemen were invigorated by <lb/>
            the cooling moisture, while the whole army was exhilarated, <lb/>
            and moved with increased alacrity. Yet the shower was so <lb/>
            gentle and evanescent that it could hardly be called rain, but <lb/>
            soft dewdrops which were felt rather than seen. This is <lb/>

            marching out to battle, he said: " These people are <lb/>
            hastening rather to fly than to fight; let them approach us <lb/>
            quite close, that we may have them in our power to devour <lb/>
            at our leisure. Let them march out! Let them march <lb/>
            out! We will presently surround them, and defeat and <lb/>
            crush them! " The Christians, however, marched forward, <lb/>
            keeping the step, no one breaking the ranks by undue haste. <lb/>
            Curboran, seeing them approach under arms in such good <lb/>
            order, without wavering as if they were under any alarm, <lb/>
            but keeping the measured time and pace,-did not blush <lb/>
            to add: " These worthless curs seem as if they mean to <lb/>
            venture on fighting." He was then struck with sudden terror, <lb/>
            his limbs lost their powers, and his heart was frozen. In <lb/>
            consequence, he gave secret orders to his lieutenant, who is <lb/>
            called an emir, that if he saw the smoke from a fire lighted <lb/>
            in front of the army,1 he might conclude that his comrades <lb/>
            were certainly defeated, and should immediately give the <lb/>
            signal for retreat, and withdraw the troops under his com­ <lb/>
            mand, that the whole body who were with him, and in the <lb/>
            camp, might not be cut off. Then, seeing the Christians <lb/>
            advancing in good order and in greater force than his reports <lb/>
            had said, he began to retire by degrees towards the moun­ <lb/>
            tains,2 in order that the Franks, supposing they had taken <lb/>
            to flight, might pursue them with impetuosity, and breaking <lb/>
            their order, might be more easily attacked. Finding that <lb/>
            this manoeuvre failed, the Turkish army was divided into <lb/>
            two bodies, one of which advanced on the side towards the <lb/>
            sea, while the other stood fast, hoping thus to place the <lb/>
            Christians between them. But the Franks detached a body <lb/>
            of troops from the division commanded by Duke Godfrey <lb/>
            and Robert the Norman, thus forming an eighth division, <note type="footnote"> tonnes assert that the general was playing chess when the near approach of <lb/>

            which they placed under the command of one Rainald,1 with <lb/>
            directions to oppose the advance of the Pagans from the <lb/>
            side towards the sea. These troops were instantly attacked <lb/>
            by the Turks, and numbers of them fell by showers of <lb/>
            arrows or by death cruelly inflicted in other ways. The <lb/>
            other divisions of the Christian army extended their lines <lb/>
            from the sea to the foot of the mountains, a space of about <lb/>
            two miles.</p>

            attacks on all sides. But in this emergency, thanks be to <lb/>
            God, there was seen to issue forth from the heart of the <lb/>
            mountains, a countless host, mounted on white horses, and <lb/>
            carrying white banners. This spectacle was witnessed by <lb/>
            many of the Christians, and it is believed, of the Gentiles, <lb/>
            who, in their first surprise, did not know what to make of <lb/>
            it. At last, both parties became sensible that it was a <lb/>
            manifestation from heaven, and recognized in the leaders of <lb/>
            the celestial army the holy martyrs St. George, St. Deme­ <lb/>

            Holy War has given the clearest account of this battle. He says: " The <lb/>
            Turks were divided into two bodies ; one went towards'the sea, and the other <lb/>
            stood firm, thinking to enclose our army between them. Then there was <lb/>
            formed a seventh division from that of Duke Godfrey and the count of- <lb/>
            Normandy, and it was placed under the command of Count Rainald. This <lb/>
            division was ordered to oppose the troops of the enemy advancing from the <lb/>
            sea coast." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These three saints belonged to the Eastern church. </note><note type="footnote"> St. George, of whose history there are few authentic remains, is supposed <lb/>

            their banners. At this sight the Saracens were struck with <lb/>
            mortal terror, while the Christians were filled with confident <lb/>
            hope. The prodigy was not. seen by all, but it is attested <lb/>
            by many who were eye-witnesses. It was a sign from <lb/>
            heaven for the confusion of one party and portending the <lb/>
            approaching triumph of the other.</p>
          <p>The Gentiles who fought on the side towards the sea, <lb/>
            finding they were unable to sustain the weight of the con­ <lb/>
            flict, set fire to the grass as Curboran had ordered. This <lb/>
            preconcerted signal being seen, those who were in the tents <lb/>
            fled hastily and in confusion, snatching up in their alarm <lb/>
            their most valuable effects. The Christians who fought on <lb/>
            this side had already directed their attack to the Turkish <lb/>
            camp, where they knew that their greatest force was <lb/>
            stationed. The Turks still made all the resistance in their <lb/>
            power, so that some fought while the rest were intent on <lb/>
            pillaging the tents. Meanwhile, Duke Godfrey, with Robert <lb/>
            of Flanders and Hugh the Great, made a charge with their <lb/>
            cavalry near the river,1 where they found that a great body <lb/>
            of the enemy was again collected. Their joint attack <lb/>
            repelled the pagans, although they made a stout resistance, <lb/>
            and the battle raged desperately on both sides. The clang <lb/>
            on brazen helmets was like the hammering of anvils. Sparks <lb/>
            flew from the battered swords; skulls were cloven; and the <lb/>
            ground was bespattered with the brains of the dead. <lb/>
            Armour was broken, and men embowelled. The weary <lb/>
            horses were covered with sweat, but there was no repose <note type="footnote"> happily, for the commander of the Theban legion is, from the place of his <lb/>
            martyrdom, altogether a saint of the Western church (22nd of September). <lb/>
            There were, however, two other saints of the name of Maurice in the East; <lb/>
            St. Maurice of Nicopolis, 10th of July, and St. Maurice d'Apamea, 16th <lb/>
            and 18th of July. </note><note type="footnote"> In the chronicle of Monte Cassino, St. Theodore (probably Stratelates, <lb/>
            February 7) is substituted for St. Mercury, and the miracle is referred to <lb/>
            the battle of Dorylceum. The History of the Holy War agrees with this, <lb/>
            and also represents the three saints as having often appeared at the head of <lb/>
            celestial warriors in the crusaders'battles, St. Mercury most frequently; St. <lb/>
            George, also, on some occasions, and St. Theodore more rarely. The <lb/>

            either for the horses or horsemen. The troops were engaged <lb/>
            at such close quarters, that they were scarcely separated by <lb/>
            the length of their weapons. Some fought hand to hand, <lb/>
            foot to foot, and body against body. Meanwhile, a terror <lb/>
            inspired by God himself seized the Turks, and the invincible <lb/>
            constancy of their adversaries filled them with admiration <lb/>
            and astonishment, and compelled them to retreat. The <lb/>
            whole body began to give way, and neither trumpets, drums, <lb/>
            nor clarions, nor the voice of heralds, could recall them to the <lb/>
            ranks. The routed Turks made for their tents, where they <lb/>
            expected to find a large body of troops, whom they had left <lb/>
            there in reserve, but they had fled, as before related, as <lb/>
            soon as the signal-fire was lit by the troops engaged. <lb/>
            The Christians drove the pagans before them with great <lb/>
            slaughter to the Iron Bridge, and pursued them sword-in- <lb/>
            hand as far as Tancred's fort; they then returned to the <lb/>
            enemy's tents, and pillaged everything they fancied. They <lb/>
            carried back with them to the city in great triumph wealth <lb/>
            of all kinds, woolled sheep, innumerable beasts of burden, <lb/>
            plentiful stores of provisions, and whatever else could <lb/>
            supply their necessities; for it is the custom of the pagans <lb/>
            to carry with them in their expeditions abundant supplies, <lb/>
            horses, asses, and camels for conveying baggage, sheep, and <lb/>
            oxen for food, with corn, and meal, and lentiles, and oil, not <lb/>
            forgetting wine. The Christians, having obtained with the <lb/>
            wished-for victory these abundant stores of all descriptions, <lb/>
            blessed God with due praises, acknowledging him as their <lb/>
            present protector, and raising to heaven hymns of thanks- <lb/>
            giving.</p>
          <p>The Syrians and Armenians who inhabited that country, <lb/>
            seeing that the Turks had sustained an irretrievable defeat, <lb/>
            closed the well-known passes of the mountains, occupy­ <lb/>
            ing the defiles, and sword-in-hand caused the fugitives great <lb/>
            losses. They butchered them like lost sheep who in their fear <lb/>
            could find no means of safety. The emir also who had <lb/>
            remained in the citadel, the custody of which was committed <lb/>
            to him by Curboran, seeing his friends shamefully routed in <lb/>
            every quarter, was struck with terror, and consulting his <lb/>
            own safety, before the Franks re-entered the city, asked for <lb/>
            a Christian standard, which being given him, he planted it <lb/>
            on the summit of the castle, that it might secure quarter to <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            himself and the garrison, there being no doubt as to the <lb/>
            surrender of the citadel. The crusaders returning con­ <lb/>
            querors, when the Lombards 1 saw the pennon of the count <lb/>
            of St. Giles, he being nearest at hand when a Christian- <lb/>
            ensign was demanded, they were much enraged, and began <lb/>
            to utter violent threats. The emir, to allay the disturbance, <lb/>
            sent back the count's pennon, and hoisted that of Bohemond <lb/>
            on the tower,2 for the peace and safety of himself and his <lb/>
            comrades. Then the capitulation made between Bohemond­ <lb/>
            and the emir was ratified by all, and the citadel was quickly <lb/>
            surrendered to the Christians. Soon afterwards, the emir <lb/>
            was baptized, as, according to his account, he had long <lb/>
            desired, and received magnificent presents from the liberality <lb/>
            of the Franks.</p>
          <p>It was thus that the Christians, by God's help, gained <lb/>
            the victory in the battle on the fourth of the calends of <lb/>
            July [June 28th] 3 and possessed Antioch in freedom and <lb/>
            tranquillity. As for the Turks of the garrison who had <lb/>
            surrendered the citadel but rejected the Christian faith, <lb/>
            which is the light of the soul and the way of salvation, they <lb/>
            returned to their own country, under the protection of <lb/>
            Bohemond, according to the terms of their capitulation.</p>
          <p>The Franks who formed their escort according to the <lb/>
            treaty, having left them on their own frontiers to which the <lb/>
            Turks were approaching unsuspicious of any danger, Baldwin <lb/>
            suddenly set on them from Rages,4 and attacking them in <lb/>

            nearly all to the sword. Then he led his followers laden <lb/>

            Edessa, were highly pleased, and out of respect to him avoided <lb/>
            entering on the borders of that province. Baldwin was a <lb/>
            knight of great stature, of a noble presence, and lofty spirit, <lb/>
            well imbued with letters, celebrated for his valour and worth, <lb/>
            and of illustrious descent, as sprung from the race of the <lb/>
            emperor Charlemagne.2 This lord, with the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Edessa, made frequent expeditions against the Turks in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, and defeating the pagans took much booty <lb/>
            and many captives; thus making the duke of Edessa formid­ <lb/>
            able to all his neighbours.</p>
          <p>The city of which we are speaking is called by old writers <lb/>
            Rages, but it was destroyed during the fierce wars waged <lb/>
            between the ancient kings of the Assyrians and Chaldeans <note type="footnote"> 1 He was an old Greek, sent there in the reign of the emperor Romanus <lb/>

            At a later age, Seleucus Nicanor, who was one of the four <lb/>
            principal generals of Alexander the Great, after his death <lb/>
            restored this city a nd called it Edessa. It is watered by the <lb/>
            Tigris and Euphrates which are the sources of fertility <lb/>
            and abundance to the natives. King Abgarus governed <lb/>
            Edessa, the same to whom the Lord Jesus sent a sacred letter, <lb/>
            and the precious napkin which had wiped the sweat from his <lb/>
            brow and retained the Saviour's features miraculously <lb/>
            impressed, so that the lineaments and proportions of the <lb/>
            divine image were visible on it. Thaddeus, the disciple of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ came to this city and baptising King Abgarus <lb/>
            with all his people first established, by the grace of God, the <lb/>
            worship of the divinity.1 The community of this place <lb/>
            was composed of Greeks, Armenians, and Syrians living <lb/>
            together, and serving the King of heaven from the foundation <lb/>
            of Christianity to the present day. But for their sins God <lb/>
            had lately chastised them with the discipline of his rod, and <lb/>
            caused the offences of the Christians to be punished by the <lb/>
            fury of the Gentiles; so that the city, with the surrounding <lb/>
            country was under the dominion of the Turks. They still <lb/>
            freely attended divine worship, and were not compelled to <lb/>
            abandon the law of God by any restriction of the pagans. <lb/>
            The citizens of Edessa therefore were well pleased with the <lb/>
            civilization of the Franks, who, on their part, treated them <lb/>
            in all things as brothers.</p>
          <p>The haughty governor of Edessa, moved by jealousy and <lb/>
            blinded by malice, laid snares for the crusaders, commanding <lb/>
            his officer, who was going on an expedition, to attack Baldwin <lb/>
            and his companions, as they were returning and when they <lb/>
            were unarmed, and to kill them without mercy. The treach­ <lb/>
            erous contriver of this nefarious scheme took his measures <lb/>
            accordingly, but the intelligence reached Baldwin's ears who <lb/>
            was beloved by many. As they were returning from the <lb/>
            expedition the pagans recommended the Christians, in light <lb/>
            talk, to lay aside their armour, that they might be less incum­ <lb/>
            bered; but they, aware of the plot, did not listen to the <lb/>
            advice. At last, as they were drawing near to the city, the <lb/>
            Franks riding in full armour, the Gentiles at a given signal <lb/>
            suddenly threw themselves on them, and, thus assaulting <lb/>
            their comrades, disclosed their base designs. The Christians, <note type="footnote"> 1 See vol. i. p. 263. </note> <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1097.] </note> <lb/>
            however, in the name of the Lord, stood firm, and attacking <lb/>
            their enemies with spirit put them to flight, killing some as <lb/>
            they were making their escape and pursuing the rest, sword <lb/>
            in hand, to the city gate. Baldwin then ordered his people <lb/>
            to pitch their tents on the spot, and lay siege to the place. <lb/>
            A great commotion was now raised in the city, and the <lb/>
            people flocked together from all quarters.</p>
          <p>Then Tobias, the chief of the citizens, thus addressed them : <lb/>
            " Good citizens, I beseech you to be quiet for a short time <lb/>
            while I go with three of my neighbours to the Franks, and <lb/>
            inquire for what reason they have laid siege to our city." <lb/>
            In consequence the four principal citizens went out of the <lb/>
            town, and inquired the cause of the sudden siege. Baldwin <lb/>
            replied: " I left my brothers and friends, and the noble army <lb/>
            of Christians, in Cilicia, and came here with three hundred <lb/>
            gallantknights to enter your service, and I have been a faithful <lb/>
            protector to you and your governor on all occasions. The <lb/>
            crusaders, out of their regard for me have left the borders of <lb/>
            your country untouched, and have done you no injury of any <lb/>
            kind. I and my followers have engaged in sharp hostilities <lb/>
            with your enemies in the neighbourhood, and gained frequent <lb/>
            triumphs over them for your peace and security. You <lb/>
            doubtless are sensible of this, and will, I think, bear witness <lb/>
            to the truth of my assertions. What offence then have I <lb/>
            and my companions given this day ? Why, when we were <lb/>
            returning in security to your city, as we did yesterday and <lb/>
            often before, did our fellow soldiers suddenly attack us with <lb/>
            swords and spears ? In this emergency we resisted, calling <lb/>
            on God according to the Christian practice, and Christ our <lb/>
            God, who is always ready to help his servants, promptly <lb/>
            gave the succour from heaven which we implored. Our <lb/>
            comrades who attacked us as enemies felt the weight of our <lb/>
            arms in defence of our own lives, and turned their backs <lb/>
            and fled. Some of them, as you may perceive, were left by <lb/>
            their companions dead on the road. These things being so, <lb/>
            we remain in our tents, expecting your aid and advice; for <lb/>
            we still regard you not as enemies, but as our loyal hosts."</p>
          <p>Tobias, having heard this account and other similar <lb/>
            details, called his neighbours apart, and after a brief confer­ <lb/>
            ence returned to the Franks. " There is no need," he said, <lb/>
            “illustrious knights, for many words; we entreat you to <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH.XI. </note> <lb/>
            wait for us here in peace, while we are employed in <lb/>
            arranging your business satisfactorily in the city."</p>
          <p>With these explanations, and a mutual understanding, <lb/>
            the envoys re-entered the city, and reported to their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours what they had heard and said. The conduct of the <lb/>
            four deputies was approved, and they were commissioned to <lb/>
            present themselves at the governor's palace, while the rest <lb/>
            of the citizens followed slowly under arms. They found the <lb/>
            harsh governor alone in his private apartments, and saluting <lb/>
            him in the fashion of the country, thus addressed him : <lb/>
            " The times demand prudent counsel, for we have now reason <lb/>
            to fear as enemies those whom we have hitherto considered as <lb/>
            our faithful protectors. The Franks now besiege us closely, <lb/>
            and are proceeding to assault us with the greatest vigour. <lb/>
            They call us traitors, and summon us to judgment. They say <lb/>
            that their fellow soldiers treacherously attacked them as they <lb/>
            were returning from the enemy's country, and that they <lb/>
            received more injury from their allies than from their <lb/>
            adversaries. They, therefore, threaten us terribly that <lb/>
            unless we render them justice they will bring upon us the <lb/>
            whole force of the Christian army. We must, therefore, <lb/>
            use prudent means for avoiding destruction, and take care <lb/>
            that we do not provoke the intolerable wrath of the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians by our injustice. The treasonable enterprise was <lb/>
            undertaken without our knowledge, and so great a crime <lb/>
            ought to be instantly punished. It is, therefore, the universal <lb/>
            opinion of the citizens that the atrocious traitors should be <lb/>
            dealt with according to the severity of our ancient laws, and <lb/>
            that our illustrious friends, or rather protectors, should be <lb/>
            respectfully conciliated."</p>
          <p>While Tobias was thus speaking, a band of citizens had <lb/>
            crept cautiously and silently into the palace. The pagan <lb/>
            governor, however, treated with contempt the proposals of <lb/>
            the friends, and plainly avowed himself the defender of the <lb/>
            traitors and their fellow conspirators. Upon this, the <lb/>
            incensed citizens rushed upon him, and, losing all respect, <lb/>
            at once cut off his head.1 Then Tobias took it, and said to <note type="footnote"> I This narrative of Baldwin's conquest of Armenia is not extracted from <lb/>

            the citizens his neighbours : " Guard the palace, and all that <lb/>
            it contains from injury; and I and my companions will <lb/>
            bring hither the Franks with joy and peace." Saying this, <lb/>
            Tobias went forth, and saluting the Franks, thus addressed <lb/>
            them: " The citizens of Edessa, being greatly concerned at <lb/>
            the injury done you, demanded redress from the governor. <lb/>
            As, however, he avowed himself the author of the treason, <lb/>
            they have cut off his head. See here the head of the enemy <lb/>
            of God and of you, which they have sent by us." All <lb/>
            present being filled with joy, Tobias added: " Come, illus­ <lb/>
            trious knight, and receive the hand of the governor's <lb/>
            daughter in marriage. Be our prince, and long may you <lb/>
            possess the dukedom of Edessa." Baldwin, therefore, and <lb/>
            his followers, entered the city in triumph, and were received <lb/>
            in the palace of the government by all the citizens with <lb/>
            great joy. In due time the beautiful daughter of the wicked <lb/>
            governor was baptized, and married Baldwin the handsome <lb/>
            knight, on whom she had secretly set her affections during <lb/>
            her father's life, without his knowledge.1 The native Chris­ <lb/>
            tians were highly delighted to be under the government of a <lb/>
            Christian prince, and returned thanks to God, while the <lb/>
            Turks were dejected at losing their dominion over the wor­ <lb/>
            shippers of Christ, whom they had hitherto oppressed. The <lb/>
            magnificent church of St. Sophia had been built at Edessa <lb/>
            in ancient times, and under the rule of Baldwin, the faith­ <lb/>
            ful, both natives and foreigners, dedicated to St. Saviour, the <lb/>
            virtue and wisdom of God the Father, and restored his <lb/>
            worship. The order of divine service was re-established with <lb/>
            much splendour at Edessa, and divine grace displayed its <lb/>
            influence on the people both in their hearts and actions <note type="footnote"> our author with more precise information than that he has adopted. The <lb/>
            reader will already have discovered that the account savours more of romance <lb/>
            than of history. Unfortunately for the crusaders' fame, the governor was <lb/>
            much more true to his engagements than Baldwin. The old prince having <lb/>
            solemnly adopted him, with singular ceremonies, became the victim of a <lb/>
            popular tumult, of which Baldwin was the hero, if not the contriver, and <lb/>
            which, at least, he took no pains to repress. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The new prince of Edessa. did not marry his predecessor's daughter, <lb/>
            but the niece of a chief of that country, whose name, it is said, was <lb/>
            Taphroë. He'divorced her, and married again in 1102, Adelaide, widow <lb/>
            of Roger I., king of Sicily, whom he soon afterwards also repudiated upon <lb/>
            the pretext of consanguinity. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>

            much more wonderfully and incomparably than my pen can <lb/>
            describe.</p>
          <p>Baldwin, having been thus engaged in a multiplicity of <lb/>
            affairs for the glory of Christ,1 had not been able to assist <lb/>
            the crusaders in the siege of Antioch. Hearing, however, <lb/>
            reports of the extreme distress to which they were reduced, <lb/>
            he and his companions deeply compassionated their suffer­ <lb/>
            ings, and as soon as it was in their power, put their affairs <lb/>
            in order to hasten to their relief. Meanwhile, by the help <lb/>
            of the Lord Jesus, they had gained a great victory over <lb/>
            Curboran and his army, and Baldwin and his companions <lb/>
            had cut off the Turks, who had retreated from the citadel <lb/>
            of Antioch, as before mentioned, and taking their spoils, <lb/>
            visited their brothers and friends. Then, all having mutually <lb/>
            related their several successes, rejoiced together, and gave <lb/>
            thanksgivings with heart and mouth to the God of victory, <lb/>
            who ordereth all things well.</p>
          <p>After this conference of the brothers and friends, Duke <lb/>
            Baldwin returned to Rages, and took under his fatherly <lb/>
            government the church of God and the people committed to <lb/>
            his care. He defeated the Turks on his frontiers in frequent <lb/>
            engagements, and crushing the wicked, enlarged the borders <lb/>
            of the Christians. He also nobly increased the endowments <lb/>
            of the clergy, furnished them with all that was necessary, <lb/>
            and anxiously entreated them to celebrate daily service for <lb/>
            the benefit of the faithful. He maintained himself vigorously <lb/>
            in the dukedom five years.- He then succeeded his brother <lb/>
            Godfrey in the kingdom of Jerusalem, which he governed <lb/>
            nearly fifteen years,3 signalizing his reign by many bold <note type="footnote"> 1 Much less for the interests of religion than of his own private ambition. <lb/>
            So much so that the princes and prelates of the crusaders made in vain a <lb/>

            him under the banner of the cross. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This calculation is evidently exaggerated. Baldwin's government at <lb/>

            him the immediate possession of the city which they had <lb/>
            purchased for him at the cost of so much suffering, calling <lb/>
            upon him at the same time to observe the terms of the <lb/>
            treaty which he had sworn to on his part, viz., that he <lb/>
            would resolutely accompany them in their march to Jerusa­ <lb/>

            although he had hitherto conducted himself with great <lb/>
            ability during the crusade both in the field and in council, <lb/>
            be was very deficient on this occasion, for, like the raven <lb/>

            and at this season it would be impossible for us to bear the <lb/>
            torrid atmosphere. Besides, both our strength and our sup­ <lb/>
            plies are exhausted by a long siege. Let us therefore be <lb/>
            quiet and seek repose, endeavouring to restore our sick and <lb/>
            wounded, and not forgetting the relief of the poor. Let us <lb/>
            wait for the rains of autumn, and avoid the injurious influ­ <lb/>
            ences of the Cancer and the Lion. In the month of <lb/>
            November the climate will be refreshed, and we will then <lb/>
            re-assemble, and with one accord proceed on our journey: <lb/>
            otherwise, the whole people will be prostrated with the <lb/>
            intolerable heat. Let this counsel be well considered by <lb/>
            the crowd who are agitating for our immediate departure. <lb/>
            Necessity requires that we should defer it during this <lb/>
            intractable season: and this course seems most advisable <lb/>
            for all parties." The determination was announced to the <lb/>
            whole army, and in the end it met with universal appro­ <lb/>
            bation.</p>
          <p>The chiefs, therefore, with their household troops, dis­ <lb/>
            persed themselves throughout the neighbouring country to <lb/>
            pass the summer ; 1 and the poor followed them to obtain <lb/>
            subsistence: for the chiefs had said, " If there be any in <lb/>
            want, or infirm health, let them attach themselves to our <lb/>
            families, and we will support them, allowing them pay. <lb/>
            The disabled shall be maintained at the public expense until <lb/>
            they recover."</p>
          <p>Then Raymond Pilet, a brave knight, one of the com- <note type="footnote"> 1 The chiefs of the crusaders quitted Antioch not only to pass the <lb/>

            panions of the count of St. Giles, collected a body of horse <lb/>
            and foot-soldiers, and putting himself at their head, <lb/>
            and boldly entering the country of the Saracens passed <lb/>
            beyond two cities to a strong place belonging to the <lb/>
            Syrians called Talamania.1 The inhabitants submitted <lb/>
            voluntarily to the Franks, who rested there nearly eight <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>Then, again buckling on their armour, they attacked a <lb/>
            castle of the Agarenes in that neighbourhood, and having <lb/>
            blockaded it till it surrendered, it was sacked and the natives <lb/>
            put to the sword, except those who were willing to become <lb/>
            Christians; those were preserved uninjured. After this, <lb/>
            they returned to Talamania, rejoicing at their success. <lb/>
            Three days afterwards they made another expedition against <lb/>
            Marrah, a neighbouring town.2 From thence many pagans <lb/>
            who had assembled from Aleppo and other neighbouring <lb/>
            places, issued forth to attack them. The Franks supposing <lb/>
            that they were going to fight drew up in order like disciplined <lb/>
            soldiers, but their hopes were disappointed. For the Turks <lb/>
            cautiously retreated towards the city, neither flying before <lb/>
            the enemy, nor suffering them to come to close quarters; but <lb/>
            withdrawing a little from the conflict by a skilful manoeuvre, <lb/>
            they turned and again made a rapid charge on the Franks <lb/>
            and then wheeling their horses round again retreated. The <lb/>
            Franks had to sustain repeated attacks of this kind, nor could <lb/>
            they safely disengage themselves from the enemy. For if <lb/>
            they attempted to retreat the gentiles pressed on their rear, <lb/>
            as afterwards happened. They had to maintain their ground, <lb/>
            suffering from intolerable thirst, until the evening; for the <lb/>
            heat was excessive. At last, being no longer able to bear <lb/>
            the fatigue, and having no means of assuaging their thirst, <lb/>
            for no water was to be found, they resolved to draw off in a <lb/>
            body, and by a slow march, to their own castle. But the foot- <lb/>
            soldiers and Syrians, feeble and undisciplined troops, break­ <lb/>
            ing their ranks, regardless of the commands of the knights, <lb/>
            were seized with a panic and began to fly in utter confusion. <lb/>
            The pagans were instantly upon them when they gave way, <lb/>
            and cut them down without mercy, fiercer than wolves, and <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> 1 M. Poujoulat thinks that this place must be in the neighbourhood of <lb/>

            giving no quarter. The prospect of victory, and the advan­ <lb/>
            tage they had gained supplied them with strength. Many <lb/>
            therefore of the common people and faint-hearted were here <lb/>
            slain, others were choked with thirst. Those who escaped <lb/>
            alive returned with Raymond to Talamania, where they passed <lb/>
            some days. This massacre took place in the month of July, <lb/>
            and the insolence of the proud was thus punished by the <lb/>
            hand of God. So we read in the sacred writings that the <lb/>
            children of Israel were often afflicted, and defeated in battle <lb/>
            by the Philistines, Edom, Midian, and other neighbouring <lb/>
            nations, in order to compel them to return frequently <lb/>
            to the Lord, and to persevere in the ways of his command­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>At this time Aimar, bishop of Puy, fell sick at Antioch, <lb/>
            and having comforted his sorrowing children with paternal <lb/>
            affection went the way of all flesh, departing in the Lord on <lb/>
            the calends of August [5th July]. His death caused deep <lb/>
            affliction among the soldiers of the cross, for he was the <lb/>
            counsellor of the nobles, the hope of the orphan, the pro­ <lb/>
            tector of the weak, the companion in arms of the knights. <lb/>
            The clergy he instructed and guided in a becoming manner; <lb/>
            he was distinguished by his singular prudence, while his good <lb/>
            humour and affability made him a general favourite. The <lb/>
            whole army therefore celebrated his obsequies with much <lb/>
            lamentation; his body was embalmed with aromatic spices <lb/>
            and interred in the church of St. Peter the Apostle.</p>
          <p>The count of St. Giles, who never yielded to sloth or idle­ <lb/>
            ness, when the Gentiles could be attacked with vigour, lost <lb/>
            no time in making an irruption into the territory of the <lb/>
            Saracens, and assaulted and took by storm a fine city of theirs <lb/>
            called Albara.1 He put to the sword almost all the inhabit- <note type="footnote"> 1 Raymond d'Agiles calls it Barra, and the oriental historians Baré or <lb/>

            ants of both sexes and took the place into his own hands. <lb/>
            The Christians appointed a bishop there, fitted for his office, <lb/>
            and instituted what was required for the worship of the <lb/>
            true faith. The bishop of Albara was sent to Antioch, <lb/>
            and there duly consecrated according to the rites of the <lb/>
            church.1</p>
          <p>As the appointed time approached for resuming the <lb/>
            journey to Jerusalem,2 all the chiefs assembled at Antioch <lb/>
            to consider this urgent business, so that they might be no <lb/>
            longer diverted from their expedition. But there was an <lb/>
            implacable quarrel concerning the possession of the city, <lb/>
            between Duke Bohemond, and Count Raymond which all the <lb/>
            ability of the elder chiefs failed in settling, notwithstanding <lb/>
            their many sensible exhortations. The one demanded the <lb/>
            sovereignty of the whole city, as it was promised to him during <lb/>
            the siege and before it was taken. The other alleged the oath <lb/>
            of fealty taken to the emperor, with Bohemond's approbation, <lb/>
            and declared that he could not be absolved from it without <lb/>
            perjury. Bohemond put the citadel which was given up to <lb/>
            him in a state of defence, drawing in supplies of arms and <lb/>
            provisions, and manning it with troops and warders. In <lb/>
            like manner the count strengthened himself in the possession <lb/>
            of the palace of the emir Cassian, which he had before <lb/>
            occupied, and seized the fort at the bridge towards the port <lb/>
            of St. Simeon. Their ambition and resentment were carried <lb/>
            to such a pitch that neither of them would yield to the <lb/>
            other, and both under colourable pretences aspired to the <lb/>
            possession of the city.</p>

            honour or the profit of the acquisition ; for Antioch is a very <lb/>
            beautiful and strongly fortified place, and has rich and <lb/>
            ample revenues. Within the city are inclosed four gentle <lb/>
            hills, on the highest of which stands the citadel commanding <lb/>
            the whole place.' The lower part of the town is well built, <lb/>
            and it is surrounded by a double wall. The inner wall is <lb/>
            broad and lofty, and formed of immense blocks of stone, <lb/>
            squared and closely fitted. It has in its circuit four hundred <lb/>
            and fifty towers,2 the walls of which are of stately architec­ <lb/>
            ture and defended by battlements. The outer wall is not so <lb/>
            lofty, but is a work of wonderful beauty. The city contains <lb/>
            three hundred and forty churches,3 and being a great primacy, <lb/>
            is the seat of a patriarch who has one hundred and fifty three <lb/>
            bishops under his jurisdiction. Antioch is shut in on the <lb/>
            east by four hills,4 and the river Farfar washes the walls on <lb/>
            the west.5 Its ancient name was Reblath,6 as St. Jerome <lb/>
            informs us in his Commentary on the Prophets, but it was <lb/>
            afterwards augmented by Seleucus Nicanor, who called it <lb/>
            after his father Antiochus Clarus. The place being of so <lb/>
            much importance and dignity, as in truth the capital and <lb/>
            metropolis of all Syria, the Franks were unwilling to part <lb/>
            with it easily now that it was in their power, hoping by hold­ <lb/>
            ing possession of it to extend their influence far and wide, <lb/>
            and to reduce even distant regions to obedience to Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity. The siege had lasted eight months and a day,7 and <note type="footnote"> 1 This description is very exact; the four rising grounds of which our <lb/>

            an Arabian writer says that 80,000 crenelles could be counted. The <lb/>

            after its capture they had themselves been besieged within it <lb/>
            three weeks. During the continuance of which siege there <lb/>

            it to safe custody. Meanwhile the count and Bohemond <lb/>
            had each their own private views regarding it. They there­ <lb/>
            fore fortified the place, as before mentioned, and in the month <lb/>

            The next day he led his troops to the assault of the place, <lb/>
            but as the walls were strong and well defended, he could <lb/>

            also arrived before Marrah.1 A second attack was then <lb/>
            made by the united forces of the two chiefs, who repeatedly <lb/>
            assaulted the defenders of the fortifications with great spirit <lb/>
            but little success. Scaling-ladders were raised against the <lb/>
            walls, but the violent outcries and threatening demonstra­ <lb/>
            tions of the Turks discouraged every one from venturing to <lb/>
            mount them. The citizens indeed thought that their resist­ <lb/>
            ance on the present occasion would be as successful as it <lb/>
            had been against Raymond Pilet; but Count Raymond <lb/>
            caused a machine to be built of wood, to run on four <lb/>
            wheels, that it might be easily moved. It was so lofty that <lb/>
            it commanded the walls and reached to the battlements of <lb/>
            the towers. This structure was rolled forward against one <lb/>
            of the towers; the trumpets and clarions sounded, and the <lb/>
            troops under arms invested the whole circuit of the walls, <lb/>
            the cross-bowmen and archers discharged their bolts, and <lb/>
            the party in the wooden tower hurled below immense <lb/>
            stones, while the priests and clerks, offered earnest prayers <lb/>
            to the Lord for his people. William of Montpellier and <lb/>
            many others fought from the machine, overwhelming the <lb/>
            citizens beneath with stones and darts, and easily killed <lb/>
            them by crushing their shields, helmets, and heads ;3 others <lb/>
            made incessant attacks on the defenders of the walls with <lb/>
            iron hooks. On the other hand, the Turks directed their <lb/>
            arrows and missiles against the Christians from the towers, <lb/>
            they also threw the Greek fire into the machine, and left; <lb/>
            nothing untried. The Christians lost no time in using oil <lb/>
            to extinguish the fire ;3 and pressing forward to mount the <lb/>
            walls, were driven back and held in check by those who <lb/>
            manned the battlements, but still would not draw off. The <note type="footnote"> 1 Not only Bohemond, but a considerable part of the Christian army <lb/>

            The oriental historians assert that the count of Tholouse promised to spare <lb/>
            the lives of the citizens, and that twenty thousand souls were victims of his <lb/>

            struggle was prolonged until the evening. The unwearied <lb/>
            courage of the Agarenes foiled all the devices of the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians. At length Gouffier de Tours,' a knight of the Limou­ <lb/>
            sin, of high birth and extraordinary daring, was the first to <lb/>
            mount the scaling-ladder and reached the top of the wall. <lb/>
            Some soldiers, few in number, ascended after him, for the <lb/>
            ladder was broken and fell in pieces. Gouffier, however, <lb/>
            held his footing on the battlements manfully, driving back <lb/>
            the Pagans, and at the same time calling his comrades to <lb/>
            his aid, both by his gestures and voice. They soon raised <lb/>
            another scaling-ladder, by means of which so many knights <lb/>
            and soldiers mounted to the top that they occupied a long <lb/>
            extent of the wall, from which they entirely drove the gar­ <lb/>
            rison. The Pagans now rallied, and renewed the attack <lb/>
            with so much determination, sometimes charging the Franks <lb/>
            with such impetuosity, that some of them in their terror <lb/>
            leaped from the wall. However, a strong body maintained <lb/>
            their ground, and resisted the repeated attacks of the <lb/>
            enemy, until the Christians below had undermined the wall <lb/>
            and made a breach for the besiegers to enter. The Turks <lb/>
            discovering this abandoned themselves to despair, and pre­ <lb/>
            cipitately fled. Thus the wealthy town of Marrah was taken <lb/>
            the evening of Saturday the ides2 [the 11th] of December. <lb/>
            The Christians spread themselves through the conquered <lb/>
            place, and mercilessly pillaged it of all the wealth they could <lb/>
            find in the houses and cellars, giving no quarter to the <lb/>
            Saracens, but putting them almost all to the sword. Every <lb/>
            place in the city was filled with corpses, and it was impos­ <lb/>
            sible to walk through the streets without stumbling over <lb/>
            heaps of the dead. On the capture of the place a great <lb/>
            number of the citizens, with their wives and children and <lb/>
            most valuable effects, assembled in the palace over the gate, <lb/>
            where they submitted to the Christians. Some of these <lb/>
            were put to death, others, by Bohemond's order, were con­ <lb/>
            ducted to Antioch, and subjected to servitude or sold into <note type="footnote"> 1 Gouffiers de Lastours, lord of Hautefort and father of Guy de Lastours, <lb/>

            slavery, and all were stripped of their wealth and scattered. <lb/>
            The Franks remained at Marrah an entire month and <lb/>
            three days.</p>
          <p>The bishop of Orange fell sick there, and his spirit, <lb/>
            released from the body, ascended to heaven.1 A severe <lb/>
            famine also affected the army, and forced some of them to <lb/>
            devour things disgusting, unusual, disagreeable, and even <lb/>
            forbidden. Some, indeed, partook of the flesh of the Turks,2 <lb/>
            which, coming to the knowledge of the elders and better <lb/>
            sort, they were overwhelmed with shame and sorrow, but <lb/>
            they suspended the punishment on account of the extremity <lb/>
            of the famine. Nor did they esteem it a mortal offence that <lb/>
            those who underwent voluntarily such excessive hunger for <lb/>
            the cause of God should thus make war on the Turks with <lb/>
            their teeth as well as their hands. The thing, indeed, was <lb/>
            against all laws, but it was absolute necessity which drove <lb/>
            them to it. W hen there is a famine in a camp, everything <lb/>
            is welcome, nothing rejected. Some ripped open the bowels <lb/>
            of the Turks to find the bezants and gold they had swallowed, <lb/>
            and which they thus secured. Numbers perished by the <lb/>
            prevalence of the famine.</p>
          <p>The chiefs, while they were at Marrah, made fresh endea­ <lb/>
            vours to restore amity between the duke and the count, <lb/>
            but their efforts were fruitless. In consequence, Bohemond <lb/>
            was so much irritated that he immediately went back to <lb/>
            Antioch,3 and the expedition to Jerusalem was hindered, to <lb/>
            the great injury of the people. The private quarrels and <lb/>
            animosities of princes disturb and afflict their subjects; for <lb/>
            while every one is seeking his own advantage, he is careless <lb/>
            of the common good; and the people fall into ruin when <lb/>
            their chiefs do not protect them. The army of Jerusalem <note type="footnote"> I William, the first of the name, bishop of Orange and vice-legate; lie <lb/>

          <p>COUNT RAYMOND again sent envoys to the chiefs at Antioch <lb/>
            and invited them to meet him at Rugia to have another <lb/>
            conference. In consequence, Duke Godfrey, with Robert the <lb/>
            Norman, and Robert of Flanders, and other chiefs who were <lb/>
            summoned, proceeded to Rugia, taking Bohemond with them. <lb/>
            Much was then said on the necessity of restoring concord <lb/>
            among the principal nobles, but no means of accomplishing <lb/>
            it was discovered. Bohemond refused to march on Jeru­ <lb/>
            salem unless Antioch was entirely given up to him, and the <lb/>
            count would not go unless Bohemond accompanied the rest. <lb/>
            Raymond returned to Marrah where the Christian army was <lb/>
            in danger of perishing by famine.. At length, in the com­ <lb/>
            punction of his heart, a generous feeling prevailed, and, to <lb/>
            serve the soldiers of Christ, he undertook to prosecute the <lb/>
            journey to Jerusalem, preferring the cause of God to his <lb/>
            own will and profit. To subdue themselves is the highest <lb/>
            virtue of which princes are capable; in general, they exhibit <lb/>
            great obstinacy, and cause their subjects extreme perils. <lb/>
            The count ruled his own spirit that he might not injure all <lb/>
            Christendom. However, he gave orders to his people to <lb/>
            maintain a strong garrison in the palace of Cassian.2</p>
          <p>Count Raymond came out of Marrah on the ides <lb/>
            [13th] of January,3 and, with bare feet, freely joined the <lb/>
            Christian pilgrims, exhibiting by this token of humility his <lb/>
            resumption of the pilgrimage. There was, therefore, great <note type="footnote"> 1 During the absence of the count of Tholouse, the crusaders whom he <lb/>
            left at Marrah, exasperated at the chiefs delay in leading them to Jerusa­ <lb/>

            fit of ill-humour with the count, came express from Marrah to seize it and <lb/>

            joy among the people of God, and the duke of Normandy <lb/>
            joined them on their march at the city of Capharda.1 There <lb/>
            they rested three days, and the king of Cæsarea made an <lb/>
            alliance with the chiefs. He had already sent frequent <lb/>
            messages to Marrah, firmly promising to keep the peace <lb/>
            towards the Christians, and furnish them gratuitously <lb/>
            with many things they wanted, as well as to allow <lb/>
            them free trade through all his dominions, if only the <lb/>
            invincible Franks abstained from invading his dominions, <lb/>
            and devastating his territories. In that case, he swore <lb/>
            fealty to the Christians. The whole army now marched <lb/>
            from Capharda, and encamped on this side the river Farfar, <lb/>
            near Cæsarea.2 The king, seeing the Franks stationed so <lb/>
            near his city, was much troubled, and immediately sent <lb/>
            them this message: " Unless you remove your camp from <lb/>
            the suburbs of our city at the first dawn of day, you will <lb/>
            violate our treaty, we shall forbid the traffic for supplies, and <lb/>
            take precautions for our own safety." Accordingly, as soon <lb/>
            as it was morning, he sent two of his people to the Christians <lb/>
            to show them where they could ford the river, and to conduct <lb/>
            the army into a fertile district. They entered a rich and <lb/>
            fruitful valley, commanded by a castle which formed imme­ <lb/>
            diately a post of security for the chiefs. The army laid <lb/>
            hands on as many as five thousand cattle, and great abun­ <lb/>
            dance of provisions of all descriptions were found; so that <lb/>
            all the soldiers of Christ were refreshed by the gratuitous <lb/>
            plenty. The garrison also gave them horses, and pure gold, <lb/>
            and much money, and swore that they would never more <lb/>
            molest the pilgrims, nor prohibit their trafficking with the <lb/>
            people of the country. They rested there five days.</p>
          <p>Departing from thence, they came to a camp of the Arabs, <lb/>
            the chief of whom came forth to talk with the Christians, <note type="footnote"> 1 According to the careful Raymond d'Agiles, this place, which appears <lb/>

            nnd made a peace with them to the satisfaction of both <lb/>
            parties. They then journeyed to the city of Cephalia,l <lb/>
            which stands in a valley, and is surrounded with stately <lb/>
            walls, and rich in all kinds of commodities. The citizens <lb/>
            were struck with alarm at the approach of the Franks, and <lb/>
            deserted the place in a panic, leaving their gardens well <lb/>
            stocked with vegetables, and their houses stored with provi­ <lb/>
            sions and all kinds of useful articles, without staying to <lb/>
            look behind them. The Christians took possession of their <lb/>
            substance in triumph, rendering grateful thanks to God, the <lb/>
            Giver of all good. They marched forward on the third day, <lb/>
            and, crossing a high mountain by a precipitous road, <lb/>
            descended into another rich valley,2 where they rested twelve <lb/>
            days. While there they made a vigorous assault on a <lb/>
            fortified place belonging to the Saracens, which stood in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of the valley, and would have stormed it if <lb/>
            the Gentiles had not driven out to them herds of cattle and <lb/>
            beasts of burden, which the Christians carried off, and thus <lb/>
            returned to their camp encumbered with the spoil. The <lb/>
            Pagans, however, had been so terrified that they retired in <lb/>
            the night, and at dawn of day the Franks discovered that <lb/>
            the fort was deserted and took possession of it. They found <lb/>
            in it plentiful stores of corn and wine, meal, barley, and <lb/>
            oil, and they spent there the feast of the Purification of St. <lb/>
            Mary with great devotion.</p>
          <p>While there, the chiefs received rich presents from the <lb/>
            king of the city of Camela,3 who offered to make peace <lb/>
            with the Christians, promising that he would never molest <lb/>
            them, but rather love and honour them, if the Christian <lb/>
            army treated him in like manner.</p>
          <p>The king of Tripoli4 also sent ten horses and four mules <lb/>
            with a large sum of gold to the Christians, and demanded <lb/>
            by his envoys peace and amity with them. But the chiefs <lb/>
            would neither make peace with him, nor receive his presents, <note type="footnote"> 1 No remains of this place now exist. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The valley of Lem, or as some authors write it, Sem. Ordericus <lb/>

            on the contrary they boldly replied, " We reject all that <lb/>
            comes from you until you consent to become a Christian." <lb/>
            After leaving the rich valley, they came to a castle called <lb/>
            Archis,1 near which they encamped on the day before the <lb/>
            ides [the 12th] of February.2 The place was strongly <lb/>
            occupied by a vast number of Pagans, and frequented by <lb/>
            hordes of Arabs and Publicans, who defended themselves <lb/>
            bravely against the assaults of the Christians. Fourteen <lb/>
            Christian knights sallied forth on the road to Tripoli, which <lb/>
            was at no great distance from the camp, and fell in with <lb/>
            sixty Turks, who were convoying a large body of men, <lb/>
            Saracens, Arabs, and Curds, to the number of about one <lb/>
            thousand and five hundred, with vast herds of cattle. <lb/>
            The Christian knights charged the Turks with spirit and <lb/>
            killing six of them took their horses, and dispersed all the <lb/>
            rest of the convoy and brought back the cattle to the camp. <lb/>
            Thus the invincible bravery of the Franks quelled the <lb/>

            God thus working in them, who is always at hand to succour <lb/>

            success attended his servants, that fourteen Christians <lb/>
            defeated sixty Turks, and dispersed the rest of the multitude <lb/>
            carrying off the cattle from before their faces.</p>

            the whole army was present. At sunrise the Franks <lb/>

            Laodicea,2 which is commonly called Licea. Bohemond <lb/>
            however again parting from them, returned to Antioch, <lb/>

          <p>The duke and the count received this message with great <lb/>
            satisfaction, as they were eager for battle. They therefore <lb/>
            made peace with the emir of Gibel, and received from him <lb/>
            at the conclusion of the treaty many presents. They then <lb/>
            marched to the aid of their comrades, but did not find the <lb/>
            Turks as they expected. They therefore established them­ <lb/>
            selves on the other side of the river, and laid siege to the <lb/>
            castle. Shortly afterwards, some of the Christian horsemen <lb/>
            rode as far as Tripoli, looking for an opportunity of Annoying <lb/>
            the Gentiles. They found some Turks and Arabians, with <lb/>
            some of the people of Tripoli, riding about outside the town <lb/>
            waiting the approach of the Christians, and intending to <lb/>
            take them by surprise. Presently the squadrons charged <lb/>
            each other; the Saracens stood their ground fairly at the <lb/>
            first onset, and resisted for a time; at last however they <lb/>
            turned their backs and fled before the swords of the enemy, <lb/>
            and lost many of their party in the retreat; several of the <lb/>
            principal citizens fell there. The women, both mothers and <lb/>
            virgins, watching the conflict from the battlements, poured <lb/>
            forth imprecations on the Christians, and cries of anguish <lb/>
            for their friends. But in the midst of their grief, some of <lb/>
            them could not help admiring the valour of the Franks. <lb/>
            The river which washes the city was coloured red by the <lb/>
            blood of the Pagans who were slain, and the cisterns fed by <lb/>
            its stream in the heart of the city were polluted by the <lb/>
            carnage. The distress of the people of Tripoli was extreme, <lb/>
            as well for the loss of their principal citizens, as for their <lb/>
            cisterns, the waters of which were spoilt by the effusion of <lb/>
            blood. Thus they suffered two disasters on the same day, <lb/>
            and their tears flowed for a double misfortune. They were <lb/>
            in despair that the Franks had unexpectedly triumphed, and <lb/>
            were troubled at the pollution of the cisterns they valued <lb/>
            very Highly. The people of Tripoli were therefore utterly <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1099.] </note> <lb/>
            disheartened, and shutting themselves up within their walIa <lb/>
            before they were besieged, did not venture any longer <lb/>
            outside the gates ; their neighbours were partakers in their <lb/>
            misfortunes. The Franks, having obtained a welcome victory, <lb/>
            returned to their friends, giving praises to God.</p>
          <p>Another day, a detachment of cavalry made an irruption <lb/>
            into the valley of Sem1 to plunder the country, and sweeping <lb/>
            off oxen and asses, sheep and camels, to the number of <lb/>
            nearly three thousand, they returned triumphant to the <lb/>
            camp with this great booty. The crusaders were detained <lb/>
            before the castle of Archis three months and a day,2 for it was <lb/>
            almost impregnable. They celebrated there the feast of Easter, <lb/>
            on the fourth of the ides [the 10th] of April. Meanwhile, some <lb/>
            Christian ships had anchored in a port near the castle, which <lb/>
            was a safe harbour, and they were freighted with corn and <lb/>
            wine, cheese and oil, lentils and lard, and all sorts of <lb/>
            merchandise for the use of the army. The troops also made <lb/>
            frequent expeditions to ravage the country, and never failing <lb/>
            of success, they returned in high spirits and eager for fresh <lb/>
            incursions.3 However, many of the Christians fell before <lb/>
            the place, for the swords of the Saracens were not always in <lb/>
            their scabbards, nor their chivalry idle, nor their arms weak. <lb/>
            Thus they slew Anselm de Ribmont,4 and William Picard, <lb/>
            men of high birth and experience in military affairs, who <lb/>
            had signalized themselves by great achievements during that <lb/>
            crusade. Many others also fell, whose names may God <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH.XIV. </note> The king of Tripoli had frequent communications with <lb/>
            the Christian chiefs by means of his envoys, and used every <lb/>
            argument to persuade them to accept his presents and make <lb/>
            peace with him, breaking up their camp and receiving the <lb/>
            money agreed on. The crusaders proposed to him to em­ <lb/>
            brace Christianity, and would not be diverted from their <lb/>
            purpose by any other consideration. The prince heard of <lb/>
            this change of religion with extreme repugnance, for he <lb/>
            shrunk from relinquishing the rites of his fathers and the <lb/>
            customs of his ancestors. Meanwhile, time wearing on, the <lb/>
            new corn began to be white for harvest, for the climate of <lb/>
            that country is much warmer than it is on this side the <lb/>
            mountains, and the summer being earlier, the corn sooner <lb/>
            ripens. New beans are gathered in the middle of March, <lb/>
            wheat is cut by the ides [the 13th] of April, and the vintage <lb/>
            is finished before autumn.</p>
          <p>In consequence, Duke Godfrey, and the counts of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, Flanders, and Tholouse, with Tancred, held consul­ <lb/>
            tations respecting their departure, because the favourable <lb/>
            season was pressing on, if not almost past. Raising there­ <lb/>
            fore the siege of the castle which they had long invested, <lb/>
            they marched to Tripoli,1 and concluded a treaty of peace <lb/>
            with the inhabitants. The king delivered to them fifteen <lb/>
            thousand bezants and fifteen horses of great value, with <lb/>
            three hundred pilgrims he had long retained in captivity. <lb/>
            Peace being made,2 and the markets opened, the strength <lb/>
            of the Christians was universally re-established. The <lb/>
            king also promised them that if they were successful in <lb/>
            the battle which the emir of Babylon was then preparing to <lb/>
            fight with them, he would become Christian, and, for the <lb/>
            rest, would hold his territories under fealty to the chiefs.</p>
          <p>The crusaders quitted Tripoli in the middle of May,3 <lb/>

            evening at the castle of Betberen.1 Thence they came to <lb/>
            Zebari,2 a town lying on the sea-coast. Here they suffered <lb/>
            excessive thirst for want of water, fainting for which they <lb/>
            hastened forward to the river Braim,3 where men and beasts <lb/>
            refreshed themselves with abundant draughts. On Ascen­ <lb/>
            sion-day4 they had to thread a narrow defile, where they <lb/>
            were exposed to the attacks of the Gentiles during the <lb/>
            entire march, but they were not deterred from the attempt. <lb/>
            The standard-bearers and men-at-arms rode in the van, <lb/>
            looking out carefully against ambuscades; next came those <lb/>
            who had the care of the baggage and the drivers of the <lb/>
            beasts of burden. The rear was brought up by a body of <lb/>
            knights ready to give succour whenever it was needed. <lb/>
            Thus the loaded attendants proceeded daily, and crowds of <lb/>
            unarmed people were mingled with them. The trumpets <lb/>
            sounded from time to time, and they marched slowly that <lb/>
            the weak might not be left behind. They took it by turns to <lb/>
            mount guard by night, and when there was especial cause <lb/>
            of alarm, the watch was more on the alert: nothing was done <lb/>
            indiscreetly or in disorder. Breaches of discipline were <lb/>
            punished; the inexperienced were taught; the insubordinate <lb/>
            were reproved; the intemperate were restrained; and all <lb/>
            were encouraged to make charitable offerings. The practice <lb/>
            of frugality and propriety was universal; and, in a word, the <lb/>
            camp was a school of moral discipline. Such were the habits <lb/>
            and dispositions of the pilgrims to Jerusalem; and as long <lb/>
            as they observed these strict rules, and displayed their <lb/>
            charitable feelings, God was evidently with them, and made <lb/>
            them champions in his wars. I have given this account to <lb/>
            compare it with the way of life, so worthy of reproach, of <lb/>
            those disorderly persons who, full of vain-glory, followed in <lb/>
            the track of this glorious expedition. In fact there is <lb/>
            nothing like discipline in assemblies of men.</p>
          <p>Having at length traversed the mountains in which they <lb/>
            expected to be attacked, without meeting an enemy, they <lb/>

            monly called Sagitta,1 Tyre, which is also called Sor, and <lb/>
            Acharon called Acre,2 and afterwards a fortified place called <lb/>
            Caiphas.3 From thence they advanced towards Cæsarea,4 to <lb/>
            find quarters, and rested there on Whitsunday the fourth <lb/>
            of the ides of June.5 Afterwards they marched to Diospolis, <lb/>
            called also Ramatha, Arimathea, and Ramula,6 where they <lb/>
            halted, in consequence of their fatigue; and the inhabitants, <lb/>
            terrified by the approach of the pilgrims, deserted the town. <lb/>
            The church formerly boasted a bishop in that place, but <lb/>
            now the see was widowed and sunk in distress, since it was <lb/>
            ingloriously subjected to the yoke of the Saracens. The <lb/>
            Christians re-established a bishop in the city, and gave <lb/>
            him the tenth of their substance that he might live by their <lb/>
            offerings, and restore the long desolate church. It was <lb/>
            there that the illustrious champion St. George had nobly <lb/>
            contended for the faith, and gloriously ended his course by <lb/>
            martyrdom. A church dedicated to his honour stands in a <lb/>
            little suburb, where the precious remains of the confessor <lb/>
            rest. The Christians wished to have this saint always <lb/>
            their patron and companion, whom they had seen acting as <lb/>
            their leader and guide in the battle of Antioch, and their <lb/>
            mighty protector against the infidel nation. They therefore <lb/>
            greatly honoured his church, and appointed a bishop at <lb/>
            Ramula, as we have already related.</p>
          <p>Inspired with religious ardour, the pilgrims set forward <lb/>
            at day-break, and, on the signal being given, hastened <lb/>

          <p>ON the eighth of the ides [6th] of June,2 the Christians <lb/>
            invested Jerusalem, not as stepsons approaching a mother­ <lb/>
            in-law, but as children embracing their parent; for her <lb/>
            friends and sons surrounded her to fetter the brood of aliens <lb/>
            and bastards, not to deprive her of freedom, but to set her <lb/>
            free. Robert, duke of Normandy, laid siege to Jerusalem <lb/>
            on the north side near the church of St. Stephen, the proto­ <lb/>
            martyr, where, stoned by the Jews, he slept in the Lord. <lb/>

            liam the Bastard, king of England, and all the family of the <lb/>
            murdered countess sent emissaries to seek him in every <lb/>
            part of the world, promising honours and rewards to any one <lb/>
            who should despatch the fugitive assassin wherever he could <lb/>
            be found. The brave Hugh, fearing the strong hands and <lb/>
            long arms of the powerful king, left Christendom behind him, <lb/>
            and fearing nothing so much as the whole race of the bap­ <lb/>
            tized, became an exile for a long course of time among the <lb/>
            Mahometans, whose manners and language he adopted for <lb/>
            twenty years.3 Being now well received by the Duke of <lb/>
            Normandy, he was a great assistance to his countrymen, <lb/>
            being able to detect the skilful manoeuvres and stratagems <lb/>
            which they contrived against the faithful.</p>

            believer in Christ, and his heart was set on the regeneration <lb/>
            of holy baptism. Cosan therefore used his utmost efforts <lb/>
            to second those of his adopted friends and brothers in <lb/>
            securing the dominion of Palestine and the capital of the <lb/>
            kingdom of David.</p>
          <p>On the third day of the siege certain Christian knights <lb/>
            went forth from the camp, namely Raymond Pilet, Raymond <lb/>
            de Turenne,1 and some others, for the purpose of reconnoitring <lb/>
            the country or obtaining plunder, and falling in with two <lb/>
            hundred Arabs, attacked, defeated, and put them to flight. <lb/>
            They slew a great many and took thirty horses. After this <lb/>
            exploit, they returned in triumph to the camp.</p>
          <p>On Monday2 the crusaders made a vigorous assault on the <lb/>
            city, and it was believed they would have taken it if they had <lb/>
            been sufficiently supplied with scaling ladders. They made <lb/>
            a breach in the outer wall, and raised one ladder against the <lb/>
            inner one. The Christian knights mounted it by turns and <lb/>
            fought with the Saracens on the battlements hand to hand <lb/>
            with swords and lances. In these assaults many fell on both <lb/>
            sides, but most on the side of the Gentiles. The trumpets <lb/>
            sounding the recall, the Christians at length withdrew from <lb/>
            the combat, and returned to their camps. Meanwhile, the pro­ <lb/>
            visions they brought with them began to fail, nor could bread <lb/>
            be purchased for money, nor was any one able to succeed <lb/>
            in foraging. The country round is entirely without water, <lb/>
            and is moreover arid and rocky, affording no pasture for the <lb/>
            subsistence of beasts of burden or other animals. It is also <lb/>
            naked of trees and therefore produces but little fruit; bear­ <lb/>
            ing only the olive and the palm, with a few vines. The <note type="footnote"> 1 Raymond, viscount de Turenne. See before, p. 162. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Monday, June 13th. All the cotemporary accounts concur in this date <lb/>

            this mistake, the narrative will be found worthy of attention. The author, <lb/>
            after having related, like all the others, that the only ladder they had was <lb/>
            raised against the wall, adds that it was with the greatest difficulty Tanered <lb/>

            place, and at the moment he got to the top and laid hold of the battlement <lb/>
            to secure his footing, his hand was cut off. They were obliged to carry <lb/>
            him back to the camp, and reserve the ladder for a more favourable oppor­ <lb/>

            river Jordan is at the distance, it is computed, of nearly <lb/>
            thirty stadia from Jerusalem.. Connected with it, are six <lb/>
            lakes, but they lie far away. There are cisterns within the <lb/>
            walls which supply the city. At the foot of Mount Sion is <lb/>
            the fountain of Siloah, but its waters could only slake the <lb/>
            thirst of a very small number. It was, however, in great <lb/>
            request, and a small quantity of it was sold at a high rate. <lb/>
            They led the horses six miles to water, at considerable risk.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, news arrived in the camp that merchant ships <lb/>
            belonging to Christians had arrived at Japhi, which I think <lb/>
            was anciently called Joppa.1 This intelligence spread great <lb/>
            joy throughout the army, and the chiefs took counsel for <lb/>
            providing for the safety of those who went to and fro between <lb/>
            the camp and the ships for the transport of necessaries. <lb/>
            Joppa is about eight miles distant from Ramula; and the <lb/>
            people of Ascalori, and the wandering tribes of natives in the <lb/>
            mountains or in the fastnesses of the steep defiles, sometimes <lb/>
            sallied forth and massacred parties of travellers. Their <lb/>
            movements, or rumours of them, harassed the convoys <lb/>
            despatched by the merchants. To put an end to this, Raymond <lb/>
            Pilot, Achard de Montmel,2 and William de Sabran,3 with <lb/>
            one hundred men-at-arms of the division of the Count of <lb/>
            Tholouse, sallied forth at the dawn of day, and, followed by <lb/>
            a body of foot soldiers, began their march towards the sea- <lb/>
            coast. They were proceeding to the port, trusting in their <lb/>
            own valour, when their force became separated into two <lb/>
            bodies, whether purposely or from mistaking the road, we <lb/>
            cannot say. However, thirty of the horsemen who took a <lb/>
            different direction from the rest fell in with a hundred Arabs, <lb/>
            Turks, and Saracens, belonging to the emir's army, and <lb/>
            boldly charging them closed with them and engaged in battle. <note type="footnote"> 1 Now Jaffa. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Montmel in the Herault. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 William de Sabran (Gard) was living in 1123. He was nephew of <lb/>

            William assumed the title of constables by the grace of God of the counts <lb/>
            of Tholouse. He is thought to be the person who, at the siege of Antioch, <lb/>
            surprised the wife and family of Bagui- Syan in bed, and got from them <lb/>
            3000 bezants of gold. The historians say it was a person of the name of <lb/>

            The enemy gave them a warm reception, and trusting in <lb/>
            their superior numbers surrounded the small band of <lb/>
            Christians. Such is the mode of fighting among the <lb/>
            Saracens. They had already succeeded in this, and were <lb/>
            talking confidently of the slaughter they looked forward to, <lb/>
            when a messenger despatched to Raymond Pilet shouted <lb/>
            aloud, as he called to him : " Fly with the utmost speed to <lb/>
            the succour of your comrades, for without your aid they will <lb/>
            all be cut off. They are surrounded by the enemy, but as <lb/>
            yet they are doing their best to defend themselves."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, they gave their horses the reins, and <lb/>
            spurring onward flew quicker than thought to the spot. <lb/>
            Each knight clasping his shield to his breast levelled his spear <lb/>
            at a horseman in the enemy's ranks, and each brought his <lb/>
            foe to the earth. Appearing thus unexpectedly on the scene, <lb/>
            they turned the scale, and drawing their swords, by God's <lb/>
            help, changed the fortune of the day. The Pagans tried to <lb/>
            rally their forces, and forming them into two troops, prolong <lb/>
            the conflict, but were not able. For the Franks charged <lb/>
            them again with such impetuosity, that they released their <lb/>
            comrades who were beset, and who lost only Achard, a brave <lb/>
            knight and some foot soldiers. Having pursued the flying <lb/>
            Turks four miles, cutting down many of the fugitives, they <lb/>
            saved one hundred and three horses, and took one man alive, <lb/>
            who was compelled to give a particular account of all that <lb/>
            was planned against the Christians.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Christians employed in the siege were <lb/>
            suffering the torments of constant thirst. The Pagans lay <lb/>
            in ambush for the people who had to drive the horses six <lb/>
            miles to water, and occasioned them great losses in the narrow <lb/>
            defiles. Cedron and the other torrents were dried up by the <lb/>
            excessive drought. Even barley-bread was dear in the <lb/>
            camp. The natives, concealing themselves in dens and caverns, <lb/>
            interrupted all convoys of provisions.</p>
          <p>The chiefs of the army assembled in council to consider <lb/>
            what was to be done in the midst of these calamities. They <lb/>
            said: " We are in difficulties on all sides ; bread is wanting; <lb/>
            the water has failed. We ourselves are, in fact, closely <lb/>
            blockaded, while we fancy we are besieging this city. We <lb/>
            can hardly venture outside our camp, and when we do, return <lb/>
            empty. Our long delays have produced the scarcity, and, <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH.XV. </note> <lb/>
            unless we find a remedy, matters will become worse. This <lb/>
            place can never be taken by the mere strength of our hands <lb/>
            and arms without the aid of engines of war. We have <lb/>
            to contend against walls, and bulwarks, and towers ; we are <lb/>
            opposed by a numerous garrison who make an obstinate <lb/>
            defence. What, then, is your opinion ? Let us undertake <lb/>
            something which will relieve ourselves and distress the <lb/>
            besieged. We want timber to construct machines for <lb/>
            assaulting the walls and towers of the place. As the <lb/>
            country is not woody, let us take the rafters of the houses <lb/>
            and beams from the churches, and shape them to our purpose, <lb/>
            so that we may attack the city in the most determined <lb/>
            manner; otherwise, we waste our time to no purpose."</p>
          <p>At length the faithful champions of the cross discovered <lb/>
            some timber at a great distance from the camp,1 to which <lb/>
            they transported it with vast labour. Carpenters were <lb/>
            assembled from the whole army, some of whom hewed the <lb/>
            rough surface of the trees, others squared it and bored it, <lb/>
            while the rest fitted the beams and planks together. Duke <lb/>
            Godfrey built one machine at his own expense; the count <lb/>
            of Tholouse caused another to be constructed at his proper <lb/>
            cost. On the other hand, the Saracens used every effort to <lb/>
            strengthen the fortifications, raising the towers higher by <lb/>
            working in the night, and devoting themselves without <lb/>
            respite to increase the defences.</p>
          <p>One Saturday 2 Duke Godfrey's machine was transported <lb/>
            in the dead of the night to the foot of the walls, and erected <lb/>
            before sunrise, three days being employed in unremitting <lb/>
            exertions to fit the parts together and prepare it for use. <lb/>
            The count of Tholouse caused his machine, which might be <lb/>
            called a castle of wood, to be placed near the wall on the <lb/>
            south of the place, but a deep hollow prevented its being <lb/>
            joined to the wall. Such machines cannot be guided on <lb/>
            declivities nor carried up steep places, and can only be <note type="footnote"> I According to M. Michaud, this timber was procured from the forest <lb/>

            transported on level ground. Proclamation was therefore <lb/>
            made through the camp, that whoever should cast three <lb/>
            stones into the hole should for so doing receive a penny. <lb/>
            In consequence all the people who were weary of delay lent <lb/>
            a hand willingly to the proposed work.</p>
          <p>The bishops and priests addressed the multitude in moving <lb/>
            discourses, pointing with their fingers, while they spoke of <lb/>
            the death of Christ, to the very spot on which he suffered; <lb/>
            and while describing with holy eloquence the heavenly Jeru­ <lb/>
            salem, taking for its type the terrestrial one before which <lb/>
            they were assembled. In consequence, all the laity flew to <lb/>
            arms, and made a general attack on the city during Wednes­ <lb/>
            day and Thursday, which was continued by night as well as <lb/>
            by day. Again, having been prepared by fasting and <lb/>
            supplications, tears and alms, and strengthened by the com­ <lb/>
            munion of the consecrated host, they renewed their attack <lb/>
            at the first dawn of the morning of Friday, the ides [15th] <lb/>
            July,1 but without success; for the besieged to whom the <lb/>
            defence of the walls and towers was committed mutually <lb/>
            co-operated in hurling fire and stones on the assailants. <lb/>
            The count of Tholouse, having filled up the hollow, which <lb/>
            took three days and nights to accomplish, brought his <lb/>
            wooden tower up to the wall, and then permitted his troops <lb/>
            to rest till Monday on account of the great toil they had <lb/>
            undergone for a whole week.</p>
          <p>After the fatigues of the morning the Franks, by their <lb/>
            commander's order, withdrew awhile from the assault, and <lb/>
            the Pagans from the defence. The emir, Guinimond,2 and <lb/>
            his nephew Frigolind, the Persian, held the tower of David, <lb/>
            and had assembled there the magistrates and principal per­ <lb/>
            sons of the city for a conference. Meanwhile the women of <lb/>
            the place collected on the terraced roofs of the houses, as is <lb/>
            the custom in Palestine, and sang by turns, answering one <lb/>
            another with shrill voices, a song to the following effect ;­ <lb/>

          <p>While the Turkish women raised their voices in such <lb/>
            songs as these from the flat roofs of their houses, the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians listened in astonishment, inquiring curiously from <lb/>
            their interpreters what these sounds meant. Then Conon, <lb/>
            a German count, a brave knight and wise counsellor, who <lb/>
            had married the sister of Duke Godfrey, said: " Do you <lb/>
            hear, my lord duke, what these women say ? Do you under­ <lb/>
            stand what they mean ? When the men faint with toil and <lb/>

          <p>Accordingly, at the third hour, being the time at which <lb/>

            Christians, in memory of his passion, took fresh courage, <lb/>

            and the rest followed their lead. Then Letold and Rambold <lb/>
            Croton,' two brave soldiers, mounted the walls, and, utter­ <lb/>

            They were followed by several others, and those who had <lb/>
            hitherto defended the fortifications fled on all sides, and no <lb/>
            longer thought of the defence of the city. Crowds of Chris­ <lb/>

            of them endeavour to claim the distinction for their countrymen, or at <lb/>
            least a share of it. According to the chronicle of St. Brienne, the first <lb/>
            was a Breton followed by two Normans. Ralph de Caen gives the honour <lb/>
            to a Norman lord, Bernard de St. Valleri, a kinsman of Duke Robert, <lb/>
            who has been twice mentioned in the course of the narrative. </note><note type="footnote"> It appears, however, plain that the first who actually gained the summit <lb/>
            of the walls of the holy city were two brothers, natives of Tournay, and <lb/>
            belonging to Godfrey's division of the army. One was called Letalde, <lb/>
            Letolde, or Ludolfe, and the other Engelbert. As for Rambold Creton, we <lb/>
            have already seen that his escalade took place on the assault of the 13th of <lb/>
            June. The claims of Bernard de St. Valleri to the honours of the 15th of <lb/>
            July appear better founded. </note><note type="footnote"> The author of the Belli Sancti Historia, who was an eye-witness and <lb/>
            quite disinterested in the question of national vanity, tells us what really <lb/>
            passed. A piece of timber having been let down from the wooden tower <lb/>
            to the wall, so as to establish a connection between them, Bernard de St. <lb/>
            Valleri immediately began to make his way to the battlements, astride on <lb/>
            this beam, but while he was accomplishing this perilous and difficult <lb/>
            exploit, the two Belgians ran to the scaling-ladders, mounted them with <lb/>
            great rapidity, and were the first to leap from the wall into the interior of <lb/>
            the place. The Norman was, therefore the third who reached the summit, <lb/>
            and, perhaps annoyed at having been thus distanced, penetrated into the <lb/>
            city, with those who followed him, by another street. There he signalized <lb/>
            himself as the author tells us, by a sword-cut, worthy to be compared with <lb/>
            those of Godfrey and Robert of Normandy under the walls of Antioch, <lb/>
            already mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ordericus has not told us by what quarter the main body of the cru­ <lb/>

            unhung the wicket. This eye-witness paints with fearful vividness the <lb/>
            multitude rushing in to pillage the place, while the knights were engaged <lb/>
            in massacring all the inhabitants they met, without distinction of age or <lb/>

            best of their power, as soon as they saw the crusaders <lb/>
            storming the city, fled in a body to the church of the <lb/>
            Holy Sepulchre, and began devoutly chanting the Kyrie <lb/>
            eleison, and other prayers suited to the exigency of the <lb/>
            occasion, while they waited the issue of events. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Tancred and his followers, having lost their way, by God's <lb/>
            providence lighted on the church, and discovering by their <lb/>
            prayers and religious ceremonies that the people were wor­ <lb/>
            shippers of Christ, he said to his followers: " These men are <lb/>
            Christians, none of you presume to do them any injury: <lb/>
            we are not come here to afflict the worshippers of Christ, <lb/>
            but to deliver them from their cruel persecutors. They are <lb/>
            our brothers and friends, whose worth has been proved by <lb/>
            severe trials, like gold in the furnace." Then the illustrious <lb/>
            champion left there Bigod d'Igé, the commander of his <lb/>
            troops, with two hundred soldiers to guard the church, and <lb/>
            prevent the pagans from again taking possession of it. <lb/>
            Tancred himself, with the rest of his followers, marched to <lb/>
            the assault of other parts of the fortifications, and to assist <lb/>
            their comrades who were scouring the city and putting the <lb/>
            Saracens1 to the sword. Meanwhile the Christian na­ <lb/>
            tives, who remained with Bigod d'Igé in the church of the <lb/>
            Holy Sepulchre, had private conferences with him, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Allophilos. Our author has employed this word before to designate <lb/>
            the Mahomedan conquerors of the Holy Land. A capital letter is used <lb/>
            for the initial both in the text of Duchesne, and of the Historical Society <lb/>
            of France, seeming to indicate that the word represents a nation, tribe, or <lb/>
            sect, and it has been suggested that it may be translated worshippers (or <lb/>
            more closely) votaries of Allah. But the text of Duchesne, though in <lb/>
            general less correct than that of the recent French edition, which follows <lb/>
            the MS. of St. Evroult,) spells it Allophylos, and it seems most probable <lb/>
            that Ordericus used the word in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλόΦυλος</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φυλἡ</foreign>) <lb/>
            of another race, not a Jew, in which sense it is employed in Acts x. 28, <lb/>
            In the Septuagint the word is used in Isa. lxi. 5, and ib. 6, for " the <lb/>
            stranger," and " sons of the stranger." See also 2 Maccab. x. 2, 5, and <lb/>
            Joseph. Antiq. i. 21, and iv. 8; Died. Sic. i. 35; Thueyd. i. 102. Allophyli <lb/>
            is frequently employed by Sulpitius Severus (A.D. 427) to designate the <lb/>
            Philistines or Syrians: " Israelite subject! Allophylis," " Uxorem habuit <lb/>
            ex Allophylis ;” and several other passages. As the word was thus used, <lb/>
            before the time of Mahomet, to represent the inhabitants of the very <lb/>
            district of which Ordericus speaks, Duchesne's reading of Allophyli, not <lb/>
            Allophili, is probably correct, but without the initial capital. The other <lb/>
            version, notwithstanding the turn this gives it, besides the sound, would <lb/>
            make the word a strange compound. </note> <pb n="179"/>

            desiring to secure his protection, conducted him and his <lb/>
            companions, with great courtesy, to the holy places, namely, <lb/>
            the sepulchre of the Lord, and other sacred objects, showing <lb/>
            them some things which they and their predecessors had <lb/>
            long hidden in concealed recesses, for fear of the pagans. <lb/>
            Amongst other holy relics, Bigod d'Igé there found, in a <lb/>
            marble urn, deposited in a place hollowed under the altar, a <lb/>
            little packet of the hair of St. Mary, mother of God, which <lb/>
            he afterwards carried with him to France, and reverently <lb/>
            distributed among the sanctuaries of the cathedrals and <lb/>
            abbey-churches. For the mother, always a virgin, being in <lb/>
            the deepest distress during the passion of Christ, her son <lb/>
            and Lord, according to the custom of the nation and of <lb/>
            those times, rent her clothes and tore her hair, and devoutly <lb/>
            uttered lamentable cries for the death of her illustrious <lb/>
            friend. The devout women of the neighbourhood who were <lb/>
            present, and had long attached themselves to the service of <lb/>
            the divine Master, affectionately supported the weeping <lb/>
            mother of the King of heaven, and lavished upon her all the <lb/>
            endearing attentions which her circumstances required. <lb/>
            They then piously gathered up and carefully preserved the <lb/>
            hair which had been plucked, and John the Divine,1 and <lb/>
            other followers of Christ, afterwards deposited it in a <lb/>
            place of security, foreseeing how many would profit by <lb/>
            it. I have inserted this account in my work, because <lb/>
            the before-named Bigod d'Igé gave two of these sacred <lb/>
            hairs to a monk of Chartres, who was his cousin, which he <lb/>
            transferred to the church of Maule, where many sick per­ <lb/>
            sons were healed by their virtue.</p>
          <p>The emir, who commanded the tower of David, with the <lb/>
            chief persons of the city, and many others assembled there, <lb/>
            presented themselves in the greatest terror to Count Ray­ <lb/>

            as we shall find, in his endeavour to save those who took refuge in the <lb/>
            mosque built on the site of Solomon's Temple. The brave knight had, <lb/>
            according to the report of his panegyrist, Ralph de Caen, to submit to </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. CII.XV. </note> <lb/>
            entrance at this gate was only to be obtained before for <lb/>
            money, it being here that the pilgrims paid the tax for <lb/>
            admission into the city, and without it they were mercilessly <lb/>
            driven from the gate.</p>
          <p>The dispersed citizens again collected, and made a stand <lb/>
            in the temple of Solomon, where they resisted stoutly the <lb/>
            attacks of the Christians, but being at last driven to despair, <lb/>
            they laid down their arms and submitted to their fate. No <lb/>
            one knows the number of the slain, but the floor of the <lb/>
            temple was knee-deep in blood, and great heaps of corpses <lb/>
            were piled up in all quarters of the city, as the victors <lb/>
            spared neither age, sex, rank, nor condition of any kind. <lb/>
            They exercised this bitter vengeance upon the heathen and <lb/>
            thus massacred them, because they had profaned the temple <lb/>
            of the Lord and the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and had <lb/>
            used the temple of Solomon and the other churches for <lb/>
            their own accursed rites, and foully polluted them. Some <lb/>
            had taken refuge on the roof of Solomon's temple and <lb/>
            begged that Tancred's standard might be planted there, so <lb/>
            that under its protection they might hope for a better fortune. <lb/>
            But it profited them little or nothing, for not even these <lb/>
            were spared by the Christians, except that they suffered <lb/>
            some few to live that they might employ them in burying <lb/>
            the dead; but these were afterwards butchered or sold as <lb/>
            slaves. Tancred was much grieved at this, but he did not <lb/>
            quarrel with his companions about it.1 As for the count of <lb/>
            Tholouse, he conveyed in safety to Ascalon the emir who " <lb/>
            had surrendered to him, and given up the tower of David <lb/>
            with the rest of his party; for he had made them a promise <lb/>
            to that effect, and he kept his engagement. The victors did <lb/>
            not pillage and set on fire this city like other places taken <lb/>
            by storm, but finding the houses well supplied with all <lb/>
            conveniences, they reserved them for their own use, and <lb/>
            many liberally shared with the poor the stores they found. <lb/>
            Each -one quietly appropriated the first house he came to, <note type="footnote"> another humiliation in having to refund 700 marks of silver, to compensate <lb/>
            for the rapacity with which he had pillaged this mosque. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 If we may believe Peter Tudebode, the affair was far less honourable <lb/>
            to Tancred's character, and he himself caused it to be proclaimed by the <lb/>
            public crier, on Saturday morning, that whoever wanted to kill Mussul­ <lb/>

          <p>The crusaders, having thus at length secured their <lb/>

            of their blessed Saviour, having first cleansed their hands <lb/>
            from the stain of blood ; and many of them approaching it <lb/>
            with bare feet and tears of joy, offered their thanksgivings <lb/>
            and sacrifices of peace. The faithful indulged in transports <lb/>
            of joy, now that they had gained the object of their long <lb/>
            cherished hopes, which they had sought through so many <lb/>
            toils and dangers. They now witnessed with delight the <lb/>

            formed exalted conceptions of their future recompense. <lb/>
            However their immediate attention was called to the necessity <lb/>
            of clearing the city of the bodies of the slain, for the <lb/>
            spectacle was horrid and the stench insupportable. The <lb/>
            corpses were therefore piled in heaps by the captive Gentiles <lb/>
            and the poorer pilgrims who were paid for the service, and <lb/>

            whose free goodness they had triumphed over the heathen. <lb/>
            They restored the churches to their former honours, and <lb/>
            fitted them all for the work of prayer. A feast was institu­ <lb/>
            ted on Friday the lOth of July, to commemorate the taking <lb/>
            of the city. They also held a council for the appoint­ <lb/>

            Jerusalem, elected Duke Godfrey. He was of royal blood, <lb/>

            much advanced in the world in wealth, and power, and were <lb/>
            especially proved, strengthened, and elevated in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition to Jerusalem. Godfrey, being the eldest, was raised <lb/>
            to the throne of King David, because he had triumphed in <lb/>
            the war conducted with great ability after the French <lb/>
            manner, being both in heart and arm a most valiant warrior, <lb/>
            as well as generous and mild, and distinguished for his <lb/>

          <p>At the same time Arnulf de Zocris,1 a very learned man, <lb/>
            was elected to fill the functions of bishop. Meanwhile, <lb/>

            who gave up the place to them and made a treaty of peace. <lb/>
            They remained there some days, enjoying their repose, until <lb/>
            the king of Jerusalem sent messengers to them with great <note type="footnote"> 1 It is singular that our author has told us so little of this remarkable <lb/>
            person. His name was not Arnulfus de Zocris, but Arnulfus de RoheS, <lb/>
            Castello Flandriæ, probably Roculx, near Valenciennes. All the historians <lb/>
            agree as to his learning and ability. He made his profession at Caen <lb/>
            with great credit, Ralph de Caen, who was one of his scholars, speaks of <lb/>
            him with veneration and enthusiasm. The princess Cecilia, who was then <lb/>
            a nun, and afterwards abbess, of the monastery of the Holy Trinity at Caen. <lb/>
            recommended him as chaplain to her brother, when he embarked on his <lb/>
            pilgrimage for the Holy Land. It appears, even, that Duke Robert had <lb/>
            engaged to take the first favourable opportunity of making him a bishop. <lb/>
            Odo, bishop of Baycux, on his death at Palermo, left him the greatest part <lb/>
            of his splendid effects. If Ralph de Caen is to be believed, Bishop Adhe­ <lb/>
            mar also bequeathed to him his authority, so as to justify the singular title <lb/>
            of vice-bishop which the historian gives him from the time of the death of <lb/>
            the bishop of Puy. </note><note type="footnote"> But as Arnulf had been the principal opponent of the authenticity <lb/>
            of the holy spear at Antioch, most of the historians of the crusades, and <lb/>
            especially the fellow countrymen of Peter Barthelemi, have not spared him. <lb/>
            They affirm that he was the natural son of a priest, and ought in that <lb/>
            quality to have been attached as a serf to the service of the church to which <lb/>
            his birth had occasioned scandal; that he was not even a sub-deacon, and <lb/>
            that his irregularities during the crusade had made him the subject of the <lb/>
            taunts and songs of the people. It is however difficult to believe that a <lb/>
            prince, even so little scrupulous as the duke of Normandy, would have <lb/>
            received as chaplain from his pious sister a man who was not even qualified <lb/>
            by one of the lowest degrees of holy orders. However this may be, Arnulf, <lb/>
            elected patriarch on St. Peter's day (August I), was deposed before the end <lb/>
            of the year, which seems a strong confirmation of the charges made against <lb/>
            him. His predecessor Symon II. died in the island of Cyprus during the <lb/>

            On hearing this, Tancred and Eustace marched to Ramula <lb/>
            on the sea coast, and finding a number of Arabs, the <lb/>
            advanced guard of the emir's army, they attacked with spirit <lb/>
            and speedily dispersed them. Putting some to the sword, <lb/>
            they spared others to obtain from them exact accounts of <lb/>
            the emir and his army. They therefore learnt all particulars <lb/>
            as to who they were, their numbers, what were their <lb/>
            intentions, and in what quarter they would make an <lb/>
            attack.</p>
          <p>Tancred sent to the king the account he had carefully <lb/>
            gathered from the reports of the prisoners. " Know for <lb/>
            certain," he said, " that they are really preparing for war <lb/>
            against us at Ascalon, and that nearly all the world is <lb/>
            assembling and conspiring against us, thinking to defeat <lb/>
            and crush us. Collecting then your whole forces, come <lb/>
            and let us lay hold of this synagogue of Satan. For, as you <lb/>
            say, if we attack them fearlessly and unawares, we shall <lb/>
            easily overcome them by God's help, as they are encumbered <lb/>
            with arms and baggage, and are bringing with them engines <lb/>
            of war to assault the city." In consequence, the king caused <lb/>
            his heralds to proclaim that all should prepare themselves <lb/>
            for battle, and march immediately under the royal standard. <lb/>
            The king therefore, with the patriarchs before-named, the <lb/>
            count of Flanders and the bishop of Martorano,2 marched <lb/>
            out of Jerusalem on the third day.3 The count of St. <note type="footnote"> I The vizir Afdhal, who had reduced Jerusalem under his master’s <lb/>

            Giles and the Normans delayed their departure until they <lb/>
            heard more particulars respecting the march of the emir.1 <lb/>
            When the king had observed the enemy's preparations, he <lb/>
            sent the bishop of Martorano to Jerusalem to inform the <lb/>
            princes of the state of affairs ; and after conferring with the <lb/>
            counts of Tholouse and Normandy, he was hastening to <lb/>
            carry back their message to the king and the patriarch, <lb/>
            when he fell into the hands of the Pagans, and whether he <lb/>
            was slain or carried away captive it is not known, but he <lb/>
            was never seen afterwards.2</p>
          <p>The counts of Tholouse and Normandy began their march <lb/>
            for the scene of war with large bodies of troops, leaving <lb/>
            Jerusalem on the fourth day of the week.3 The clergy <lb/>
            offered ceaseless prayers and masses. Peter the hermit and <lb/>
            a small number of unarmed people who remained behind, <lb/>
            together with the defenceless women, made processions from <lb/>
            church to church, and spent their time in prayers and alms, <lb/>
            imploring God in his mercy to be propitious to his people, <lb/>
            and signally overthrow the enemy with his mighty arm. <lb/>
            The chiefs with their respective followers were now assem­ <lb/>
            bled on the banks of the river which runs near Ascalon. <lb/>
            They found large herds of cattle feeding there of which they <lb/>
            secured a great number. The Franks were pursued by <lb/>
            three hundred Arabs, but they turned upon them and drove <lb/>
            them to the camp with the loss of two prisoners. After <lb/>
            this excursion the Christians retired to their camp, where <lb/>
            they rested during the night, or rather almost all were occu­ <lb/>
            pied in keeping watch and saying their prayers. Late in the <lb/>
            evening, an order was issued by the patriarch forbidding any <lb/>
            pillage by the troops until the battle which was to be fought <lb/>
            on the morrow should be ended. <note type="footnote"> 1 It was not so much their uncertainty respecting the march of the emir <lb/>
            which detained the count of Tholouse and the duke of Normandy at <lb/>

            which alone they affected to consider as involved in this contest. His <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>AT sun-rise on the day before the ides [the 12th] of <lb/>
            Augnst,1 the holy army of Christ took up its position in a <lb/>
            level and pleasant valley near the sea, being formed into six <lb/>
            . divisions. Of these the king, the counts of Normandy, <lb/>
            Tholouse and Flanders, with Gaston, Eustace, and Tancred, <lb/>
            each put himself at the head of his own knights and cavalry, <lb/>
            and gave precise orders to his bowmen and foot soldiers. They <lb/>
            were detached in advance with instructions when they should <lb/>
            shout their war-cries and make attacks, when they should <lb/>
            stand firm, when they should press vigorously the close ranks <lb/>
            of the enemy; and constantly to watch the advance of their <lb/>
            standards in the rear, fearing nothing, and never recoiling <lb/>
            although severely handled by their adversaries. All this <lb/>
            indeed the Christian soldiers had learnt in many well-fought <lb/>
            fields.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the Gentiles drew out their troops <lb/>
            innumerable as the stars, ranging their countless legions in <lb/>
            squadrons from flank to flank of the Christian army. The <lb/>
            Ethiopians were placed in the van, with orders not to move. <lb/>
            They had one knee planted on the ground, and covering the <lb/>
            upper part of their bodies with their shields were armed with <lb/>
            arrows and swords. They were forbidden to make the least <lb/>
            move in retreat, or to advance more than a single pace from <lb/>
            the ground they occupied. These trained bands held their <lb/>
            position, according to their orders. To provide against the <lb/>
            excessive thirst to which they were exposed by the heat, the <lb/>
            clouds of dust, and the fatigue and length of the battle, they <lb/>
            had gourds full of water suspended from their necks that <lb/>
            they might be able to hold their ground, or pursue the fugi­ <lb/>
            tives without respite. As to their flying themselves, such a <lb/>
            thing was never thought of; animated as they were by their <note type="footnote"> 1 Friday, August 12, instead of which read Sunday, August 14. Our <lb/>
            author having spoken of only six divisions of the army, names seven com­ <lb/>
            manders. It would appear that the fifth corps was placed under the <lb/>
            orders of Eustace, count of Boulogne, and the sixth under those of <lb/>
            Tancred and Gaston jointly, as was the case at the battle of Antioch. </note> <pb n="186"/>

            vast numbers, by the fierce courage of barbarous nations, <lb/>
            and by the order of their commander1 who had declared that <lb/>
            fugitives should lose their heads.</p>
          <p>Both armies being thus drawn up in battle array and arived <lb/>
            on the field, the Christians halted for a short time, and rais­ <lb/>
            ing their eyes upwards knelt on the ground and prayed <lb/>
            devoutly; for they looked for help from heaven, from <lb/>
            whence they had often been sensible of receiving it in their <lb/>
            necessities. After offering a short prayer, and reverently <lb/>
            making the sign of the blessed cross on their foreheads, they <lb/>
            mounted their horses in great confidence, and, in the name <lb/>
            of the Lord Jesus, undauntedly charged the enemy; for <lb/>
            the Gentiles had now halted, and waited the attack in an <lb/>
            immovable attitude. The count of Tholouse rode at the <lb/>
            head of his cavalry on the right wing of the army towards <lb/>
            the sea. The king's division hastened forward on the left. <lb/>
            The duke of Normandy, the count of Flanders, with Tancred <lb/>
            and others, were posted in the centre; but there were ten <lb/>
            Mahometans in the ranks for one of our people. At the <lb/>
            beginning of the battle, Robert duke of Normandy, perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing at a distance the emir's standard, which exhibited an <lb/>
            ,apple of gold on the point of a spear, the staff shining with <lb/>
            silver plates, by which the duke learnt the emir's station <lb/>
            . in the line, he singled him out in the midst of the squadrons, <lb/>
            and rushing furiously at him gave him a mortal wound.2 <lb/>
            This greatly checked the enemy's daring. The count of <lb/>
            Flanders now charged them, and the fearless Tancred dashed <lb/>
            into the middle of their camp. The pagan cavalry presently <lb/>
            turned round and fled. The Ethiopians were struck with <lb/>
            panic but did Dot move. The king however, and some of the <note type="footnote"> The vizir Afdhal. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is a correct account with the exception of the word mortal. </note><note type="footnote"> "The standard," observes M. Prevost, " like that of Richard-Cœur-de-Lion in <lb/>
            the subsequent crusade, might he a long staff fixed in a car moving <lb/>
            on four wheels, and surmounted by a flag, or other ensign, which placed in <lb/>
            the centre of the army served for a rallying point." We have had, <lb/>
            however, several instances of the banners or pennons of the knights being <lb/>
            borne in the hand, which we think was also the more usual custom with <lb/>
            respect to the standards of the commanders, and was probably the case, <lb/>
            with the vizir's at the battle of Ascalon, as we find it was so portable as to <lb/>

            Franks, wheeled towards them and halting a moment cut them <lb/>
            down as corn is reaped in harvest, severing their heads from <lb/>
            their bodies with strokes of their swords. The field flowed <lb/>
            with blood and was covered with the corpses of the pagans. <lb/>
            The Christians pursued the fugitives, who, terrified by the <lb/>
            Divine influence, had no opportunity of rallying. Their <lb/>
            sight was so dimmed that, as it was afterwards related by <lb/>
            some who escaped, although their eyes were open, they could <lb/>
            scarcely see the Christians, and were wholly incapable of <lb/>
            resisting them. Even numbers were unable to make a stand <lb/>
            against a few, but tried every means of getting out of their <lb/>
            way. Our victorious troops punished the Pagans without <lb/>
            exception, sparing no one. It was a fatal day to them, for <lb/>
            they found no means of escaping; for trees, rocks, and the <lb/>
            deepest recesses of caves gave them up to the swords of the <lb/>
            conquerors.</p>
          <p>Count Raymond, whose position lay towards the coast, <lb/>
            slew immense numbers, and pursued them vigorously towards <lb/>
            the city which stood at a short distance. They fell on the way <lb/>
            by fatigue, or were cut down with mortal wounds, or threw <lb/>
            themselves into the sea, and thus rushed from one kind of <lb/>
            death to another. The emir's fleet covered the sea wait­ <lb/>
            ing the issue of the battle. Seeing that a different fortune <lb/>
            from what they expected awaited their friends, the Pagans <lb/>
            embarked in their ships, and setting sail steered for their own <lb/>
            country. It is reported that the emir, half fainting, groaned <lb/>
            aloud, and thus vented his grief: " Creator of all things ! how <lb/>
            is this ? How is it that so terrible a fate has fallen to our <lb/>
            lot ? Alas ! what unutterable disgrace, what endless shame <lb/>
            has involved our race ? A nation of mendicants, a nation <lb/>
            small in number, has prevailed against us. How is this ? I <lb/>
            assembled and led here two hundred thousand cavalry, and <lb/>
            infantry without number, enough, I thought, to conquer the <lb/>
            world. Now, to speak the truth, they have been shamefully <lb/>
            defeated by less than a thousand cavalry, and thirty thou­ <lb/>
            sand infantry. Either their God is omnipotent, and fights <lb/>
            on their side, or ours is incensed with us, and chastises and <lb/>
            punishes us in the fierceness of his wrath. However this <lb/>
            may be, one thing is certain ; I will never again take arms <lb/>
            against the Christians, but will return to my own country <lb/>
            where my disgrace will only end with my life." These words <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IX. CH XVII. </note> <lb/>
            were mingled with sighs and groans from the depth of his <lb/>
            heart.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of Ascalon, perceiving the fugitive Saracens <lb/>
            making for the town, and entering it in crowds, while Count <lb/>
            Raymond with his provincials was pursuing and cutting <lb/>
            them down without respite, shut their gates to exclude both <lb/>
            their enemies and their allies. For they feared that their <lb/>
            invincible foes would enter the town along with their friends, <lb/>
            and massacring the citizens completely subjugate it. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, the undaunted Count of Tholouse halted his <lb/>
            troops under the walls, and butchered such of the Saracens <lb/>
            as lingered about their asylum, like a flock of sheep. The <lb/>
            inhabitants therefore, seeing from their battlements the <lb/>
            determined spirit of the Christians, and apprehensive that the <lb/>
            indiscriminate slaughter they now witnessed or had heard of <lb/>
            as the lot of their neighbours, might overtake themselves, <lb/>
            begged the count to send them his ensign, and promised <lb/>
            faithfully to surrender the place to him. They were more <lb/>
            disposed to this because the count was the the nearest of <lb/>
            the chiefs, and the danger from him was most threatening, <lb/>
            and also because he had saved the emir Guinimund and the <lb/>
            rest who had trusted to his word. The count sent his standard <lb/>
            to the citizens who asked for it, and having dispersed and <lb/>
            slain all the enemy who were under the walls, joined his <lb/>
            comrades who were resting after the carnage, and having <lb/>
            assembled them together, thus addressed them: "Thanks be <lb/>
            to God, the victory is on our side, and the citizens of Ascalon <lb/>
            are almost reduced to open their gates to us. They have <lb/>
            already received my standard, and if you grant permission <lb/>
            will willingly accept me for their master, and obey my com­ <lb/>
            mands, for the sake of saving themselves." The king replied: <lb/>
            " Far be it from me to yield the dominion of this place to <lb/>
            any one: I will compel it to surrender and submit to my <lb/>
            authority. Ascalon is very near Jerusalem, and it is expedient <lb/>
            that both should be under the rule of the same prince." <lb/>
            Robert of Normandy and the count of Flanders, and the <lb/>
            other chiefs remonstrated with the king, saying: " We all <lb/>
            know well-enough that the count of St. Giles left his rich <lb/>
            lands and well fortified towns for the service of God. During <lb/>
            this holy enterprise, he has performed many brilliant achieve­ <lb/>
            ments, and has excelled us all by the resolution he has shown <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> AUG. 1099.] </note> <lb/>
            in great trials and sufferings. If therefore he is determined <lb/>
            to persevere in the duties of the pilgrimage he has under­ <lb/>
            taken, and defend the holy city which he has shown so much <lb/>
            zeal in recovering to the faith of God, you ought willingly to <lb/>
            relinquish to him this place, which is not yet in your posses­ <lb/>
            sion, and which he claims. When we are returned to our <lb/>
            own states, you will doubtless have need enough of his <lb/>
            counsels and active support. Ascalon will be a noble and <lb/>
            useful fief of the crown of Jerusalem, and this great <lb/>
            lord will pay you homage and perform military service <lb/>
            for it."</p>
          <p>The king refusing to follow the advice of the chiefs, the <lb/>
            count departed in a rage, and sent word to the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Ascalon to make an obstinate defence. The king wanted <lb/>
            to besiege it, but all the chiefs abandoning him through <lb/>
            fatigue and anger, he could do nothing by himself, and was <lb/>
            compelled to draw off much chagrined, leaving the place <lb/>
            uninjured. Neither Godfrey, nor the other kings who <lb/>
            reigned after him during the course of forty years,1 to their <lb/>
            shame be it spoken, have ever been able to the present day <lb/>
            to reduce this capital of the Philistines; on the contrary, it <lb/>
            has been the cause of their losing more than a hundred <lb/>
            thousand men, besides suffering other disasters. Such was <lb/>
            the consequence of an insatiable ambition. If the king had <lb/>
            possessed a true spirit of charity, and following the law of <lb/>
            God, had loved his neighbour as himself, he might have <lb/>
            obtained possession of the hostile city that very day, and <lb/>
            thereby secured a free passage for the Christians even to <lb/>
            Babylon. I acknowledge the great merits of King Godfrey, <lb/>
            but in this, as St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, " I praise <lb/>
            him not."2</p>
          <p>It is reported that the emir had in the battle two hun­ <lb/>
            dred thousand cavalry, and countless bodies of infantry, <lb/>
            while the Christians had scarcely one thousand cavalry <lb/>
            and thirty thousand infantry. After having, by God's <lb/>
            help, defeated the enemy, they proceeded to plunder the <lb/>
            tents of the Ishmaelites. They found there, to speak shortly, <note type="footnote"> 1 This calculation would seem to indicate, if it were not for the little <lb/>
            confidence we can place in our author's round numbers, that the close of <lb/>

            everything that can be imagined as valuable; silver and <lb/>
            gold, corn, meal, and oil, innumerable herds of cattle, rich <lb/>
            ornaments, piles of arms, and if it be possible things more <lb/>
            precious. Having pillaged the camp of this booty, they <lb/>
            returned to the holy city of Jerusalem, and offered thanks­ <lb/>
            givings to God in all the churches for their success.</p>
          <p>Robert, duke of Normandy, bought the emir's standard, <lb/>
            for twenty silver marks, from those who took it when he was <lb/>
            wounded, and placed it in the church of the Holy Sepulchre <lb/>
            in memory of this victory.1 Some one else purchased the <lb/>
            emir's sword for sixty bezants. All Christendom was <lb/>
            filled with unspeakable joy on hearing the issue of the <lb/>
            war.</p>
          <p>Thus the crusaders delivered Jerusalem from the power <lb/>
            of the impious Turks in the year of our Lord 1099, having <lb/>
            often triumphed over them, under Christ their leader. The <lb/>
            great battle of which we have last spoken was fought on the <lb/>
            second of the ides [the 12th] of August, and in consequence <lb/>
            thanksgivings were offered to God throughout the Christian <lb/>
            world.</p>

            <title type="sub">CH. XVIII. Some account of Baldric, archbishop of Dol, from whose account of the crusade the previous narrative is taken—Conclusion of the present book.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THUS far I have followed the steps of the venerable Baldric,2 <lb/>
            in giving a true account of the noble army of Christ, which <lb/>
            by God's help, fought the swarms of the Gentiles with such <lb/>
            signal success in the countries of the East. In many places <lb/>
            I have quoted the very words used by that writer, not daring <lb/>
            to alter his language, as I did not think I could improve it. <lb/>
            Some things I have curtailed, that I might not weary the <lb/>
            reader with the length of my narrative, and others of which <lb/>
            he was silent I have added for the benefit of posterity, from <lb/>
            information I have carefully gathered from persons who <note type="footnote"> 1 If Wace may be trusted (t.. ii. p. 322), this standard was deposited by <lb/>
            Robert in the church of the Holy Trinity at Caen; but it is probable that <lb/>
            with his usual want of precision he has confounded the standard of the <lb/>
            battle of Ascalon, with some other ensign taken by the duke in a war <lb/>
            which furnished so many spoils of this description as the first crusade did. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See the note respecting Bishop Baldric at the beginning of the present <lb/>

            shared the toils and perils of the expedition. I ought to <lb/>
            respect and venerate the old prelate, with whom I had an <lb/>
            intimate acquaintance. He was a citizen of Orleans, and had <lb/>
            been a monk, and afterwards abbot of Bourgeuil, and was <lb/>
            well imbued with learning, as well as much respected for his <lb/>
            virtue and piety. His religion and wisdom were the means <lb/>
            of his election to the diginity of archbishop of Dol.1 But <lb/>
            when a bishop he still observed the monastic discipline, and <lb/>
            as often as he had opportunity resided among the monks. <lb/>
            Having the rude Bretons for his flock, whose insubordina­ <lb/>
            tion he could not bear, he frequently escaped from their <lb/>
            lawless insolence, and took refuge in Normandy,2 where the <lb/>
            church of DoLhad possessed domains on the river Risle3 from <lb/>
            the time of St. Samson, who lived in the reign of Childebert, <lb/>
            king of the Franks, which it still enjoyed in undisturbed <lb/>
            tranquillity. There, not only by his writings, but by his <lb/>
            discourses, he invited his hearers to the service of God, and <lb/>
            paid visits to the abbeys of Fécamp, Fontenelles, Jumièges, <lb/>
            and other monasteries in that neighbourhood, comforting the <lb/>
            monks in the fear of the Lord, by his holy conversation. <lb/>
            He died at length in a good old age, and was buried at <lb/>
            Préaux, in the church of St. Peter the apostle before the <lb/>
            crucifix.</p>
          <p>I propose to rest here, being fatigued with writing and <lb/>
            having to make researches concerning, events which occurred <lb/>
            at a great distance in the far countries of the East. I shall <lb/>
            therefore bring the sixth1 book of my ecclesiastical history <lb/>
            to a conclusion. <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author calls Baldric archbishop of Dol, as that prelate claimed <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1098, the sixth induction, the <lb/>
            Almighty Creator of all things displayed some extraordinary <lb/>
            signs in the heavens to terrify mankind, and by such <lb/>
            unusual appearances predict fearful events. On the fifth <lb/>
            of the calends of October [the 27th September], the sky <lb/>
            appeared to be on fire the whole night.1 Afterwards, in the <lb/>
            seventh indiction, on a Saturday on which the feast of our <lb/>
            Lord's nativity happened to fall, the sun was eclipsed.2 <lb/>
            After these signs, there were changes among the rulers of <lb/>
            the world, and terrible disasters and tumults, with severe <lb/>
            calamities, troubled mankind. Pope Urban, after governing <lb/>
            the apostolic see for ten years3 with vigour and usefulness, <lb/>
            fell sick at Rome when Jerusalem was taken, and departed <lb/>
            out of this life on the fourth of the calends of August <lb/>
            [24th July], going to his reward above for the good works <lb/>
            which had distinguished him here. The lamentations of <lb/>
            his enemies for his loss, as well as his fame spread through­ <lb/>
            out the world, attest how admirable was his life. Peter <lb/>
            Leo has composed three elegiac couplets, recording his <lb/>
            worth thus shortly :4 <lb/>
            "Rheims claims Odo as a canon, Cluni as a monk. Rome <note type="footnote"> 1 The year 1098 appears to have been remarkable for the number of <lb/>
            meteoric appearances. This must not be confounded with the Aurora <lb/>

            the day mentioned by our author. This passage is of great importance, as <lb/>
            it proves that Ordericus reckoned the indiction, not from the 1st of Sep­ <lb/>
            tember, with the emperors of the East, nor from the 24th of the same <lb/>
            month, with the emperors of the West and the kings of England, but from <lb/>
            a period of the year later than the 27th. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This calculation in round numbers is not exact. Urban II. filled the <lb/>

            invites him, and Ostia makes him her bishop. When as <lb/>
            pope, he changed his name to Urban ; the honour which the <lb/>
            city had lost was restored entire. Rome has here celebated <lb/>
            his obsequies on the fourth day before the beginning of <lb/>
            August."</p>
          <p>Another eminent versifier has treated of the life and <lb/>
            death and conduct of the same pope, in the following <lb/>
            verses:</p>
          <p>" Odo, a canon of Rheims, who was made a monk of <lb/>
            Cluni by [Abbot] Hugh, became an excellent pope. While he <lb/>
            lived he was the light'of Rome, when he died it was eclipsed. <lb/>
            The city flourished while he lived, and languished at his <lb/>
            death. 0 Rome! the laws which he gave you, and the <lb/>
            peace he cherished, filled you with happiness, preserving <lb/>
            you from vices within and from foes without. He was <lb/>
            never swayed by the wealth of the rich, nor elated by <lb/>
            praises and fame, nor terrified by the threats of the power­ <lb/>
            ful. His tongue was remarkable for eloquence, his heart for <lb/>
            wisdom, his conduct by worth, his carriage by dignity. <lb/>
            Through him the way is open to the holy city ;1 our religion <lb/>
            triumphs ; the pagans are conquered; and the faith is spread <lb/>
            through the world. As the rose, the most brilliant of <lb/>
            flowers, is soon plucked, so fate swept off this distinguished <lb/>
            prelate. Death possesses his mortal part, rest his soul, the <lb/>
            tomb his corpse; nothing is left to us but his glory."</p>
          <p>While Pope Urban was still a shining light in the house <lb/>
            of the Lord, and engaged in expelling darkness from the <lb/>
            hearts of men by his preaching and example, Guibert of Ra­ <lb/>
            venna, who was called Clement, died,3 and Peter Leo com­ <lb/>
            posed his eulogy in the following ironical verses : <note type="footnote"> Histoire Littéraire de France. It was to the palace of this powerful and <lb/>
            wealthy nobleman the pope retired to end his days. " Urban, returning to <lb/>
            the city after the conclusion of the council of Bari, betook himself, worn <lb/>
            out with age and infirmities, from the Transteverine island to the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring residence of Peter Leo, a powerful noble who was his intimate <lb/>
            friend. The mansion, which is strongly fortified, stands near the church of <lb/>
            St. Nicholas; there the pope, who had worthily filled the apostolic see, <lb/>
            died happily on the fourth of the calends of August (29th of July), 1099.” </note><note type="footnote"> There will be frequent opportunities of referring again to Peter Leo. <lb/>

            " Guibert! neither Rome nor Ravenna offers you an <lb/>
            asylum ; settled in neither, you are now expelled from both. <lb/>
            You lived at Sutri,1 a pope under sentence of excommuni­ <lb/>

            regions."</p>
          <p>On the death of Pope Urban, Rainier, a monk of Vallom­ <lb/>
            brosa was elected pope by the name of Paschal, and <lb/>
            canonically consecrated on the sixteenth day from the <lb/>
            departure of his predecessor.3 He governed the apostolical <lb/>
            see nearly twenty years, and devoted himself with the <lb/>
            utmost care to the service of the church of God. He visited <lb/>
            France in the time of King Philip, and spending the feast <lb/>
            of Easter4 at Chartres, confirmed the privileges of that <lb/>
            church, on the petition of the venerable bishop Ivo.5</p>
          <p>The emperor, Henry IV., had disturbed the peace of <lb/>
            holy church from his youth ; had long violently usurped the <lb/>
            right of ecclesiastical investitures, and intruded into the <lb/>
            house of the Lord the profane adversaries of ecclesiastical <lb/>
            unity. He was now dethroned by his son Charles, covered <lb/>
            with disgrace for the enormity of his evil deeds, and being <lb/>
            deserted by all his friends in his declining years, died a <lb/>
            wretched old man on the seventh [of the ides] of August.6 <lb/>
            But, as for his crimes, he died under a sentence of apostolical <lb/>
            excommunication; his corpse was suffered to decay, like <lb/>
            that of a beast, uncommitted to the bosom of mother earth, <lb/>
            not being permitted to receive the rites of burial common <lb/>
            to all mankind.7 His reign lasted nearly fifty years ; but <note type="footnote"> 1 Sutri, six leagues and a half S.S.E. of Viterbo. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Civita-Castellana, an episcopal city, seven leagues S.E. from Viterbo. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Rainier, a native of Bleda in Tuscany, and a monk of Cluni (not <lb/>

          <p>The emperor Charles Henry V. began his reign in the <lb/>
            year of our Lord 1106, succeeding to his father's authority, <lb/>
            which he held for nearly nineteen years, and " walked in the <lb/>
            way of his father,”1 as it is said in Chronicles of the wicked <lb/>
            son of an iniquitous father. In the fifth year of his reign,2 <lb/>
            he invested Rome at the head of 30,000 cavalry, and an im­ <lb/>
            mense army of infantry, and having made a treaty with the <lb/>
            Romans, was admitted by the terms of it to enter the city,3 <lb/>
            where by order of the pope he sat on the imperial throne in <lb/>
            the church of St. Peter the apostle. He then requested the <lb/>
            pontiff to celebrate mass; but he refused, unless four nobles <lb/>
            of the imperial court who had been expressly excommuni­ <lb/>
            cated by him, were excluded. The emperor was so incensed <lb/>
            that he commanded the pope to be arrested while he was <lb/>
            standing before the altar. Upon this, one of the imperial <lb/>
            guards laid hands on the pontiff; but one bolder than the <lb/>
            rest of the by-standers drew his sword in imitation of <lb/>
            Simon Peter, and smote the assailant of the pope with more <lb/>
            resolution and effect than Peter did Malchus, for he killed <lb/>
            the emperor's retainer with a single stroke. In consequence <lb/>
            there was a great tumult in the city, and a cruel conflict <lb/>
            between the two parties, in which blood was even shed in <lb/>
            the churches, without any regard to decency. Two thou­ <lb/>
            sand Normans from Apulia had marched to the support of <lb/>
            the Romans. These, united with the citizens and Latins, <lb/>
            marched out and put to the sword vast numbers of the <lb/>
            Germans and other people who were quartered in supposed <lb/>
            security in the ancient city on the other bank of the Tiber. <lb/>
            Thrice they expelled the emperor and his followers from the <lb/>
            city; but they could not release the pope from captivity, <lb/>
            because the place of his imprisonment was concealed. The <lb/>
            emperor attempted to march through Rome with his <note type="footnote"> 1 A very common phrase in the book of Chronicles, applied both to <lb/>

            troops under arms on his road to Campania, but he was <lb/>
            resisted at the point of the sword, and compelled to retire <lb/>
            by another way ; and many had to lament the vast numbers <lb/>
            of his troops who, as we said before, were cut oft' in the <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the pope, detained in close custody, and <lb/>
            deprived of all support, yielded to the emperor's demands.1 <lb/>
            Having thus obtained his release, he became afterwards an <lb/>
            object of contempt to many persons. Robert of Paris,2 <lb/>
            Walo bishop of Léon,3 and Poncius abbot of Cluni,4 and <lb/>
            many more cardinals and prelates of churches, blamed the <lb/>
            pope,5 affirming without hesitation that all he had conceded <lb/>
            to the emperor, whether verbally or in writing, was void. <lb/>
            They declared that he ought to have been willing to die for <lb/>
            truth and justice, following the example of Christ, with clean <lb/>

            and torture, rather than yield anything to the secular power, <lb/>
            contrary to the laws and decrees of the fathers. Pope <lb/>
            Paschal bore the rebukes of his learned accusers with patience, <lb/>
            confessing that their assertions were just and true. Soon <lb/>
            afterwards he assembled a council of bishops at Rome,6 in <lb/>
            which all the acts which the emperor bad obtained from him <lb/>
            under coercion, were plainly condemned, under the advice of <lb/>
            the jurisconsults, and the emperor was excommunicated for <lb/>
            his profanation of the house of God, and imprisonment of <lb/>
            the servant of Christ, and effusion of Christian blood. It <lb/>
            was thus that the emperor, in the sixth year of his reign, <lb/>
            soiled the glory of Latium by these great crimes, and <lb/>
            disturbed to no purpose many nations by his attempt to <lb/>

            reduced the city more by threats than by arms.2 In that <lb/>
            expedition the emperor attacked Milan, but was repulsed, <lb/>

          <p>William Rufus, a warlike prince, succeeded to the throne <lb/>
            of England at his father's death; he firmly repressed <lb/>
            rebellions against his authority, and for twelve years and ten <lb/>
            months kept all his subjects in submission to his rule. <lb/>
            He was liberal to his military men and to foreigners, but the <lb/>
            poor natives of his realm were severely oppressed, and he <lb/>
            exacted from them what he so prodigally bestowed on <lb/>
            strangers. During his reign many of his father's nobles died, <lb/>
            who had acquired in his wars honours beyond any they <lb/>
            inherited from their ancestors, in whose place the king <lb/>
            substituted men of low rank who raised themselves to <note type="footnote"> I At the death of Henry V. the imperial dignity was lost by the house <lb/>

            eminence, as the reward of their flatteries. William Rufus <lb/>
            was never married, having abandoned himself without <lb/>
            restraint to lewdness and debauchery, setting his subjects a <lb/>
            fatal example of gross lasciviousness. On the death of the <lb/>
            bishops and abbots, the king's officers seized their ecclesi­ <lb/>
            astical possessions and all their wealth, which for three years <lb/>
            and upwards were held by the king. Thus for the sake of <lb/>
            the revenues which the king's avarice gathered into his <lb/>
            treasury, the churches were suffered to remain vacant, and, <lb/>
            deprived of their proper pastors, the Lord's flock were <lb/>
            exposed to the ravages of the wolves.</p>
          <p>At this time the venerable bishops, Osmund of Salisbury1, <lb/>
            Walkelin of Winchester,2 William of Durham,3 Remi <lb/>
            of Lincoln,4 and several other reverend prelates died, whose <lb/>
            rents and property were for a long time in the hands of <lb/>
            Flambard and his brother Fulcher.5 So also, on the death <lb/>

            afterwards abbot of St. Vincent-du-Mans. Nominated to the bishopric of <lb/>
            Durham by William the Conqueror, November 9,1080, he was consecrated <lb/>
            at Gloucester, the 3rd of January, 1081. King William Rufus made him <lb/>
            great-justiciary of England, and heaped benefits upon him, which did not <lb/>
            prevent him from betraying his benefactor, and joining the conspiracy of the <lb/>
            bishop of Bayeux, the result of which obliged him to take refuge in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. In the month of September, 1091, William restored him his <lb/>
            bishopric, while he was at Durham on his expedition against the king of <lb/>
            Scots. The bishop's return to England was fatal to the peace of the <lb/>
            church, as he never ceased fomenting the quarrel between the king and St. <lb/>
            Anselm, in the hope of one day obtaining the primacy in his place. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Remi was a monk of Fécamp, and attended William the Conqueror to <lb/>

            moderate allowance of food and clothing, and paying the <lb/>
            surplus of the revenues into the royal treasury. At last, <lb/>
            after a considerable time, the king conferred these ecclesi­ <lb/>

          <p>THE venerable Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, seeing <lb/>

            and of his perilous travels, in a book which he published1 on <lb/>

            and pressed the siege against the rebellious Lombards who <lb/>
            had driven out the young prince. The pope offered <lb/>
            himself as mediator, and with the assistance of the venerable <lb/>
            Anselm, proposed conditions of peace between the contend­ <lb/>
            ing parties. At length the count suppressed the rebellion, <lb/>
            and restored his nephew to his former honours, and the pope <note type="footnote"> Dover, William de Warwast, the king's favourite, examined his effects in <lb/>

            been near at hand when the archbishop received this last message. It is <lb/>
            probable that this envoy of the king's is the same person who was made bishop <lb/>
            of Exeter in 1107. A Norman by birth, he had been attached to the <lb/>
            chapel royal from the reign of William the Conqueror, and employed in <lb/>
            several missions. He was probably born at a place now called Veraval, in <lb/>
            the commune of Hotol-le-Vatois, and canton of Fauville. In the 13th <lb/>
            century the name was called Warawast, and also Werelwast. The owners <lb/>
            of this fief are often named in the chartulary of St. Wandrille, of which <lb/>
            abbey Werawast and Hoto formed part of the domains. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Eadmeri, Cantuarensis monachi, sancti Anselmi vita, labore et studio <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. IV. The administration of Normandy in the duke’s absence by William Rufus—Death of Odo, bishop of Bayeux—Some ecclesiastical appointments.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ROBERT II., duke of Normandy, who was humourously <lb/>
            surnamed Curthose, demised all his territories for five years <lb/>
            to his brother King William, and received from him ten <lb/>
            thousand marks of silver for the expenses of the pilgrimage <lb/>
            to which he had devoted himself. King William, in the ninth <lb/>
            year of his reign, being loath to exhaust his treasury, seized <lb/>
            the ornaments of the churches, which the pious zeal of <lb/>
            former kings and nobles had enriched with gold and silver <lb/>
            and jewels, and bestowed on holy mother church to the glory <lb/>
            of God, and for a remembrance of themselves. William <lb/>
            crossed over the sea in the month of September, and obtain­ <lb/>
            ing possession of Normandy for the price be paid, trampled <lb/>
            it under foot for nearly five years, that is all the rest of <lb/>
            his life. f Then Odo, bishop of Bayeux, undertook the <lb/>
            pilgrimage with his nephew Duke Robert, for there was so <lb/>
            much ill will between him and the king on account of their <lb/>
            former quarrels, that it could not be appeased by any <lb/>
            mediators. The king was haughty and passionate, and had <lb/>
            a good memory, not easily forgetting, and suffering to pass <lb/>
            unrevenged, any injury he received. The proud prince <lb/>
            therefore bitterly recollected that bishop Odo, his uncle, <lb/>
            had been the first to oppose him in the beginning of <lb/>
            his reign and had excited an extensive revolt of the nobles <lb/>
            against him. ] At -his instigation, Robert, earl of Morton, had <lb/>
            held Pevensey, but afterwards being besieged by the king, <lb/>
            who was his nephew, he made peace with him, and surrender­ <lb/>
            ing the castle, returned to his allegiance. Gilbert Fitz- <lb/>
            Richard, also, with his brother Roger, fortified Tunbridge, <lb/>
            but the king besieged the fortress in Easter week, and it <lb/>
            was given up to him on the first assault. Lastly, the <lb/>
            bishop himself, with Eustace, count of Boulogne, Robert de <lb/>
            Belèsme and a gallant force, held the castle of Rochester, <lb/>
            until, being blockaded by two forts which the king erected, <lb/>
            he was forced to make an ignominious capitulation, and to <lb/>
            depart from the realm of England with the forfeiture of all <lb/>
            his possessions.1 Afterwards in Normandy, when the king <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author has related these occurrences in b. viii. c. ii. See vol. ii. <lb/>
            pp. 433—443. </note> <pb n="206"/>

            sought for revenge and retaliated on his brother the unjust <lb/>
            and fruitless attack he had received from him, triumphantly <lb/>
            getting possession of great part of the duchy, through the <lb/>
            fear or the covetousness which attached the barons to his <lb/>
            cause, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, opposed him for a long time, <lb/>
            and did not withhold his succour from the duke, until he was <lb/>
            wanting to himself. In consequence, when the bishop found <lb/>
            that King William was master, as we have before related, he <lb/>
            preferred rather to undertake the pilgrimage than to submit <lb/>
            to his enemy. The bishop and the duke had a conference <lb/>
            at Rome with Pope Urban, and having received his benedic­ <lb/>
            tion, crossed the Tiber, and wintered in Apulia.</p>
          <p>fFrom thence the bishop retired to the city of Panormo, <lb/>
            commonly called Palermo, where he died in the month of <lb/>
            February. and was buried in the church of St. Mary, mother <lb/>
            of God, by Gilbert, bishop of Evreux. Odo was early <lb/>
            promoted, becoming when young governor of the church <lb/>
            which he ruled for nearly fifty years. He added to the <lb/>
            honours and ornaments of his cathedral, respected the clergy, <lb/>
            and depriving numbers of their property was liberal of what <lb/>
            he took from others.1 As soon as King William heard of <lb/>
            his death, he gave the bishopric to Thorold, son of Hugh de <lb/>
            Envermou, who resigned it seven years afterwards for some <lb/>
            secret motives, and submitted himself to the monastic rule <lb/>
            under Abbot William at Bee, where he served God a long <lb/>
            time in the regular discipline to the end of his days.2 He <lb/>
            was succeeded in the see of Bayeux by Richard, son of <lb/>
            Sampson, who filled it twenty-six years.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 See vol. ii. pp. 428—431. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Thorold d'Envermeu, brother of Hugh d'Envermeu, who granted the <lb/>

            resign his bishopric at the end of seven years, but even presented canonical <lb/>
            obstacles to his taking possession, which he does not appear to have done. <lb/>
            Still he was a worthy person, honoured with the friendship and correspond­ <lb/>

          <p>King William thus possessed Normandy, having secured <lb/>
            to himself the territories of his father, which his brother <lb/>
            had foolishly alienated. He committed the churches which <lb/>
            were deprived of their pastors by death to rulers chosen <lb/>
            according to his own will; for the abbeys of Jumièges and <lb/>
            Dives were both vacant. Gontard, the famous abbot of <lb/>
            Jumièges, died at Clermont on the sixth of the calends of <lb/>
            December [26th November], while the celebrated council <lb/>
            was held there. The king appointed in his place Tancard, <lb/>
            provost of Fécamp, who, some years afterwards, retired with <lb/>
            infamy in consequence of a disgraceful quarrel between him <lb/>
            and the monks. He was succeeded by Ursus of Rouen, <lb/>
            who had been a monk of the same house from his childhood, <lb/>
            and was abbot for twenty years.1 Meanwhile Fulk, a monk <lb/>
            of St. Evroult and abbot of Dives, went to Pope Urban, and <lb/>
            became an exile at Monte Cassino. His successor Bene­ <lb/>
            dict, who had been a monk of St. Ouen, archbishop of <lb/>
            Rouen, having died, King William appointed Etard, who <lb/>
            had been gardener at Jumièges, and a monk there from <lb/>
            childhood, abbot of Dives, and he diligently fed the flock of <lb/>
            Christ for several years. But when Fulk returned, under <lb/>
            the pope's protection, he willingly resigned the government <lb/>
            of the abbey, and, returning to the place where he made his <lb/>
            first profession, spent the rest of his life there, until he died <lb/>
            in extreme decrepitude. Fulk, who had rigorously governed <lb/>
            the abbey of Dives for twenty years before he was deposed, <lb/>
            and by his ability much increased the number of the <lb/>
            monks, and been serviceable to the church in a variety of <lb/>
            ways, having been unjustly accused and deposed by the <lb/>
            instigation of the devil, was exiled for seven years.2 On his <lb/>
            return, resuming the government of his abbey, he conducted <lb/>
            it prosperously for a further period of seven years, and died <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. V. William Rufus asserts pretensions to the French Vexin—Builds the fortress of Gisors—Makes an irruption into France as far as Pontoise.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1097, the fifth indiction, William <lb/>
            Rufus, having considered his father's acts and the causes of <lb/>
            his wars, claimed of Philip, king of France, all the country <lb/>
            of the Vexin, demanding possession of the noble castles of <lb/>
            Pontoise, Chaumont, and Mantes. The French were so far <lb/>
            from acceding to these demands, that they burnt with <lb/>
            ardour to resist the invader, so that bloody hostilities broke <lb/>
            out between the two fierce nations, which involved numbers <lb/>
            in sad destruction. The whole burden of the war fell on <lb/>
            the French nation, for their king, Philip, was fat and lazy, <lb/>
            and altogether unfit for military service, while his son <lb/>
            Lewis was as yet unqualified for it in consequence of his <lb/>
            tender years.1 Whereas the sovereign of England was <lb/>
            devoted to arms, making distinguished warriors his prin­ <lb/>
            cipal friends, and surrounding himself with chosen bands <lb/>
            of gallant knights. At the head of such troops, if Caius <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar himself, with his Italian legions, had attacked <lb/>
            him and attempted to do him any injustice, William Rufus <lb/>
            would doubtless have dared to try the courage and daring <lb/>
            of his troops in close combat with the Roman. Robert do <lb/>
            Belèsme was appointed commander of the king's forces, <lb/>
            enjoying the royal favour in an especial manner, and being <lb/>
            eminent for his abilities. The illustrious count Henry, the <lb/>
            king's brother, Hugh earl of Chester,2 and Walter Griffard, <lb/>
            earl of Buckingham,3 with several other counts, captains, <lb/>
            and officers, led the troops of the king of England, and as <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's account must not be taken literally. Doubtless, Louis- <lb/>

            or twenty years of age, and commanded a French army, it is not correct <lb/>
            to describe him as too young to bear arms. It will be seen presently that <lb/>
            notwithstanding the incontestable superiority of the king of England in <lb/>

          <p>Most of the French, called on to obey two lords for the <lb/>
            rich fiefs which they held under both kings, and being in <lb/>
            great trouble because no man can serve two masters, chose <lb/>
            the more enterprising and wealthy of the kings, and placed <lb/>
            their vassals and castles at his disposition. Thus Robert, <lb/>
            count of Mellent, received English garrisons into his for­ <lb/>
            tresses, and giving them ready access into the French <lb/>
            territory, their irruptions caused great losses to that nation. <lb/>
            Guy de-la-Roche-Guion1 also favoured the English for their <lb/>
            money, and put into their hands his castles of Roche-Guion <lb/>
            and Veteuil. Several others did the same, deserting their <lb/>
            countrymen to act with zeal in the cause of strangers. <lb/>
            Then King William caused a very strong fortress to be <lb/>
            constructed at Gisors, which serves to this day as a bulwark <lb/>
            to Normandy against Chaumont, Trie, and Bouri.2 Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme selected the site, and directed the works like a <lb/>
            skilful engineer. One day, when the Normans had attacked <lb/>

            inspired the French, who were not wealthy, with ardour for <lb/>

            and Peter, sons of Herbert de Serrans,5 were at the head of <lb/>
            the troops of the Vexin, and sometimes had sharp engage­ <lb/>

            number of excellent soldiers, distinguished for their intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and valour. They would not suffer the glory of the <lb/>
            French name to be lost, and resisted the enemy to the death <lb/>
            in defence of their country and national honour. In <lb/>
            consequence the flower of the French chivalry flocked to <lb/>
            their standard from all parts of the country, and won rich <lb/>
            spoils in frequent encounters with the enemy.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, when the followers of the English king <lb/>
            were ravaging the neighbourhood of Chaumont, and the <lb/>
            daring enterprise of the knights was exhibited on both <lb/>
            sides, the French made prisoners of Gilbert de Laigle, <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 109S, the sixth indiction, in the <lb/>
            month of September, King William collected a large army, <lb/>
            and on his march into France rested at Conches on the fifth <lb/>
            of the calends of October [27th September]. The same <lb/>
            night a fearful prodigy was exhibited to the world, the whole <lb/>
            sky being on fire and appearing red as blood to the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants of the west. At that time, as we afterwards heard, the <lb/>
            crusaders fought a battle with the infidels in the east, and <lb/>
            by God's help gained the victory.2 King William carried his <lb/>
            irruption into France as far as Pontoise, devastating a noble <lb/>
            province abounding in wealth of all kinds, with fire and <lb/>
            pillage, and capture of the inhabitants. He likewise invested <lb/>
            Chaumont with powerful boides of troops, and ordered it to <lb/>
            be desperately assaulted by his well-armed soldiers. The <lb/>
            gallant defenders of the place bravely defended their fortifica­ <lb/>
            tions, without however forgetting what was due to the fear <lb/>
            of God and the claims of humanity. For they mercifully <lb/>
            spared the persons of the assailants while they vented their <lb/>
            rage on the valuable chargers of their enemies ; in this way <lb/>
            more than seven hundred horses of great price fell by their <lb/>
            arrows and missiles, so that the French dogs and birds of <lb/>
            prey gorged themselves with the carrion. Many followed <note type="footnote"> 1 Paganus de Montjai, near Villevaude (Seine and Marne). He will <lb/>
            appear again at the battle of Bremule and on other occasions. </note><note type="footnote"> The list of prisoners taken on either side is very different in the narrative of <lb/>
            Suger. According to that historian, Louis-le-Gros took Count Simon, Gilbert <lb/>
            de Laigle, a nobleman illustrious both in England and Normandy, and <lb/>
            Paganus de Gisors, the founder of the castle of that name. The prisoners <lb/>
            of William Rufus were, Matthew count de Beaumont, Simon de Montfort, <lb/>
            and Paganus de Montjai.. </note><note type="footnote"> It is most probable that the count Simon, made prisoner by the French, <lb/>
            was Simon de Senlis, who was earl of Huntingdon in right of his wife <lb/>
            Matilda. </note><note type="footnote"> The captivity had very different results for the warriors of the two <lb/>
            armies. The wealthy king of England ransomed his partisans without loss <lb/>
            of time, but the finances of Louis-le-Gros did not allow of his doing the <lb/>
            same. In consequence, the French were kept prisoners a long time and <lb/>
            escaped from it on condition of swearing fealty to the king of England and <lb/>

            predatory excursions of the king's troops, whose numbers <lb/>
            were great, nor risk a regular engagement, without a king <lb/>
            or general, against a powerful monarch at the head of a <lb/>
            large army, they defended their fortresses with great <lb/>
            obstinacy, and, putting their trust in the goodness of God, <lb/>
            waited for better times. Meanwhile, King William, accom­ <lb/>
            panied by William count of Poitou,1 led a large army, under <lb/>
            the command of the young Amauri,2 and Nivard de Septeuil,3 <lb/>
            against Montfort and Epernon, ravaging all the surrounding <lb/>
            country. However, Simon-the-Young,4 by God's help, saved <lb/>
            his castles from injury. Simon-the-Elder defended Neaufle,5 <lb/>
            and Peter, with his sons Arnold and Theobald stoutly main­ <lb/>
            tained themselves at Maule,6 as did also other lords of castles <lb/>
            whose naipes I cannot furnish individually. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            King William being recalled to England by affairs in his <lb/>
            kingdom, a truce was concluded on both sides, and the <lb/>

            king, but as that prince did not perform the engagements he <lb/>
            had entered into, the king of Norway was so much incensed <lb/>
            that he sent her back to her father.1 This led to hostilities <lb/>
            between them. In consequence, in the fifth year of the <lb/>
            reign of William Rufus, king of England, Magnus assembling <lb/>
            his forces from all quarters, and favoured by an east-wind <lb/>

            in the historical details, errors such as it has often been our task to point <lb/>
            out, it is a more pleasing task to call attention to our author's unwearied <lb/>
            industry and general merits. It is indeed surprising that a monk buried <lb/>
            in the depths of the forests, in a remote district of Normandy, who once <lb/>
            only in his life quitted his retirement for a visit of a few weeks to England, <lb/>
            should at such a period, when books were scarce and communications <lb/>
            difficult, have amassed such stores of varied and, for the most part, <lb/>

            Norwegian king's marauding expedition to the Hebrides in the year <lb/>

            and all the islands on the west coast, from Lewis to the Isle of Man, <lb/>
            which they called by one name Sudeyjar, or " the southern islands," from <lb/>

            under his dominion, penetrated as far as the isle of Anglesey. <lb/>
            He proposed to make a descent on Ireland, but finding that <lb/>
            the Irish were assembled on the coast to oppose his landing, <lb/>
            he altered his course. Sailing to the isle of Man, which was <lb/>
            uninhabited,1 he settled a colony on it, caused houses to be <lb/>
            built for them, and supplied them carefully with all neces­ <lb/>
            saries for their subsistence. He also visited other islands <lb/>
            in the vast Archipelago situated I may say, beyond the <lb/>
            circuit of the globe, causing them to be inhabited by his <lb/>
            . royal authority; and thus employed himself for several <lb/>
            years in extending his dominions and increasing the <lb/>
            population.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, the commander of king Magnus's2 forces <note type="footnote">he advanced in his foray to Man, which he plundered. 3. In 1098—1099, <lb/>
            the Norwegian king prolonged his expedition to the isle of Anglesey, <lb/>
            which he reduced, it being a point further south than any of his <lb/>
            predecessors had extended their rule. During this expedition, which also <lb/>
            embraced Ireland, his son Sigurd, then only nine years of age, was <lb/>
            betrothed to Biadmyrea, daughter of Moriartak, king of Connaught, and <lb/>
            Magnus created Sigurd king of the Orkneys and Hebrides. 4. In 1102 <lb/>
            king Magnus fitted out a great armament, and, after visiting his insular <lb/>
            dominions, landed at Dublin, and conquering great part of Ulster, uniting <lb/>
            his forces with his ally Moriartak, spent the winter with him in Connaught. <lb/>
            In the spring of 1103 he was on the point of reimbarking for Norway <lb/>
            when he was slain in a skirmish with the Irish, described in a most spirited <lb/>
            manner in his Saga in the Heimskringla from which these notices are <lb/>
            taken. After this disaster his soil Sigurd, “leaving the Irish king's <lb/>
            daughter behind," lost no time in returning to his own country. </note><note type="footnote"> Our author has not only made Magnus himself the party in this abortive <lb/>

            north of England, on seeing strange ships, with fierce crews <lb/>
            draw near the land, raised shouts of alarm and collected bands <lb/>
            of armed men from all quarters of the province of Mercia. <lb/>
            There were then violent hostilities between the English and <lb/>
            Welsh, for which reason the loud outcries called the people <lb/>
            to arms.</p>
          <p>Two earls who had the chief authority in Mercia, both of <lb/>
            whom had the name of Hugh,2 despatched messengers in <lb/>

            without a moment's delay and defend the country against the <lb/>

            out of the counties of Chester and Shrewsbury, and stationed <lb/>
            at Diganoth3 near the sea ready for battle. Hugh de <lb/>
            Montgomery being the first who arrived at the head of his <lb/>
            vassals with great despatch, took up his quarters there for <lb/>
            several days, while waiting for the auxiliaries from the <lb/>

            arrow hit the earl's eye, and went through his head, and that was found to <lb/>

            brother of Gervase, archbishop of Rheims.5 He had six <lb/>
            brothers, the two eldest of whom, Goisbert and Enoch <lb/>
            quitted the army to become monks. The other four Geoffrey, <lb/>
            Lanceline, Milo and William6 were cut off prematurely. <lb/>
            Elias held the castle of Flèche by inheritance from his father, <lb/>
            and obtained four castles in right of his wife, namely, <note type="footnote"> Robert, the younger son, a person of no merit, succeeded to his mother's <lb/>
            property instead of William the elder. We have had an instance of such <lb/>
            succession in Robert de Belèsme, inheriting the Talvas domains of his <lb/>
            mother Mabel, and it is not uncommon in great English families. After <lb/>
            Ordericus has told us that Simon and Hugh, cousins of the two brothers, <lb/>
            died in their infancy, we find that Simon succeeded Robert at the age of <lb/>
            fifteen years. </note><note type="footnote"> I Geoffrey de Gacé ; perhaps a son or relation of Ralph-Téte-d'Ane. <lb/>

            him a daughter named Eremburga, who, when she became <lb/>
            marriageable, was espoused to Fulk, then Count of Anjou, <lb/>
            and who is now king of Jerusalem, and gave birth to an <lb/>
            illustrious progeny, Geoffrey and Elias, Matilda and Sybilla; <lb/>
            the daughters marrying the sons of kings, but by God's <lb/>
            providence which disposes all things well, they soon became <lb/>
            widows.1</p>
          <p>At the time when Duke Robert pledged Normandy to his <lb/>
            brother, receiving from him a large sum of money for the <lb/>
            expenses of his pilgrimage to the King of kings, Count Elias <lb/>
            came to the court of William Rufus at Rouen. Having had <lb/>
            a long conference with the duke, he presented himself to the <lb/>
            king, and thus humbly addressed him: “My lord the king, <lb/>
            by the pope's advice I have taken the cross in his service, and <lb/>
            devoted myself to my Lord God for the expedition to <lb/>
            Jerusalem with many noble pilgrims. I demand your friend­ <lb/>
            ship as a faithful ally, and desire to undertake this journey <lb/>
            at peace with you." The king replied to him: " Go where <lb/>
            you please, but yield up to me the city of Mans with the <lb/>
            whole county, for I wish to possess all that my father held." <lb/>
            Elias answered: " I hold the county by inheritance from my <lb/>
            fathers, and by God's help, I will bequeath it to my children as <lb/>
            free as I now possess it. If you choose to challenge my right, <lb/>
            I am ready to submit to a legal judgment, and will hold or <lb/>
            lose my inheritance according to the decision of kings, counts, <lb/>
            and bishops.” The king rejoined: " My pleadings with you <lb/>
            shall be with swords and spears and showers of arrows." <lb/>
            Elias then said: "It was my desire to fight against the pagans <note type="footnote"> 1 Eremburge, countess of Maine, married in 1100 Fulk V., count of <lb/>

            in the Lord's name, but it appears that I must have a con­ <lb/>
            flict nearer home with the enemies of Christ. For every <lb/>
            one who resists the right and does injustice, proves himself <lb/>
            to be the enemy of God, who is truth itself and the sun of <lb/>
            justice. He has thought fit to invest me with the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Maine, and I ought not lightly to relinquish it, lest <lb/>
            through my folly God's people should be abandoned to <lb/>
            robbers, like sheep who having no shepherd become the <lb/>
            prey of wolves. Listen then, all you lords who are present, <lb/>
            while I make known the resolution with which Heaven <lb/>
            inspires me. I will not relinquish our Saviour's cross which <lb/>
            I have adopted after the manner of the pilgrims, but will <lb/>
            place it on my shield, my helmet, and all my other arms, and <lb/>
            cause the holy sign to be fixed on my saddle and bridle. <lb/>
            Under the protection of this divine symbol I will encounter <lb/>
            the enemies of peace and justice, and will defend, sword in <lb/>
            hand, the country of Christians. My horse and my arms <lb/>
            shall be distinguished by the holy sign, so that those who <lb/>
            fight with me will combat a soldier of Christ. I trust in <lb/>
            Him who governs the world, and knows the secrets of my <lb/>
            heart, and through his mercy I shall find a favourable oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity for fulfiling my vow." King William made this <lb/>
            reply: " Go where you will, and do what you like; I am not <lb/>
            willing to make war against those who have taken the cross, <lb/>
            but I will not give up a city which my father held to the day <lb/>
            of his death. Lose no time therefore in repairing your <lb/>
            dilapidated fortifications, hire masons and stone-cutters, who <lb/>
            work for money, and with all speed restore the old breaches <lb/>
            in your neglected walls. I will visit as soon as possible the <lb/>
            citizens of Mans, appearing before the gates with a hundred <lb/>
            thousand lances, under my standards; for I will not leave <lb/>
            you in quiet possession of my heritage without laying claim <lb/>
            to it. I will cause waggons drawn by oxen to convey there <lb/>
            loads of arrows and bolts, but I will come myself to your <lb/>
            gates with numerous troops of men at arms before the <lb/>
            drivers can accomplish the journey with their utmost speed. <lb/>
            Believe that I speak the truth, and let it be known to those <lb/>
            who are in league with you."</p>
          <p>After this conversation, the count retired and put his <lb/>
            territories in a state of defence. The great nobles who had <lb/>
            listened to the altercations of the warlike princes did not <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1098.] </note> <lb/>
            venture to interfere, fearing the haughty king to whom they <lb/>
            owed fealty, while they were sorry for the gallant count who <lb/>
            defended his cause with firmness. Elias was brave and honour­ <lb/>
            able, and dear to all for his many virtues. He was distinguished <lb/>
            also for his personal qualities, being strong and of large <lb/>
            stature, tall and graceful, with black curling hair, and well <lb/>
            shaved like a priest.. He was agreeable and eloquent in his <lb/>
            discourse, gentle to the peaceable and rough to the turbulent, <lb/>
            a strict observer of justice, and zealous of good works in the <lb/>
            fear of the Lord. His cheeks often moistened with tears <lb/>
            showed how great was the fervour of his devotions and <lb/>
            prayers. He employed himself diligently in defending the <lb/>
            churches, in giving alms to the poor and in fasting, for he <lb/>
            made every Friday a day of abstinence from meat and drink <lb/>
            in reverence to the passion of our Lord.</p>
          <p>Moreover, King William was occupied with many cares <lb/>
            relating to the French, Bretons, and Flemings, so that he <lb/>
            put off the performance of his threats for two years,2 and. <lb/>
            forgot the Manceaux. Meanwhile, Elias fortified the castle <lb/>
            of Dangeul3 against Robert Talvas, and placed his retainers <lb/>
            in it to defend the inhabitants of his territories. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, that tyrant was grieved because he could not <lb/>
            ravage the lands in his neighbourhood as he pleased. He <lb/>
            therefore unseasonably disturbed the king in the month of <lb/>
            January, and inflaming his anger by the violence of his <lb/>
            language, induced him to march at the head of his army <lb/>
            against the castle of Dangeul in the month of February. He <lb/>
            had said to the king : “The enemy's garrison, abandoned to <lb/>
            security, are dispersed in all quarters, trusting to the winter <lb/>
            rains and storms, and believing you and your troops to be <lb/>
            entangled in other military operations. If we make a sudden <lb/>
            attack we shall find the garrison and the inhabitants <lb/>
            unprepared, and the fortress will prove an easy conquest. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is not the first time that our author has given expression to the <lb/>

            The king engaged in the enterprise, although for many <lb/>
            reasons he was very unwilling; but as Robert urged him and <lb/>
            made great promises of success, he did not like to defer it <lb/>
            lest he should be accused of want of courage. Reports <lb/>
            of the king's march preceded him, and by the orders of the <lb/>
            count of Maine the country people were summoned to arms <lb/>
            and posted at the passages of the rivers, along dikes, and at <lb/>
            the difficult entrances of the woods, for defence against the <lb/>
            enemy. The king was thus prevented from obtaining success, <lb/>
            but his fury was roused to the highest pitch andhe commanded <lb/>
            Robert to assemble great bodies of troops in his garrison, <lb/>
            and supplied him with large sums of money, to enable him <lb/>
            to fortify his castles with trenches and walls and various <lb/>
            kinds of buildings, and to bestow large donations on his <lb/>
            mercenary soldiers. The Count de Belèsme therefore, who <lb/>
            was a skilful engineer, lost no time in erecting new fortresses, <lb/>
            and adding deep ditches to the defences of the old ones. <lb/>
            He possessed nine castles in that county, viz. Bleve, Per­ <lb/>
            rie, le Monte-de-la-Nue, Saône, St. Remi-du-Plain, Lurson, <lb/>
            Allières, la Motte-de-Gualtier-le-Clinchamp, Mamers,1 and <lb/>
            several other fortified houses. In this manner the cunning <lb/>
            manœuvrer prepared castles for himself at the king's expense, <lb/>
            placing in them ferocious garrisons, fatal to the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, by whose means he satisfied his pride and carried on <lb/>
            an atrocious war against the people of Mans. In the season <lb/>
            of Lent, when sinners, inspired with divine compunction, <lb/>
            relinquish their sins, and have recourse to penance as a <lb/>
            remedy for their past offences, more than three hundred <lb/>
            prisoners perished in the dungeons of Robert. They had <lb/>
            made great offers for their ransom, but they were cruelly <lb/>
            refused by him, and his captives perished by hunger and cold <lb/>
            and other tortures.</p>
          <p>At this time Hoel, by birth a Breton and bishop of Mans, <lb/>
            died after a venerable life.2 Count Elias nominated Geoffrey, <note type="footnote"> 1 Blèves, three leagues from Perai three leagues and a half from Mont <lb/>

            a Breton, and dean of the same church, to the vacant <lb/>
            bishopric,1 but the clergy had already compelled Hildebert <lb/>
            de Lavaric2 to seat himself on the episcopal throne, and <lb/>
            sang triumphantly, with a loud voice, Te Deum laudamus, and <lb/>
            the rest of the service prescribed by the church at the <lb/>
            election of bishops. Elias, finding this, was greatly <lb/>
            incensed and offered resistance, but the clergy saying <lb/>
            to him, " You ought not to prefer your choice to <lb/>
            that of the church," he was silent through respect, because <lb/>
            he feared God ; and in order not to introduce a mortal <lb/>
            schism among the members of the church, he approved the <lb/>
            choice of the canons.3 Geoffrey, feeling sure of his <lb/>
            election to the bishopric, had prepared a sumptuous banquet <lb/>
            for the day of his elevation, and the prepared meats were <lb/>
            not the less devoured by his greedy followers. However <lb/>
            the people of Mans would not hear of him as their bishop. <lb/>
            He was brother of Judicail, bishop of Aleth, and after <lb/>
            the death of William was seventeen years archbishop of <lb/>
            Rouen.</p>
          <p>Hildebert was chosen by the clergy and people archbishop <lb/>
            of Tours after the death of Gilbert, being thus translated <lb/>
            by God's providence from the bishopric of Mans to the <lb/>
            metropolitan see.' This prelate was mild, pious, and <lb/>
            devoted to the study both of sacred and secular literature.5 <lb/>
            He was by far the best poet of our age, and composed a <lb/>
            number of verses equal or superior to those of the ancients. <lb/>

            and diligently studies them as more valuable than gold and <lb/>
            topazes. He has written with elegance and wisdom <lb/>
            concerning Christ and the church, the body and the soul, <lb/>
            the acts of the saints and their miracles, and in praise of <lb/>
            virtue and contempt of vice. The cardinals who frequently <lb/>
            visit France, because they find the people civilized and <lb/>
            obedient to their teaching, have carried back with them to <lb/>
            Rome several of Hildebert's poems, thinking them worthy <lb/>
            of admiration among the Roman schools and professors of <lb/>
            eloquence. This reverend lord exercised the episcopal <lb/>
            functions for nearly thirty-five years,1 and was particularly <lb/>
            devoted to useful pursuits both in practice and teaching. <lb/>
            He worthily ornamented in a variety of ways the church of <lb/>
            St. Gervase, where the body of Julian, the illustrious <lb/>
            confessor of Christ reposes, and afterwards consecrated it <lb/>
            in the time of Grumar the Breton, his successor, who is <lb/>
            known also by his other name of Guy d'Etampes.2 But, for <lb/>
            their sins, what good men had exerted themselves to <lb/>
            embellish so richly, and to furnish with various ornaments <lb/>
            to the honour of God, became eight years after its <lb/>
            dedication a prey to the flames, which destroyed great part <lb/>
            of the city and polluted and ruined the church in a horrible <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1098, the sixth indiction, Count <lb/>
            Elias undertook an expedition against Robert in the week <lb/>
            preceding the Rogations,3 and having completed it ordered <lb/>
            his followers to retire homewards after the nones. On their <lb/>
            return, the count leaving his troops turned aside near Dan­ <lb/>
            geul, attended by only seven horsemen and perceiving some <lb/>
            men lurking among the thick trees and bushes, immediately <lb/>
            charged them with his slender company. Robert himself <lb/>
            was lying there in ambush, and, seeing the small band <lb/>
            incautiously galloping on, that experienced and wary soldier <lb/>

            made prisoners of the count, and Hervé de Montfort,' his <lb/>
            standard bearer, with nearly all the rest. The troops in <lb/>
            advance, after reaching Ballon2 in high spirits, learned from <lb/>
            those who escaped that the count was taken, and after <lb/>
            their empty triumph were plunged into the deepest distress. <lb/>
            Robert conducted Elias to Rouen, and presented him to the <lb/>
            king, who committed him to honourable custody, for <lb/>
            William was not cruel to the knights, but treated them <lb/>
            with kindness and generosity, good humour and courtesy.</p>
          <p>Favoured by the smiles of fortune, King William in great <lb/>
            exultation summoned an assembly of all the barons of <lb/>
            Normandy and thus addressed them: " Hitherto I have been <lb/>
            very negligent in recovering my father's inheritance, because <lb/>
            I was loth that lives should be lost and the people harassed, <lb/>
            through my ambition to increase my territories. But now, <lb/>
            as you see, my enemy has been taken prisoner without my <lb/>
            knowledge, and by God's will, who knoweth the justice of <lb/>
            my cause, is delivered to me. What course do you approve? <lb/>
            What do you advise me to do now? Consult on what is to <lb/>
            be done, and inform me what you consider best." The <lb/>
            barons, having taken counsel, replied: "Our lord the king, <lb/>
            we resolve unanimously that the whole army of Normandy <lb/>
            be assembled at your summons, and we all will march with <lb/>
            it boldly and cheerfully to reduce the province of Maine."</p>
          <p>The king was much pleased at hearing this, and heralds <lb/>
            were despatched with haste far and wide through all <lb/>
            quarters to proclaim his will, that all his subjects, allies, and <lb/>
            friends should come loyally to his aid. In consequence, <lb/>
            French and Burgundians, Flemings and Bretons, and other <lb/>
            neighbouring nations, flocked to the standard of the liberal <lb/>
            master and greatly augmented his forces. In the month of <lb/>
            June King William marched his army by Alençon, and <lb/>
            entered the enemy's country at the head of a large body of <lb/>
            troops. By his command the cavalry suddenly appeared <lb/>
            before Frênai,3 where they skirmished for a time with the <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably Montfort-le-Rotrou, near Conneré, now the chief town of a <lb/>
            canton. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ballon is also the chief place of the canton of that name. The <lb/>

            while Ralph viscount de Beaumont,1 hastened to the king <lb/>
            and humbly proposed a truce which he was anxious to make <lb/>
            for the term he mentioned. " I ask a truce of your highness, <lb/>
            my lord the king, until such time as you shall return safe <lb/>
            from Maine. For the bishop and council are sitting there, <lb/>
            and daily occupied in deliberations for the common good of <lb/>
            the state. We will readily concur in whatever shall be <lb/>
            there agreed between you, and obey your orders in all things. <lb/>
            I refer this, my lord the king, to the decision of my elders, <lb/>
            because if I were the first to yield without a struggle, and <lb/>
            deserting my peers should make a separate peace, I should <lb/>
            doubtless bring shame and dishonour on my whole race. <lb/>
            The members ought to follow and not take the lead of the <lb/>
            head; good and loyal vassals seek rather to obey their lord <lb/>
            than to command him." The king approved Ralph's pro­ <lb/>
            posal and discourse, and granted his demand.</p>
          <p>Likewise, Geoffrey of Maine,2 Rotrou de Montfort,3 and <lb/>
            several others, through whose territories he had to pass, did <lb/>
            the same, and by their humble entreaties obtained a safeguard <lb/>
            from him until his return.</p>
          <p>Gilo de Sully,4 a knight of one of the oldest and noblest <lb/>
            families of France, and belonging to the household5 of, <lb/>

            assemblies of people, now surveyed the troops in arms all <lb/>
            around as he stood on the summit of a lofty hill, and com­ <lb/>
            puted them at fifty thousand men, declaring that he had <lb/>
            never seen such an army collected on this side the Alps.</p>
          <p>The king's first halt in the enemy's country was at <lb/>
            Roussei-Fontaine ;6 the next day he encamped at Mont­ <lb/>

            reached Coulans, and commanded the tents to be pitched on <lb/>
            the meadows of the Sarthe. The cross-bowmen and archers <lb/>
            were posted in the vineyards on the sides of the road, with <lb/>
            orders to keep a sharp look out against the enemy, and to put <lb/>
            them in disorder with showers of missiles if they attempted <lb/>
            to pass.1</p>
          <p>Fulk, surnamed Rechin, count of Anjou, hearing that Elias <lb/>
            was a prisoner, immediately went to Mans of which he was the <lb/>
            suzerain lord, and being well received by the inhabitants he <lb/>
            reinforced the defences with soldiers and slingers. On the <lb/>
            king's approach to the city, the knights sallied forth to meet <lb/>
            him, and maintained an obstinate engagement with the <lb/>
            Normans the whole day, many feats of arms being performed <lb/>
            on both sides. For then renowned champions rejoiced in <lb/>
            the opportunity of exhibiting their valour, and meriting <lb/>
            the praises of their bloody conflicts from their chiefs and <lb/>
            comrades.</p>
          <p>Paganus de Montdoubleaux,2 an old friend of the Normans, <lb/>
            renewed his alliance with the king, and gave up to him a <lb/>
            very strong fortress which he had at Ballon, by means of <lb/>
            which the whole place was kept in subjection. The king <lb/>
            appointed there Robert de Belèsme commander of the troops <lb/>
            and joined with him more than three hundred knights well <lb/>
            armed and of approved courage. He treated the inhabitants <lb/>
            who resisted with the greatest severity, subjecting them to <lb/>
            the most serious losses, employing a great number of his <lb/>
            troops in rooting up their vines, and destroying their corn <note type="footnote"> 1 Coulans, on the left bank of the Sarthe, about three leagues from <lb/>

            rivulets about which Wace tells a story as gross as it is improbable. <lb/>
            According to that author, the king of England made a long detour to the <lb/>
            east, on the territory of Sargi, to avoid these two insignificant streams, <lb/>
            solely on account of the obscenity of their names. To any one who is <lb/>

            and laying waste the province all around. But he was <lb/>
            unable to continue the siege for any length of time, so great <lb/>
            was the scarcity of food felt both by men and horses, because it <lb/>
            was the season between the old and new crops.1 A quartern <lb/>
            of oats, without which grain it is difficult to maintain the <lb/>
            strength of horses in the western provinces, was sold for ten­ <lb/>
            pence of the money of Maine. In consequence the king drew <lb/>
            off his troops, ordering them to go and gather the corn into <lb/>
            their barns, and when the harvest was over to be ready to <lb/>
            besiege the enemy's castles.</p>
          <p>William Rufus returning to Normandy with his powerful <lb/>
            force, Count Fulk laid siege to Ballon, and attempted for <lb/>
            some days to reduce the garrison with the united troops of <lb/>
            Anjou and Maine. The garrison, however, reported their <lb/>
            danger to the king, and the tidings getting abroad, some <lb/>
            gallant knights hastened to the succour of their besieged <lb/>
            comrades. Meanwhile, when the count and his troops were <lb/>
            at dinner in their tents, and the mendicants from the town <lb/>
            returned to the garrison with the alms they had received, <lb/>
            informing them that the besiegers were then taking their <lb/>
            meal, it being about tierce,2 several bodies of troops sallied <lb/>
            forth in good order, and falling unexpectedly on the enemy <lb/>
            while they were eating unarmed, took several prisoners and <lb/>
            put all the rest to flight. Walter of Mount Sorely Goffrey <lb/>

            nearly one hundred and forty knights and men-at-arms, with <lb/>
            a great number of foot-soldiers were made prisoners, and the <lb/>
            conquerors carried off much booty from the enemy, consisting <lb/>
            of arms, vestments, and effects of all descriptions. Among <lb/>
            the prisoners were several noble lords of castles who, possessed <lb/>
            of large domains, held a high rank among the barons of their <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author means to say that it was the season when the corn of the <lb/>

            native country, and had under them by hereditary right <lb/>
            many very valiant knights.</p>
          <p>In the third week of the month of July,1 King William <lb/>
            came to the relief of his garrison, bringing with him a body <lb/>
            of troops formidable to the enemy. On the king's arrival <lb/>
            the people of Ballon admitted him into the castle with great <lb/>
            joy. The prisoners in confinement hearing of it, set up a <lb/>
            loud cry, shouting with one voice: " Noble King William, <lb/>
            give us our liberty." This coming to the king's ear, he <lb/>
            ordered them all to be released from their fetters, and to <lb/>
            have a plentiful repast with his own followers in the court <lb/>
            of the castle, and that after they had eaten they should be <lb/>
            dismissed in freedom on pledging their word. His courtiers <lb/>
            objected that in such a great concourse of people the <lb/>
            prisoners would easily make their escape, but the king <lb/>
            reproved their harshness, and taking the part of the captives <lb/>
            said: " Far be it from me to think that a brave knight will <lb/>
            forfeit his word! If he did so, he would become a contemp­ <lb/>
            tible outlaw all his life."</p>
          <p>Count Fulk had fled from the siege to take refuge in the <lb/>
            city, where he waited the issue of events in a monastery. <lb/>
            The leading men of Anjou now consulted with those of <lb/>
            Maine, and finding themselves inferior to the Normans in <lb/>
            all respects, procured a conference between the king and the <lb/>
            count. The result, by God's help, was the peace which was <lb/>
            required, and the people on both sides for various reasons <lb/>
            made great rejoicings. It was required and granted that <lb/>
            Count Elias and the rest of the prisoners in both armies <lb/>
            should be released, and that all the castles which were held <lb/>
            by King William should submit to his son William Rufus. <lb/>
            The conditions of peace being solemnly confirmed, the king <lb/>
            called Robert,2 son of Hugh do Montfort, the commander of <lb/>
            his troops, and directed him to ascend the tower of Mans <lb/>
            and the other fortifications, placing under his orders seven <lb/>
            hundred chosen men in complete armour with bright helmets <lb/>
            and breastplates. They immediately took possession of all the <lb/>
            defences of the place, the former garrison marching out, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author probably means the week which commenced on the 18th <lb/>
            of July. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Robert de Montfort-sur-Risle, the youngest brother of Hugh, third of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. X. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            planted the royal standard on the principal towers with <lb/>
            great triumph. The next day the king reinforced them with <lb/>
            a thousand of his best troops, and commanding the whole <lb/>
            city, made whatever ordinances he pleased. The King's <lb/>
            Tower, Mount-Barbet, and Little-Mount-Barbet1 were <lb/>
            given up to the king, and justly, because it is known that <lb/>
            they were erected by his father. All the citizens rejoicing <lb/>
            in the restoration of peace congratulated their new prince, <lb/>
            clapping their hands, singing, and making various demon­ <lb/>
            strations of gladness.</p>
          <p>Then Hildebert the bishop, with the clergy and all the <lb/>
            people, made a joyful procession to meet the king and <lb/>
            conducted him, chanting thanksgivings, to the church of St. <lb/>
            Gervase the martyr, where the bodies of the holy bishops <lb/>
            and confessors Thuribius and Victor, and other saints, <lb/>
            reposed</p>
          <p>Elias, released from confinement at Bayeux, came to the <lb/>
            king at Rouen, unwashed and unshorn, and humbly said to <lb/>
            him: "Illustrious king, who reckon such numbers among <lb/>
            your subjects, assist me I pray you in your great goodness. <lb/>
            I have long been called count, having possessed a noble <lb/>
            county by hereditary right, but by change of fortune I am <lb/>
            deprived of my title to the name and possession. Not <lb/>
            therefore beseech you to receive me into your household <lb/>
            with my former rank, and I will do you worthy service. Not <lb/>
            that I demand the city of Mans, or any castles until I <lb/>
            shall have merited them of your mightiness by my loyal <lb/>
            conduct. I only aspire to be reckoned among your servants <lb/>
            and enjoy your royal favour. " The generous king readily <lb/>
            determined to grant this, but Robert, earl of Mellent, was <lb/>
            moved by jealousy to dissuade him from it. The crafty <lb/>
            veteran3 held the first place in the royal counsels and <note type="footnote">1 Mons-Barbatus atque Mons-Barbatulus. There are no remains of <lb/>

            judgments, and he was apprehensive of admitting into the <lb/>
            palace one who might prove his equal or superior. He <lb/>
            therefore said to the king: " The Manceaux are crafty and <lb/>
            faithless, and what they cannot accomplish by their valour <lb/>
            they bring about by deceit and manoeuvring. Your <lb/>
            conquered enemy becomes your suppliant, and seeks <lb/>
            perfidiously to be your intimate friend. Why does he <lb/>
            desire this? That being admitted to your secret counsels, <lb/>
            he may be better able, when a favourable opportunity offers, <lb/>
            to revolt fiercely against you, and to join your enemies with <lb/>
            greater means of injuring you."</p>
          <p>The king's determination was changed by these counsels, <lb/>
            and the brave knight was rejected from admission into the <lb/>
            royal household. From hence great difficulties, with dangers <lb/>
            and losses, were afterwards occasioned to many people. <lb/>
            Elias made another attempt to propitiate the king by gentle <lb/>
            words but in vain. Whereupon he added with firmness, <lb/>
            " If it had pleased you, my lord king, and I had found <lb/>
            favour with you, I would have willingly served you. And <lb/>
            now, I pray you, do not blame me if I try to do something <lb/>
            for myself. I am unable to bear with patience being <lb/>
            deprived of my inheritance, and the denial of justice, <lb/>
            violence prevailing against my rights. Let no one therefore <lb/>
            wonder if I prosecute my claim and use every means in my <lb/>
            power to recover my father's possessions." The king <lb/>
            replied in great wrath : " Go, and undertake what you please <lb/>
            against me. ”1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Although the account of this conversation is shorter and more spirited <lb/>
            than those of Ordericus usually are, we prefer that of William of Malmes­ <lb/>

            king's character. </note><note type="footnote"> " Elias being taken and brought before him, the king said jocularly: ‘I <lb/>
            have you, master.' But he, whose haughty spirit could not brook submis­ <lb/>

            has put me in your power; if I could get away, I know what I would do.' <lb/>
            At this, William, almost beside himself with rage, and seizing Elias, <lb/>
            ‘You!' he exclaimed, ‘you! what would you do P Begone—depart—fly! <lb/>
            I give you leave to do whatever you can; and by the holy image of Lucca <lb/>
            (per vultum de Lucca), if you conquer me, I will ask no return for this <lb/>
            favour.' The common oath of this prince was “par le saint voult (by the <lb/>

            freedom to his own domains amidst the great joy of his <lb/>
            friends. He fortified his five castles,1 with the adjacent <lb/>
            villages, repairing his losses with extreme diligence, and <lb/>
            carefully conducting his own affairs. Remaining quiet <lb/>
            from August to Easter, in the meantime he carefully <lb/>

            the royal authority, and seized without decency whatever <lb/>
            they found in their treasuries. They took into the king's <lb/>
            hands the domains of the monasteries and the revenues of <lb/>
            the bishoprics, and exacted from the abbots or bishops who <lb/>
            still survived enormous sums of money. Thus amassing, <lb/>
            by fair means or foul, an immense amount of contributions, <lb/>
            they remitted it to the king beyond sea, to be employed <lb/>
            on his own occasions whether good or bad. Vast sums <lb/>
            accumulated by these taxes, were presented to the king who <lb/>
            used them ostentatiously to enrich foreigners. But the <lb/>
            native inhabitants, unjustly spoiled of their goods, were in <lb/>
            great distress and cried lamentably to God, who delivered <lb/>
            Israel from the hand of Moab, when Eglon the corpulent <lb/>
            king was slain by Aoth, the left-handed. 1</p>
          <p>Anselm, the holy archbishop was greatly troubled at these <lb/>
            exactions, and used all the means in his power to succour <lb/>
            the oppressed. He endeavoured to stand firmly as a wall of <lb/>
            defence for the house of Israel against the worshippers of <lb/>
            Baal. He therefore sent trusty messengers to the king with <lb/>
            letters, humbly complaining and informing him of the many <lb/>
            afflictions to which the church was exposed. But the foolish <lb/>
            king hardened his heart and refused to listen to his suppliant <lb/>
            teacher, and in consequence Anselm asked for permission to <lb/>
            retire to Rome. The haughty prince allowed him indeed to <lb/>
            go to Rome, but prohibited his passing through Normandy. <lb/>
            Alas! how far was he blinded by his profane pride when, <lb/>
            standing on the brink of a precipice, he forbade the servant <lb/>
            of God, who was flying from his tyranny, to approach his <lb/>
            presence! The king never had another opportunity of seeing <lb/>
            him, as he himself was soon afterwards cut off by a bloody <lb/>
            death. However, the venerable prelate, obeying the com- <note type="footnote"> I Ehud; see Judges iii. 15,—26. The manner in which Ordericus <lb/>

            de Tournai, a monk of Bee, and Eadmer of Canterbury, an <lb/>
            Englishman who afterwards wrote the life of this prelate <lb/>
            with great care, to the edification of souls. Anselm accom­ <lb/>
            plished a toilsome journey as far as the city of Capua, the <lb/>
            metropolis of the rich Campania, where he met Pope Urban, <lb/>
            and, being received with great kindness and respect, made <lb/>
            known to him the reason of his coming. The pope was at <lb/>
            that time very much engaged, having undertaken to restore <lb/>
            peace between the people of Capua, and their prince Richard, <lb/>
            the son of Jordan, against whom they had rebelled. The <lb/>
            young prince, with the aid of his uncle Roger the Elder, <lb/>
            count of Sicily, who was much incensed against the citizens <lb/>
            of Capua, used his utmost efforts to compel them to surrender. <lb/>
            The aged and venerable archbishop was therefore an exile <lb/>
            for nearly two years among the people of Italy where he <lb/>
            was born, and other nations, and preached the word with <lb/>
            eloquence to his foreign auditors to their spiritual profit. <lb/>
            If any one desires to have a fuller account of the acts and <lb/>
            discourses of this prelate, he will find them in the book of the <lb/>

          <p>IN the autumn, King William, having, as has been related, <lb/>
            subjugated Maine, and settled affairs in Normandy according <lb/>

            river Huisne, and challenged the garrison which held the <lb/>
            place for the king, to the combat. The brave Normans <lb/>
            sallied forth and fought for a long time, but the numbers of <lb/>
            the enemy prevailing they were repulsed and driven back <lb/>
            into the city. The enemy entered pell-mell with the king's <lb/>
            troops, as the throng was so violent that the garrison could <lb/>
            not close the gates, but flying through the streets with great <lb/>
            difficulty made their escape into the castle and other <lb/>
            fortifications. For Elias was greatly beloved by the citizens, <lb/>
            and they much preferred his government to that of the <lb/>
            Normans. The garrison however, who had the custody of <lb/>
            the fortifications for the king, were amply supplied with all <lb/>
            necessaries, and therefore prepared to hold out to the last <lb/>
            extremity, loyally fighting in the cause of their lord. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, Elias was received in the city with the acclamations <lb/>
            of the inhabitants, but a sad disaster speedily ensued, to the <lb/>
            public loss. For Walter, son of Ansger, the commander <lb/>
            in the castle, ordered the smiths he employed there to set to <lb/>
            work, and caused the burning cinders to be hurled by his <lb/>
            engineers on the roofs of the houses. " At that time the sun <lb/>
            was blazing in the lofty Gemini, ”2 and the earth was burnt <lb/>
            up with severe drought. The fiery whirlwind caught the <lb/>
            roofs3 of the houses, and the flames burst out with such <lb/>

            made desperate efforts to storm them and take them with <lb/>
            their machines, but could do nothing against impregnable <lb/>
            fortifications.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Robert de Belésme increased the defences of <lb/>
            Ballon, and dispatched his courier Amalgise1 to the king in <lb/>
            England. The messenger having crossed the sea hastened <lb/>
            to Clarendon,2 but met the king riding in the New-Forest <lb/>
            with his attendants, and to his eager inquiries after <lb/>
            the news, replied: " Mans has been treacherously taken by <lb/>
            surprise ; but my lord holds Balan, and the king's garrisons <lb/>
            guard faithfully all the fortresses entrusted to them, but <lb/>
            they urgently demand your royal succour against the hostile <lb/>
            forces which surround and threaten them."</p>
          <p>As soon as the king had heard the message he exclaimed: <lb/>
            " Let us cross the sea to support our friends." The same <lb/>
            instant, without consulting any one, he wheeled his horse <lb/>
            round, and giving him the spur rode full speed to the coast. <lb/>
            Finding there by chance an old worn-out vessel, he embarked <lb/>
            in it without any royal pomp, like one of the people, and <lb/>
            gave orders for immediately putting to sea.3 He waited <lb/>
            neither for a favourable wind, nor attendants, nor anything <lb/>
            else becoming his royal dignity, but, a stranger to fear, com­ <lb/>
            mitted himself to fortune and the waves, and the next <lb/>

            seeing a vessel coming in under sail from England were in <lb/>
            eager expectation to hear if she brought any news. Their <lb/>
            first inquiry regarded the king, and he was there to give a <lb/>
            true account of himself. He laughed heartily as he gave <lb/>
            replies they little expected to their questions, and his answers, <lb/>
            which filled them at first with wonder, soon caused universal <lb/>
            joy. He then mounted a mare belonging to a priest, and sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by a great concourse of the clergy and country folk, <lb/>
            who attended him on foot with loud acclamations, he rode to <lb/>
            Bonneville.1 His presence struck with consternation those <lb/>
            who were in arms against him on the frontiers of Normandy. <lb/>
            After sending out his orders he quickly raised a powerful <lb/>
            army, and proceeded by hasty marches to ravage the hostile <lb/>
            province. The enemy's troops commanded by Elias, as soon <lb/>
            as it was known that the king had passed the straits, dispersed <lb/>
            without loss of time, leaving the city they had occupied in a <lb/>
            condition much worse than they found it. Hildebert, the <lb/>
            bishop, who went to meet the king in Normandy as a sup­ <lb/>
            pliant, was received by him graciously as an old friend, for <lb/>
            neither by his counsels nor active interference had he taken <lb/>
            any part in the late troubles.2</p>
          <p>The king full of wrath, having intelligence of the enemy's <lb/>
            retreat, pursued him closely, without deigning to pass even <lb/>
            a single night at Mans. Passing on, he saw the city in <lb/>
            flames, and ordered his tents to be pitched on a wide heath3 <note type="footnote"> estuary of the Seine, and is in the commune of Trouville. It was probably <lb/>
            the curé of that parish who supplied the palfrey which the king mounted <lb/>

            on the bank of the river Huisne. On the morrow, he took <lb/>
            severe revenge for his wrongs with fire and sword. But before <lb/>
            the king could reach the enemy's strongholds and give them <lb/>
            to the flames, they set them on fire with their own hands, <lb/>
            and laid waste all the country round, lest the freebooters <lb/>
            of the royal party should find any thing to pillage, or even <lb/>
            a house where they might make their beds and take repose. <lb/>
            Thus the castles of Vaux and Oustillil were burnt, and many <lb/>
            other villages and hamlets entirely ruined. However <lb/>
            Robert de Montfort, the commander of the royal army, <lb/>
            pushing forward at the head of five hundred cavalry, extin­ <lb/>
            guished the fire at the castle of Vaux, and strengthened the. <lb/>
            fortifications for the king's service.</p>
          <p>Elias remained at Chateau-du-Loir with a considerable <lb/>
            number of troops, and reserving himself for better times, <lb/>
            waited the course of events. At last, on Friday, the king <lb/>
            sat down before Maiet,2 and ordered his troops to storm the <lb/>
            castle on the following day. But when Saturday came, and <lb/>
            the soldiers were busy in putting on their armour, and pre­ <lb/>
            paring to make a vigorous assault on the garrison, the king, <lb/>
            by the advice of his counsellors and for the glory of God, <lb/>
            spared the enemy out of respect to the day of our Lord'a <lb/>
            burial and resurrection, granting them a truce until Monday. <lb/>
            The besieged took advantage of the interval to strengthen <lb/>
            their defences, and to weaken the force of the bolts and <lb/>
            stones hurled against them with a quantity of wicker baskets. <lb/>
            They were resolute men, faithful to their lord, and deter­ <lb/>
            mined to fight for him to the last extremity, so that their <lb/>
            merit deserves commendation. The assailants had by <lb/>
            excessive toil filled up the ditch surrounding the fortifications <lb/>
            with great heaps of wood, and were openly engaged in <lb/>
            making a road to the foot of the palisades supported by <lb/>
            immense beams, when the garrison threw down vessels full <lb/>
            of burning coals, and set fire to the heaps of combustible <lb/>
            matter which had been collected for their injury, and, assisted <lb/>
            by the summer heat, speedily reduced them to ashes. Both <note type="footnote"> 1 Oustillé or Outilld, a hamlet which has given its name to the commune <lb/>

            sides suffered very much in this assault, which took place on <lb/>
            Monday, so that the king who was witness of it was much <lb/>
            distressed. While he was tormented with rage and vexation <lb/>
            because all his efforts to reduce the place proved fruitless, <lb/>
            one of the garrison hurled a stone at him from the top of a <lb/>
            turret,1 which by God's mercy did not strike the king, but <lb/>
            crushed the head of a soldier who was standing near him, so <lb/>
            that his brains were mingled with his fractured skull. As <lb/>
            he thus miserably perished in the.king's presence, the sounds <lb/>
            of scornful laughter were heard from the garrison, who <lb/>
            raised the loud and horrible cry: " There is fresh meat for <lb/>
            the king; take it to the kitchen to be cooked for his supper." <lb/>
            The king was so much disturbed that he called his principal <lb/>
            nobles aside, and by their advice gave orders for drawing off <lb/>
            toward Lucei,2 at break of day. These prudent counsellors <lb/>
            justly thought that, in so well-fortified a place, a brave <lb/>
            garrison could make a determined resistance, and, defended <lb/>
            by strong walls, had many opportunities of defending them­ <lb/>
            selves against assailants who had no sort of cover. The <lb/>
            wary advisers plainly gave good counsel, believing it to be <lb/>
            best for troops thus exposed in the present case, that the <lb/>
            king should retreat in safety with his forces in good order, <lb/>
            and find other means of punishing his enemies ; thus securing <lb/>
            the safety of his army, and contriving the ruin of his enemy. <lb/>
            They were therefore on the move very early in the morning, <lb/>
            and employed themselves inlaying waste the enemy's country <lb/>
            in every way, rooting up the vines, felling the fruit-trees, <lb/>
            levelling walls and buildings, and ravaging the whole district, <lb/>
            which was very rich, with fire and sword. Then the king <lb/>
            returned in triumph3 to Mans, and gave leave to the troops <lb/>
            of many provinces to return home.</p>

            Jerusalem was captured by the holy pilgrims, they having de­ <lb/>

            of the ides [the 7th] of the same month of July, as I have <lb/>
            related in the last book. Pope Urban also died on the fifth <lb/>
            of the calends of August [the 28th of July], having lived to <lb/>
            hear with triumph that the tomb of Christ was surrendered <lb/>
            to the crusaders. He was succeeded by Pope Paschal, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>GILBERT, bishop of Lisieux, had been often requested by <lb/>
            the monks of St. Evroult to give his benediction to their <lb/>
            abbot, but he always refused unless the abbot signed a pro­ <lb/>
            fession of canonical obedience.2 In consequence, there was <lb/>
            a controversy between them which lasted ten years, neither <lb/>
            the one nor the other being willing to yield, as each hoped <lb/>
            to succeed. Serlo, who was elected abbot on the death of <lb/>
            Mainier, governed the monks for two years without being <lb/>
            consecrated, because he refused to submit to a profession <lb/>
            which was a new custom in the abbey of St. Evroult. In <lb/>
            the same way, Roger du Sap presided over the brethren <lb/>
            more than seven years, but the bishop obstinately persisting <lb/>
            in his views, Roger did not carry the pastoral staff. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the monks resorted to the royal authority, which <lb/>
            secured their rights, an order being given to the contuma­ <lb/>
            cious bishop that he should observe the customs used by his <lb/>
            predecessors in Normandy in the time of the king's father, <lb/>
            William the Conqueror, and consecrate the abbot without <lb/>
            requiring any innovation. The bishop reluctantly obeyed <lb/>
            the royal command, and the ancient usage of the abbey was <lb/>
            confirmed. Ralph, abbot of Séez, conducted to Lisieux the <lb/>
            brother elect, and dictated the act of election, as the repre- <note type="footnote"> 1 Urban II. died on the 29th not the 28th, of July. Paschal II. was <lb/>
            elected the 13tb of August, and consecrated the next day. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We have here an instance of the obstinate repugnance of the monks <lb/>
            to submit to the jurisdiction of the ordinary, that is, of the bishop of the <lb/>

            sentative of the convent of monks. Robert, a monk of Séez, <lb/>
            an able penman, engrossed the charter, and Herluin, the <lb/>
            bishop's chaplain, read it before all the clergy, who made no <lb/>
            objection, to the following effect:—</p>
          <p>" Christ, the ever-present bishop and shepherd of the ec­ <lb/>
            clesiastical flock and its pastors, has perpetuated it by a <lb/>
            continual succession of souls, and has also continued the <lb/>
            pastoral order in perpetuity, appointing a number of priests <lb/>
            in succession, inasmuch as death interrupts their perma­ <lb/>
            nence. We have no doubt that their consecration ought to <lb/>
            be performed by the hands of the bishops giving spiritual <lb/>
            benediction from God himself, and we hold it no less certain <lb/>
            that their election is the business of their future subjects <lb/>
            directed by the Holy Spirit. Wherefore we, the convent <lb/>
            of monks of St. Evroult, following the ancient examples and <lb/>
            apostolical traditions, after the decease of our father Mai­ <lb/>
            nier, and the elevation of our father, the lord Serlo, to the <lb/>
            episcopacy, and by the inspiration of the divine mercy, have <lb/>
            unanimously elected abbot the lord Roger, our brother, who <lb/>
            is well known to us with whom he dwelt, as well as united <lb/>
            to us by the same profession. In this election we have been <lb/>
            assisted by the presence and opinions of several eminent <lb/>
            prelates, viz., the said Bishop Serlo, Anselm, abbot of Bee, <lb/>
            Ralph, abbot of Séez, Arnulph, abbot of Troarne, and others, <lb/>
            with whom considering, as far as is in our power, after the <lb/>
            apostle's rule, the worth of the person, we adopt one who is <lb/>
            catholic, instructed in the divine law, chaste, sober, humble, <lb/>
            gentle, merciful, benevolent, and endowed with the other <lb/>
            qualities which pastors require. Wherefore, offering this <lb/>
            our abbot elect, to the blessing of the divine Majesty, we <lb/>
            present him to Gilbert, our bishop of Lisieux, demanding <lb/>
            for him episcopal consecration according to the ecclesiastical <lb/>
            laws, with the canonical benediction."</p>
          <p>This act of the monks' election having been carefully <lb/>
            read, was graciously accepted by the bishop and clergy, and <lb/>
            Roger was consecrated abbot on the feast of the beheading <lb/>
            of St. John the Baptist.1 The next day he was received by <lb/>
            the brethren at St. Evroult with due honours. The same <lb/>
            day, while the monks were'sitting in the cloister conversing <lb/>
            with each other, and ably exchanging their thoughts on a <note type="footnote"> 1 The 29th of August, 1099. </note> <pb n="246"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            variety of subjects, the conversation happened to turn, as 1 <lb/>
            think, by God's inspiration, on the dedication of the abbey- <lb/>
            church ; and as it continued, they felt a fervent desire to <lb/>
            have it accomplished.1 At length, to the satisfaction of <note type="footnote"> 1 Richly stored as we find our author's work in materials from which we <lb/>
            may form an acquaintance with the interior life and exterior relations of the <lb/>
            monasteries of England and Normandy, it must be confessed that, except <lb/>
            in furnishing the dates at which many of them were erected, he throws but <lb/>
            little light on their architectural character, although a new style inseparably <lb/>
            connected with Norman history had sprung up in the times of his cotem­ <lb/>
            poraries or immediate predecessors. This is much to be regretted, and it <lb/>
            is very singular that an author who has devoted a considerable portion of <lb/>
            his work-to the history of his own convent, and has entered into such <lb/>
            minute details connected with it, should have supplied us with such scanty <lb/>
            notices of his own abbey church, and other conventual buildings. He <lb/>
            appears to have been so careless on a subject which is interesting to poste­ <lb/>
            rity, for whose benefit he is continually telling us he wrote, that he even <lb/>
            contradicts himself in what he has related. </note><note type="footnote"> We find that when the abbey was restored in the year 1050, after having <lb/>
            been long deserted, the old chapel built by St. Evroult between the years <lb/>
            575 and 584, was soon found too small for the increasing numbers of the <lb/>
            monks, as well as dilapidated by age; and that, consequently, Theodoric, the <lb/>
            first abbot on the new foundation, began to build a new church in a noble <lb/>
            style of architecture, but was compelled to desist from his undertaking by <lb/>
            the troublesome times which succeeded. Very little progress had, probably, <lb/>
            been made in the works, as his successor, Abbot Osberne (1061—1066) is <lb/>
            represented to have " planned and commenced the new church," making <lb/>
            one of the monks, Richard de Heudicourt, a man of rank, who had seen <lb/>
            much of the world, overseer of the works, with the charge of the expendi­ <lb/>
            ture and the superintendence of the stone-cutters. </note><note type="footnote"> We hear nothing of the progress of the works during the five years of <lb/>
            Osberne's government; but, upon the appointment of his successor, Abbot <lb/>
            Mainier, in 1066, we are told that he "began" building the new church <lb/>
            dedicated to St. Mary, St. Peter, and St. Evroult, and which was to con­ <lb/>
            tain seven altars, the old church erected by the saint being, as it has been <lb/>
            said before, small and dilapidated ; and that, by God's help and the contri­ <lb/>
            butions and munificence of the brethren and his friends, he completed the <lb/>
            building of a spacious and beautiful church, a dormitory, and cellar, and <lb/>
            other offices for the use of the monks, vol. i., pp. 467, 468. A shorter. <lb/>
            account afterwards given concurs in stating that Abbot Mainier " began <lb/>
            and completed" the new church and monastery. </note><note type="footnote"> Without stopping to reconcile these conflicting statements by inquiring <lb/>
            whether the abbey-church, finished by Mainier, was the same as that <lb/>
            commenced by his predecessors Theodoric and Osberne, as it probably was, <lb/>
            we may conclude that the building thus completed was that which received <lb/>
            consecration at the time and in the manner described in this paragraph of <lb/>
            our author's narrative, and in the year 1099. The works probably occu­ <lb/>
            pied the greater part of the period of Mainier's abbacy, as we find Arch­ <lb/>

             <note type="margin">1099.] </note> <lb/>
            their friends and with their assistance, the resolution was <lb/>
            made, and by God's help, the church of St. Evroult was <lb/>
            consecrated on the ides [the 13th] of November. Three <lb/>
            bishops assisted in the celebration of this office. Gilbert, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux, consecrated the high altar in honour of <lb/>
            St. Mary, mother of God, St. Peter, prince of the apostles, <lb/>
            and St. Evroult, the confessor. Gilbert, bishop of Evreux, <lb/>
            consecrated the altar on the south side in honour of All the <lb/>
            Apostles, and Serlo the altar of All the Martyrs. The next <lb/>
            day Serlo blessed the crucifix and its altar dedicated to St. <lb/>
            Saviour and St. Giles, the confessor; and Gilbert of Evreux <lb/>
            consecrated the altar used for the matins mass to All Saints. <lb/>
            Lastly, on the seventeenth of the calends of December1 <note type="footnote"> dormitory in 1078 and at a subsequent time, and Queen Matilda providing <lb/>
            for the erection of the refectory on her visit to the abbey some time after <lb/>
            the year 1081. However, Abbot Mainier did not live to see the consecra­ <lb/>
            tion of his noble edifice, and the long delay of its dedication in the time of <lb/>
            his successors may have arisen from their disputes with the bishop of the <lb/>
            diocese referred to in the present chapter. </note><note type="footnote"> We may conclude from the dates supplied, and a few words dropped by <lb/>
            Ordericus, that the abbey-church was in the best style of Norman archi­ <lb/>
            tecture. Of its details and particular character, we have no immediate <lb/>
            means of furnishing any account, but we have reason to think that, as in <lb/>
            the case of many other abbatial and cathedral churches, the Norman <lb/>
            building, or great part of it, was superseded in after times by a new erec­ <lb/>
            tion in the pointed style. The abbey of St. Evroult shared the fate of other <lb/>
            monastic establishments in France at the time of the revolution, but it has <lb/>
            only very recently reached the last stage of ruin, being now (1853) <lb/>
            nearly levelled to the ground, and the squared and beautifully-worked <lb/>
            stones piled in heaps for sale as building materials, so that, shortly, there <lb/>
            will not be left a trace of this once magnificent abbey. The only remains <lb/>
            now standing which can be supposed to belong to our author's age, are <lb/>
            some low Norman arches, in or near the south transept, which appear to <lb/>
            have belonged to a mortuary chapel. </note><note type="footnote"> The natural features of the neighbourhood, so often described by Orde­ <lb/>
            ricus with more precision than the conventual buildings, have experienced <lb/>
            of course less change. The little marshy valley is watered by the Charen­ <lb/>
            ton, pouring its torrent through meadows in which the remains of the <lb/>
            monk's fishponds are still visible. Its right bank rises rapidly to the verge <lb/>
            of the wood, where the church of Notre Dame-du-Bois stands on the same <lb/>
            spot as the original building founded by the munificence of Childebert's <lb/>
            queen. The forest surrounds the whole, as it did when St. Evroult first <lb/>
            built his cell in the wilderness. The country people say it is forty miles in <lb/>
            circumference ; we have traversed it ourselves in nearly a straight line for <lb/>
            ten miles in more than one direction. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We have ventured to correct the text by substituting the calends of <lb/>

            [November 15th], the lord bishop of Evreux consecrated an <lb/>
            altar on the south, in honour of All Confessors; and, when <lb/>
            he had finished celebrating the mass, proceeded to the <lb/>

            benedictions. At the close of the same year, Serlo, bishop <lb/>
            of Séez, dedicated the altar in the north transept on the <lb/>
            second of the calends of January [December 31st], in honour <lb/>
            of All the Virgins.</p>
          <p>Thus, seven altars were reverently dedicated by the three <lb/>
            bishops on certain fixed days, and distributed to the praise <lb/>
            of God, according to ecclesiastical rule among the glorious <lb/>
            orders of saints, who in the heavenly kingdom for ever <lb/>
            surround the holy of holies in endless bliss.</p>
          <p>Many of the Norman lords were present at this dedica­ <lb/>
            tion, and the faithful of both orders presented to God the <lb/>
            offerings of their prayers. William, abbot of Bee, and <lb/>

          <p>AT that time there was much disturbance in the west, and <lb/>
            shame and confusion were attached to the base deserters of <lb/>
            the crusade, in the sight of all men. Pope Urban had <lb/>
            sanctioned by his universal authority, and enforced <lb/>
            apostolical order by an inviolable decree through all the <lb/>
            Latin states, that those who had assumed our Saviour's <lb/>
            cross and changing their purpose, had not joined the <lb/>
            pilgrimage to Jerusalem, should undertake a corresponding <lb/>
            journey in the name of the Lord, or lying under excommu­ <lb/>
            nication should for their punishment be cut off from the <lb/>
            church. In consequence, Stephen, count de Blois, who had <lb/>
            undergone severe sufferings of various kinds, was in great <lb/>
            distress of mind, and made preparations for a second ex­ <lb/>

            of the cross, who, armed with faith in the Holy Trinity, <lb/>
            had fought against the Gentiles, and having obtained a <lb/>
            glorious triumph by the power of their merciful Saviour, <lb/>
            had secured to themselves endless fame.</p>
          <p>I propose now, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to return to <lb/>
            the pilgrims, and relate shortly the adventures and end of <lb/>
            those who after their successes remained in Judæa or Syria, <lb/>
            as well as of those who effected their return home by an <lb/>
            arduous journey.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1099, in the month of August,1 <lb/>
            Godfrey, son of Eustace, count of Boulogne and son of Ita, <lb/>
            received the sceptre of David at Jerusalem, and reigned <lb/>
            there three years. In the course of the same month,2 <lb/>
            while yet supported by the whole force of his fellow crusa­ <lb/>
            ders, he fought a battle with the emir near Ascalon, in <lb/>
            which by God's help he gained a glorious victory. In the <lb/>
            autumn when the Gentiles were utterly crushed, the God of <lb/>
            Sabaoth having fought against them, the illustrious chiefs <lb/>
            with their followers resolved to return, and bidding farewell <lb/>
            to their friends and comrades, commenced their homeward <lb/>
            journey. Among these were Robert, duke of Normandy, <lb/>
            Robert, marquis of Flinders, and Raymond, count of <lb/>
            Thoulouse,l of whose valour the Turks had received sufficient <lb/>
            proofs. They met on their road crowds of pilgrims who <lb/>
            had been prevented from accompanying them iu the first <lb/>
            expedition, but who had taken the earliest opportunity they <lb/>
            could find of fulfilling their vow of making a pilgrimage to <lb/>
            the tomb of our Lord. They suffered severely on the road <lb/>
            from famine, being reduced to the last extremity by want, <lb/>
            for their precursors, who had in the preceding year wasted <lb/>
            the country between Antioch and Jerusalem, sowed the <lb/>
            seeds of destruction in their path by the scarcity they <lb/>
            occasioned to the pilgrims who followed them ; having either <lb/>
            slain or driven away the inhabitants of the country, so <lb/>
            that the lands, not being cultivated, produced nothing that <note type="footnote"> I It was not in the month, but during the calends, of August, the 24th <lb/>

            could be eaten. However, the chiefs who were returning <lb/>
            home learnt from the pilgrims they met, that Duke Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond was besieging Laodicea,l and that the troops of the <lb/>
            emperor who formed the garrison were making an obstinate <lb/>
            defence.</p>
          <p>Nearly twenty thousand pilgrims, who were on their road <lb/>
            from England and the other islands of the ocean to the <lb/>
            tomb of our Lord, had disembarked there at the time when <lb/>
            the Gentiles were besieging Antioch and blockaded the <lb/>
            Christians in the city. The people of Laodicea received the <lb/>
            island crusaders with great satisfaction, and put themselves <lb/>
            under their protection against the Turks. The most <lb/>
            distinguished of them was Edgar Atheling, who had been <lb/>
            unsuccessfully raised to the throne of England after the <lb/>
            death of King Harold. He undertook the defence of <lb/>
            Loadicea, maintaining its fidelity to Duke Robert, to whom <lb/>
            he ceded it after his victory over the Pagans. Edgar was <lb/>
            handsome in person, a good speaker, liberal and high-born, <lb/>
            being the son of Edward, king of Hungary, but he was <lb/>
            slow in action. As for the duke, who was of his own <lb/>
            age, he loved him as a brother who had been nursed with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>In this manner, Duke Robert obtained possession of Lao­ <lb/>
            dicea, a city of Syria, and halted there some time with the <lb/>
            Normans, English, and Bretons. He stationed a garrison <lb/>
            of his own followers in the fortifications of the place, while <lb/>
            he continued his pilgrimage to the tomb of our Lord Jesus <lb/>
            Christ.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Ravendinos, the protospathaire of the emperor <lb/>
            Alexius, and some of his other officers, arrived by sea and <lb/>
            laid siege to the city with a powerful army.2 The towns- <note type="footnote"> 1 The siege of Laodicea by Bohemond is wholly apocryphal. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 When Jerusalem was taken, the count of Tholouse was the first who <lb/>
            held Laodicea, as a vassal of the emperor Alexius. After the battle of <lb/>
            Ascalon, the inhabitants of that place consented to receive him as their <lb/>
            lord in consequence of their having formed a favourable opinion of his <lb/>
            character, from their commercial relations with Montpellier. Raymond, <lb/>
            who was the only one of the crusaders who had vowed never to return to <lb/>
            his own country, had a great desire to find some settled establishment in <lb/>
            the East, after his pretensions had been rejected at Antioch and Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem. Godfrey, refusing his concurrence, the inhabitants of Ascalon declined <lb/>
            to receive Raymond, and he withdrew in disgust from the army and with </note> <pb n="252"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH.XI. </note> <lb/>
            men, taking the part of their countrymen, expelled the <lb/>
            Cisalpines, and thus the imperial commander was introduced <lb/>
            by the Greeks and Syrians. Bohemond learning this, lost <lb/>
            no time in hastening to the spot with his troops, and <lb/>
            besieged the city a long time, making frequent assaults upon <lb/>
            it. But when the inhabitants of Laodicea and the Thracians <lb/>
            heard that the crusaders were returning from Jerusalem, <lb/>
            fearing that if the two armies united they would be invin­ <lb/>
            cible, they sent messengers to meet them, carrying presents, <lb/>
            and adroitly requesting them to hasten securely to the <lb/>
            defence of their city. The crusaders received this invi. <lb/>
            tation with great satisfaction, and continuing their march, <lb/>
            were peaceably admitted by the inhabitants within the <lb/>
            walls. These occurrences being ascertained, and everything <lb/>
            quiet on both sides, Duke Robert and his confederates inti­ <lb/>
            mated to Bohemond that he should retire peaceably, or else <lb/>
            make instant preparation for battle. On receiving this <lb/>
            message, Bohemond assembled his council, and demanded <lb/>
            what he was to do in these difficult circumstances. All his <lb/>
            friends persuaded him to depart without a struggle, and, <lb/>
            content with his own states, not invade those of others to <lb/>
            which he had no claim, in hostility to his brothers and brave <lb/>
            companions in arms, lest he should become a scandal to <lb/>
            Christians and a laughing-stock to Pagans, and stain, by the <lb/>
            effusion of Christian blood, the glory acquired by his valour. <lb/>
            The duke, with his usual moderation, clearly perceived the <lb/>
            soundness of this reasoning, and comprehending the wisdom <lb/>
            of the prudent counsels he received, and, acquiescing in them, <note type="footnote"> only his own followers took possession of Laodicea, of which place he <lb/>
            received the investiture from the Greek emperor. After his departure to <lb/>
            Constantinople, Tancred, who governed the principality of Antioch, got <lb/>
            possession of Laodicea, by force or favour, as the historians state. </note><note type="footnote"> As to the occupation of that city by Edgar Atheling on behalf of Robert <lb/>
            of Normandy, it took place after the siege of Antioch as our author states, <lb/>
            but it was merely temporary, and it might be anticipated from the well- <lb/>
            known character of the two princes that it could not be permanent. What <lb/>
            became of it in the interval between the two occupations, we do not learn, <lb/>
            but it is not probable that Bohemond conquered it from the Greeks, to <lb/>
            demand the investiture of it from their own emperor. </note><note type="footnote"> M. Le Prevost remarks that the whole of this episode respecting Lao­ <lb/>
            dicea will not bear a serious examination. It must have been gathered <lb/>
            from the romantic stories of some ill-informed pilgrims, and does not merit <lb/>
            the honour given it of finding a place of our author's history. </note> <pb n="253"/>

            drew off his forces, though with great regret, out of respect <lb/>
            for his companions.</p>
          <p>The Greeks and Syrians, thus freed from alarm, con­ <lb/>
            sulted respecting their own affairs, and a few days after­ <lb/>
            wards, having summoned our countrymen to a conference, <lb/>
            thus addressed them :—" Illustrious lords, whose worth and <lb/>
            courage are now known throughout the world, listen to what <lb/>
            we have now to say to you in good faith. We well know <lb/>
            that you abandoned rich territories for the sake of your <lb/>
            pilgrimage, and that now, having fulfilled your vows, you are <lb/>
            anxious to return to them, but principally for the love you <lb/>
            bear to your dear wives and children, and your regard for <lb/>
            kindred and friends whom you left for Christ's sake. Hear <lb/>
            now, with indulgence, the advice we offer towards the <lb/>
            accomplishment of this object, which doubtless, by God's <lb/>
            guidance, you will approve as sound and advantageous. <lb/>
            Give up to us, for the emperor's use, the cities and towns <lb/>
            which you possess in Syria and Romania: we, on our part, <lb/>
            will completely equip a fleet for your use and convey you <lb/>
            and all who choose to follow. you, free of charge, to Constan­ <lb/>
            tinople, supplying you plentifully with bread and wine and <lb/>
            all other necessaries during the voyage. We know the <lb/>
            emperor's wishes in this matter, and we desire to please him <lb/>
            by such service; for he is flattered by having the Franks <lb/>
            about him, admiring and valuing their determination and <lb/>
            spirit of enterprise. Take our advice, and present your­ <lb/>
            selves to him in full confidence, and you will find that we <lb/>
            have given you profitable counsel."</p>
          <p>The Franks consulted together, and each gave his opinion <lb/>
            on various matters after due consideration. The chiefs with <lb/>
            their friends had a separate meeting, and the following is <lb/>
            the substance of what passed between them: “We are far <lb/>
            away in a strange country, and earnestly desire to return <lb/>
            home; but there is a double difficulty in our way. We <lb/>
            can neither remain here honourably, as becomes our rank, <lb/>
            nor go back to France without great danger. Bohemond, <lb/>
            who is possessed of Antioch and the adjacent provinces, has <lb/>
            widely extended his rule, and will permit no equal to exist <lb/>
            here. We are without vessels to cross the sea, and there is no <lb/>
            route by land, except through the dominions of the emperor. <lb/>
            Besides, we should find it perilous unless we enjoy his <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X CH.XI. </note> <lb/>
            favour, having everything to fear in journeying among bar­ <lb/>
            barous tribes and through difficult roads. We are suffering <lb/>
            many privations, and tormented by the apprehension of a <lb/>
            variety of dangers. Worn out with fatigues, our great <lb/>
            desire is, as before observed, to return to our own country, <lb/>
            which is out of our power, either by land or sea, without the <lb/>
            emperor's co-operation. What then shall we do ? We <lb/>
            cannot linger here, for want stares us in the face, weak and <lb/>
            weary exiles as we are. It is better for us to be satisfied <lb/>
            with the promises of these Greeks, although we know them <lb/>
            to be crafty, and, as they are Christians, to accept thankfully <lb/>
            their peaceable offers, which we might have been compelled <lb/>
            to implore with earnest prayers."</p>
          <p>At length the Franks commended themselves to God, <lb/>
            in whose hands all things are, and gave a willing assent to <lb/>
            all that the Greeks proposed. The latter rejoiced greatly, <lb/>
            and faithfully fulfilled what they promised.</p>
          <p>The emperor received the Franks on their arrival with <lb/>
            due honours, and having heard the terms of the treaty con­ <lb/>
            cluded between the Greeks and themselves, he was highly <lb/>
            pleased with it, and ratified it by his imperial authority. <lb/>
            He offered high dignities to those who were willing to <lb/>
            remain with him, and made magnificent presents to those <lb/>
            who returned to the western states. The count of Thoulouse <lb/>
            was entertained by him as long as he lived, being admitted <lb/>
            among the number of his most favoured guests and trusted <lb/>
            counsellors. The emperor had an especial regard for him, <lb/>
            and listened to him with great pleasure, because he knew <lb/>
            that he had firmly opposed Bohemond at Antioch in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of his fidelity to him. Raymond's wife, who was <lb/>

            viz. that the emperor's officers and all the Franks had crossed <lb/>

            and laying siege to Laodicea with great vigour, forced it to <lb/>
            surrender, and having held it twelve years left it to his <lb/>
            successors who still possess it. He was also signally suc­ <lb/>

            tosa, where he established himself, and thus escaped their fearful disaster. <lb/>
            From thence he sat down before Tripoli in Syria, and built the castle of <lb/>
            Mont-Pelerin to maintain the siege. He died there the 18th of February, <lb/>
            1105. Tripoli did not surrender to the crusaders till 1109, when it was <lb/>

            having been honoured by many gifts from the emperor, as <lb/>
            already mentioned, departed with their followers, and were <lb/>
            received with great favour in Italy by the Normans, who <lb/>
            possessed there great wealth. Roger the elder, count of <lb/>
            Sicily, and his nephew Roger, duke of Apulia, with Geoffrey <lb/>
            de Conversana,2 nephew of duke Guiscard, and their other <lb/>
            countrymen or kinsmen rejoiced at their safe return, and <lb/>
            did all in their power to gratify the champions of Christ <lb/>
            worn by their numerous conflicts in his cause. While there, <lb/>
            Robert duke of Normandy fell in love with a noble young <lb/>
            lady, Sibylla daughter of Geoffrey de Conversana, and <lb/>
            marrying her took her with him to Normandy. She was <lb/>

            for five years. He therefore procured from his father-in-law <lb/>

            effects, from which sources he amassed a vast sum of money <lb/>
            with the prudent intention of paying his creditor in order <lb/>
            that he might have the possession of his duchy peaceably <lb/>
            restored.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Modern historians have not thought proper to give any account of the <lb/>

            motives which induced him to join the crusade. The circumstances, as <lb/>
            they are detailed by Rudborne, the annalist of Winchester cathedral, are so <lb/>
            curious that they deserve to he mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> According to this writer, Robert Curthose promised his father when he <lb/>
            was on his death-bed, to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the good of <lb/>
            his soul. His natural indolence and the embarrassments of all kinds in <lb/>
            which he was speedily involved, for a time suspended the performance of <lb/>
            his promise, but it was brought vividly to his recollection by the preaching <lb/>
            of the crusade which summoned all Christendom to hasten to the deliver­ <lb/>
            ance of the holy places. He, therefore, took the cross with enthusiasm, but <lb/>
            the funds required for so expensive an enterprise were wanting in his case, <lb/>
            as well as in those of most of his fellow pilgrims. In order to raise them <lb/>
            he had recourse to his brothers in England, appealing to their filial regard <lb/>
            for assistance to perform a vow which had for its object the good of their <lb/>
            father's soul. William Rufus gave him a harsh refusal, telling hiin, with <lb/>
            bitter irony, to go to his friend the king of France. Henry, who was <lb/>
            younger, and of a more kindly disposition, declined at first to lend his <lb/>
            brother any assistance, but was at length moved to give him a thousand <lb/>
            pounds. Upon this, William, unwilling to yield in generosity to Prince <lb/>
            Henry, and calculating on the advantages he might gain both to his ambi­ <lb/>
            tion and avarice, agreed to lend Robert 10,000 silver marks for five years, <lb/>
            on condition that Normandy was made over to him as security for repay­ <lb/>

          <p>THE memorable achievements performed in the east to the <lb/>
            honour of Christ by the princes and other faithful servants <lb/>
            of the cross were quickly known by report in the western <lb/>

            the signal deliverance of Jerusalem and the downfall of <lb/>
            Babylon. William count of Poitiers,1 having heard of these <lb/>
            splended triumphs, was inflamed with the desire of under­ <lb/>
            taking the pilgrimage. An army of three hundred thousand <lb/>
            men from Aquitaine, Gascony, and other provinces of the <lb/>
            south enlisted under his banner. He determined on mort­ <lb/>
            gaging to William Rufus, king of England, the duchy of <lb/>
            Aquitaine and all his territories, on condition of receiving a <lb/>
            large sum of money from his treasury to enable him to <lb/>
            accomplish the journey he proposed with great splendour. <lb/>
            Ambasadors of proved ability were therefore despatched to <lb/>
            the king who conveyed to him their master's wishes. The <lb/>
            proud monarch, who the more he had the more he coveted, <lb/>
            like the thirst of a dropsical man, received the envoy's pro­ <lb/>
            posals with great satisfaction, and longed to add the duke's <lb/>
            ample possessions to the ancient dominions belonging to his <lb/>
            father's duchy and kingdom. He therefore gave orders for <lb/>
            the equipment of a powerful fleet, and for a large body of <lb/>
            English cavalry to accompany him, that having crossed the <lb/>
            sea he might be ready in arms, lion-like, to seize on his prey, <lb/>
            oppose by force his brother's return to Normandy, purchase <lb/>
            the duchy of Aquitaine, at a vast expense, and reducing to <lb/>
            submission all who opposed him, extend the frontiers of <lb/>
            his dominions to the bank of the Garonne. Such were the <lb/>

          <p>TITEN, about the season of Rogations,' a lamentable event <lb/>
            took place in the New Forest. While the knights of the <lb/>
            king's court were engaged in hunting, and shooting does <lb/>
            and bucks with bolts from their cross-bows, a certain knight <lb/>
            aiming at one of the beasts of chase with an arrow chanced <lb/>
            to strike an illustrious young prince, Richard, duke Robert's <lb/>
            son. He fell instantly dead, to the great sorrow of his <lb/>
            numerous friends. The knight, terrified at his great mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, fled with all speed to the priory of St. Pancras, 2 and <lb/>
            there became a monk, avoiding by that means the two-fold <lb/>
            penalties he had incurred. For, retiring from the world, he <lb/>
            expiated by penance the guilt of homicide ; and escaped at <lb/>
            the same time the bitter revenge of the friends and relations <lb/>
            of the young prince. Many persons had predicted extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary good fortune to the knight referred to, but men, <lb/>
            when the God of Sabaoth orders otherwise, are frequently <lb/>
            deceived and deceive others; for, clouded by the darkness of <lb/>
            ignorance, the thoughts of man are vain.</p>
          <p>Let me say something of this young prince. At the <lb/>
            time that Duke Robert was foolishly engaged in rebellion <lb/>
            against his -father, and harassed Normandy from the place <lb/>
            of his exile by pillage and other aggressions, he fell in love <lb/>
            with the handsome concubine of an old priest, who lived <lb/>
            somewhere on the frontier of France,3 and had by her two <lb/>
            sons, Richard and William. Having nourished these <lb/>
            children for many years with great care, when they came <lb/>
            to riper years, she took them to Normandy, and presented <lb/>
            them to the duke as his sons, recalling to his memory many <lb/>
            well-known tokens of their familiar intimacy in his youthful <lb/>
            days. He partly acknowledged the truth of these asser­ <lb/>
            tions, but affected to doubt the children being his; the <note type="footnote"> 1 The filst day of Rogations was Monday, May 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 St. Pancras at Lewes; see vol. ii., p. 472. At a later period the <lb/>

            king's son. Both these brothers were worthy and amiable, <lb/>
            but they perished in a moment like the flower of grass ; one, <lb/>
            as we have seen, was cut off by a wound he received in <lb/>
            hunting; and the other, after Henry made Robert prisoner <lb/>
            at Tinchebrai, went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and after <lb/>
            much distinguishing himself, soon fell in the wars.</p>
          <p>Learn now, my reader, why the forest in which the young <lb/>
            prince was slain received the name of the New Forest. <lb/>
            That part of the country was extremely populous from <lb/>
            early times, and full of well-inhabited hamlets and farms. <lb/>
            A numerous population cultivated Hampshire with un­ <lb/>
            ceasing industry, so that the southern part of the district <lb/>
            plentifully supplied Winchester with the products of the <lb/>
            land. When William the First ascended the throne of <lb/>
            Albion, being a great lover of forests, he laid waste more <lb/>
            than sixty parishes, compelling the inhabitants to emigrate <lb/>
            to other places, and substituted beasts of the chase for <lb/>
            human beings, that he might satisfy his ardour for hunting. <lb/>
            Two of his sons, Richard and William Rufus, as well as his <lb/>
            grandson Richard, of whom we have lately spoken, perished <lb/>
            in this forest; and apparitions of various kinds were seen <lb/>
            there, to the great alarm of some persons; and in this way <lb/>
            the Lord manifested his displeasure that consecrated <lb/>
            churches had been ruined to make a shelter for wild beasts.</p>

            humbly address to him this petition: ' 0 Lord Jesus Christ, <lb/>
            the Saviour of mankind, for which thou didst shed thy <lb/>
            precious blood when hanging on the cross, look with an eye <lb/>
            of compassion on thy people which now groans under <lb/>
            the yoke of William. Thou avenger of wickedness, and <lb/>
            most just judge of all men, take vengeance, I beseech <lb/>
            thee, on my behalf of this William, and deliver me <lb/>
            out of his hands, for, as far as lies in his power, he has <lb/>
            polluted and grievously afflicted me.' The Lord replied: <lb/>
            ' Be patient and wait awhile, and soon you will be amply <lb/>
            revenged of him.' I trembled at hearing this, and doubt <lb/>
            not that the divine anger presently threatens the king; <lb/>
            for I understood that the cries of the holy virgin, our <lb/>
            mother the church, had reached the ears of the Almighty, <lb/>
            by reason of the robberies, the foul adulteries, and the <lb/>
            heinous crimes of all sorts which the king and his courtiers <lb/>
            cease not daily of committing against the divine law.2</p>
          <p>On being informed of this, the venerable abbot Serl03 <note type="footnote"> 1 The abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester was founded during the reign of <lb/>
            King Ethelred in the year 680. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A foreign monk related to Robert Fitzhamon a still more frightful <lb/>
            dream, in which he saw William Rufus come into a church with his usual <lb/>
            menacing and insolent gestures, looking contemptuously on the standers-by </note><note type="footnote"> - and gnaw the legs and arms of Jesus Christ on the crucifix. The <lb/>
            image bore this for a time, but at length struck the king with its foot in <lb/>
            such a manner that he fell backwards. Then such volumes of flame burst <lb/>
            from his mouth that the smoke darkened the sky. Robert Fitzhamon <lb/>
            thought it right to tell this dream to the king, who heard it with shouts of <lb/>
            laughter; " He is a monk," he exclaimed, " and dreams for money ; give <lb/>
            him a hundred pence." Still he hesitated a long time before he decided <lb/>
            on hunting and did not go till after dinner, having taken a more than <lb/>
            usual quanuty of wine. William of Malmesbury, p. 344, Bohn's Antiq. <lb/>

            wrote letters which he despatched in a friendly spirit from <lb/>
            Gloucester, informing the king very distinctly of all that <lb/>
            the monk had seen in his vision. On the calends [1st] of <lb/>
            August, they were celebrating the feast of St. Peter-in- <lb/>
            Vinculis, in the same monastery, and immense crowds of <lb/>
            people of all ranks were drawn together on that spot. <lb/>
            Then Fulchered, a zealous monk of Séez2 and first abbot of <lb/>
            Shrewsbury, an eloquent expositor of the holy scriptures, <lb/>
            being chosen as one of the oldest clergy, ascended the <lb/>
            pulpit, and addressed a sermon to the congregation on the <lb/>
            word of salvation. In the course of it he openly denounced <lb/>
            offenders against the divine law, and filled, as it were, with <lb/>
            a prophetic spirit, boldly advanced predictions such as this: <lb/>
            " England," he said, " is allowed to become a heritage <lb/>
            trodden under foot by the profane, because the land is full <lb/>
            of iniquity. Its whole body is spotted by the leprosy of <lb/>
            a universal iniquity, and infected by the disease of sin <lb/>
            from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet. <lb/>
            Unbridled pride stalks abroad, swelling, if I may say it, even <lb/>
            above the stars of heaven. Dissolute lust pollutes not <lb/>
            only vessels of clay, but those of gold, and insatiable avarice <lb/>
            devours all it can lay hands on. But lo ! a sudden change <lb/>
            of affairs is threatened. The libertines shall not always bear <lb/>
            rule, the Lord God will come to judgment of the open <lb/>
            enemies of his spouse, and strike Moab and Edom with the <lb/>
            sword of his signal vengeance, and overthrow the mountains <lb/>
            of Gilboa with a fearful convulsion. The anger of the <lb/>
            Lord shall no longer spare transgressors, and the wrath of <lb/>
            heaven shall rage against the unbelieving children. The <lb/>
            bow of divine vengeance is bent on the reprobate, and the <lb/>
            swift arrow taken from the quiver is ready to wound. The <lb/>
            blow will soon be struck, but the man who is wise enough <lb/>
            to correct his sins will avoid the infliction."</p>

            effect. The morning1 of the day following, King William, <lb/>
            having dined with his minions, prepared, after the meal <lb/>
            was ended, to go forth and hunt in the New Forest. Being <lb/>
            in great spirits he was joking with his attendants while his <lb/>
            boots were being laced, when an armourer came and <lb/>
            presented to him six arrows. The king immediately took <lb/>
            them with great satisfaction, praising the work, and uncon­ <lb/>
            scious of what was to happen, kept four of them himself <lb/>
            and held out the other two to Walter Tirel.2 " It is but <lb/>
            right," he said, " that the sharpest arrows should be given <lb/>
            to him who knows best how to inflict mortal wounds with <lb/>
            them." This Tirel was a French knight of good extraction, <lb/>
            the wealthy lord of the castles of Poix and Pontoise, filling <lb/>
            a high place among the nobles, and a gallant soldier; he was <lb/>
            therefore admitted to familiar intimacy with the king, and <lb/>
            became his constant companion. Meanwhile, while they <lb/>
            were idly talking on various subjects, and the king's household <lb/>
            attendants were assembled about him, a monk of Gloucester <lb/>
            presented himself and delivered to the king a letter from his <lb/>
            abbot. Having read it, the king burst out laughing, and <lb/>
            said merrily to the knight just mentioned, " Walter, do <lb/>
            what I told you." The knight replied, " I will, my lord." <lb/>
            Slighting then the warnings of the elders, and forgetting that <lb/>
            the heart is lifted up before a fall, he said respecting the letter <lb/>
            he had received, " I wonder what has induced my lord Serlo to <lb/>
            write to me in this strain, for I really believe he is a worthy <lb/>
            abbot and respectable old man. In the simplicity of his <lb/>
            heart, he transmits to me, who have enough besides to attend <lb/>
            to, the dreams of his snoring monks, and even takes the <lb/>
            trouble to commit them to writing, and send them a long <lb/>
            distance. Does he think that I follow the example of the <lb/>
            English, who will defer their journey or their business <lb/>
            on account of the dreams of a parcel of wheezing old <lb/>
            women?"</p>
          <p>Thus speaking, he hastily rose, and mounting his horse, <lb/>
            rode at full speed to the forest. His brother, Count Henry, <note type="footnote"> 1 Wednesday, August 1,1] 00. Malmesbury, whom we have just quoted, <lb/>

            with William de Breteuill and other distinguished persons <lb/>
            followed him, and, having penetrated into the woods, the <lb/>
            hunters dispersed themselves in various directions according <lb/>
            to custom. The king and Walter de Poix posted themselves <lb/>
            with a few others in one part of the forest, and stood with <lb/>
            their weapons in their hands eagerly watching forthecomingof <lb/>
            the game, when a stag suddenly running between them, the <lb/>
            king quitted his station, and Walter2 shot an arrow. It <lb/>
            grazed the beast's grizzly back, but glancing from it, <lb/>
            mortally wounded the king who stood within its range. <lb/>
            He immediately fell to the ground, and alas! suddenly <lb/>
            expired.3 The death of one man caused the greatest confu­ <lb/>
            sion among numbers, and the wood echoed with fearful <lb/>
            shouts occasioned by the death of their prince. Prince <lb/>
            Henry lost no time in riding as fast as his horse could carry <lb/>
            him to Winchester, where the royal treasure was kept, and <lb/>
            imperiously demanded the keys from the keepers, as the <lb/>
            lawful heir. William de Breteuil arrived at the same instant <lb/>
            with breathless haste, for he anticipated Henry's deep <lb/>
            policy and resolved to oppose it. " We ought," he said, <lb/>
            " to have a loyal regard for the fealty we have sworn to <lb/>
            your brother Robert. He is, undoubtedly, the eldest son <lb/>
            of King William, and both I and you, my lord Henry, have <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Breteuil, son of William Fitz-Osberne. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Walter Tirel, the third of that name. He must have undertaken <lb/>
            the pilgrimage to the Holy Land in which he died after he founded the <lb/>
            abbey of Selincourt in 1134. He also founded the priory of St. Denys at <lb/>
            Poix. He lived in the Vexin in 1091, at which time he appears as witness <lb/>
            in a charter of King Philip I., being a donation of the abbey of St. Melon <lb/>
            at Pontoise to the archbishop of Rouen. We must not be surprised to <lb/>
            find him sometimes at Pontoise and at others in Picardy. as the counts of <lb/>
            Amiens were both counts of Pontoise and the French Vexin. </note><note type="footnote"> Richard Giffard, his wife's father, was probably brother of Waiter <lb/>

            not a word, but breaking off the shaft of the arrow where it projected <lb/>

            The sun was declining, and the king, at the time he was shot, was holding <lb/>
            up his hand to screen his eyes from the sun's rays athwart the glades of <lb/>
            the forest, while he was keenly gating at a stag which he had just slightly <lb/>

            paid him homage.1 Therefore we ought to keep our <lb/>
            engagements to him in all respects, whether he be absent <lb/>
            or present. He has long laboured in God's service, and <lb/>
            the Lord now restores him, without a contest, the duchy <lb/>
            which he relinquished for the love of heaven, as well as his <lb/>
            father's crown." There was now a sharp contention between <lb/>
            them, and crowds flocked round them from all quarters; <lb/>
            but the influence of an heir present in person to claim his <lb/>
            rights began to prevail. Henry hastily seizing his sword <lb/>
            drew it out of the scabbard, declaring that no foreigner <lb/>
            should on frivolous pretences lay hands on his father's <lb/>
            sceptre.</p>
          <p>At length, through the intervention of friends and <lb/>
            prudent counsellors, the quarrel abated on one side and <lb/>
            the other, and by a wise resolution, to prevent a serious <lb/>
            rupture, the castle, with the royal treasures, was given up <lb/>
            to Henry, the king's son. This had been long before pre­ <lb/>
            dicted by the Britons, and the English desired to have for <lb/>
            their lord a prince they regarded as illustrious because he <lb/>
            was nobly born on the throne.2</p>
          <p>On the king's death, many of the nobles hastened at once <lb/>
            from the forest to their own abodes, and began to put their <lb/>
            affairs in order, in anticipation of the troubles which they <lb/>
            feared would follow. Some of the servants wrapped the <lb/>
            king's bloody corpse in a mean covering, and brought it, <lb/>
            like a wild boar pierced by the hunters, to the city of Win­ <lb/>
            chester. The clergy, the monks and citizens, with the poor <lb/>
            widows and mendicants, went in procession without delay <lb/>
            to meet the body, from respect to the royal dignity, and <lb/>
            buried it in the old minster of St. Peter.3 Notwithstanding, <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author, so far from applauding the loyalty of William de Breteuil, <lb/>
            already exhibits his great partiality for Henry I. Robert Curthose was <lb/>
            odious to the clergy not only on account of his licentious conduct, but <lb/>
            because he afforded them no protection against the rapacity of the barons. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He was the only son of William the Conqueror born after his acces­ <lb/>

            by Bishop Walkelin. The funeral procession was not so mean as our </note> <pb n="266"/>

            the doctors and prelates of the church, taking into con­ <lb/>
            sideration his debauched life and tragical end, did not <lb/>
            hesitate to pass sentence upon him, and thought, that as <lb/>
            they had been unable to inflict salutary punishment upon <lb/>
            him for his iniquities while he lived, he must be treated as <lb/>
            a reprobate,2 and one who did not merit absolution. In <lb/>
            some churches the bells did not ring his knell, although <lb/>
            they often are tolled long for paupers and women of the <lb/>
            lowest rank. Of the immense treasure he had amassed, <lb/>
            wrung from the labours of the wretched people, no alms <lb/>
            were given to the poor for the soul of their former ava­ <lb/>
            ricious owner. The soldiers who served for hire, the bullies <lb/>
            and common whores missed their gains at the death of the <lb/>
            debauched king, and lamenting his miserable end, not so <lb/>
            much from regard, as from their loss of the supplies which <lb/>
            ministered to their detestable vices, sought carefully for <lb/>
            Walter Tirel, threatening to tear him in pieces in revenge <lb/>
            for the death of their patron. However, the moment the <lb/>
            deed was done he hurried to the coast, and crossing the <lb/>
            sea took repose in his castles in France, where he laughed <lb/>
            in security at the threats and curses of his malevolent ene­ <lb/>
            mies. He married Alice, daughter of Richard, of the noble <lb/>
            family of Giffard, who bore to her husband Hugh de Poix, <lb/>
            a very valiant knight. Many years afterwards Walter went <lb/>
            in pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died penitent on the holy <lb/>
            journey.2 <note type="footnote"> author infers: multorum procerum conventu, paucorum planctu. Many of <lb/>

            shades, varying with certain glittering specks. His strength was prodigious, <lb/>
            though his frame was not large, and his belly was rather protuberant. He <lb/>
            had no pretensions to eloquence, but was remarkable for stammering in his <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1100, on Thursday, the fourth of <lb/>
            the nones [20th] of August, William Rufus was mortally <lb/>
            wounded by an arrow in the New Forest, after having pos­ <lb/>
            sessed the kingdom of England twelve years and nearly ten <lb/>
            months. Thereupon Henry hastened to London with Robert <lb/>
            earl of Mellent, and the following Sunday1 was placed on <lb/>
            the throne in the church of St. Peter the apostle, at West­ <lb/>
            minster, being anointed by the venerable Maurice, bishop of <lb/>
            London. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, was then an <lb/>
            exile, as it has been already observed, and Thomas, arch­ <lb/>
            bishop of York, being lately dead,2 that metropolitan see <lb/>
            was still vacant. Henry was thirty years old when he <lb/>
            ascended the throne, and his reign lasted thirty-five years <lb/>
            and four months.3 He ruled the dominions, divinely com­ <lb/>
            mitted to him, with prudence and success in prosperity and <lb/>
            adversity, and was distinguished among . the princes of <lb/>
            Christendom for his love of peace and justice. In his time <lb/>
            the church of God was brilliantly endowed with wealth and <lb/>
            honours, and all orders of the religious increased to the <lb/>
            glory of the Creator. This is shown by the monks and <lb/>
            clergy, who, during his reign, augmented their numbers and <lb/>
            their dignity; this is proved in the case of anchorites, who, <note type="footnote"> person by whose hand William Rufus fell. Suger, a cotemporary historian, <lb/>

          <p>From the beginning of his reign, Henry had the wisdom <lb/>
            to conciliate all parties, attaching them to his person by his <lb/>
            royal munificence. He admitted the nobles to a high place <lb/>
            in his favour, loaded them with wealth and honours, and <lb/>
            secured their fidelity by his flattering caresses. The com­ <lb/>
            mon people among his subjects he indulged with equitable <lb/>
            laws, and protected by his authority from unjust exactions <lb/>
            and pillage. This illustrious prince thus distinguished him­ <lb/>
            self above all the lords and kings of the west, and obtained <lb/>
            the favour both of the clergy and laity, who were delighted <lb/>
            to find themselves governed with reason.</p>
          <p>Henry began to console the widowed churches, deprived <lb/>
            of their pastors, by giving them learned men, with the advice <lb/>
            of his council. He promoted William Giffard,1 who was the <lb/>
            chancellor of the late king, to the see of Winchester, and <lb/>
            Gerard, bishop of Hereford, to the archbishopric of York.2 <lb/>
            He also despatched messengers in haste over the sea, recall­ <lb/>

            Longueville and earls of Buckingham. He was chancellor to three kings, <lb/>

            Henry I. 1100—1108. Not having been willing to receive consecration <lb/>

            and archbishop of York on the decease of Thomas his predecessor in the <lb/>
            month of November, 1100. Gerard died in 1108. He was only a <lb/>
            sub-deacon when he was appointed bishop, and Anselm had to ordain him <lb/>

            good understanding with the abbot of Ely did not last long : at the outset <lb/>
            Abbot Richard refused to be consecrated by the bishop of Lincoln in <lb/>
            whose diocese his abbey stood, and afterwards he lost the royal favour for <lb/>
            three reasons,-for having come to court with too pompous a retinue, for <lb/>
            not obeying with sufficient punctuality the royal commands, and for <lb/>
            shamefully dismissing a jester belonging to his household for foul words. <lb/>
            This last charge is not very intelligible; conviciantem, the phrase used <lb/>
            having also a good sense, being used by Martial for a merry jest, besides <lb/>
            its common acceptation of railing or brawling. However, for these <lb/>
            offences Richard was deprived of his abbey. He retired to Rome, where, <lb/>
            meeting St. Anselm, he had the courage to espouse the cause of King <lb/>
            Henry against that prelate, upon hearing which Henry restored him to the <lb/>
            possession of his abbey. He retained it till his death, which happened in <lb/>
            1107, just at the time that he was making arrangements, with the king's <lb/>
            consent, for its being erected to a bishopric, which took place soon <lb/>
            afterwards. </note><note type="footnote"> The election of Robert de Chester was quashed in the council held at <lb/>
            London by St. Anselm in the end of September, 1107, on the ground that <lb/>
            the monks of St. Edmundsbury had the right to choose their own abbot. <lb/>
            They forthwith exercised it, and substituted Robert their prior for Count <lb/>
            Hugh's son. In general the English monks had a great aversion to <lb/>
            Norman abbots on account of their arrogance, avarice and tyranny. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Glastonbury abbey had been stripped by William the Conqueror of <lb/>
            great part of its domains. Abbot Herluin proved a vigilant and <lb/>

            medical skill, so much so that we are told he frequently trusted for the <lb/>
            restoration of his health to the abbot of Malmesbury's prescriptions only. <lb/>

            made an incursion on the territories of Beaumont with a <lb/>
            powerful force, and swept off a vast booty from the lands of <lb/>
            Robert, earl of Millent, on the pretext of some injuries he <lb/>
            had inflicted on their allies arising out of the perfidious <lb/>

          <p>In the course of September, Duke Robert returned to <lb/>

            conversations with them. Those within the castle and those <lb/>
            without mutually indulged in good-humoured banter on a <lb/>
            variety of subjects, jesting with each other without ill-will, <lb/>
            so that their discourse became the admiration and delight of <lb/>
            the people of that country in future times.</p>
          <p>At length Walter and Hameric, after some days, said to <lb/>
            Elias, " We guard this strong castle, which our master has <lb/>
            committed to our custody, and we fear neither you nor your <lb/>
            warlike engines as long as we choose to resist you. It is in <lb/>
            our power to annoy you with stones and arrows, having the <lb/>
            advantage of you from our high tower; but from the fear of <lb/>
            God and our natural regard for you, we do not injure you, <lb/>
            especially as we really do not know in whose service we now <lb/>
            are, and for whom we hold the place. We think it, there­ <lb/>
            fore, would be right and convenient that a truce should be <lb/>
            made on both sides until a messenger returns from our <lb/>
            lords, the princes of England and Normandy. On his <lb/>
            return we shall do what reason tells us." Elias was <lb/>
            delighted at this proposal which he communicated to Fulk, <lb/>
            and both readily agreed in accepting the terms offered <lb/>
            by the Normans.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the messenger who was despatched to the <lb/>
            duke of Normandy thus addressed him: " Walter and <lb/>
            Hameric guard the citadel of Mans, according to King <lb/>
            William's orders; they are besieged by the forces of Maine <lb/>
            and Anjou, and they demand succour from you, wishing to <lb/>
            learn what they shall do to follow your wishes. If you <lb/>
            desire to hold the place, come to their relief with a strong <lb/>
            body of troops, and release them from the enemy who is <lb/>
            besieging them. Otherwise instruct them what they are to <lb/>
            do that they may escape destruction."</p>
          <p>The duke, exhausted by the fatigues of his long pilgrim­ <lb/>
            age, and liking better to enjoy a quiet bed than to encounter <lb/>
            the toils of war, sent word to the besieged by their messen­ <lb/>
            ger that they were to make peace on honourable terms with <lb/>
            the besieging army. "I am worn out," he said, " with my <lb/>
            protracted labours, and am contented with the duchy of <lb/>
            Normandy. I am also invited to cross the sea by the barons <lb/>
            of England, who are ready to acknowledge me king.”</p>
          <p>The messenger from the garrison, on receiving this <lb/>
            answer, did not return to Mans, but embarking in all haste <pb n="275"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 1100.] </note> <lb/>
            went to the court of the king of England, and communicated <lb/>
            to him in detail with great clearness what the duke had just <lb/>
            said to him, as I have quoted it. Henry, however, was so <lb/>
            occupied with the affairs of his trans marine states, that he <lb/>
            wisely preferred devoting himself to the care of what was <lb/>
            lawfully his own, than to burden himself through ambition <lb/>
            with foreign enterprises which had no just claim on his <lb/>
            attention. He therefore returned his thanks to the keepers <lb/>
            of the citadel for their good will towards him, and honour­ <lb/>
            ably dismissed their envoy with royal gifts. The messenger <lb/>
            accordingly returned to his employers, and detailed to them <lb/>
            the answers he had successively received from King Wil­ <lb/>
            liam's sons.</p>
          <p>In consequence, Walter and Hameric, having laudably <lb/>
            proved their fidelity, caused Elias to put on the white shirt, <lb/>
            which was the occasion of his being called " The White <lb/>
            Bachelor;" 1 and he lost no time in obeying the summons. <lb/>
            The keeper of the citadel, seeing him coming in great haste, <lb/>
            called out to him merrily: " White Bachelor, you may well <lb/>
            be glad, now that the moment you have long expected is <lb/>
            arrived. If you have plenty of money in your treasury, <lb/>
            you will be able to make a good bargain with us." Elias <lb/>
            asking what sort of a bargain they meant, they replied: <lb/>
            " The great William, king of England, built this citadel; his <lb/>
            successor entrusted it to our keeping; but now, alas, he is <lb/>
            dead. We therefore give it up to you, and acknowledge <lb/>
            you as count of Maine. We do so under no compulsion, <lb/>
            and under no alarm at your valour; if we wished to make a <lb/>
            longer resistance, we have the means of protracting the <lb/>
            siege, for our hearts are bold, and arms and provisions are <lb/>
            not wanting. But we have no legitimate master, to whose <lb/>
            service we may devote our powers, and, therefore, noble <lb/>
            sir, well assured of your merit, we choose you; and having <lb/>
            surrendered the citadel into your hands, declare you count <lb/>
            of Maine from this day." <note type="footnote"> I The text reads Bacularis, one who carries a baton or staff, but Bacca­ <lb/>
            larius is evidently the word meant. The name was given to Count Elias <lb/>
            not from his being a knight, bachelor, or banneret, but because he was <lb/>
            deprived of his honour as count of Maine, and consequently held an <lb/>
            inferior position to that which properly belonged to him. He was therefore <lb/>
            a pretender, an aspirant to the county, as the bachelors were to the rank <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1101, great disturbances broke <lb/>
            out in England and Normandy. The turbulent barons, <lb/>
            dreading the firmness of King Henry, and preferring the <lb/>
            inactive government of the imbecile Duke Robert, which <lb/>
            gave them licence for their malpractices, began to entertain <lb/>
            treasonable designs, and invited him to equip a fleet and <lb/>
            cross over to England. Robert de Belèsme and his two <lb/>
            brothers, Roger of Poitiers1 and Arnulph,2 together with <lb/>

            were parties to the league, and aided the duke's cause, at <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger de Montgomery, sometimes called earl of Lancaster, third son <lb/>

            Yorkshire, and sixty-three other manors, most of them in the same <lb/>

            of Cluni, in which he placed monks from the celebrated abbey of La <lb/>

            acres of land in Boos on Mount Mainart, probably Mount Main, which <lb/>
            the abbess sold to a monk of La Trinité-du-Mont. </note><note type="footnote"> In 1080 Enguerrard, son of Hilbert (probably Ilbert de Laci), gave to <lb/>
            the Trinité-du-Mont two thirds of the tithes of Bois l'Evêque. This <lb/>
            Enguerrard was apparently a great person, as his signature precedes that of <lb/>
            the count of Morton. There is great reason to believe that he was a son, <lb/>

            first in secret, but afterwards openly. The weak duke, <lb/>
            instead " of guarding his own dominions, imprudently <lb/>
            hazarded and lost them, led away by his ambition for a <lb/>
            crown which his abler brother firmly wore.</p>
          <p>The duke at this time granted to Robert de Belèsme the <lb/>
            bishopric of Séez,1 with the castle of Argentan and the <lb/>
            forest of Gouffern; and to Theobald Paganus the castle of <lb/>
            Gisors,2 because on one occasion he had found an asylum <lb/>
            with him. He also made large presents from his treasury <lb/>
            to other lords, and promised if he became king far more <lb/>
            than he could perform. As, also, he did not give up the <lb/>
            society of harlots and buffoons, but shamefully encou­ <lb/>
            raged them, he so wasted his means, that, in spite of <lb/>
            the wealth of his wide duchy, he was often penniless, and so <lb/>
            much in want of clothes that he lay in bed till twelve o'clock, <lb/>
            and could not go to church to hear mass, because he had <lb/>
            nothing to wear; for the idle scamps and loose women <lb/>
            with whom he was constantly surrounded, knowing his <lb/>
            weakness, frequently robbed him with impunity of his <lb/>
            breeches, hose, and other articles of dress. In him was <lb/>
            fulfilled the saying of a wise man: <lb/>
            Who waste their wealth at home must emigrate.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 By the bishopric of Séez must be understood not the ecclesiastical <lb/>
            revenues of that see, but the possession of and feudal rights over the country <lb/>
            dependent on it, better known as the Hiémois. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The castle of Gisors had been erected by William Rufus on the <lb/>
            domain of that place belonging to the archbishop of Rouen. Theobald <lb/>
            (Tibaud) Paganus held the fief of Gisors and that of Neaufle under the <lb/>
            archbishop ut casamentum. This kind of tenure seems to have been a sort of <lb/>
            stewardship, at least in its origin, and applied particularly to church lands. </note><note type="footnote"> Although the family of Paganus was ancient and distinguished, and had <lb/>
            been for several generations in possession of Neaufle and Gisors, there was <lb/>
            the greater imprudence in the duke's granting him the royal castle of <lb/>
            William Rufus, the key of Normandy on this side, because the domains, <lb/>
            the connections, the sympathies, and even the pious foundations of these <lb/>
            lords of the castle of Gisors, were all on the other side of the Epte. In a <lb/>
            word, it was a family of the French Vexin transplanted to Gisors, without <lb/>
            ever taking root there. All these considerations were set aside for the <lb/>
            sake of recompensing an act of hospitality. This was consistent with the <lb/>
            character of Robert Curthose, but it was paying the bill for his entertain­ <lb/>
            ment a little too dear. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The text is a rhyming hexameter verse: <lb/>

            disposed to favour the cause of the king of England, <lb/>
            resolved on transferring to him the duchy of Normandy, <lb/>
            and sent frequent messengers to rouse his ambition to this <lb/>
            point. Thus both parties were depraved by growing treason, <lb/>
            and, faithless to their sovereigns, engaged in conspiracies to <lb/>
            their injury. Some, breaking into open insurrection, flew <lb/>
            to arms against their loyal neighbours, and stained their <lb/>
            country's fertile soil with ravages, flames, and cruel slaugh­ <lb/>
            ters. The venerable Archbishop Anselm, and all the bishops <lb/>
            and abbots, with the clergy and the whole English people, <lb/>
            adhered firmly to their own prince, and prayed without <lb/>
            ceasing to the Lord of Sabaoth for the safety of their king <lb/>
            and the stability of his throne.1 Robert de Mellent also, <lb/>
            and many other loyal and prudent barons, maintained their <lb/>
            fealty to their lord, and supported him with their forces and <lb/>
            their counsels.</p>
          <p>Ranulph Flambard, bishop of Durham,2 was the chief <note type="footnote"> 1 It was quite natural for the Norman barons, who were daily witnesses <lb/>
            of the disorderly conduct and follies of Robert Curthose, to have <lb/>
            more sympathy for King Henry, whose yoke, as yet easy even to his own <lb/>
            subjects, could not be so heavy on them as on their neighbours over the <lb/>
            sea. But the clergy on both sides the Manche were devoted to Henry, <lb/>
            whose more regular habits and respectful conduct to the church gave no <lb/>
            offence to public decency. There was a still more powerful motive for the <lb/>
            ecclesiastics' predilection for the king; it was the severity with which he <lb/>
            administered justice and maintained order in his states, the protection he <lb/>
            gave to their persons, their property, and their revenues, against the <lb/>
            rapacity of the nobility and soldiery. In consequence of this, the English <lb/>
            barons in his reign complained of their straitened resources, and were <lb/>
            anxious for a government which, less firm, would allow them to pillage and <lb/>
            extort money at their own pleasure. </note><note type="footnote"> * For the character of this bishop, see vol. ii. pp. 466, 467. Historians are <lb/>
            not agreed either as to the Christian or surname (or rather the nick-name) <lb/>
            of this person. He is called Radulfus, Randulfus, and Ranulfus, probably <lb/>
            three forms of the same name, and Flambard, or Passeflabere. At first <lb/>
            he had been dean of the college of Twineham in Hampshire, but having <lb/>
            quarrelled with the bishop, entered the service of William Rufus, becom­ <lb/>
            ing his chaplain as early as 1088, at which time the king made him abbot <lb/>
            of Winchester. The year following, on the death of archbishop Lanfranc, <lb/>
            he was appointed to administer the revenues of that see, and in 1091, <lb/>
            those of the see of Lincoln and abbey of Chertsey were added to his <lb/>
            charge. In 1097, the number of bishoprics and abbeys entrusted to his <lb/>
            administration for the king's profit was sixteen, " which," say the Annals <lb/>
            of Winton, "he reduced to extreme poverty ... both the clergy and <lb/>

            origin, who, by his flatteries and crafty policy, had so crept <lb/>
            into the favour of William Rufus, that he was raised by <lb/>
            that king above all the nobles of the realm. Being made <lb/>
            lord high treasurer and justiciary, he brought on himself <lb/>
            the hatred and fear of numbers of the king's subjects, by <lb/>
            the cruel severities with which he performed his functions. <lb/>
            Amassing wealth and enlarging his property in all quarters, <lb/>
            he became enormously rich, and was advanced to the epis­ <lb/>
            copacy, although he was very illiterate, not for his piety, <lb/>
            but for his worldly power. But as all earthly prosperity is <lb/>
            of short duration, on the death of his patron, King William, <lb/>
            the bishop was thrown into prison by the new king as an <lb/>
            inveterate robber of his country. For the many injuries he <lb/>
            had inflicted on Henry himself and the other children of <lb/>
            the soil, both rich and poor, by which he had in various ways <lb/>
            heaped constant troubles upon them, he was, thanks to <lb/>
            divine providence which changed the current of affairs, <lb/>
            hurled from his proud elevation,' and committed to the cus­ <lb/>
            tody of William de Magnaville,2 to be confined in fetters in <lb/>
            the tower of London. But, as Ovid says, speaking of <lb/>
            Daedalus:— <lb/>

            was not from Magneville near Valognes, which was then the property of <lb/>
            the lords of Briquebec. It is also known that their Norman estates lay <lb/>
            partly in the neighbourhood of Creuli (from whence M. Delisle places <lb/>

            the crafty prelate contrived his release from prison, effecting <lb/>
            his liberation by the adroit use of his friend's assistance. <lb/>
            Indeed, he had great ability and fluency of speech, and <lb/>
            although he was cruel and passionate, such was his genero­ <lb/>
            sity and constant good humour, that he rendered himself a <lb/>
            general favourite, and was even beloved. By the king's <lb/>
            command, he was allowed every day two shillings for his <lb/>
            diet while in confinement, so that, with the assistance of <lb/>
            his friends, he fared sumptuously for a prisoner, and kept <lb/>
            daily a splendid table for himself and his keepers. One <lb/>
            day a cord was brought to the bishop in a flagon of wine, <lb/>
            and, causing a plentiful banquet to be served, the guards <lb/>
            having partaken of it in his company, washed it down with <lb/>
            Falernian cups in the highest spirits. Having intoxicated <lb/>
            them to such a degree that they slept soundly, the bishop <lb/>
            secured the cord to a mullion in the centre of the tower <lb/>
            window, and, catching up his pastoral staff, began to lower <lb/>
            himself by means of the cord. But, now, having forgotten <lb/>
            to put on gloves, his hands were excoriated to the bone by <lb/>
            the rough cord, and as it did not reach the ground, the <lb/>
            portly bishop fell, and being much bruised, groaned piteously. <lb/>
            Faithful friends and tried followers were waiting at the <lb/>
            foot of the tower, where they had swift horses in readiness <lb/>
            for him, though they were in great terror.1 Having mounted <lb/>
            on horseback with them, they fled with the utmost speed, <lb/>
            and escorted by his trusty companions, who had charge of <lb/>
            his treasure, he lost no time in hastening on shipboard, and, <lb/>
            crossing over to Normandy, presented himself to Duke <lb/>
            Robert.</p>
          <p>Flambard's mother, who was a sorceress, and had frequent <lb/>
            conferences with the devil, in the course of which accursed <lb/>
            familiarity she lost an eye, was sailing to Normandy in <lb/>
            another ship with her son's treasure, and during the voyage <lb/>
            was often exposed to the derision of the crew by her hellish <lb/>
            incantations. Meanwhile, meeting with pirates on the <lb/>
            passage, the ship was plundered of all the treasure, and the <lb/>
            sorceress, half-naked and very sorrowful, with the guards <lb/>
            and steersmen, was set on shore on the coast of Normandy. <lb/>
            The fugitive bishop, being received with welcome, was <lb/>
            entrusted with the government of the duchy; and, as far as <note type="footnote"> 1 Ranulf made his escape either on the 1st or 4th of February, 1101 ; <lb/>
            it is not certain which. </note> <pb n="282"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH.XVIII. </note> <lb/>
            his indolence permitted, Robert availed himself of his <lb/>
            counsels. His principal object was to rouse the duke to <lb/>
            engage in hostilities with his brother, using all bis'efforts to <lb/>
            exasperate him against the king. He pointed out the best <lb/>
            mode of securing the crown of England, and promised him <lb/>
            his aid under all circumstances.</p>
          <p>At length, during the autumn, Robert passed the Straits, <lb/>
            and landing in England, and being well received by the <lb/>
            illustrious and powerful persons who had joined the league <lb/>
            and were expecting him, made preparations for war with <lb/>
            the king. His fleet was vastly inferior to that with which <lb/>
            his father had invaded England, and he landed at Ports­ <lb/>
            mouth,l more by the contrivance of the traitorous conspira­ <lb/>
            tors, than by the strength of his armament. The duke was <lb/>
            immediately conducted by those peers of the realm who had <lb/>
            already done homage to him into the province of Winchester, <lb/>
            where he fixed his quarters, and, at the instance of the <lb/>
            disaffected barons, challenged his brother to battle, unless he <lb/>
            chose to abdicate his throne. Many of the nobles who had <lb/>
            hitherto kept appearances with the king, welcomed the duke <lb/>
            on his landing, and augmented his army with their troops.2 <lb/>
            Thus Robert de Belèsme, William, earl of Surrey, and <lb/>
            several more, deserted from the king's standard; while <lb/>
            many others, that they might find pretexts for leaving him, <lb/>
            preferred unjust demands, threatening that they would <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert Curthose embarked at Tréport, and landed at Portsmouth the <lb/>
            1st of August. King Henry expected him in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Hastings, that part of the coast being the point of a regular course of <lb/>
            navigation, but the duke deranged his combinations by landing at Ports­ <lb/>
            mouth, from which place he marched towards Winchester. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The English were much embarrassed in deciding to which of the two <lb/>
            brothers they should give the preference. Henry had in their eyes two <lb/>
            great advantages, that of having married the heiress of the line of their <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxon kings, and that of having been born after the Conquest, and <lb/>
            of being consequently what the Greeks of the Lower Empire called <lb/>
            Porphyrogenites. But the people of England had not yet recovered from <lb/>
            the terror of the Norman arms which the battle of Hastings had inspired. <lb/>
            Henry was compelled to have the English troops often arranged in his own <lb/>
            presence, and to teach them himself military exercises and the use of <lb/>
            arms to give them some degree of confidence on the field of battle. The <lb/>
            Norman lords, indignant at all these attentions to the sympathies and <lb/>
            wants of a conquered race, called Henry in derision Godric, and his wife <lb/>
            Goddith, or Godiva. </note> <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1101.] </note> <lb/>
            abandon his cause unless their pretensions were satisfied. <lb/>
            On the other hand Robert de Mellent, Richard de Revières, <lb/>
            and many other stout barons, rallied round their king. The <lb/>
            people of England, to a man, repudiating the claims of the <lb/>
            other prince, were firm in their loyalty to their native king, <lb/>
            and demanded to be led to battle for him.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Hugh, earl of Chester, took to his bed, and, <lb/>
            after a long illness, having taken the monastic habit in the <lb/>
            abbey founded by himself at Chester, died in the course of <lb/>
            three days, on the sixth of the calends of August [July 27].1 <lb/>
            His SOIl Richard, a young mail of handsome person, his <lb/>
            only child, by Ermentrudo, daughter of Hugh de Claremont, <lb/>
            succeeded to the earldom, which he held for nearly twelve <lb/>
            years, beloved by all. He married Matilda, daughter of <lb/>
            Stephen, count do Blois, by Adele, sister of King Henry, <lb/>
            but they both unhappily perished in the wreck of the <lb/>
            Blanche-Neuf, on the seventh of the calends of December <lb/>
            [November 27], as will be hereafter fully related.2</p>
          <p>The earl of Mellent, observing the plots and defection of <lb/>
            his countrymen, and endeavouring to keep his fealty to his <lb/>
            friend and sovereign, in adversity as well as prosperity, <lb/>
            reflected secretly with much acuteness on the state of <lb/>
            affairs, and used every exertion that the settlement of the <lb/>
            crown should not be shaken. He therefore said to the king : <lb/>
            " Every honest and just man, when he sees his friend in <lb/>
            distress, ought, if he wishes to have his faithfulness believed, <lb/>
            to employ all his efforts to succour that friend in time of <lb/>
            need. In doing this, he should look less to the future <lb/>
            reward of his services than to the means in his power for <lb/>
            rendering aid. But we see many persons acting quite other­ <lb/>
            wise, and staining their honour by a shameful breach of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Hugh Lupus, viscount of Avranches and earl of Chester, who has been <lb/>
            so often mentioned before, had brought St. Anselm to England in 1092 to <lb/>

            substituted Benedictine monks for the regular canons who had before <lb/>
            occupied it. See Monast. Anglic. i. 199. His wife was daughter of Hugh, <lb/>

            fealty they have pledged to their lord. Doubtless, this is <lb/>
            clear enough, and it causes us the most poignant inward <lb/>
            pain. We, however, to whom the care of the commonwealth <lb/>
            is divinely committed, ought to look well to the safety of <lb/>
            the realm and the church of God. It should be our chief <lb/>
            concern, that, by God's grace, we may live in peace, gain <lb/>
            the victory without the effusion of Christian blood, and that <lb/>
            the loyal people may live in the enjoyment of a state of <lb/>
            tranquillity. Now, then, my lord king, listen to my advice, <lb/>
            and condescend to follow my counsels. Speak graciously to <lb/>
            all your knights; caress them as a father does his children ; <lb/>
            soothe them with promises, granting their requests, and in <lb/>
            this manner adroitly conciliate the attachment of all your <lb/>
            adherents. If they should even ask for London or York, <lb/>
            do not hesitate to make magnificent promises, befitting a <lb/>
            royal liberality. It is better to give away a small portion of <lb/>
            the kingdom, than, by making a number of enemies, to lose <lb/>
            both victory and life. When, however, we get happily to <lb/>
            the end of this affair, by God's help, useful advice can be <lb/>
            given as to reclaiming the domains which treasonable <lb/>
            deserters may have usurped during the war. It is certain <lb/>
            that whoever voluntarily deserts his lord when in peril of <lb/>
            his life, and attaches himself to another for love of gain, or <lb/>
            makes a market to his king of the military service which he <lb/>
            is bound to give freely for the defence of the realm, and <lb/>
            attempts to rob him of his royal domains, should in the <lb/>
            eyes of justice and equity be considered a traitor, and, <lb/>
            incurring the forfeiture of his hereditary estates, be driven <lb/>
            into exile.”1</p>
          <p>All the great men who were present approved the earl's <lb/>
            discourse and advised the king to follow his advice. Henry, <lb/>
            who was endowed with great sagacity, thanked his faithful <lb/>
            counsellors and fully acquiesced in their prudent recom­ <lb/>
            mendation. He therefore conciliated by promises and gifts <lb/>
            many of the lords whose fidelity was suspected. At length, <lb/>
            he advanced with a powerful army to meet his brother, <lb/>
            sending envoys to him with instructions to demand dis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Although it is impossible to vouch for the authenticity of this discourse, <lb/>
            its tenor is quite in harmony with what we know of the very relaxed <lb/>
            notions of honour entertained both by Robert de Mellent and his sovereign. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            tinctly for what reason he dared to enter England at the head <lb/>
            of armed troops. Robert sent the following answer by his <lb/>
            own messengers: " I have come to the kingdom of my father, <lb/>
            in company with my barons, to claim it as my own by right <lb/>
            of primo-geniture."</p>
          <p>The two brothers pitched their camps near each other for <lb/>
            some days on a certain level tract,1 and interchanged <lb/>
            messengers by noble envoys. The turbulent traitors <lb/>
            desired war rather than peace, and looking more to their <lb/>
            private advantage than the public good, their wily emissaries <lb/>
            perverted the words of the princes, and promoted strife <lb/>
            rather than concord between the brothers. The wise <lb/>
            Henry soon discovered this, and in consequence sought a <lb/>
            conference with his brother face to face, and on their meet­ <lb/>
            in-- both felt the gentle influence of brotherly affection. <lb/>
            Their numerous troops formed a magnificent circle round <lb/>
            them, displaying the terrible but brilliant spectacle of the <lb/>
            Normans and English under arms. The two brothers met <lb/>
            unattended in the centre and conversed together in the <lb/>
            presence of the troops, and while all eyes were fixed upon <lb/>
            them, they gave free vent to the thoughts of their hearts <lb/>
            by words of sincerity. After a short conversation they <lb/>
            embraced each other with loving kisses, and were reconciled <lb/>
            without reserve. I cannot insert here the words used at <lb/>
            this conference, not having been present at it, but I have <lb/>
            learnt from what I heard the results of this meeting of the <lb/>
            illustrious brothers.</p>
          <p>Imprimis, Duke Robert renounced the claim which he had <lb/>
            preferred to the crown of England in favour of his brother, <lb/>
            and released him, in consideration of his royal dignity, from <lb/>
            the homage he had paid him a long while before. On his <lb/>
            part, King Henry engaged to pay his brother yearly three <lb/>
            thousand pounds sterling, and ceded to him the whole <lb/>
            county of Coutances and all his other possessions in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, except Damfront. He retained the castle of Dam­ <lb/>
            front only, because he had pledged his oath to the people <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Wace, whose authority is somewhat doubtful, the two <lb/>
            brothers met in a forest district called Hantone (Hampton), probably near <lb/>
            Hampton Court. It may be that Robert Curthose marched in this direction <lb/>
            in consequence of having learnt that his sister-in-law had not recovered <lb/>
            from the effects of childbirth at Winchester, at which city it was his <lb/>
            original design to take up his position. </note> <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH.XVIII. </note> <lb/>
            there, when they gave him admission, never to let the place <lb/>
            pass out of his own hands, nor to change their laws and <lb/>
            customs. The brothers agreed on the articles of their <lb/>
            treaty without the intervention of any umpires, and, in the <lb/>
            sight of all those who formed the circle round them and <lb/>
            beheld them with admiration, resolved that they would <lb/>
            mutually aid each other as brothers should, that they would <lb/>
            recover all the territories possessed by their father, and would <lb/>
            punish on both sides, those who had infamously sown <lb/>
            dissension between them.1</p>
          <p>Peace being thus concluded, the traitors were covered <lb/>
            with confusion, and became contemptible even to those on <lb/>
            whom they had lavished their Batteries, being compelled in <lb/>
            disgrace and pale with fear to fly from the presence of the <lb/>
            king. The loyal commons, devoted to their honest labours, <lb/>
            were clamorous with joy, and the armed troops were dis­ <lb/>
            banded by the king's licence and returned rejoicing to their <lb/>
            respective abodes. The whole realm of England enjoyed <lb/>
            the still delight of renewed tranquillity, and the church of <lb/>
            God, flourishing during a long season of repose, exhibited <lb/>
            the beauty of the divine law, and rendered its service to God <lb/>
            in security, undisturbed by the clash of arms.</p>
          <p>The truth of our account is evidenced by the number of <lb/>
            new churches and chantries recently erected in the villages <lb/>
            of England, as well as by the cloistered buildings of the <lb/>
            abbeys and other monastic offices constructed during King <lb/>
            Henry's reign. For all the religious orders, being in the <lb/>
            enjoyment of peace and prosperity, rivalled each other in <lb/>
            manifesting their zeal in all that belongs to the worship of <lb/>
            the omnipotent Deity, both internally and externally. In <lb/>
            the fervour of their devotion the faithful undertook to demo­ <lb/>
            lish the temples and habitations that they might substitute <lb/>
            for them edifices on a better scale. The buildings which <lb/>
            were erected in the times of Edgar, Edward, and other Chris­ <lb/>
            tian kings, were therefore levelled to the ground, that they <lb/>

            Duke Robert spent two months with his brother the <lb/>
            king, and then, as winter approached, returned to Normandy <lb/>
            loaded with royal gifts, and taking with him William de <lb/>
            Warrenne and several others who had been disinherited for <lb/>
            their share in his enterprise.</p>
          <p>A short time afterwards Gilbert, surnamed Maminot,1 the <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux 2 died in the month of August at an <lb/>
            advanced age, upon which Fulcher, the brother of Flambard <lb/>
            was consecrated bishop of that see by William the archbishop <lb/>
            in the month of June. Being almost illiterate, he had to <lb/>
            thank his brother's interest for pushing him forward from <lb/>
            attendance at court to become a bishop. However his mu­ <lb/>
            nificence was commendable; and having filled the see only <lb/>
            seven months, he died in January following. Then Ralph <lb/>
            Flambard, who lived in Normandy, a banished man, and was <lb/>
            deprived of his bishopric of Durham by the king's hatred of <lb/>
            him, obtained the see of Lisieux for his son Thomas a mere <lb/>
            child, governing it himself for three years, not as a bishop <lb/>
            but as a provost. Meanwhile William de Pact bought the <note type="footnote"> I Gilbert Maminot, bishop of Lisieux, has been often mentioned in the <lb/>

            the name of his son Thomas, he stipulated that in case of that son's death <lb/>
            he should be replaced by one of his other children. This scandal only <lb/>
            lasted three years, at the end of which the duke, on the remonstrances of <lb/>
            the archbishop of Rouen and the neighbouring bishops, resolved at last to <lb/>
            put an end to it. Still the see of Lisieux did not yet find the end of its <lb/>
            misfortunes, nor escape from the toils of Ranulf. William, archdeacon of <lb/>
            Lisieux, was at first elected bishop; a good choice, but the archbishop was <lb/>
            suspended from his functions, and none of the suffragans would undertake <lb/>
            to perform them. Upon this, Ranulf presented one of his clerks named <lb/>
            William de Paci, who was rejected for simony. After the battle of Tin­ <lb/>
            chebrai, Hervey, bishop of Bangor, wished to exchange his see for that of </note> <pb n="288"/>

            being condemned for his simony, first at Rouen and afterwards <lb/>
            at Rome, he paid dearly for his presumption. Thus Lisieux <lb/>
            was without a guide for nearly five years, and the Lord's flock, <lb/>
            having no worthy pastor, became a prey to ravening wolves, <lb/>

            places, exercise their valour and skill in arms against the <lb/>
            Turks. Many were compelled to the crusade by the terrors <lb/>
            of the apostolical censure, for Pope Paschal had excommuni­ <lb/>
            cated and cut off from the Christian privileges all those who, <lb/>
            having voluntarily taken the cross, had returned without <lb/>
            accomplishing their enterprise, unless they engaged a second <lb/>

            the enterprise to make him shrink from undergoing such <lb/>

            and another Stephen who was son of Richelde,1 hastened to <lb/>
            assume the cross in company with a great body of the war­ <lb/>
            riors of Burgundy. Likewise, the archbishop of Milan and <lb/>
            Albert de Blandrai, the most powerful of the Italian <lb/>
            nobles,' put themselves en route for Jerusalem with Ligu­ <lb/>
            rian troops. All these crusaders, having undertaken the <lb/>
            pilgrimage for the love of God, on reaching Macedonia sent <lb/>
            envoys to the emperor Alexius demanding a free passage <lb/>
            through his dominions and the liberty of marketing for <lb/>
            supplies.</p>
          <p>The crafty emperor was greatly alarmed when he heard of <lb/>
            the approach of so powerful a Western army, and prudently <lb/>
            flattered their pride by readily granting all that they re­ <lb/>
            quired. Having had frequent experience of the daring valour <lb/>
            of the Cisalpine troops under Guiscard and Bohemond, <lb/>
            he took every precaution against giving the crusaders <lb/>
            umbrage and provoking hostilities. For this reason he <lb/>
            granted them a free passage through his territories and <lb/>
            liberally acquiesced in all the demands they made. After <lb/>
            loading the chiefs with munificent presents, he caused the <lb/>
            whole army to be conducted in safety as far as Cappadocia, <lb/>
            which is beyond Constantinople. There they mustered all <lb/>
            the Western people, and found that the force amounted to <lb/>
            fifty thousand fighting men.</p>
          <p>Having consulted well-informed persons on the route they <lb/>
            were to take, they took precautions for avoiding the dangers <lb/>

            consultations, and they talked of them among each other in <lb/>
            such language as the following : " Thus far we have been in <lb/>
            security, having had to do with our brethren with whose <lb/>
            habits and language we are familiar. From the hour we <lb/>
            left our own homes till the present we have travelled through <lb/>
            Christian countries where we have been well received for <lb/>
            the love of the Father Almighty. Now a different lot <lb/>
            awaits us. The storm of war is fiercely raging between the <lb/>
            emperor and Bohemond who commands at Antioch. The <lb/>
            regions which we have to traverse are a waste, through <lb/>
            which the Turks make frequent irruptions towards the sea- <lb/>
            coast, breathing slaughter on all who bear the Christian name <lb/>
            as naturally as wolves thirst for the blood of the flocks. Let us <lb/>
            humbly implore Almighty God to protect us in the great dan­ <lb/>
            gers which surround us on every side. We leave in our rear <lb/>
            this faithless emperor and his people, with great reason to <lb/>
            suspect them of treachery. On our right is the sea in which <lb/>
            lie Crete, Cyprus, the far-famed Rhodes, and many other <lb/>
            islands, all which owe allegiance to the emperor, and detest <lb/>
            us for the misconduct of those of our countrymen who have <lb/>
            proceeded us. To the east and north, the country is occu­ <lb/>
            pied to the extremity of the globe by barbarous nations who <lb/>
            are inflamed with insatiable ardour to shed Christian blood. <lb/>
            The march to Antioch will take more than thirty days, <lb/>
            through deserts in which we shall find no means of subsist­ <lb/>
            ence as the fertile spots have been left uncultivated in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the long wars between the emperor and Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond. Environed by so many perils, what are we to do ? <lb/>
            All is desolation around."</p>
          <p>At length1 the duke of Poitiers, having listened with atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the various opinions which were offered, said to the <lb/>
            council: " Let us despatch envoys to the emperor with our <lb/>
            unanimous request that he will send us the count of <lb/>
            St. Giles with our Saviour's holy spear; for he will lead us <lb/>
            in safety through these unknown countries to the tomb of <lb/>
            our Lord. The count has great wisdom, and his influence is <lb/>
            powerful; in the first expedition he was considered on all <lb/>
            occasions as one of the most distinguished of the crusaders. <note type="footnote"> 1 Many of our author's details connected with this crusade are fabulous. <lb/>

            His personal knowledge of the difficulties of the march will <lb/>
            supply our inexperience, and his proved valour has been <lb/>
            long known both to Christians and Pagans. If we have him <lb/>
            at our head as our Maro1 and counsellor, we shall obtain <lb/>
            security with respect to the emperor, and he will take wise <lb/>
            precautions against the infidels."</p>
          <p>Envoys were accordingly dispatched by common consent, <lb/>
            who with much eloquence laid before the emperor the object <lb/>
            of their mission; and after listening to the message of the <lb/>
            Italian chiefs, he reported it without delay to Count Ray­ <lb/>
            mond. His reply was as follows : " By God's grace, through <lb/>
            many perils, I devoted all my powers to the recovery of <lb/>
            Jerusalem; but now, feeling the burden of years and im­ <lb/>
            paired by my exertions, I wish to spend the rest of my days <lb/>
            in tranquillity. For this purpose, my lord emperor, I <lb/>
            sought an asylum at the court of your majesty. Excuse <lb/>
            me then, I pray you, and do not force me to engage in <lb/>
            another expedition." The emperor then communicated his <lb/>
            reply to the ambassadors : " I have entreated," he said, " the <lb/>
            court of St. Giles to join your company, but he alleges that <lb/>
            his age and infirmities will not allow him to take part in the <lb/>
            enterprise. Go forward, relying on peace with us. As to <lb/>
            the illustrious count who has placed himself under the pro­ <lb/>
            tection of our majesty, I cannot send him away, for I have <lb/>
            not the right to do so."</p>
          <p>The envoys immediately returned and reported what they <lb/>
            had heard. As it caused great perturbation, and the chiefs <lb/>
            vented their thoughts in various murmurs, William of <lb/>
            Poitiers thus addressed them : " Let us instantly fly to arms <lb/>
            and, by a counter march, lay siege to Constantinople; and <lb/>
            stoutly assaulting the city, we will not draw off till we either <lb/>
            put to death this perfidious emperor, or wring from him, <lb/>
            however reluctantly, what we demand. He has brought <lb/>
            destruction on thousands of the faithful by his treacheries, <lb/>
            and I think therefore that he who by any means shall take <lb/>
            the life of one whose occupation of the country is the cause <lb/>
            of so much loss, will offer a sacrifice acceptable to God."</p>

            rate counsels did not acquiesce in this proposal, which they <lb/>
            joined in opposing, alleging arguments founded on right <lb/>
            reason. However, the Aquitanians and Gascons, with other <lb/>
            insubordinate troops, preferring to be led by juvenile <lb/>
            imprudence, supported the rash proposal of the young duke. <lb/>
            They therefore returned by a hasty march, and sat down <lb/>
            before Byzantium for three days. The emperor, when he first <lb/>
            heard of their design, was disposed to treat it lightly, con­ <lb/>
            sidering the vast population of his capital, and that it was <lb/>
            fortified by triple lines of circumvallation. But finding that <lb/>
            they persisted in their enterprise, he commanded three <lb/>
            most savage lions and seven leopards to be let loose in the <lb/>
            area between the two exterior walls. He also posted guards <lb/>
            on the third w all, to which the palaces of the nobles in the <lb/>
            interior of the place adjoined, and caused the gates to be <lb/>
            firmly closed, thinking thus, in scorn, to deter the Franks <lb/>
            from their attack through fear of the wild beasts, and defend <lb/>
            the imperial city without employing human means. But <lb/>
            the crafty wiles of man are fruitless when they are not <lb/>
            aided by Divine Providence. The Franks, after standing to <lb/>
            arms in their camp, seeing that there was no show of resist­ <lb/>
            ance, entered the outer gate eager for conflict, and searched <lb/>
            with enquiring eyes on all sides for the defenders of their <lb/>
            country. However, no sooner had they entered than the <lb/>
            fierce lions unexpectedly attacked their foremost ranks with <lb/>
            great rage, and tearing them with their fangs and claws, <lb/>
            severely wounded some of the troops, unaccustomed as they <lb/>
            were to encounter wild beasts.1</p>
          <p>But such a contest with the skill of man could not last <lb/>
            long. The soldiers transfixed the lions with spears and <lb/>
            darts, and having destroyed the lions, drove off the leopards, <lb/>
            pursuing them to the foot of the middle wall, which the <lb/>
            leopards crossed, creeping up them like cats. The Franks <lb/>
            passed through the gate in this second wall, and made a <lb/>
            bold assault on the third. The citizens now raised loud <lb/>
            cries, and there was horrible confusion, all the people run­ <lb/>
            ning together and not knowing what they should do in this <note type="footnote"> I We find Ordericus occasionally unscrupulous in the use of the mate­ <lb/>

            sudden emergency. The emperor hearing the noise of this <lb/>
            unexpected attack was struck with terror, lamenting the. <lb/>
            failure of his false hopes. At last he sent a suppliant <lb/>
            message to the noble pilgrims, and contriving to soothe their <lb/>
            wrath by a variety of promises, induced them to draw off from <lb/>
            the assault of his capital, the defence of which they were on <lb/>
            the point of carrying by storm.</p>
          <p>While the victorious Franks returned to their tents, the <lb/>
            sorrowful emperor summoned the count of Tholouse to his <lb/>
            presence, and in his grief and utter dismay thus addressed <lb/>
            him: " Illustrious count, I have recourse to you in great <lb/>
            tribulation and ask your advice, what is to be done in this <lb/>
            most unexpected disaster. The insolence of the Franks <lb/>
            has led them to make an audacious attack on the imperial <lb/>
            city, the capital of the East. They have violated the dig­ <lb/>
            nity of the holy empire and reduced me to become a <lb/>
            suppliant to prevent the worst. They have shed the blood <lb/>
            of my faithful subjects, and provoked the wrath of Divine <lb/>
            Providence. The imperial majesty, which used to give laws <lb/>
            both to the natives and foreigners, is now, alas ! compelled <lb/>
            to submit to conditions imposed by insolent pilgrims." <lb/>
            Count Raymond replied: " My countrymen are well prac­ <lb/>
            tised in such assaults, and I well know their fierce attacks <lb/>
            under such circumstances against their own neighbours. <lb/>
            Your majesty's wisdom does not require the aid of long <lb/>
            explanations. You must lose no time in making terms with <lb/>
            this daring host. The public interest requires it; but, if I <lb/>
            mistake not, it will cost the lives of many of them. These <lb/>
            audacious Gascons demand that I shall join their expedition, <lb/>
            they would insolently make me a pilgrim whether I am <lb/>
            willing or not. <lb/>
            "They'll rue the day they urged the rash design.”1</p>
          <p>I deeply grieve, mighty emperor, the affront offered to the <lb/>
            holy empire; but at present I will not give utterance to <lb/>
            all that is passing in my mind. A time for vengeance will <lb/>
            come when these miscreants will have to expiate their out­ <lb/>
            rageous offence. Behold, the walls of Constantinople are <lb/>
            reeking with the blood of her sons; a spectacle which, shame <lb/>
            to say, we have now before our eyes." <note type="footnote"> 1 Non impune ferent, ausis quod lalibus Alerent. </note></p><pb n="295"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 1102.] </note> Such was the nature of the conference between the <lb/>
            emperor and the count, and they contrived measures by <lb/>
            which they would avenge themselves on the enemy for the <lb/>
            annoyance they had caused. Alexius made choice of illus­ <lb/>
            trious envoys, and sent them to the Franks to guarantee <lb/>
            his engagements by their oaths, and convey humble sup­ <lb/>
            plications that the army would peaceably withdraw and wait <lb/>
            for the arrival of the count in Cappadocia with twenty <lb/>
            thousand Turcopoles. Having received the promise of <lb/>
            the emperor ratified on oath, the Franks withdrew, and <lb/>
            rested for a while, preparing for their march. The count <lb/>
            followed them a few days afterwards, and the emperor <lb/>
            despatched, ships loaded with tartarons, and commanded them <lb/>
            to be distributed among all the troops in the army according <lb/>
            to their order and rank. The Thracians call tartarons the <lb/>
            square copper coins which the inhabitants of Thrace and <lb/>
            Bithynia use in traffic like philips or bezants. The needy <lb/>
            pilgrims received with eagerness the emperor's bounty, not <lb/>
            suspecting the perfidy and deep policy of that worst of <lb/>
            traitors. The crafty spy by this contrivance counted their <lb/>
            force, reckoning the numbers of the receivers by the sum of <lb/>
            money he gave to each. He then sent an account of their <lb/>
            numerical force to Daliman, Soliman, and the rest of the <lb/>
            Turkish chiefs, exhorting them to assemble the whole <lb/>
            strength of paganism and attack them in Paphlagonia.</p>
          <p>Our countrymen, not suspecting any fraud, and exulting <lb/>
            at being joined by the count, commenced their march with <lb/>
            the Turcopoles in the van, who were acquainted with the <lb/>
            language and manners of the Getes, as well as the roads; <lb/>
            but the Franks were led astray, and after wandering about <lb/>
            and surmounting great difficulties, reached a large city of <lb/>
            the barbarians called Gandras. In short, they left entirely <lb/>
            on their right the road leading through Romania and Syria <lb/>
            to Jerusalem, and turned aside through Pontus, formerly the <lb/>
            kingdom of Mithridates, who ruled over twenty kings, until <lb/>
            at length, marching northward, they entered Paphlagonia. <lb/>
            I am not sufficiently informed whether the count of St. Giles <lb/>
            thus deviated from the direct road by mistake, or whether <lb/>
            he led his allies astray vindictively to satisfy his malice. <lb/>
            The Christians having crossed a rough country, with dan­ <lb/>
            gerous rivers and imperviable forests, and at last arrived at <pb n="296"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH.XIX. </note> <lb/>
            Gandras after a three weeks' journey, they resolved to rest <lb/>
            there for a time after their great fatigues. Then, however, <lb/>
            a multitude of Pagans, innumerable as the sands of the sea, <lb/>
            fell on them when they little expected it, and weary as they <lb/>
            were with severe toil. The barbarians, on their side, brought <lb/>
            with them their wives, their flocks and herds, and dragged <lb/>
            along great stores of wealth in waggons, in order to guard <lb/>
            carefully the mass of their substance in person, and display­ <lb/>
            ing their riches to their enemies as well as their friends <lb/>
            and countrymen, strike terror into all who witnessed their <lb/>
            abundance; and, in short, to show that whether at home or at <lb/>
            war they revelled in all kind of delights. Meanwhile the <lb/>
            Christians, although exhausted by hunger and thirst and <lb/>
            other privations, when they began to be pressed by the <lb/>
            enemy's attack, forgot their past sufferings, and flying to <lb/>
            arms with renewed strength and courage, formed their <lb/>
            ranks, and fought manfully in the name of God for five <lb/>
            days. As pilgrims worthy of credit have informed me, there <lb/>
            were assembled fifty thousand Christians, and they were <lb/>
            fiercely attacked, if I mistake not, by a million of pagans. <lb/>
            The conflict was maintained with the utmost vigour on both <lb/>
            sides, and many thousands fell. On the fifth day, the Turks <lb/>
            finding their squdrons weakened, and utterly dismayed at <lb/>
            the invincible courage of the Christians, received general <lb/>
            orders to direct their wives, who remained in their tents, <lb/>
            with the eunuchs and other domestics who had the care of <lb/>
            the valuables belonging to the chiefs, to privately pack all <lb/>
            their household effects, and the rest of the wealth, so that they <lb/>
            might be prepared for a hasty retreat from the presence of <lb/>
            the enemy the ensuing night. The Christians, however, <lb/>
            not having discovered that the Turkish troops were giving <lb/>
            way, shamefully retreated themselves ; for night coming on, <lb/>
            count Raymond with the imperial Turcopoles and provincial <lb/>
            troops, fell to the rear, and commenced their flight stealthily <lb/>
            without communicating with the other chiefs. The count's <lb/>
            squire, finding this, struck his lord's pavilion, in compas­ <lb/>
            sionate consideration for the Christian army, that the com­ <lb/>
            rades he had betrayed might learn his flight. Albert de <lb/>
            Blandrai, a very brave knight, was slain in the battle, with <lb/>
            many thousand of the Franks, but I am not informed of the <lb/>
            exact number.</p><pb n="297"/>

            other chiefs, with their followers, being apprised of the <lb/>

            panic, and losing all command of themselves, thought only <lb/>
            of escaping by various roads. Meanwhile, the Turks, <lb/>
            although they had been so nearly overpowered that they were <lb/>
            meditating flight themselves, finding that the Franks were <lb/>
            departed, regained their courage, and pursuing the enemy <lb/>
            fell on their rear and cut down many thousands of the <lb/>
            fugitives. Some of them who were in the prime of youth <lb/>
            were carried off into captivity; nearly forty thousand Chris­ <lb/>
            tians suffered bodily death. May they live spiritually in <lb/>
            eternal rest with Christ, in whose cause they fell! 1</p>
          <p>The count of Tholouse, with his own followers, and the <lb/>
            Turcopoles continued their flight to Constantinople, and <lb/>
            reported the lamentable disaster of the Christians to the <lb/>
            emperor's great satisfaction. Moreover, Daliman and Soli­ <lb/>
            man and the other chiefs of the hostile race triumphed in <lb/>
            the pomp of victory and restored to Alexius the whole <lb/>
            amount of tartarons which he had perfidiously distributed <lb/>
            among the Christians under colour of charity, besides send­ <lb/>
            ing him one half of all the booty they had taken from their <lb/>
            defeated enemies. Such was the agreement which that false <lb/>
            traitor had made with the Turks, and such the terms on <lb/>
            which he sold the faithful to the infidels; and he gloried <lb/>
            in his cunning as he recovered the vast sum of tartarons, <lb/>
            the price of his treachery.</p>
          <p>The illustrious dukes of Aquitaine and Burgundy and <lb/>
            other brave knights made their escape from the slaughter, <lb/>
            and concealed themselves in dens and caverns and thick <lb/>
            woods as opportunity offered. In those regions Syrians <lb/>
            and Armenians dwelt among the barbarians, their habi­ <lb/>
            tations being scattered through the country, and were under <lb/>
            subjection to the Turks, paying an annual tribute to pur­ <lb/>
            chase peace and security; but although tried by persecutions <lb/>

            sustained by the crusaders, and sympathizing in their <lb/>
            sufferings, as brothers, they lent them all the services of <lb/>
            humanity as far as fear of their infidel tyrants permitted. <lb/>
            Concealing the fugitives in their secret retreats, and supply­ <lb/>
            ing them with food, they took advantage of the darkness of <lb/>
            the night to put them on the road to Antioch, conducting <lb/>
            them in safety to the territories of neighbours and country­ <lb/>
            men in whom they could trust. Many were dragged into <lb/>
            captivity by the barbarians among unknown countries, and <lb/>
            retained for some time in servitude or bonds among a people <lb/>
            whose language they did not understand. There, serving <lb/>
            the most High God aright, they experienced his mercy, and <lb/>
            were succoured by him in various ways, like the Israelites <lb/>
            among the Assyrians or Chaldeans. In consequence, many <lb/>
            returned from captivity either by making their escape or by <lb/>
            permission of the princes in Persia and other nations.</p>
          <p>With the assistance of the merciful Creator, who is near <lb/>
            to all who love him, about a hundred thousand of the <lb/>
            Christians accomplished their escape, some of whom retraced <lb/>
            their steps through Illyrium and others pursued their journey <lb/>
            surrounded by alarms and difficulties. The duke of Poitiers <lb/>
            who left the Limousin at the head of three hundred thousand <lb/>
            armed men, and had struck terror into the emperor by his <lb/>
            too daring assault of Constantinople, with great difficulty <lb/>
            reached Antioch, with only six companions, and reduced to <lb/>
            poverty and want. Other chiefs of the crusaders, and gallant <lb/>
            counts and officers lost all their troops, and, separated from <lb/>
            their attached followers and stripped of their wealth, were <lb/>
            exposed to utter desolation in the midst of barbarism. <lb/>
            Reanimated, however, by their consistancy in the true faith <lb/>
            and their love of the merciful Jesus, they hastened to his <lb/>
            tomb, and although, in the mysterious providence of God <lb/>
            they were retarded by many obstacles, yet, with hearts <lb/>
            cheered by the spiritual nectar, they shrunk from no toils on <lb/>
            their pilgrimage to the holy places, to become partakers in <lb/>
            blood with the blessed martyrs, who having shed it for Christ <lb/>
            are crowned with the laurels of triumph in the heavens.</p><pb n="299"/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XX. Death of Godfrey, king of Jerusalem—He is suc­ ceeded by Baldwin—Stephen of Blois arrives at Jerusalem —The duke of Poitiers returns to France.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>GODFREY, king of Jerusalem, reigned only two years,1 <lb/>
            during which he was almost always in arms against the <lb/>
            Philistines, and sustained by his great courage enlarged the <lb/>
            boundaries of his kingdom. The native Gentiles observed <lb/>
            a doubtful peace in their towns and villages, and did not <lb/>
            even dare to whisper in public a word against the Christians. <lb/>
            But, filled with sorrow, they secretly plotted the ruin of <lb/>
            their new lords, watching cunningly for an opportunity of <lb/>
            effecting their purpose. At last the citizens of Joppa con­ <lb/>
            trived to poison King Godfrey3 during his abode there, and <lb/>
            thus cut off that glorious prince to the great sorrow of the <lb/>
            Christians. He was the first Christian prince, from the <lb/>
            time of our Saviour's suffering on our behalf at Jerusalem, <lb/>
            who wore a diadem there, to the praise of him who, for the <lb/>
            salvation of men, condescended to wear a crown of thorns; <lb/>
            being compelled by ecclesiastical election to accept the title <lb/>
            of King of Jerusalem,3 that he might be a terror to the <lb/>
            Gentiles. Having perished in the manner I described, <lb/>
            measures were immediately taken for appointing a successor. <lb/>
            The king's death was announced to his brother Baldwin, <lb/>
            and he was invited to accept the crown of Jerusalem in the <lb/>
            place of Godfrey. Entrusting without loss of time the <lb/>
            government of his principality to his cousin Baldwin de <lb/>
            Burg,4 he himself traversed hostile countries and barbarous <lb/>
            tribes with the speed of lightning. At Sarepta, a city of <lb/>
            the Sidonians, he encountered a host of nearly forty thou­ <lb/>
            sand pagans, and charging them manfully at the head of a <lb/>
            small number of troops, they were miraculously struck with <note type="footnote"> 1 That is from the 25th of June, 1099, to the 17th of July, 1100. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This charge is quite gratuitous. Godfrey was labouring under severe <lb/>
            illness when he arrived at Joppa, insomuch that he could not any longer <lb/>
            ride on horseback. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Our author makes here another grave mistake. It is well known that <lb/>
            Godfrey expressly refused to assume the title of king, or to wear a crown <lb/>
            or any other ensigns of royal dignity in the city where our Saviour wore a <lb/>
            crown of thorns. It is difficult to say what Ordericus means by " ecclesi­ <lb/>
            astical election." Godfrey owed his elevation to the choice of the brave <lb/>
            chiefs of the crusaders. </note><note type="footnote"> * Baldwin de Burg, second son of Hugh, count de Retel. </note> <pb n="300"/>

            panic, and Baldwin, by God's help, put them all to flight, <lb/>
            and continued his journey to Jerusalem in triumph. The <lb/>
            Turks, apprized of his approach, had posted their troops <lb/>
            under arms in all ambuscade on his road, promising them­ <lb/>
            selves signal success; but their ill-founded hopes were <lb/>
            foiled, and those who were able to escape returned to their <lb/>
            homes in confusion, with loss and disgrace.</p>
          <p>The prince of whom I am speaking, being well received <lb/>
            by the people of Jerusalem, ascended the throne of David, <lb/>
            and maintained himself on it with vigour for nearly twelve <lb/>
            years.1 Baldwin was personally handsome, of lofty stature, <lb/>
            distinguished for daring courage, indefatigable in the most <lb/>
            toilsome enterprises, well imbued with learning, an accom­ <lb/>
            plished speaker, and endowed with many virtues. During <lb/>
            his reign, Stephen of Blois and the other chiefs of whom I <lb/>
            have spoken, arrived at Jerusalem after many disasters, and <lb/>
            were honourably received by King Baldwin and Ebremar <lb/>
            the patriarch.2 The duke of Poitiers, having performed his <lb/>

            perity he made the sufferings he had undergone during his <lb/>
            captivity a subject for amusement among kings, and nobles, <lb/>
            and Christian assemblies, descanting on them in rhyming <lb/>
            verses to merry tunes. On the contrary, Stephen of Blois <lb/>
            and several other crusaders remained in Judea for the love <lb/>
            of Christ, resolved to consecrate their strength and valour <lb/>
            to his service, waiting for the attack of the king of Babylon, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>INTELLIGENCE being received that there was no doubt the <lb/>
            emir' of Babylon had reached Ascalon, and was resolved to <lb/>
            attack the Christians the next day with a large force, King <lb/>
            Baldwin, and Stephen, and the rest of the faithful encou­ <lb/>
            raged each other in the Lord Jesus, and devoutly armed <lb/>
            themselves in his name either for a glorious victory or fatal <lb/>
            end. Part of the army was detached to Joppa, while the <lb/>
            king and most of the nobles marched to Ramla, being averse <lb/>
            to be shut up in Jerusalem, and not knowing what place the <lb/>
            Turks would first attack. At last the emir, by a sudden <lb/>
            movement, invested Ramla with an immense force, assault­ <lb/>
            ing the walls with missile weapons and various engines of <lb/>
            war, and endeavouring to sap them by trenching and <lb/>
            mining. There were some brave knights in the place, but <lb/>
            their numbers were small, and their strength was not sum­ <lb/>
            cient to resist such vast numbers. In consequence, Stephen <lb/>
            and Harpin, and William Sans-Avoir,2 with some others, <lb/>
            persuaded the king to depart for Jerusalem with the utmost <lb/>
            despatch. "Hasten," they said, " brave king, to return to <lb/>
            the holy city, lest it should be beset by this immense army <lb/>
            while it has no protector, and the mother and her children <lb/>
            perish by a sudden assault. We are here blockaded in a <lb/>
            similar manner, and expect assuredly that our end is at <lb/>
            hand in the confession of Christ, imploring our Creator <lb/>
            from the depth of our hearts that we may become his true <lb/>
            martyrs, and being cleansed from all our sins by shedding <lb/>
            our blood in his name, be admitted in company with the <lb/>
            saints to behold his face beaming with mercy on ourselves. <lb/>
            Farewell, good king; sally forth without delay, although <lb/>
            the passage through such hosts of fierce enemies is perilous, <lb/>
            unless you are attended by God's mercy."</p>
          <p>The anxious barons, addressing the king in these words <lb/>
            and others of the same kind, compelled him to escape from <lb/>
            one danger by incurring another still greater. Godfrey <note type="footnote"> 1 Admirabilis ; a curious perversion of the oriental title. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mentioned before, p. 75, with his uncle Walter de Poissi, and his <lb/>

            with great reluctance submitted to the advice of these <lb/>
            renowned warriors, and mounting a swift and powerful <lb/>
            mare, called Farise,' he left Ramla in the night, and attended <lb/>
            by a single trooper, by the protection of God passed through <lb/>
            the enemy's troops unmolested. He had got beyond the <lb/>
            camp while it was still dark, and was making his way <lb/>
            towards Jerusalem by by-paths when the sentinels who were <lb/>
            on the watch, finding that some strange soldiers had passed, <lb/>
            gave the alarm, and rousing the troops, pursued the fugi­ <lb/>
            tives for two miles with cries and yells. The king, however, <lb/>
            being well acquainted with the by-roads, by God's help, <lb/>
            made his escape unhurt, although with the utmost diffi­ <lb/>
            culty ; for he was obliged to leave in his alarm the <lb/>
            mountain track to Jerusalem on which he had entered, and <lb/>
            by crossing some precipitous heights with great toil, reached <lb/>
            a town called Arsur,2 where he found the guards watching <lb/>
            in great trepidation. He immediately addressed them, and <lb/>
            begged them to admit him, but met with a repulse; for the <lb/>
            warders, although he repeated, " I am Baldwin—you have <lb/>
            nothing to fear; admit me among you," were so terrified <lb/>
            at the various stratagems practised by the enemy that they <lb/>
            would not believe him until they had kindled a fire on the <lb/>
            walls, and on his taking off his helmet his features were recog­ <lb/>
            nized. They then opened the gate with joy, and entering <lb/>
            the place, he encouraged the garrison, and telling them the <lb/>
            state of affairs, exhorted them to defend the place.</p>
          <p>The king then mounted his gazelle,3 and with his fellow <lb/>
            soldiers rode with all speed to Joppa. Being well known <lb/>
            there, the townsmen admitted him without hesitation, and <lb/>
            he communicated to them the disastrous state of affairs. <lb/>
            " Countless hordes of pagans," he said, " are besieging <lb/>
            Ramla, and the garrison are in danger of their lives from <lb/>
            the desperate assaults. That illustrious warrior Stephen, <lb/>
            count palatine of Blois, Milo de Brai, Harpin de Bo urges, <lb/>

            Ramla, having compelled me to leave them that I may <lb/>
            encourage you and the rest of our brethren to follow their <lb/>
            example. The enemy has pursued me boldly, and I think <lb/>
            will determine on following me here. Now, if you please, <lb/>
            we will despatch a messenger to Jerusalem, with my com­ <lb/>
            mands to the patriarch and all our brothers to succour us <lb/>
            in this extremity in such fitting manner as I shall instruct <lb/>
            them." This proposal meeting with general approbation, <lb/>
            the king summoned a squire of distinguished intrepidity and <lb/>
            said to him : “ Dear brother, go to Jerusalem, and bring us <lb/>
            a strong party of our brothers in arms, and if you escape <lb/>
            with your life I will dub you a knight on your return." <lb/>
            The squire executed his commission with perfect success, <lb/>
            and well earned the honour of knighthood which was pro­ <lb/>
            mised him.</p>
          <p>The accursed army of pagans laid Ramla in ruins, putting <lb/>
            to the sword, or making captives, all whom they found in the <lb/>
            place. Then, elated with victory, they marched the same <lb/>
            day to Joppa, covering the face of the earth like locusts, <lb/>
            having sent Count Stephen and others they reckoned the <lb/>
            noblest of the prisoners to Ascalon. The infidels silently <lb/>
            beset Joppa for two days, but the third they retired with <lb/>
            loss and disgrace. For the sentinels on the watch-tower at <lb/>
            Joppa descried the standards of the army of Jerusalem <lb/>
            crossing the mountains, and announced it with congratula­ <lb/>
            tions to the king, who was near at hand in the castle of <lb/>
            the Burgundians. Then the king assembled the band of <lb/>
            the faithful and cheered them by this encouraging address: <lb/>
            " Now is the wished-for opportunity of brave aspirants to <lb/>
            honour, and renowned knights ready to avenge those who <lb/>
            are dear to them, but it fills with dismay the cowards and <lb/>
            sluggards, and those who are crafty as foxes. You see <lb/>
            before your gates that accursed race which is hateful to God <lb/>
            and all Christian men. Arm yourselves, then, ye brave, and <lb/>
            go forth gloriously to attack the enemies of all goodness. <lb/>
            Let us put on our armour that we may take vengeance in <lb/>
            the name of God, and sally out to meet our friends who are <lb/>
            marching to our aid, and strong in the faith give the enemy <lb/>
            battle under God's protection. Reflect in your inmost <lb/>
            souls on the wrongs and losses you have sustained, and let <lb/>
            the aliens feel the weight of your arms in full vigour. They <pb n="304"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.X. CH.XXI. </note> <lb/>
            have put to the sword Count Stephen, Harpin, and other <lb/>
            noble barons, and have carried off our gallant knights and <lb/>
            officers; barons, I say with sorrow, than whom braver are <lb/>
            not to be found in the world. Let your fresh grief at the <lb/>
            loss of your friends inflame your rage and sharpen your <lb/>
            • swords for the destruction of the enemy. Think of David, <lb/>
            that most valiant of kings, and his soldiers, of Joab and <lb/>
            Abishai, of Banaiah and Uriah the Ethite, of Jonathan and <lb/>
            Judas Maccabseus, and other famous warriors of your own <lb/>
            nation. Marching out of the town, we will commence the <lb/>
            action, and the Jerusalem troops who are hastening to our <lb/>
            support, will fall on the aliens' in another quarter. May <lb/>
            the mighty Emanuel, the blessed virgin's son, your king <lb/>
            and leader, the invincible defender of his church, be with <lb/>
            you."2</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, as the Jerusalemites drew near the castle of <lb/>
            Ernald, their standards became visible to the Turkish army. <lb/>
            Then King Baldwin and the troops of Joppa adored the holy <lb/>
            crucifix, and carrying it in their ranks, sallied forth in full <lb/>
            armour, and began to deal terrible blows on the unarmed <lb/>
            Turks. The aliens, who were taken by surprise and in dis­ <lb/>
            array, seeing themselves attacked on all sides, and inspired <lb/>
            with terror by God himself, betook themselves to flight, as <lb/>
            did also the troops of Holofernes in the like extremity. King <lb/>
            Baldwin, with the Christians, pursued the gentiles as far as <lb/>
            Ascalon, and falling on their rear with great slaughter, reco­ <lb/>
            vered all the captives who were threatened with bondage. <lb/>
            But the most eminent, having been sent forward to Ascalon, <lb/>
            disappeared, nor could any certain intelligence be obtained <lb/>
            respecting any of them, except Harpin. Thus the Christians <lb/>
            triumphed in Christ's name, after their deep tribulations, <lb/>
            and returned, with the vast spoils of the infidels to Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem, giving glad thanks to their triumphant God. They <lb/>
            now restored Ramla to a better state than before, and re- <lb/>
            established there an episcopal see with fitting revenues. I <lb/>
            cannot commit to writing the number of the slain, as I was <lb/>
            not present. Those who were in the battle thought more of <lb/>
            slaying than counting their enemies, and were afterwards <lb/>
            intent on stripping the dead.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Allophilos. See the note in p. 178 of the present volume. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This narrative contains several inexact statements and anachronisms. </note></p><pb n="305"/>

          </ab>
          <p>HARPIN of Bourges was carried captive to Babylon, and <lb/>
            imprisoned for a long time in the emir's dungeons. Mind­ <lb/>
            ful of the martyrs who had endured all kinds of tortures, <lb/>
            even to death, for the cause of Christ, he frequently called <lb/>
            on his name, and receiving consolation, regained his liberty <lb/>
            and returned hearty thanks to his Saviour. He obtained <lb/>
            his release in the following manner. Some Byzantine mer­ <lb/>
            chants had come to Babylon with commodities of various <lb/>
            kinds, and according to the. law of nations, having paid to <lb/>
            the government officers the accustomed duties, abode there <lb/>
            for some time. They being Christians, and very affluent, <lb/>
            frequented the Christian churches, went among the poor in <lb/>
            their own dwellings, and visited the Christians in prison. <lb/>
            Harpin conversed with them, and charging them with his <lb/>
            commission, sent the following message to the emperor <lb/>
            Alexius: " Harpin of Bourges, your servant, who has long <lb/>
            groaned in the depth of misery in a Babylonian dungeon, <lb/>
            humbly supplicates the magnificence of your imperial <lb/>
            majesty to pity and relieve him, by interfering with the emir <lb/>
            for his release from prison."</p>
          <p>On receiving this message, the emperor felt compassion <lb/>
            for the noble Frenchman, and immediately insisted on the <lb/>
            emir's sending Hirpin to him, threatening in case of refusal <lb/>
            to arrest all the Babylonian merchants and tributaries <lb/>
            through the empire of Constantinople. The emir, terrified <lb/>
            at this indignant command, immediately freed Harpin from <lb/>
            his chains, and, entertaining him for several days in his <lb/>
            palace, showed him some rare objects, and then sent him to <lb/>
            the emperor, honoured by valuable ornaments and other <lb/>
            gifts. Having thus obtained his freedom, he went to the <note type="footnote"> For instance, it was not in Ramla that Harpin was made prisoner, but in <lb/>

            the siege of Joppa the same day they took Ramla. They were only pre­ <lb/>
            paring for it when Baldwin gained a signal victory in the beginning of <lb/>

            emperor's court to thank him for his effectual aid; and, <lb/>
            having been loaded with presents, returned to France.</p>
          <p>On the way he presented himself to Pope Paschal, and <lb/>
            after relating to him his misfortunes and sufferings, consulted <lb/>
            him in deep anxiety as to his future course of life. The <lb/>
            skilful pontiff, having listened to the knight's account of all <lb/>
            he had endured, said: " Especial care should be taken lest <lb/>
            any one who has been washed and purified in the bath, and <lb/>
            then clothed in garments white as snow or delicate as silk, <lb/>
            should walk in the darkness of night through foul roads, lest <lb/>
            he stumble in the mire, and, being soiled with filth, should <lb/>
            have to blush before all observers. In this mirror, my son, <lb/>
            behold yourself, and apply this example for your own correc­ <lb/>
            tion. You have been cleansed by penance and confession; <lb/>
            your laborious pilgrimage and the sufferings of martyrdom <lb/>
            have crowned you with the distinctions of virtue; you have <lb/>
            made satisfaction to God for your sins by the torments of <lb/>
            your prison; and, during your passion, you learned patience, <lb/>
            chastity, and other Christian graces. The foul road is a <lb/>
            worldly life, which you should resolutely endeavour to avoid, <lb/>
            lest you become polluted, and lose the crown of the <lb/>
            sufferings in which you glory. Take care, then, not to be <lb/>
            as the dog returning to his vomit, and the sow that wallows <lb/>
            in the mire. Never again bear arms against Christians, but <lb/>
            despise worldly pride like one of the true poor in Christ. <lb/>
            Thus, following the steps of Christ in works of righteous­ <lb/>
            ness, and relinquishing your own will for the hope of an <lb/>
            eternal reward, you will obtain the blessed prize of your <lb/>
            heavenly calling with the faithful in Abraham's bosom."</p>
          <p>Harpin, having received the pope's benediction, with his <lb/>
            leave proceeded to France, where he was received by his <lb/>
            friends with great honour; but he did not long remain with <lb/>
            them ; for, following the counsels of the pope, or rather the <lb/>
            precepts of Christ himself, he gave up the world, and, <lb/>
            retiring to Cluni, became a monk in that abbey, where he <lb/>
            persevered in the service of God until his death." 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's account of the deliverance of Ilarpin and his retirement to <lb/>
            Cluni, perfectly agrees with the existing facts of the history of that <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ABOUT this period, other serious disasters befell the crusaders <lb/>
            in Syria. The illustrious duke, Mark Bohemond, having <lb/>
            undertaken an expedition against the Turks, Daliman1 <lb/>
            attacked him by surprise with a vast multitude, and, putting <lb/>
            great numbers of the Christians to the sword, made <lb/>
            prisoners of Bohemond and Robert de Principatu,2 with <lb/>
            some other noble and gallant knights, whom he threw into a <lb/>
            dungeon, and kept in chains for a long time.3 Tancred, the <lb/>
            commander of Bohemond's troops, was much distressed <lb/>
            when he learned the calamity of his lord and kinsman; but <lb/>
            he did not give way to a woman's weakness and content <lb/>
            himself with vain regrets and lamentations. Assembling <lb/>
            the whole force of the faithful from all the surrounding <lb/>
            district, and placing vigilant garrisons in the villages and <lb/>
            towns in the neighbourhood, he defended his borders against <lb/>
            all the enemy's attacks while Bohemond was in captivity, <lb/>
            and even nobly enlarged them.</p>
          <p>The emperor Alexius was filled with joy when he heard <lb/>
            that Bohemond had fallen into the hands of the Turks, and <lb/>
            sent envoys with rich presents to Daliman, entreating him <lb/>
            to accept an enormous ransom for Bohemond, and to send <lb/>
            him to Constantinople on payment of a hundred thousand <lb/>
            philips.4 This he did, not with the intention of giving the <lb/>
            duke his liberty, and allowing him the freedom to become <lb/>
            again the defender of Christianity, but to subject him to <lb/>
            perpetual imprisonment in his own dungeons; for he was <lb/>
            deeply vexed that he had taken Antioch from him. It is <note type="footnote"> 1 The name should be written Danismand. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A province in the kingdom of Naples, now divided into two, of which <lb/>

            certain that Antioch is the metropolis1 of the Constantino­ <lb/>
            politan empire, but the Turks had wrested it from the <lb/>
            emperor by force of arms fourteen years before the Cis­ <lb/>
            alpines reduced the city when Cassian was slain. That <lb/>
            prince never abandoned his claims on it, but, in consequence <lb/>
            of the resistance offered by the obstinate valour of the <lb/>
            Normans, he was never able to accomplish his wishes. He <lb/>
            made the attempt at different times and in various ways, <lb/>
            using both entreaties and money, with the pagans as well as <lb/>
            the Christians, but in vain; for, foiled in all his endeavours, <lb/>
            the city remained in the hands of the victors, those, I mean, <lb/>
            who acquired it by their eminent valour in conquering the <lb/>
            Agarenes, and having obtained it, defended it admirably by <lb/>
            the help of God. However, Daliman rejected the emperor's <lb/>
            overtures, and resolved to inflict perpetual captivity on <lb/>
            Bohemond, who was called by the Turks, " The little God <lb/>
            of the Christians." That which conferred so much honour <lb/>
            on his own faith he counted as beyond all price.</p>
          <p>In the time of the Turks, a certain Greek was patriarch <lb/>
            of Antioch. The Norman conquerors found him intractable.2 <lb/>
            Having become masters, they resolved that the clergy and <lb/>
            people should conform to the Latin rites, but the Greeks, <lb/>
            adhering to their ancient usages, presumed to think this <lb/>
            unreasonable. When Bohemond was made prisoner, a <lb/>
            rumour was spread among the people that the bishop was <lb/>
            contriving means for betraying the city of Antioch to the <lb/>
            emperor. But when he learned that such reports were <lb/>
            current against him, he was highly incensed, and, whether <lb/>
            indignant from a clear conscience, or instigated by appre­ <lb/>
            hensions of being charged with so foul a transaction, I know <lb/>
            not, he left his bishopric, and retired into the wilderness, <lb/>
            determined never to return among a people whose usages he <lb/>
            detested. The Normans, being then masters of the city, <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author probably means to say, one of the metropolitan cities.- <lb/>

            rejoiced at the Greek's abdication, and communicated to <lb/>
            Bohemond in his prison the whole circumstances, asking his <lb/>
            advice about the appointment of a successor to the patriarch. <lb/>
            His commands were that Bernard of Provence,' who had <lb/>
            been chaplain to Adhemar, bishop of Puy, and was recom­ <lb/>
            mended by him as his intimate friend to Bohemond, another <lb/>
            particular friend, should be translated from the see of Mas­ <lb/>
            chenia and raised to the patriarchate of Antioch. By the <lb/>
            duke's order, therefore, the clergy and people elected Ber­ <lb/>
            nard, and seated their bishop in the chair of St. Peter the <lb/>
            apostle. He was a man of learning, but when he became <lb/>
            known to his flock, was much disliked, for he was both <lb/>
            covetous, and, according to the character of the Goths from <lb/>
            whom he descended,2 very austere. He ruled the church of <lb/>
            God for a long period, retaining the government of his see <lb/>
            to the age of decrepitude. In his time, as already stated <lb/>
            and will be more fully related hereafter, the Christians in <lb/>
            the East suffered violent disasters.</p>
          <p>It was published throughout the world that Bohemond <lb/>
            was in captivity among the pagans. All Christendom <lb/>
            mourned for him, and even the pagans themselves paid him <lb/>
            honours in his prison. The whole church offered prayers to <lb/>
            God on his behalf, that he would deliver the captive from <lb/>
            the hands of his enemies. But the merciful God, who <lb/>
            created all things, while he knows how to chastise his <lb/>
            servants with afflictions on account of their sins, is ready <lb/>
            also to afford marvellous succour to those who humbly <lb/>
            implore him. Abraham and Joseph experienced this under <lb/>
            Pharaoh, among the Egyptians; Tobias and Raguel under <lb/>
            Salmonassar, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, among the <lb/>
            Assyrians; Daniel and the three children, with the other <lb/>
            sons of the transmigration, under Nebuchadnosor and Evil­ <lb/>
            merodach, among the Chaldeans; Esdras, and Nehemiah, and <lb/>
            Mordecai, with his niece Esther, under Cyrus, Darius, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Bernard, chaplain of the bishop of Puy, was not a Provencal, but a <lb/>
            native of Valence in Dauphiny. It was two years after the retirement of <lb/>
            John IV. that he was summoned from his bishopric of Arthasium to <lb/>

            Artaxerxes, among the Persians and Medes. This also was <lb/>
            happily felt by the apostles and other holy preachers, who <lb/>
            frequently, on their first arrival in barbarous countries, were <lb/>
            despised as aliens and mendicants, but soon afterwrads the <lb/>
            splendour of their miracles and their words of thunder <lb/>
            struck the natives with awe, and brought under the yoke of <lb/>
            the divine law those who before were opposed to all that is <lb/>
            good. Thus He who said, " My Father works hitherto, and <lb/>
            I work," 1 recently visited in their prison his champions, of <lb/>
            whom I speak in my writings for the information of pos­ <lb/>
            terity, and from admiration of the divine operations; cheering <lb/>
            them plenteously with the mellifluous nectar of his loving- <lb/>
            kindness. Mortals have the scourge of sufferings inflicted <lb/>
            on them for the sins of human infirmity, and are compelled, <lb/>
            when punished by the divine rod, to implore in sorrow the <lb/>
            mercy of their Maker. God, our King, who saves those <lb/>
            who trust in him, listened with power to the prayers of his <lb/>
            church, and succoured the captive duke and his companions <lb/>
            by the address and assistance of his enemy's daughter; as <lb/>
            formerly he aided his suffering people by means of Judith, <lb/>
            the courageous widow, when she cut off the head of the <lb/>
            proud Holophernes at Bethulia.</p>
          <p>Melaz,2 the daughter of Daliman, was a beautiful and <lb/>
            accomplished princess, and possessed great power in all her <lb/>
            father's house, having the command of abundant wealth and <lb/>
            a number of slaves to do her will. Hearing of the bravery <lb/>
            of the Franks, she conceived a high regard for them, and <lb/>
            sought their intimacy so ardently, that, bribing the gaolers <lb/>
            liberally, she frequently descended into their dungeons, and <lb/>
            held acute discussions with the prisoners concerning the <note type="footnote"> 1 John v. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It has been observed in a former note that we have no historical record <lb/>
            of the mode in which Bohemond and his companions in captivity obtained <lb/>

            Christian faith and the true religion, sometimes mingling <lb/>
            deep sighs with the investigations she made. Their gentle <lb/>
            and kind deportment placed them higher in her affections <lb/>
            than even her parents, and she took care to supply them <lb/>
            with all that was needful for food and clothing. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            her father, occupied by a multiplicity of other affairs, was <lb/>
            either unconscious of what was going on, or, placing implicit <lb/>
            confidence in the conduct of his beloved daughter, did not <lb/>
            trouble himself about it.</p>
          <p>At the end of two years, a worse than civil war commenced <lb/>
            between Daliman and his brother. Soliman, instigated by <lb/>
            his fierce and ambitious temper, took arms against Daliman, <lb/>
            and, assembling large bodies of troops, made an irruption <lb/>
            into his brother's territories, and had the insolence to pro­ <lb/>
            yoke him to battle. Daliman's indignation was roused by <lb/>
            so unnatural an hostility; and, having obtained succour <lb/>
            from all quarters, and being proud of his former victories, be <lb/>
            was eager for the bloody conflict, and, as the day of battle <lb/>
            drew near, pitched his camp ready for action.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Melaz sought a private conference with the <lb/>
            Christians, in which she thus addressed them: " I have long <lb/>
            heard the chivalry of the Franks celebrated, and now I wish <lb/>
            to prove it in the hour of my father's deepest need, that <lb/>
            experience may prove to the eyes what the ears have heard <lb/>
            by report." Bohemond replied: " Sweet and honourable <lb/>
            lady, if it be your highness's pleasure that we should have <lb/>
            permission to appear on the field of battle with our knightly <lb/>
            arms, no doubt we shall show with sword and lance the <lb/>
            force of such blows as Franks deal, and make trial of them <lb/>
            on your enemies before your eyes." The young princess <lb/>
            then said: " Promise me, on your faith as Christians, that <lb/>
            in the affair of which we treat, you will act in all things by <lb/>
            my advice, and not venture to take any step contrary to my <lb/>
            orders. Satisfy me of this by pledging your faith, and <lb/>
            then I will not hesitate to open to you the secrets of my <lb/>
            heart."</p>
          <p>Bohemond first gave the solemn engagement required, <lb/>
            and all the others followed his example, promising all the <lb/>
            princess enjoined. She then said, radiant with joy: " Now <lb/>
            I have full confidence in you, because I believe you are <lb/>
            true to your word, and will never violate your promise in <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.X. CH.XXIII."/> <lb/>
            any manner. Succour my father, who is now on the field, <lb/>
            where he is on the point of engaging in battle, and hasten <lb/>
            to lend him the aid of your valour. If success attend you, <lb/>
            as I trust it will, do not delay in pursuit of the fleeing <lb/>
            enemy, but hasten back here with your arms, and do not <lb/>
            disarm till I give you orders. Meanwhile, I will cause all <lb/>
            the guards to descend from the highest floor of the tower <lb/>
            to the lower gates, and to remain with me in the court as if <lb/>
            they were waiting for you. When you return, and you hear <lb/>
            me command them to bind you in in the fetters you wear, <lb/>
            lay hands upon them stoutly, and without a moment's loss, <lb/>
            seize them all and thrust them into the dungeon in <lb/>
            your place. For myself, at this sight, I shall flee from you <lb/>
            as if you were savage wolves. As to you, take posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the strongest tower, and hold it vigilantly until you <lb/>
            have made suitable terms with my father. There are doors <lb/>
            high up in the tower, through which you can come down <lb/>
            into the palace by stone steps, and get possession of the whole <lb/>
            wealth and all the apartments of my father. To make an <lb/>
            end, should my parent be incensed against me for these my <lb/>
            offences, I beseech you, 0 friends, whom I love as my own <lb/>
            soul, hasten, without loss of time, to my aid."</p>
          <p>Having said this, she armed the knights, and immediately <lb/>
            led them forth. She had already corrupted and deceived the <lb/>
            guards, and on giving them their instructions, spoke to them <lb/>
            in the following manner: " I am overwhelmed with fears for <lb/>
            my father, seeing that he is about to engage in battle with <lb/>
            a host from many nations. He is so intrepid a warrior that <lb/>
            he will not condescend to demand assistance from his cap­ <lb/>
            tives. But I would have you know that he has left it to my <lb/>
            care and in my power to supply the Christians with arms <lb/>
            and send them to the fight in aid of our troops. If, by <lb/>
            their means the enemy is overcome, the honour and profit <lb/>
            will belong to us, but if they fall pierced by hostile weapons <lb/>
            we shall have nothing to lament in the loss of aliens, whose <lb/>
            usages and ceremonies all the race of the Agarenes abhor."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, the guards cheerfully acquiesced in the <lb/>
            proposal, and praised to the sIdes the forethought of their <lb/>
            prudent lady. Thereupon she released the captives from <lb/>
            their fetters, conducted them from their house of bondage, <lb/>
            and having armed them, dismissed them to the combat. <pb n="313"/>

            Finding the armies already sharply engaged, they shouted <lb/>
            the war-cry of the Normans, DIEUX AIDE1 with confidence, <lb/>
            and the squadrons of Soliman, hearing their cries and deal­ <lb/>
            ing fearful blows, recoiled. There were some Christian <lb/>
            soldiers in his army, who, to their great joy, recognized <lb/>
            Bohemond, the renowned chief, and deserting Soliman, <lb/>
            attached themselves to the Catholics.</p>
          <p>Soliman had a son named Marciban, a presumptuous <lb/>
            youth, who, hearing that Bohemond was on the field, chal­ <lb/>
            lenged him to battle by name, being ambitious of meeting <lb/>
            him in single combat. At length they met in the presence <lb/>
            of Daliman, and attacked each other fiercely; but the Nor­ <lb/>
            man warrior brought the Turk to the ground, and drawing <lb/>
            his sword, struck off his head. Daliman shouting: " Hold, <lb/>
            spare him, he is my nephew," the Christian hero, when <lb/>
            he heard that, concealed his inward triumph under a sorrow­ <lb/>
            ful countenance, and said ironically: " Pardon me, my lord; <lb/>
            I did it in ignorance; I took him for an enemy, instead of <lb/>
            your nephew, and sacrificed his life to do your pleasure."</p>
          <p>After great slaughter on both sides, the army of Soliman <lb/>
            was defeated, and a body of the enemy pursued them the <lb/>
            whole of the day. The Christians immediately returned, as <lb/>
            it was agreed, and found the princess with the guards wait­ <lb/>
            ing for them at the entrance of the tower. On seeing them <lb/>
            coming, she said to the gaolers: " It is plain that the Franks <lb/>
            are true to their word, and keep the faith they pledge <lb/>
            unbroken: go to them as they enter, receive their arms, <lb/>
            and take them back to their former prison, until my father, <lb/>
            on his arrival, shall confer on them the rewards they merit <lb/>
            for their service in the battle." The Turks left their lady <lb/>
            to do her bidding, but the Franks closed on them, and <lb/>
            making them prisoners, thrust them into the dungeon, and <lb/>
            closely barring the doors, seized possession of the whole <lb/>
            interior of the tower without making any public disturb­ <lb/>
            ance, becoming masters of the place without effusion of <lb/>
            blood. Indeed, the city was left defenceless, as all the men <lb/>
            had gone out to the battle; and only the women and chil­ <lb/>

            served, and the palace of the king was connected with the <lb/>
            tower.</p>
          <p>The night following, Melaz introduced the Christians into <lb/>
            the palace by the entrance from the tower, showing them <lb/>
            all the chambers and secret recesses, and instructing them <lb/>
            what they were to do on Daliman's arrival. Returning the <lb/>
            next day, with his satraps, and captains, and great men, his <lb/>
            daughter met him, accompanied by her young companions, <lb/>
            with lively joy: "Welcome," she said, "O glorious con­ <lb/>
            queror." But the king replied: " Hold your peace, aban­ <lb/>
            doned girl; I care not for your perfidious congratulations. <lb/>
            I despise your deceitful flatteries. By the sacred turban of <lb/>
            Mahomet, who has given me the victory, you and your <lb/>
            champions shall die to-morrow; you, who have put arms <lb/>
            into the hands of my adversaries to my utter confusion <lb/>
            shall be burnt in the flames with them as a most abominable <lb/>
            traitress." The king had not yet learnt that the guards of <lb/>
            his citadel were fettered in its dark dungeon, nor that the <lb/>
            Franks, exulting in freedom, had possession of the upper <lb/>
            floor, and with Christ's aid were preparing to attack him. <lb/>
            The young princess fled, trembling and pale, from his fury, <lb/>
            and sought the concealment of her chamber in grief and <lb/>
            alarm.</p>
          <p>Some hours afterwards the incensed prince seated himself <lb/>
            on his tribunal, having no one with him but his principal <lb/>
            nobles, the rest of his people, with his squires and guards <lb/>
            being dispersed at their several lodgings and occupied about <lb/>
            their horses, arms, and other equipments. Having com­ <lb/>
            manded some of the attendants to go to the private apart­ <lb/>
            ments, and bring before him the presumptuous traitress, <lb/>
            in obedience to the summons she stood alone before the exas­ <lb/>
            perated tyrant, and heard his terrible threats and reproaches <lb/>
            without any to help her. Meanwhile, Bohemond, looking <lb/>
            through a window in the tower which commanded the inte­ <lb/>
            rior of the palace, and observing his deliverer standing in <lb/>
            her desolation before the seat of judgment, exclaimed in <lb/>
            deep distress : " Lo, our protrectress is in extreme peril; it <lb/>
            , is time that we should issue forth and aid her with our <lb/>
            utmost efforts." No time was lost in descending by the <lb/>
            staircase, step by step, into the palace, and Daliman with <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 1100—1104.]"/> <lb/>
            his officers and courtiers found themselves suddenly sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by the armed Franks, who securely closed the <lb/>
            doors of the building, and took possession of all the defences <lb/>
            round it. All parties were in a state of extreme anxiety, not <lb/>
            knowing what it was best to do. As for the Turks, they <lb/>
            had no means of escape, as the doors were securely closed; <lb/>
            they could not hide themselves as they were surrounded by <lb/>
            men with drawn swords ; unarmed and few, they were unable <lb/>
            to resist a number of valiant men well supplied with arms. <lb/>
            It was in the power of the Christians at that moment to <lb/>
            massacre all the Gentiles, but they did not dare to lift a <lb/>
            hand against any one or do him any injury without the <lb/>
            young princess's orders, in consequence of the oath they <lb/>
            had given her. They, therefore, all looked to her, waiting <lb/>
            her commands as they avoided forfeiting their pledge.</p>
          <p>At last Melaz, begining to find herself in security, said <lb/>
            to her father, laughing : "My dear father, your anger against <lb/>
            me is unjust; you frighten me with terrible threats, and <lb/>
            overwhelm me with reproaches for the timely succour which, <lb/>
            in my great regard, I adroitly provided for you in your hour <lb/>
            of need; for the Franks having taking arms, joined you in <lb/>
            the battle, your side was strengthened and your enemies <lb/>
            were sooner routed. Consider how honourably these Chris­ <lb/>
            tians have acted. They loyally supported you in the battle, <lb/>
            and the enemy gave way before their attacks. They had <lb/>
            abundant opportunities of making their escape, as even the <lb/>
            purblind can see, but, being unwilling to depart without <lb/>
            taking leave they voluntarily returned here, and confidently <lb/>
            expect from your liberality the rewards they have earned by <lb/>
            their courage in the field. At this instant their hands are <lb/>
            on their sword-hilts, and if they chose they would massacre <lb/>
            all of us in a moment. They are masters of the citadel and the <lb/>
            palace, and all your treasures contained in them are at their <lb/>
            mercy; your guards are in fetters and dare not mutter a <lb/>
            word against them. In these circumstances, my father, con­ <lb/>
            sider what you have to do, and consult the councillors I see <lb/>
            about you."</p>
          <p>Having said this, the princess placed herself at the head <lb/>
            of the Christians. Meanwhile, Daliman drew aside and took <lb/>
            the opinion of his friends. He then resumed his seat and said, <lb/>
            " We wish first, daughter, to hear what you propose." Her <pb n="316"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.X. CH.XXIII."/> <lb/>
            reply was this: "I shall not hesitate to suggest what I think <lb/>
            is the best course; make peace with the Christians, and pre­ <lb/>
            serve it inviolably as long as you live. Release all the <lb/>
            captives of that religion throughout your dominions, and let <lb/>
            them in turn liberate all your subjects who are in their <lb/>
            power. Confer on Bohemond and his comrades, by whose <lb/>
            aid you have gained a glorious victory, the rewards they <lb/>
            merit for their distinguished service. For myself, know that <lb/>
            I am become a Christian, and desire to receive the sacrament <lb/>
            of regeneration according to the Christian rites, nor shall I <lb/>
            longer abide with you. The faith of the Christians is holy <lb/>
            and pure, while yours is full of vanity, and polluted with all <lb/>
            uncleanness."</p>
          <p>This language greatly irritated the Turks, who exhibited <lb/>
            their anger by stern glances and menacing gestures, but were <lb/>
            divinely withheld from giving vent to the malice of their im­ <lb/>
            pious minds by acts of violence. While they were consulting <lb/>
            together on what was to be done, Melaz calling the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians apart, thus addressed them : "Courage, brave knights, <lb/>
            proved in many difficulties and trials! You who have come <lb/>
            voluntarily from distant countries, and by your persevering <lb/>
            valour have escaped such perils, act firmly in the name of <lb/>
            your God whom you call Almighty. Now is the time to <lb/>
            shew your courage and use your arms, that what you have <lb/>
            begun boldly you may carry into effect in a manner worthy <lb/>
            of yourselves. My father is greatly incensed against us, <lb/>
            and is contriving with his friends, to the utmost of his power, <lb/>
            the means for our destruction. Thus far you have strictly <lb/>
            observed the conditions I required. I now release you from <lb/>
            the promise to which you solemnly pledged your faith. <lb/>
            It is time for you to man the citadel and the palace with <lb/>
            the wall round it, and all the chambers, both great and <lb/>
            small, and to keep a careful watch and guard the avenues <lb/>
            that no one shall go out or in without your knowledge. If <lb/>
            my father finds means of escaping from the palace, he will <lb/>
            raise en masse all the people round, and will compel you by a <lb/>
            cruel siege to a base surrender or take your lives. Shut him <lb/>
            up then, with all his adherents, in one apartment, and use <lb/>
            all necessary force to compel them, when there, to come to <lb/>
            terms, but as far as possible avoid the effusion of blood. I <lb/>
            commit the superintendence and command in this affair to <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 1100—1104.]"/> <lb/>
            you, my lord Bohemond, who have so much experience, and <lb/>
            whose wisdom and mature judgment are renowned through­ <lb/>
            out the world. From this time, I shall be inseparably your <lb/>
            sister, and will share cheerfully your success or misfortunes, <lb/>
            in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
          <p>In consequence Bohemond, with great pleasure, forcibly <lb/>
            thrust Daliman and all his party into one of the chambers <lb/>
            and placed armed guards over it. He then posted the other <lb/>
            knights at various points, giving orders to each how they <lb/>
            were to act, and thus he held possession of the prince's palace, <lb/>
            with all he found in it, for nearly fifteen days. He permit­ <lb/>
            ted the wives of the emir and his nobles, with their attendants <lb/>
            and unarmed eunuchs, to have access to them and to supply <lb/>
            them with food and all other necessaries. Meanwhile Dali­ <lb/>
            man bitterly lamented that his own house was made his <lb/>
            prison, and his daughter the gaoler, at whose instance he was <lb/>
            strictly confined. He did not spare curses on his god <lb/>
            Mahomet, and on all his friends, subjects, and neighbours who <lb/>
            suffered him to submit to such rough treatment in the seat <lb/>
            of his power from a small band of captives and aliens. The <lb/>
            nobles who were incarcerated with him persuaded him to <lb/>
            come to terms with the Christians, that at least they might <lb/>
            escape with their lives. At last his fears got the better of <lb/>
            his obstinacy. Having conferred with Bohemond, he im­ <lb/>
            plored his amity, and consented that he and all his compan­ <lb/>
            ions should go free, and thus all the captives who groaned <lb/>
            n his dungeons should have their liberty; he also promised <lb/>
            to give him his daughter in marriage.</p>
          <p>Bohemond having informed Melaz of what had passed, <lb/>
            the able princess replied: " Words are easily uttered, but <lb/>
            must not always be taken on trust. Listen civilly to my <lb/>
            father's smooth speeches, but receive them with caution. <lb/>
            Keep watchful guard over what is in your hands until you <lb/>
            can ensure your success in complete security. Let trusty <lb/>
            messengers be despatched by different roads to Antioch to <lb/>
            summon an armed force of your countrymen, who will form <lb/>
            an honourable escort, and conducting you without hazard <lb/>
            of treachery into your own states, place you out of the <lb/>
            reach of the perfidious wiles of all the malevolent." This <lb/>
            advice was approved by all the Christians, and in conse­ <lb/>
            quence Richard de Principatu and Sardis were sent from <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.X. CII.XXIII."/> <lb/>
            Mesopotamia to Antioch, and made known the state of <lb/>
            affairs to the people there, who received the intelligence with <lb/>
            delight. Then Tancred, Bohemond's governor, sent commis­ <lb/>
            sioners to collect all the knights and other Gentiles who were <lb/>
            in captivity, and as soon as they were assembled, delivered <lb/>
            them to Richard and Sardis to be conducted to Babylon. <lb/>
            Amongst others liberated at this time was the daughter of <lb/>
            Cassian, the [former] emir of Antioch, who made great <lb/>
            lamentations when she was released from her confinement <lb/>
            among the Christians. Being asked the cause of her sorrow, <lb/>
            the lady replied, that she grieved because she would no longer <lb/>
            partake of that excellent food, pork-meat, which the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians ate. For the Turks and many other Saracen nations <lb/>
            abhor the flesh of swine, while they eagerly devour that of <lb/>
            dogs and wolves. Thus it is proved that they submit neither <lb/>
            to the law of Moses, or that of Christ, and belong neither to <lb/>
            Jews, or Christians.1"</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Bohemond had frequent conferences with <lb/>
            Daliman, and by his ability and moderation established terms <lb/>
            of familiar intimacy with him, taking opportunities of favour­ <lb/>
            ably disposing him towards numbers who were placed under <lb/>
            his tyrannical power. His respectful and courteous lan­ <lb/>
            guage soothed the resentment of the emir and his companions <lb/>
            in captivity, and he even gained their regards by the care with <lb/>
            which he paid them deferential attention. By degrees the <lb/>
            provincial governors and other chiefs became acquainted <lb/>
            with their new ruler, and feeling extreme anxiety to scruti­ <lb/>
            nize the man who had become the master of their lawful <lb/>
            sovereign, and having, by his permission, access to their <lb/>
            prince, highly celebrated Bohemond's merits. They urged <lb/>
            Daliman, as their legitimate sovereign, to act for the good <note type="footnote"> 1 This amusing episode concerning the princess Baghi-Sian, and her <lb/>
            predilection for pork, is of a piece with the rest of the narrative, adding <lb/>
            a touch of the comic to its character as a romance. Wherever our author <lb/>
            found the story, he seems to have copied it without examination, for it is <lb/>
            extraordinary that, with his great display of biblical knowledge, it should <lb/>
            have escaped his recollection that the law of Moses is as stringent as he <lb/>
            represents the practice of the Mahometans with regard to eating the flesh <lb/>
            of swine. (See Levit. xi. 7; Deut. ix. 8.) It is possible, however, that <lb/>
            Ordericus may have been but imperfectly acquainted with this portion of <lb/>
            the sacred writings, to which much importance was not at that time <lb/>
            attached. </note> <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 1100—1104.]"/> <lb/>
            of the state, and recommended him to seek the friendship of <lb/>
            the illustrious duke by all the means in his power, often <lb/>
            quoting the words of the comic poet:­ <lb/>
            " If you can't do what you will, <lb/>
            Then wish rather what you can."1</p>
          <p>Adding this, " In the victory we recently gained, we were <lb/>
            signally deceived, for we had the enemies of our own faith <lb/>
            as our efficient allies in the defeat of our countrymen, and <lb/>
            we stupidly and wickedly gloried in our common loss; our <lb/>
            own God, the execrable Mahomet, utterly deserted us, and <lb/>
            bowed powerless before the God of the Christians. Behold <lb/>
            how wonderfully that crucified Christ, whom they call The <lb/>
            Almighty, and justly, as all their enemies find and prove to <lb/>
            their loss, inspires your daughter, in a most unlooked-for <lb/>
            manner, to break the chains of those you believed to be <lb/>
            strictly confined in your dungeons, and had condemned to <lb/>
            perpetual prison in the fortress. He had given them a <lb/>
            brilliant triumph when they appeared in arms on the field <lb/>
            of battle, and their swords are red with the blood of our <lb/>
            brothers and nephews. Still more, he has given them pos­ <lb/>
            session of your principal stronghold containing all your <lb/>
            wealth, and has put you and the great men of your kingdom <lb/>
            into their hands, imprisoned in your own palace, as in a <lb/>
            sorrowful dungeon, having, as if you were helpless women, <lb/>
            made no resistance. We have no means of access to you <lb/>
            but by leave of these foreigners, and it is out of our power <lb/>
            to render you any help. We cannot unite to attack them, <lb/>
            because they would immediately vent their resentment on <lb/>
            you. If even the great king, the Soldan of Persia, should <lb/>
            march here with the whole of his forces and attempt to <lb/>
            assault the citadel, such is the valour of the Franks, and so <lb/>
            strong are the fortifications, that they would dare to resist <lb/>
            him in the fortress, and would inflict severe chastisement <lb/>
            on us before they were reduced. It is better, therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 Quando non potest id fieri quod vis, </note><note type="footnote"> Id velis quid possit. <lb/>
            r, Ter. Andr. Act ii. sc. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> It is edifying to find these brave Turks, fit subjects for a comic opera, <lb/>
            better acquainted with the classics than Ordericus seems to have been with <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.X. CH.XXIII."/> <lb/>
            amicably to make terms with the enemy, than rashly to rouse <lb/>
            his fatal rage."</p>
          <p>Daliman yielded to this advice. Accepting the proffered <lb/>
            friendship of the illustrious duke, he gave liberal orders in <lb/>
            his palace for the common good, and made freely from his <lb/>
            treasures large donations to the Christians. He also com­ <lb/>
            manded all the captives throughout his dominions to be set <lb/>
            at liberty. They were diligently inquired after, and when <lb/>
            found conducted to Daliman, who clothed them well and <lb/>
            delivered them to Bohemond. The duke forthwith enlisted <lb/>
            these captives in his service among their countrymen, assign­ <lb/>
            ing them various duties, that, augmenting his force and his <lb/>
            guard, they and their comrades might not be molested through <lb/>
            any insidious schemes of the Pagans.</p>
          <p>Richard and Sardis returned in fifteen days, having exe­ <lb/>
            cuted their commission and accompanied by a powerful body <lb/>
            of Christians. Daliman ordered them to be received with <lb/>
            distinguished honours, and abundantly supplied with pro­ <lb/>
            visions, according to the customs of the country, and to be <lb/>
            liberally furnished with all that they required. Then Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond and Daliman ratified the treaty for a perpetual peace <lb/>
            between them, and three days were employed in preparing <lb/>
            a suitable equipment of every sort. At length, Bohemond <lb/>
            and Richard, with their companions in captivity departed <lb/>
            from it exulting, and, like Zorobabel and Nehemiah, blessed <lb/>
            the Lord God of Israel. Daliman and his nobles, also joy­ <lb/>
            ful because they were released from imprisonment, conducted <lb/>
            them for some distance on theIr journey, but with perfidious <lb/>
            intentions, meaning to take some opportunity of doing them <lb/>
            mischief; but God protecting his servants, they could not <lb/>
            accomplish it. For the faithful were apprehensive of this, <lb/>
            and in consequence marched with arms in their hands, and <lb/>
            prepared for battle. They also strictly guarded the hostages <lb/>
            which had been given for their security, until they reached <lb/>
            the appointed place of safety. At last Daliman demanded <lb/>
            from his allies in a friendly manner permission to return, <lb/>

            Christians at Bithia, as Pharaoh's daughter1 happily accom. <lb/>
            panied Moses and the Hebrews when they went out of <lb/>
            Egypt. The citizens of Antioch came in triumphant <lb/>
            procession to meet their chiefs whose loss they had long <lb/>
            deplored, and the clergy with all the people offered devout <lb/>
            praises to the Lord God of Sabaoth, who saves all that trust <lb/>
            in him. Bohemond despatched Richard [de Principatu], the <lb/>
            companion of his captivity, to France, sending by him silver <lb/>
            fetters to the shrine of St. Leonard, with devout thanksgivings <lb/>
            for his liberation.2</p>
          <p>The illustrious Melaz having been regenerated and <lb/>
            admitted into the Christian church by the holy sacrament <lb/>
            of baptism, Bohemond took an opportunity of thus address­ <lb/>
            ing her in the assembly of the chiefs: " Noble virgin, who <lb/>
            while you were yet a pagan unexpectedly succoured us in <lb/>
            a wonderful way, and have wisely left your kindred for the <lb/>
            sake of the Lord Jesus, whom you kindly entreated in us <lb/>
            who are his members and servants, for which you incurred <lb/>
            your father's anger to the peril of your life, select from <lb/>
            amongst us a husband to your choice, in the name of Christ; <lb/>
            for it is not right that we should in the slightest degree <lb/>
            oppose your reasonable wishes, debtors as we deeply are to <lb/>
            your past deservings. First, however listen to my advice, <lb/>
            which I trust, my sweet friend, will be serviceable to you: I <lb/>
            admit that your father betrothed you to myself, but I hope <lb/>
            to provide better for you, and I will tell you plainly for <lb/>
            what reason. From my youth upwards I have never enjoyed <lb/>
            rest, and spending my life in toil, have suffered grievously, <lb/>
            and I fear that worse evils are still in store for me, for I <lb/>
            have to contend against the emperor, as well as the pagans <lb/>
            by whom I am surrounded. Besides, while I was in prison, <lb/>
            I made a vow to undertake a pilgrimage to St. Leonard's in <lb/>
            Aquitaine. I offer you these apologies from sincere affec­ <lb/>

            be induced to accept him for your husband, and I trust that <lb/>

          <p>All present seconded the duke's prudent counsel, and the <lb/>
            wise princess readily yielded to the unanimous opinion of <lb/>
            so many eminent men. In consequence, Roger's happy <lb/>
            nuptials with Melaz were celebrated with great honours, and <lb/>
            to the universal joy of the people of Antioch. Bohemond <lb/>
            himself served as steward of the feast, with the principal <lb/>
            lords of the country. Six years afterwards, on the death of <lb/>
            Bohemond and Tancred, Roger succeeded to the principality <lb/>
            of Antioch, but in the course of two years from his acces­ <lb/>
            sion he was slain on the field of Sarmatan, with seven thou­ <lb/>

          <p>0 MERCIFUL God of Sabaoth, mighty King, who governest <lb/>
            all things, and reignest through all ages, vouchsafe to be the <lb/>
            Saviour of the work of thy hands! Restrain the violence <lb/>
            of Satan, who continually vents his rage against thee by <lb/>
            seeking everywhere to vex thy servants. Listen, I beseech <lb/>
            thee, to my prayers, 0 gracious Creator of the world ! I <lb/>
            adore thee, I seek thee, I labour, as I ought, to do thy will. <lb/>
            I, an old man, now record the acts of popes and kings ; and, <lb/>
            a sexagenarian, make them clear to the young. But I do it <lb/>
            gratuitously, careful only for the approbation of my breth­ <lb/>
            ren. If new miracles were openly wrought in these days, I <lb/>
            would endeavour to give a faithful report of them in my <lb/>
            annals. I think that a summary of them would be more <lb/>
            acceptable both to the present generation and posterity, <lb/>
            would more profit myself, and please others, than to examine <lb/>
            and describe at large worldly wants and transitory honours. <lb/>
            I aim at glorious things, and would write of miracles, filling <lb/>
            my pages with prodigies in Christ's name. My delight is to <lb/>
            offer praise to Him who governs the whole world, and who <lb/>
            can easily cure us of all our ills. But I am compelled to <lb/>
            speak of the evil we see or suffer, and to record the unstable <lb/>
            acts of mortals; for love of the world drags crowds of men <lb/>
            to the bottomless pit, nor can the file of justice polish off <lb/>
            the rust of crime. Inclined to evil, they dwell on the earthly <lb/>
            and despise the heavenly, being so bent on the earth that <lb/>
            they cannot behold the other. Sinners carry their fatal bur­ <lb/>
            dens, and the splendid miracles of the saints naturally cease. <lb/>
            Transgressors of the law merit the punishment of the <lb/>
            divine wrath, instead of miracles. We might enlarge on the <lb/>
            suits and hostilities which the fierce desire of gain occasions <lb/>
            in the world. If learned men could condescend to dwell on <lb/>
            infamous subjects, they might descant on murder, incest, <lb/>
            and a thousand crimes. The fool perplexes himself to no <lb/>
            purpose and wastes his time, while no wise man permits his <lb/>
            to be ill-spent. He, indeed, wastes his time who writes <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <note type="margin">[B. XI. </note> <lb/>
            useless verses, and that labour is lost from which no profit <lb/>
            is gamed. The elect devote themselves to goodness with <lb/>
            ardent zeal, and apply diligently to laudable studies. There <lb/>
            is no need of using compulsion to those who voluntarily <lb/>
            take up their burdens, collecting the sheaves of corn and <lb/>
            carrying them to the garner. There is no need of the spur <lb/>
            for a horse that goes freely; a gentle rein only is wanting <lb/>
            to prevent him from stumbling; but the rider uses sharp <lb/>
            spurs to a dull horse, and applies frequent strokes of the <lb/>
            whip to quicken his pace. Such is the law of the church <lb/>
            with gentle teachers; they urge the indolent to action by <lb/>
            admonitions, while they restrain the froward.</p>
          <p>The evil beast with ten horns already triumphs; and the <lb/>
            fierce populations are everywhere polluted with the leprosy <lb/>
            of sin. The Lord showed the Behemoth in an allegory to <lb/>
            his friend Job; and this insidious demon rages in a per­ <lb/>
            verse world. Erynnis pursues her furious course over the <lb/>
            earth, and daily plunges her victims into the depths of hell. <lb/>
            Amphisilena makes sport of and deludes mankind, and by <lb/>
            her wiles deprives them of the joys of paradise. Alas! the <lb/>
            foul serpent infects them with his deadly poison, so that <lb/>
            they lose their reason and engage in mutual slaughter. The <lb/>
            foolish bring on themselves diseases and pestilences, and the <lb/>
            perverse add sin to sin. We observe the misfortunes of <lb/>
            men, and the miserable disasters with which a skilful writer <lb/>
            can fill his sheets of parchment; if he wants to use empty <lb/>
            words on various subjects, he will find abundant materials in <lb/>
            the calamities of the world.</p>
          <p>The malicious enemy of the human race is described by <lb/>
            various names in the Scriptures inspired by Heaven. He <lb/>
            is called a lion, wolf, dragon, partridge,' basilisk, a kite, a <lb/>
            boar, a fox, a dog, a bear, a leach, a satyr; 'and he becomes <lb/>
            a deadly serpent when he deludes us with his wiles, and <lb/>
            compasses by force or fraud the destruction of fools. A <lb/>
            thousand other names will occur to the intelligent reader, <lb/>
            derived from the various artifices to which the enemy of <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1102, the ninth indiction, Henry, <lb/>
            king of England, having concluded a peace with his brother, <lb/>
            and being firmly established on the throne, began gradually <lb/>
            to reek his vengeance on the traitors who had infamously <lb/>
            deserted him in the time of need. Robert Malet,1 Ivo de <lb/>
            Grantmesnil, Robert of Pontefract, son of Ilbert de <lb/>
            Laci, and Robert de Belèsme, the most powerful of these <lb/>
            barons, with many others, were brought to trial, not all at <lb/>
            once, but separately and at different times, charged with <lb/>
            various treasonable acts. Some of them, not being able to <lb/>
            clear themselves of the crimes alleged against them, were <lb/>
            heavily fined, while others, who were greater objects of sus­ <lb/>
            picion to the king, were utterly disinherited by him and <lb/>
            driven into exile.</p>

          <p>THE year following William de Warrenne presented him­ <lb/>
            self in great distress to Robert, duke of Normandy, and <lb/>
            represented to him the severe loss he had sustained in his <lb/>
            service, having forfeited his earldom of Surrey, which pro­ <lb/>
            duced him the yearly revenue of a thousand pounds of silver; <lb/>
            claiming in consequence Robert's good offices to reconcile <lb/>
            him with the king, his brother, and procure his restoration <lb/>
            to his former honours. The duke readily asssented to his <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Malet is mentioned in the succeeding chapter. For the <lb/>
            rest of these persons, see the notes to b. x. </note> <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XI. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            request, and crossed over to England. The king was in <lb/>
            great wrath when he heard of his coming, and said to his <lb/>
            courtiers and counsellors: " What should I do to my <lb/>
            enemies who presume to intrude upon me, and trespass on <lb/>
            the borders of my kingdom without my licence ? " Various <lb/>
            replies were made, but the king sent some of his own guard <lb/>
            to meet the duke and plainly tell him his mind. The ill­ <lb/>
            advised duke then discovered by private communications <lb/>
            that he had rashly ventured within the bounds of England, <lb/>
            and, unless he followed prudent counsels, he would never <lb/>
            escape from the island in which he was, as it were, enclosed, <lb/>
            and return when he pleased to his own dominions. How­ <lb/>
            ever, the politic king gave orders that the duke should be <lb/>
            honourably conducted to court with his retinue; and their <lb/>
            deep counsels were kept private, lest strangers should detect <lb/>
            any appearance of ill-will betwen the brothers. The duke, <lb/>
            though much terrified, concealed his alarm under an <lb/>
            assumed gaiety, and the king, on his part, dissembled the <lb/>
            fury that raged in his bosom under a smiling countenance. <lb/>
            Among other things1 the king accused the duke of having <lb/>
            violated the treaty, by not punishing public traitors, nor <lb/>
            proceeding with princely rigour against rebels, and that he <lb/>
            had given a gracious reception in Normandy that same year <lb/>
            to Robert de Belèsme, restoring to him his patrimonial <lb/>
            domains, the castle of Argentan, the bishopric of Séez, and <lb/>
            the forest of Gouffern. That butcher having sailed over <lb/>
            to Normandy had obtained the county of Ponthieu in <lb/>
            right of William Talvas, in consequence of the death of <lb/>
            Guy, count of Abbeville, his father-in-law.2 The duke, <lb/>
            alarmed at these reproaches, promised submissively to <lb/>
            remedy all the grievances. He was also induced by the <lb/>
            queen's influence to forego the annual pension of three <lb/>
            thousand pounds, which had been agreed on. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, the king restored him to favour, renewed the late <lb/>
            treaty, and reinstated William de Warrenne in the earldom <lb/>
            of Surrey. The earl, having thus recovered his father's <lb/>
            inheritance, which he had foolishly forfeited, learned wisdom <note type="footnote"> 1 It was probably in this conversation that the king told his brother, ut <lb/>
            comitem, non monachum ageret, to conduct himself like an earl, instead of <lb/>
            behaving like a monk. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Guy I., count of Ponthieu, father-in-law of William Talvas. </note> <lb/>

            from his misfortunes, and afterwards adhered faithfully to <lb/>
            the king during thirty-three years they lived together, <lb/>
            ranking among the chief of his intimate friends.</p>
          <p>Duke Robert now returned to Normandy, an object of <lb/>
            greater contempt to his subjects than he was before, having <lb/>
            gained nothing by his expedition but fear, trouble, and <lb/>
            disgrace. The king, prospering in all his affairs, found <lb/>
            his power greatly augmented, and report spreading his fame <lb/>
            far and wide, he was considered one of the greatest princes <lb/>
            in the four quarters of the globe. No king of England had <lb/>
            been more powerful, nor possessed wider territories within <lb/>
            the island, nor was more favoured by fortune in the acquisi­ <lb/>
            tion of all that mortals need in the fullest abundance.1 If <lb/>
            life be spared me, the sequel of my history will, by God's aid, <lb/>
            clearly exhibit this. He reduced all his enemies to subjec- <note type="footnote"> 1 " Our author prides himself in regarding Henry I. as one of the most <lb/>
            powerful, rich, and successful kings who ever wore the crown of England. <lb/>
            As to the happiness resulting from a quiet conscience and peace of mind, <lb/>
            things still more desirable, it is our duty to remark, that the case was very <lb/>
            different, and that this Lewis of the twelfth century painfully,, expiated, if <lb/>
            not by his remorse, by his violent passions and the terrors of his life, all <lb/>
            the apparent prosperity which, so to speak, dazzled the eyes of his cotem­ <lb/>
            poraries. We cannot too strongly recommend readers who would desire to <lb/>
            form a precise idea of the contrast afforded by Henry's history to consult <lb/>
            a little treatise by Henry of Huntingdon, which is very curious and distin­ <lb/>
            guished for its high philosophical views. It is inserted in the second <lb/>
            volume of the Anglia Sacra, under the title, De episcopis sui temporis. In <lb/>
            this treatise the prosperities of the English monarch are appreciated at their <lb/>
            real worth with great impartiality, but at the same time with lofty views <lb/>
            which would do honour to a modern historian of the first rank. We <lb/>
            exceedingly regret that the limits to which we are compelled to confine <lb/>

            severe a judgment on most of the celebrated persons who were his cotem­ <lb/>

            employed to decide the controversy between Gerard, archbishop of York, <lb/>
            and the abbey of Ripon. He died in 1120. His son, Geoffrey Basset, <lb/>
            was, like his father, justiciary of England. The first person known of this <lb/>
            family appears to be Osmond Basset, a cotemporary with William the <lb/>
            Conqueror, mentioned in the great charter of Montevilliers. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Monasticon Anglicanum shows several charters addressed by <lb/>

            and many others, are examples of what I have stated. <lb/>
            Having acquired wealth and built themselves mansions, they <lb/>
            established a position far beyond that of their fathers, and <lb/>
            often revenged themselves on those who had lorded over <lb/>
            them, by false and unjust accusations. These and many <lb/>
            others of humble birth, whom it would be tedious to men­ <lb/>
            tion individually, were ennobled by the king; his royal <lb/>
            authority raising them from a low estate to the summit of <lb/>
            power, so that they became formidable even to the greatest <lb/>
            nobles.</p>
          <p>While however, King Henry, heaped such munificent re­ <lb/>
            wards on his faithful adherents, he was an implacable <lb/>
            enemy to the disloyal, sparing none who where convicted <lb/>
            from punishment, either in their person, or by fines, or for­ <lb/>
            feiture of their honours. Many criminals had miserable <lb/>
            experience of this, having ended their days in the king's <lb/>
            prisons, from which neither their high connections, or noble <lb/>
            descent, or the offer of an enormous ransom could procure <lb/>
            their release. Robert de Pontefract1 and Robert Malet2 <lb/>
            having been prosecuted in the king's court, were condemned <lb/>
            to forfeit their honours, and depart the realm. Ivo 3 <lb/>
            had set the example of engaging in war on his own account, <lb/>
            and given to the flames the territories of his neighbours, <lb/>
            such private wars being hitherto unknown in England,4 and <lb/>
            being therefore severely punished. Upon this charge <lb/>
            from which he could not clear himself, he was mulct by the <lb/>
            king's stern justice in a heavy fine, and involved in the <lb/>
            deepest trouble and distress. In consequence, the knight <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Laci, lord of Pontefract. See before p. 277. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Robert Malet, son of William Malet one of the companions of the <lb/>

            implored the assistance of Robert Earl of Mellent, one of <lb/>
            Henry's principal counsellors, and was driven by many un­ <lb/>
            happy circumstances to place himself under the earl's pro­ <lb/>
            tection. In the first place, he was galled by the derision <lb/>
            with which he was assailed as one of the rope-dancers, who <lb/>
            had been let down from the walls of Antioch ;1 and besides, <lb/>
            on deep reflection, he was afraid that he should never, or <lb/>
            without great difficulty, reinstate himself in the king's favour <lb/>
            which he had lost.2 He therefore resolved to join the cru­ <lb/>
            sade again, and made an agreement with the earl of Mellent <lb/>
            to the following effect. The earl was to procure his recon­ <lb/>
            ciliation with the king, and to advance him five hundred silver <lb/>
            marks for the expenses of his expedition, having the whole <lb/>
            of Ivo's domains pledged to him as a security for fifteen years. <lb/>
            In consideration of this, the earl was to give the daughter of <lb/>
            his brother Henry, earl of Warwick, in marriage to Ivo's SOIl, <lb/>
            who was yet in his infancy, and to restore him his father's <lb/>
            inheritance. This contract was confirmed by. oath, and <lb/>
            ratified by the king's consent. Ivo then set out on his pil­ <lb/>
            grim age, accompanied by his wife ; but he died on the road, <lb/>
            and his inheritance passed into the hands of strangers.</p>
          <p>The town of Leicester had four masters, the king, the <lb/>
            bishop of Lincoln, Earl Simony and Ivo, son of Hugh. The <lb/>
            earl of Mellent contrived to get a footing in it by the poses­ <lb/>
            sion of Hugh's share, who was chief of the municipality <lb/>
            and viscount, and also farmed the king's fourth of the <lb/>
            borough. By the royal favour and his own address he got <lb/>
            the whole place into his own hands, and being, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence, created an English earl, his wealth and power <lb/>
            surpassed those of any other peer of the realm, and he was <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1102, the tenth indiction, King <lb/>
            Henry summoned the powerful earl, Robert de Belèsme, to <lb/>
            plead in his court to an indictment containing forty-five <lb/>
            counts of offences, in word or act, against himself or his <lb/>
            brother, the duke of Normandy; and the earl was required <lb/>
            to make a distinct answer to each charge. The king had <lb/>
            employed a whole year in having him closely watched, <lb/>
            causing his evil deeds to be carefully inquired into by <lb/>
            secret spies, and reduced to writing with great precision. <lb/>
            Robert demanded licence, as the custom is, for himself and <lb/>
            his friends to attend the trial, and, it being granted, finding <lb/>
            that it was out of his power to clear himself of the charges <lb/>
            alleged, he departed at once, and with his retainers mount­ <lb/>
            ing swift horses, fled with alarm in breathless haste to <lb/>
            his own castles. Meanwhile, the king and his barons were <lb/>
            waiting for Robert's answer, until one of the royal attend­ <lb/>
            ants brought the news of his sudden flight. Henry was <lb/>
            vexed at having been thus duped, but rested sure that the <lb/>
            day of vengeance would soon arrive.</p>
          <p>In consequence, the king publicly branded Robert for <lb/>
            not having legally cleared himself of the crimes with which <note type="footnote"> 1 Elizabeth de Vermandois, niece of Philip I. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Waleran was count de Meulan, or earl of Mellent, after his father. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Robert I, earl of Leicester, surnamed the Hunchback. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Hugh the Poor, earl of Bedford.

            he had been charged in open court, and proclaimed him a <lb/>
            traitor unless he returned, and submitting to judgment, was <lb/>
            ready to do right. The rebel, being once more summoned <lb/>
            to appear in court, gave a flat refusal, and, what is <lb/>
            more, lost no time in adding to the fortifications of his <lb/>
            castles in every quarter by trenches and walls, and in de­ <lb/>
            manding aid from his Norman kinsmen, and the alien <lb/>
            Welsh, and all his allies. The king called out the whole <lb/>
            military array of England, and laying siege to Arundel <lb/>
            castle, which stands near the sea-coast,1 he erected forts, <lb/>
            and stationed his officers in them with bodies of troops for <lb/>
            three months. Meanwhile the garrison of the fortress <lb/>
            humbly requested the king to grant them a truce, that they <lb/>
            might either obtain succour from their lord, or his licence to <lb/>
            give up the place. The king acceding to their proposal, <lb/>
            messengers were despatched to Robert, who was then in <lb/>
            the province of Mercia, and having found him, laid before <lb/>
            him in great distress the severe chastisement with which <lb/>
            the king's attack threatened them. The earl was then <lb/>
            building the very strong castle of Bridgnorth, on the river <lb/>
            Severn, in that country, and trying, in vain, to levy an <lb/>
            auxiliary force, for the purpose of making a resolute de­ <lb/>
            fence. He was deeply grieved at learning the defection of <lb/>
            his vassals at Arundel, but as he could not afford them any <lb/>
            aid, he released them from the fealty they owed him, and <lb/>
            with great reluctance gave them permission to come to <lb/>
            terms with the king. On the return of the messengers, the <lb/>
            garrison of Arundel gladly surrendered the castle into the <lb/>
            king's hands, and were honourably and kindly treated, <lb/>
            receiving large presents. The king then marched his army <lb/>
            to Blithe, a castle formerly belonging to Roger de Buthli,2 <lb/>
            where the garrison came out to meet him with joy, and <lb/>
            acknowledging him as their liege lord, submitted to him <lb/>
            with great readiness. After these events King Henry <lb/>
            allowed his people to enjoy a short interval of repose, and <lb/>
            the great bulk of the nobility found reason to dread his <lb/>
            prudence and valour. <note type="footnote"> 1 Arundel castle, now belonging to the Howards, dukes of Norfolk, <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 1102.] </note> Meanwhile, the king sent envoys to Normandy, bearing <lb/>
            authentic despatches to the duke, informing him that Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme was an outlaw in both countries, having fled <lb/>
            clandestinely from the royal court. He then reminded him <lb/>
            that, according to the treaty they had concluded in England, <lb/>
            they were to unite in punishing traitors with extreme venge­ <lb/>
            ance. The duke therefore summoned to his standard the <lb/>
            military force of Normandy, and laid siege to the castle of <lb/>
            Vignats,1 which was in the keeping of Girard de St. Hilary.2 <lb/>
            The garrison hoped for an assault, being prepared to sur­ <lb/>
            render the place, if the attack was vigorous. They could <lb/>
            not honourably capitulate without fighting, lest they should <lb/>
            justly merit to be branded as disloyal deserters. But the <lb/>
            duke being lost in sloth and indolence, and wanting the <lb/>
            firmness becoming a prince, Robert de Montfort,3 and other <lb/>
            conspirators, who were not in agreement between themselves, <lb/>
            set fire to their encampment, and, throwing the whole army <lb/>
            into confusion, fled of their own accord, though no one pur­ <lb/>
            sued them, compelling others also, who, detesting Robert, <lb/>
            wished his humiliation, to join in their shameful flight. <lb/>
            The garrison of Vignats, witnessing the disgrace of the <lb/>
            Norman army, raised shouts of derision after them as they <lb/>
            ran away, and afterwards, having little to fear, began to <lb/>
            make cruel irruptions into the territory of Oxmes. Robert <lb/>
            de Grantmesnil, Hugh de Montpinçon, and Robert de <lb/>
            Courci,4 with their vassals, made all the resistance in their <lb/>
            power to the savage freebooters, and endeavoured to pro­ <lb/>
            tect their domains. But the outlaws, flushed with their <lb/>
            success in pillaging, became bolder in their attacks, and <lb/>
            proudly boasting of their castles at Gunter, Fourches, and <lb/>

            de Belèsme had retired to Shrewsbury, entrusting the de­ <lb/>
            fence of Bridgnorth to Roger, son of Corbet,2 Robert de <lb/>
            Neuville, and Ulger the hunter,3 with eighty stipendiary <lb/>
            men-at-arms. He had now entered into an alliance with the <lb/>
            Welsh, and attached to his cause, Cadogan and Gervase,4 <lb/>
            sons of Rees, frequently employing the troops to beat up <lb/>
            the quarters of the royal army. He had disinherited <lb/>
            William Pantoul, a brave and experienced knight, and had <lb/>
            even given him a sharp repulse when he proffered his valu­ <lb/>
            able services at the time they were urgently needed. Being <lb/>
            thus rejected with disdain, William Pantulf5 went over to <lb/>
            the king, who, having already proved his vigour of mind, <lb/>
            received him graciously. He gave him the command of two <lb/>
            hundred men, and entrusted to him the custody of Stafford <lb/>
            castle, in the same neighbourhood. This knight proved <lb/>
            Robert de Belèsme's worst enemy, never ceasing from per­ <lb/>
            secuting him both by his counsels and his arms till his ruin <lb/>
            was completed.</p>

            suited together as to the means of reconciling the rebellious <lb/>
            earl to his sovereign. They said among themselves: <lb/>
            " Should the king succeed in crushing this mighty earl and <lb/>
            carry his resentment so far as to disinherit him, as he is <lb/>
            endeavouring to do, he will then trample us all under foot <lb/>
            like feeble women. Let us therefore use our utmost efforts <lb/>
            to plant the seeds of concord between them, that we may <lb/>
            serve in a lawful way both our sovereign and our brother <lb/>
            peer, and thus make both of them our debtors by putting an <lb/>
            end to their quarrels. In consequence, one day they all <lb/>
            went to the king in a body, and earnestly addressing him in <lb/>
            the middle of the camp, used a variety of arguments calcu­ <lb/>
            lated to soften the royal asperity. At that moment there <lb/>
            happened to be some provincial troops, to the number of <lb/>
            three thousand, drawn up on a hill close by, who becoming <lb/>
            aware of the intentions of the nobles, shouted aloud to the <lb/>
            king: " Henry, lord king, trust not these traitors. They are <lb/>
            endeavouring to deceive you, and prevent the vigorous <lb/>
            exercise of your royal justice. Why do you listen to those <lb/>
            who persuade you to pardon a traitor, and let the conspiracy <lb/>
            against your life go unpunished ? For ourselves, we are all <lb/>
            ready to stand by you faithfully and second all your under­ <lb/>
            takings. Press the siege vigorously; close in upon the <lb/>
            traitor on all sides; and make no peace till you take him, <lb/>
            alive or dead."</p>
          <p>The king's resolution was strengthened by the voice of the <lb/>
            people, and returning shortly after listening to them, he <lb/>
            negatived the proposals of the factious nobles. He then <lb/>
            made overtures to the Welsh princes through William Pan­ <lb/>
            tulf, and allured them by presents and promises subtilly used, <lb/>
            to desert the cause of his enemy and join his own with all <lb/>
            their forces. He also sent for three of the principal towns­ <lb/>
            men, and swore to them publicly that unless the place was <lb/>
            surrendered to him within three days he would hang all of <lb/>
            them he could lay his hands on. They were terrified at the <lb/>
            king's violence, and thinking it time to look to their own <lb/>
            safety, sought a conference with William Pantulf, who was <lb/>
            a neighbour of theirs, that they might hear what he advised. <lb/>
            The knight undertook to negotiate between the garrison and <lb/>
            the king, and in persuasive language recommended them to <lb/>
            surrender the fortress to their lawful king, on whose part he <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XI. CH.III. </note> <lb/>
            engaged to augment their funds by granting them lands of <lb/>
            the value of three hundred pounds in annual rent. The <lb/>
            townsmen, having taken into consideration what was for the <lb/>
            common good, agreed to this, and submitted to the royal <lb/>
            pleasure rather than risk their lives by further resistance. <lb/>
            At last, with the king's leave, they sent envoys to Robert de <lb/>
            Belèsme their lord, informing him that they could not hold <lb/>
            out any longer against the attack of the powerful king. The <lb/>
            stipendiary troops were kept in ignorance of the capitulation, <lb/>
            the regular garrison and the burgesses having concluded it, <lb/>
            to save their lives, without consulting the others. When <lb/>
            however they discovered what was thus unexpectedly arranged, <lb/>
            they flew to arms in great dudgeon and tried to render the <lb/>
            negotiation abortive. The garrison soldiers however block­ <lb/>
            aded them in one part of the fortress, and let in the king's <lb/>
            troops, with a royal ensign, amidst the cheers of the towns­ <lb/>
            men. The king, taking into consideration that the stipend­ <lb/>
            iaries had faithfully performed their service to their lord, as <lb/>
            was their duty, gave them free liberty to depart with their <lb/>
            horses and arms. Marching out of the castle in great tribu­ <lb/>
            lation they made public complaints of having been shamefully <lb/>
            outwitted by the garrison and chiefs of the municipality, <lb/>
            protesting before the whole army against their disaster <lb/>
            being considered a slur on the character of stipendiary <lb/>
            troops, and throwing the whole blame on the treachery of <lb/>
            their comrades.</p>
          <p>When Robert do Belèsme received intelligence that the <lb/>
            king had reduced his castle of Bridgnorth, on which he <lb/>
            greatly relied, he was in the greatest distress, and, driven <lb/>
            almost frantic, was at a loss what course to take. The king <lb/>
            now issued orders for his army to march by the Huvel <lb/>
            Hegen,1 and lay siege to Shrewsbury, which stands on a <lb/>
            rising ground washed on three sides by the river Severn. <lb/>
            The road through a wood on this route is called by the <lb/>
            English Huvel Hegen, which in Latin means malum callem <lb/>
            vel vicum (bad road or street.) This road was for a thousand <lb/>
            paces full of holes, and the surface rough with large stones, <lb/>
            and so narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely pass <note type="footnote"> I The literal translation of these words in modern English would be <lb/>

            each other. It was overshadowed on both sides by a thick <lb/>
            wood in which bowmen were placed in ambush ready to <lb/>
            inflict sudden wounds with hissing bolts and arrows on the <lb/>
            troops on their march. There were more than sixty thousand <lb/>
            infantry in the expedition, and the king gave orders that they <lb/>
            should clear a broad track by cutting down the wood with <lb/>
            axes, so that a road might be formed for his own passage <lb/>
            and a public highway for ever afterwards. The royal com­ <lb/>
            mand was promptly performed, and vast numbers of men <lb/>
            being employed, the wood was felled, and a very broad road <lb/>
            levelled through it.</p>
          <p>Robert de Belèsme was extremely terrified when he <lb/>
            heard of Henry's movements, and finding himself surrounded <lb/>
            by perils, was compelled to submit to the humiliation of <lb/>
            imploring pardon from the invincible monarch. The stern <lb/>
            king, however, could not forget the injuries he had received, <lb/>
            and determined to follow up the attack with his powerful <lb/>
            army until he had forced his enemy to surrender at discre­ <lb/>
            tion. At last, Robert was driven to despair by his unhappy <lb/>
            fate, and, after consulting his friends, went to meet the <lb/>
            king as he approached the town, and confessing his treason­ <lb/>
            able offences laid the keys of the place at his feet. Thus <lb/>
            King Henry became master of all the estates of Robert and <lb/>
            his vassals who had joined him in the rebellion, but he <lb/>
            permitted him to retire unmolested, with his horses and <lb/>
            arms, and gave him a safe conduct through England to the <lb/>
            coast. When the banishment of the cruel tyrant was known <lb/>
            all England was in a tumult of joy, and numbers congratu­ <lb/>
            lated the king with flattering words, to this effect: " Rejoice, <lb/>
            King Henry, and return thanks to the Lord your God, for <lb/>
            you began to reign independently from the moment you <lb/>
            reduced Robert de Belèsme to subjection, and drove him out <lb/>
            of your kingdom."</p>
          <p>Robert de Belèsme having been thus expelled, the realm <lb/>
            of Albion enjoyed peace and tranquillity, and during the <lb/>
            thirty-three years of Henry's subsequent reign no one after­ <lb/>
            wards dared to revolt in England, nor held any fortress <lb/>
            against him, Robert crossed over to Normandy boiling <lb/>
            with rage and overwhelmed with grief; and making fierce <lb/>
            attacks on those of his countrymen who had joined the <lb/>
            standard of their weak prince, he chastised them severely <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. XI. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            with fire and sword. For like the dragon mysteriously <lb/>
            described by St. John in the Apocalypse, who, cast forth <lb/>
            from heaven, cruelly vented his wrath on the dwellers upon <lb/>
            the earth, so this bloody butcher when driven from England <lb/>
            spent his fury on the Normans. Sweeping their farms of <lb/>
            all that could be carried off, he devoted them to the flames, and <lb/>
            inflicted the torments of death or mutilation on the soldiers <lb/>
            and others who fell into his hands. Indeed, so great was <lb/>
            his cruelty that he preferred torturing his prisoners to <lb/>
            enriching himself by the large ransoms he might have <lb/>
            obtained.</p>
          <p>Roger of Poitiers and Arnulph, Robert's brother,1 were <lb/>
            wealthy English earls, and through the care of their father, <lb/>
            the earl, Roger de Montgomery, obtained great honours and <lb/>
            domains. Arnulph married the daughter of an Irish king <lb/>
            called Lafracoth in right of whom he aspired to get posses­ <lb/>
            sion of her father's kingdom.2 Insatiable ambition in attempt­ <lb/>
            ing to gain more than is right often forfeits suddenly what <lb/>
            has been justly acquired. The powerful king of England <lb/>
            was so incensed against Robert's whole kindred and race, that <lb/>
            he resolved to root them all out of his dominions. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence he sought favourable opportunities of dealing <lb/>
            harshly with the two brothers, and making vigilant inquiries <lb/>
            into such as occurred, he declared their estates forfeited and <lb/>
            banished them from England. So implacable was his resent­ <lb/>
            ment that the nuns of Almenèches3 were cruelly stripped of <lb/>
            the lands with which Earl Roger the elder had endowed <lb/>
            them, because their abbess, Emma, was sister of the young <lb/>
            earls, and the king granted them to Savaric, son of Chama,4 <lb/>
            in knight-service. <note type="footnote"> 1 See what has been said before of these two brothers of Roger de <lb/>

            houses founded by St. Evroult. After the Normans established themselves <lb/>
            in that country, it was given to the monks of Fécamp by Richard II., and <lb/>
            subsequently ceded by them to Roger de Montgomery who re-established <lb/>

            the state of bitter evil in Normandy, and during three years <lb/>
            endless crimes were perpetrated there. Many villages were <lb/>
            burnt, and the churches, with the inhabitants who fled to <lb/>
            them for refuge as to a mother's bosom, were set on fire. <lb/>
            Almost all Normandy rose in arms against Robert, and there <lb/>
            was a general league to resist his tyranny; but these attempts <lb/>
            proved fruitless, because there was no one of capacity to <lb/>
            take the lead against the powerful freebooter. He had vast <lb/>
            resources and great talents, and the immense wealth he had <lb/>
            been long gathering was laid up in thirty-four strong castles, <lb/>
            which he had formerly erected to support his rebellion. <lb/>
            Having sole possession of nearly the whole of his father's <lb/>
            inheritance, he relinquished no part of it to his brothers, who <lb/>
            had forfeited their English estates through him. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence Roger retired to the castle of Charroux, which he <lb/>
            possessed in right of his wife, and living there till he became <lb/>
            old, left at his death brave sons, who became his heirs.1 <lb/>
            Arnulph, after many thankless enterprises in his brother's <lb/>
            cause, became so indignant, that he went over to the duke,, <lb/>
            to whom he ceded the castle of Almenèches which he had <lb/>
            taken by surprise, and collected about him many of his <lb/>
            brother's partisans.2 In consequence, there were great dis­ <lb/>
            turbances in the district of Séez, many of the provincials <lb/>
            leaving Robert to join Arnulph, and giving up their castles to <lb/>
            the duke's adherents. Robert, thus deserted by his own <lb/>
            brother, suffered such alarms from all quarters that he <lb/>
            scarcely trusted any one, and as he was an object of terror <lb/>
            to all the world, he even doubted the sincerity of those who <lb/>
            still adhered to him. <note type="footnote"> as we have seen before, vol. ii. p. 505. Cane, or Cham, was his mother's <lb/>

          <p>On the approach of the duke's army, Robert drew out his <lb/>
            forces, and after making several false attacks on his inactive <lb/>
            prince, fell upon him with great impetuosity at Challoux,1 <lb/>
            taking William de Conversana,2 brother of the countess <lb/>
            Sibylla, and several other prisoners. The brave Normans <lb/>
            were filled with shame, that after their brilliant victories over <lb/>

            vanquished and put to flight in the bosom of their own <lb/>

            contemplated the conquest of the whole of Normandy. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the country, having no leader, <lb/>
            and not being able to support the cruel tyranny of the <lb/>

            with great reluctance, becoming his adherents from fear <lb/>
            instead of love; and under his protection carried on fierce <lb/>
            hostilities against their neighbours, with whom they were at <lb/>
            variance. The duke's influence being thus on the wane, <lb/>
            Robert still became more formidable, and the lords of the ad­ <lb/>
            jacent fiefs going over to his side, he got possession of the <lb/>

            ordered, and buried at the entrance of the church of the <lb/>
            blessed Virgin Mary, at Longueville.2 His epitaph was <lb/>
            inscribed on the wall, which was ornamented with pictures: <lb/>

            sister of Anselm de Ribemont, and fifteen years after their <lb/>
            marriage gave birth to a son, who was named Walter.1 After <lb/>
            his father's death, she carefully educated him until he arrived <lb/>
            at manhood, and managed his hereditary domains for him <lb/>
            many years with great prudence. This lady, giving way to <lb/>
            the feelings of her sex, formed an affection for Duke Robert, <lb/>
            and entangled him in an illicit connection, by the blandish­ <lb/>
            ments of love. Promising him succour against his enemies, <lb/>
            both from her own resources and those of her powerful <lb/>
            relations, she induced the silly duke to engage that on the <lb/>
            death of his present wife, he would not only marry her, but <lb/>
            entrust to her the government of the whole of Normandy.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards the duchess Sibylla took to her bed, <lb/>
            infected by poison, and died in the season of Lent, to the <lb/>

            They raged so furiously that the duke was unable to marry <lb/>

            January, but was buried at Lire, in the abbey which his <lb/>
            father had founded on his own fief. His nephews William <lb/>
            de Guader1 and Reynold de Grancei2 disputed the succession; <lb/>
            but the Normans chose Eustace, his son by a concubine, <lb/>
            preferring a countryman of their own, although he was a <lb/>
            bastard, to a Burgundian or Breton of legitimate birth. In <lb/>
            consequence, the parties flew to arms with great violence, <lb/>
            and the country was still further desolated. William de <lb/>
            Guader dying soon afterwards Reynold became stronger, <lb/>
            and William earl of Evreux joined with many others in <lb/>

          <p>THE king of England commissioned Robert, earl of Mel­ <lb/>
            lent, to put an end to the intestine divisions of Normandy, <lb/>
            enjoining Duke Robert and the other lords to support his <lb/>
            son-in-law, and oppose his enemies, or-they would otherwise <lb/>
            incur the consequences of his royal indignation. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence many of them, on understanding that Eustace enjoyed <lb/>
            the king's favour, remained quiet, and those who had most <lb/>
            opposed him were the first to render him aid. Reynold, <lb/>
            however, and Groël,3 with other bold men, persisted in their <lb/>
            iniquitous enterprises, and instead of paying any respect to <lb/>
            the royal injunction, refused to desist from their attacks on <lb/>
            the king's son-in-law; and with wicked daring still carried fire <lb/>
            and sword through the country. Among Reynold's other <lb/>
            cruel deeds, having taken by assault one of the enemy's <lb/>

            of each individual, butchered them all without mercy, as if <lb/>
            they had been brute beasts. Becoming universally odious, <lb/>
            principally on account of this barbarity, and Eustace obtaining <lb/>
            signal successes and recovering the whole of his father's fief, <lb/>
            Reynold was driven out of Normandy. On his return to <lb/>
            his native country, he began to plot against William [de <lb/>
            Guader], his elder brother, but, by a just judgment of God, <lb/>
            while he was fomenting disturbances, he fell into his brother's <lb/>
            hands, who threw him into prison, where he suffered the <lb/>
            just punishment of his criminal enterprises.1</p>
          <p>About the same time Goël placed a watch on John,2 son of <lb/>
            Stephen, who lived at Meulan, and seizing him as he was <lb/>
            returning from a conference with the count his lord, who <lb/>
            was then at Beaumont, in Normandy, he kept the avaricious <lb/>
            usurer nearly four months in close prison. The count made <lb/>
            earnest efforts for the liberation of his burgess, who was <lb/>
            extremely rich, but he could not draw him out of the fox's <lb/>
            mouth without the good offices of several lords. The politic <lb/>
            count Robert, therefore concluded a peace with William, <lb/>
            count of Evreux, betrothing his daughter Emma, then only <lb/>
            a year old,3 to William's nephew Amauri. Ralph de Coil­ <lb/>
            ches, Eustace, and Goël, and other belligerent lord marchers <lb/>
            were included in this pacification. In consequence John <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE duke, abandoned to sloth, and perceiving the. country <lb/>
            laid waste, and that he was unable to defend the territories <lb/>
            of his duchy against Robert de Belèsme, broke the engage­ <lb/>
            ment he had made with the king, and without his consent <lb/>
            concluded peace with Robert, restoring to him his patri­ <lb/>
            monial estates, namely the bishopric of Séez, and other <lb/>
            domains before mentioned. In consequence the venerable <lb/>
            Serlo, bishop of Séez,2 rather than submit to Robert's tyranny <lb/>
            and live under his yoke, chose to retire from his bishopric. <lb/>
            Abandoning his see, he became a wanderer in foreign coun­ <lb/>
            tries, and excommunicated Robert and his adherents.</p>
          <p>Robert de Belèsme also persecuted in various ways Ralph <lb/>
            the abbot of Seez, a cheerful, facetious, and amiable person, and <lb/>
            oppressing the vassals of St. Martin.4 The Bishop, with ini­ <lb/>
            quitous exactions, forced the abbot to secede by these unjust <lb/>
            inflictions on his subjects. Thus both bishop and abbot, <lb/>
            weary of the tyrant's yoke, took refuge in England, where <lb/>
            they met a kind reception and comfort from King Henry.</p>
          <p>About this time, the venerable Gundulf, bishop of <lb/>
            Rochester, died, and abbot Ralph was appointed his suc­ <lb/>
            cessor by canonical election. He was consecrated bishop <lb/>
            of Rochester, by Anselm, the reverend archbishop of Can­ <lb/>

            manded towns and villages to be constructed as in other <lb/>
            countries. In consequence the Irish were extremely hostile <lb/>
            to him, and did all in their power to oppose him, using <lb/>
            every device to crush their enemy, either by force or fraud. <lb/>
            Thereupon, the valiant king undertook an expedition against <lb/>
            them, appearing with his fleet on the coast of Ireland. The <lb/>
            Irish, struck with terror at the king's power, called on the <lb/>
            Normans, and Arnulph,1 and his auxiliaries hastened to bring <lb/>
            them succour. But the united forces were awed by the <lb/>
            presence of the formidable Magnus, and not daring to give <lb/>
            him battle consulted how they might best manage to lead <lb/>
            him into a snare by base treachery.</p>
          <p>At last, some smooth-speaking men came to him with <lb/>
            apparent amity, and enticed him on frivolous pretences to <lb/>
            land from his ships and see the country, which they <lb/>
            persuaded him he would be able to subdue with a small <lb/>
            force. Magnus, too easily trusting the traitors, left his armed <lb/>
            troops on the shore, and being conducted two miles by the <lb/>
            traitors fell into the trap which cost him his life. For he <lb/>
            found a large band of his enemies lying in ambush, who <lb/>
            rushed on him from their place of concealment, and the daring <lb/>
            Norwegian, disdaining to fly,. encountered them bravely. <lb/>
            But a handful of men could not withstand the attack of <lb/>
            innumerable assailants. Magnus, setting his back against a <lb/>
            tree, and covered by his shield, hurled his darts against the <lb/>
            enemy, and wounded several of them, but, alas! he fell <lb/>
            overwhelmed by numbers.2</p>
          <p>A rich citizen of Lincoln kept the treasure of king Magnus, <lb/>
            and supplied him with ornaments, plate, arms, furniture, and <lb/>
            whatever else the royal service required. This man, having <note type="footnote"> Ordericus goes on to give some further details of the last in which the <lb/>

            learnt the king's death, hastened home, and trafficking with <lb/>
            the king's treasure, speedily amassed vast wealth.1</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the king of England received the intelligence <lb/>
            that Magnus was slain, with great satisfaction, feeling him­ <lb/>
            self relieved from a great burden, and some time afterwards <lb/>
            required the citizen of Lincoln to give up the late king's <lb/>
            treasure. The merchant at first denied that he had any such <lb/>
            deposit, but the king, having convicted him of the falshood, <lb/>
            suddenly arrested him, and extorted from him, as it is said, <lb/>
            more than twenty thousand pounds of silver.</p>
          <p>The Irish, having tasted the blood of king Magnus and <lb/>
            his followers, became still more savage, and made a sudden at­ <lb/>
            tempt to massacre the Normans. Their king also carried <lb/>
            off his daughter, who was married to Arnulph, and con­ <lb/>
            tracted an illicit union for the wanton with one of his <lb/>
            cousins, resolved to kill Arnulph himself, as the reward of his <lb/>
            alliance; but the knight, discovering the execrable frauds of <lb/>
            this barbarous people, made his escape to his countrymen, and <lb/>
            lived for nearly twenty years afterwards without having any <lb/>
            settled abode. At last, in his old age, having been reconciled <lb/>
            with the king, to outward appearance at least, he married, <lb/>
            and on the morrow of his nuptials fell asleep after a banquet, <lb/>
            and shortly expiring, left the guests to listen to funeral <lb/>

            notice of the mercantile connection which subsisted at that period between <lb/>
            England and Norway. The Northmen had long been the greatest mari­ <lb/>
            time power in Europe, and besides their trade by sea, had commercial <lb/>
            relations with the east. Their merchants were settled in many of the <lb/>
            great towns in England, and particularly in the " Five-Burghs," of which <lb/>
            Lincoln, where this agent of Magnus Barfod is stated to have lived, was <lb/>
            one. He was doubtless of Anglo-Norwegian origin, as almost all the free <lb/>
            people of the north and east of England were. See Warsae's " Danes in <lb/>

          <p>AT the same time, the young Lewis crossed over to England,1 <lb/>
            by his father's leave, with a retinue which though small was <lb/>
            composed of men of ability. The illustrious youth came to <lb/>

            with perfect good will under all circumstances. However, he <lb/>
            was speedily followed by a messenger from his step-mother <lb/>
            Bertrade, who was the bearer of despatches to King Henry <lb/>

            to the Norman yoke, and neither the Conqueror nor his sons were able <lb/>

            advantage of any opportunity of re-establishing their power, so that even so <lb/>
            late as 1138 King Eric-Lam contemplated an invasion. Scarcely was <lb/>
            Henry I. seated on the throne, when it was shaken by the northern rebel­ <lb/>

            summoned his council and had a long consultation on the <lb/>
            affair. The purport of the letter, he had just read, was, that <lb/>
            Philip, king of France, requested him to arrest his son, who <lb/>
            had come over to the English court, and keep him in close <lb/>
            confinement for the rest of his life. Henry, with his usual <lb/>
            sagacity, ably discussed with his faithful barons the folly <lb/>
            and indecency of the demand which the king of France had <lb/>
            addressed to him through his queen's intrigues, and gave a <lb/>
            flat refusal to a proposal altogether so abominable and un­ <lb/>
            worthy of a king, and so repugnant to himself and his nobles.</p>
          <p>William de Buschelai,1 a knight of intelligence, who was in <lb/>
            attendance on Lewis, discovered the affair while it was still <lb/>
            a secret, and, in consequence, although he had not been <lb/>
            summoned to the council, entered the apartment as if for <lb/>
            amusement. The king immediately gave him a gracious <lb/>
            message to Lewis, requesting him to retire quietly from his <lb/>
            court; and sent him back to France, having loaded both the <lb/>
            prince and his companions with munificent presents. Lewis, <lb/>
            discovering his step-mother's perfidy, went to his father in <lb/>
            great wrath, and informed him of the terrible calamity to <lb/>
            which his letter had exposed him in a foreign country. <lb/>
            The king, who knew nothing of the infamous treachery, <lb/>
            denied the whole, and the young prince, boiling with rage, <lb/>
            sought his step-mother's death; she however tried every <lb/>
            means to be before him in the work of destruction, and, <lb/>

            took to his bed, and for many days could neither eat nor sleep. <lb/>
            Almost all the French were in despair at the danger to which <lb/>
            the lawful heir to the crown was exposed. At last, all <lb/>
            remedies adminstered by the French physicians having failed, <lb/>

            among the wisest of the barbarians for their knowledge <lb/>
            acquired by the patient investigation of philosophical truth. <lb/>

          <p>Bertrade was in despair at her step-son's being restored <lb/>
            to health. Fear of the consequences of the injury she had <lb/>
            tried to do him produced hatred, which became daily on the <lb/>
            increase. Sparing no efforts to accomplish her anxiety for <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1104, Henry, king of England, <lb/>
            sailed over to Normandy with a powerful fleet, and visited <lb/>
            Domfront, and the other castles which were under his <lb/>
            dominion,' in great state. He was received honourably <lb/>
            by his principal vassals who made him large presents, fitting <lb/>
            a king. Robert earl of Mellent, and Richard of Chester, <lb/>
            Stephen earl of Aumale, and Henry count d'Eu, Rotrou <lb/>
            count de Mortain, Eustace of Boulogne, Ralph de Conches, <lb/>
            Robert Fitz-Hamon, Robert de Montfort, and Ralph de <lb/>
            Mortemer, with several others, held many lordships under <lb/>
            him in England, and having espoused his cause in Normandy <lb/>
            with their vassals, were ready to have recourse to arms and <lb/>
            support it zealously against all the world. In a few days he <lb/>
            summoned his brother to a conference and accused him, in <lb/>
            the presence of his parasites, with having broken the treaty <lb/>
            they had concluded in England, by making peace without his <lb/>
            consent with Robert de Belèsme, who was a traitor to them <lb/>
            both, restoring to him, contrary to law and justice, the fiefs <lb/>
            held by his father. Henry further reproached the duke with <lb/>
            having by his indolence abetted2 thieves, robbers, and other <lb/>
            malefactors; and having hopelessly abandoned Normandy to <lb/>
            the shameless bullies by whom he was enslaved, and with <lb/>
            filling the office of shepherd and prince to no purpose, <lb/>
            while he did not exercise the powers of government for the <lb/>

            duke had broken the treaty made between the two brothers <lb/>
            in many important particulars which he could not deny, but <lb/>
            excused himself by throwing the blame on his contemptible <lb/>
            associates. In fact he was equally destitute of judgment and <lb/>
            friends, making light of the society and counsels of good <lb/>
            and wise men, and miserably following an opposite course, <lb/>
            to the detriment of his people as well as himself. In the <lb/>
            present embarrased state of his affairs, having advised with <lb/>
            those about him, he implored, as was natural, for the weaker <lb/>
            of the two brothers, the favour of the stronger, and gave <lb/>
            up to him William count of Evreux,1 with his county and <lb/>
            all his vassals; for both Robert and his adherents were <lb/>
            alarmed lest they should be brought to public trial, and the <lb/>
            duke be justly deprived of the duchy which he nominally, <lb/>
            not really, governed, or should have to sustain a formidable <lb/>
            war against his royal brother, to his utter destruction.</p>
          <p>The illustrious count [of Evreux], hearing that he was to <lb/>
            be transferred like a horse or an ox, and wishing to preserve <lb/>
            his integrity and fealty, said publicly to the princes: " I <lb/>
            have served your father faithfully all my days, never having <lb/>
            stained my sworn fealty in any matter hitherto; I have also <lb/>
            observed it to his heir, and determined to use every effort to <lb/>
            continue in the same. But it being impossible, as I have <lb/>
            often heard learned doctors quote from the scripture, and <lb/>
            God himself has declared in the gospel, for any one to <lb/>
            serve in peace two masters who disagree with each other, <lb/>
            it is my earnest desire to be subject to only one lord, lest <lb/>
            being liable to a double service, I shall satisfy neither of <lb/>
            them. I love both the king and the duke; both are the <lb/>
            sons of the king my lord, and I wish to respect both ; but I <lb/>
            will only do homage to one of them, and him I will loyally <lb/>
            serve as my lord." This candid declaration pleased every <lb/>
            one.</p>
          <p>The duke Robert himself placed the count's hand in the <lb/>
            king's; and peace being restored between the brothers, <lb/>
            Henry returned to England before winter. Soon however, <note type="footnote"> 1 William, who was at the battle of Hastings, became count of Evreux <lb/>
            on the death of his father, which happened on the 13th of October, 1067, <lb/>
            and died himself the 18th of April, 1118. He was grandson of Archbishop <lb/>
            Robert, and consequently cousin, one degree removed, from William the <lb/>

            the fierce freebooters renewed their hostile excursions, and <lb/>
            quickly overturned all that the king and great men had <lb/>
            ordered for the good of the country. For Robert de Belèsme <lb/>
            was greatly disturbed at the advantages the king, whom he <lb/>
            cordially hated, had obtained by his journey, and in concert <lb/>
            with his nephew, William, earl of Morton,1 and such others <lb/>
            as he was able to seduce, commenced hostilities against the <lb/>
            king's adherents. In consequence, the evil disposed subjects <lb/>
            in that district were guilty of greater excesses than I can <lb/>
            describe. They presently stained the whole province with <lb/>
            murder and robbery, and, carrying off their booty and putting <lb/>
            the.inhabitants to death, set fire to the houses. The coun­ <lb/>
            try people with their wives and children fled into France, <lb/>
            where they suffered greatly in their exile. Thus the <lb/>
            Normans, who boasted of being the conquerors of the <lb/>
            English and Apulians on their native soil, were now reduced <lb/>
            to labour in misery and sorrow on the fields of France. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, their own gardens, left deserted, were overrun <lb/>
            with thistles and nettles, which covered the ground, for want <lb/>
            of cultivation.</p>

            retired to Normandy, where, guided by the counsels of Robert de Belèsme, <lb/>
            his uncle, he became one of the king's most dangerous enemies. He also <lb/>

            Crossing over to Normandy the spring following, he landed <lb/>
            at the port called Barbaflot, in the last week of Lent, and <lb/>
            on Easter eve,2 found quarters in the village of Carentan, on <lb/>
            the fords of the Vire, where he rested for a while.</p>
          <p>Serlo, the venerable bishop of Séez, met him there, being <lb/>
            the first of the Normans who offered their services to King <lb/>
            Henry; and undertook the celebration of the Paschal solem­ <lb/>
            nities in honour of the King of kings. Entering the church <lb/>
            in company with Henry, and being robed in his sacred vest­ <lb/>
            ments in readiness to commence the holy office, while wait­ <lb/>
            ing patiently the assembling of the people and the royal <lb/>
            household, he observed that the church was encumbered <lb/>
            with the chests of the villagers, and a quantity of implements <lb/>
            and furniture of various kinds. Drawing a deep sigh, he­ <lb/>
            thus poured forth his grief to the king, who had humbly <lb/>
            seated himself with some of his nobles among the peasants' <lb/>
            paniers 3 at the lower end of the church : " The hearts of the <lb/>
            faithful may well be afflicted on observing the humiliation <lb/>
            of the church and the sufferings of the unhappy people. <lb/>
            The spectacle exhibited in this church shows the desolation <lb/>
            to which the Cotentin is subjected. In truth, the whole of <lb/>
            Normandy is a prey to irreligious freebooters, for want of a <lb/>
            fitting ruler. The church of God, which was once called <lb/>
            the house of prayer, is now, as you see, indecently filled <lb/>
            with this vile lumber; and the edifice which ought to be set <lb/>
            apart for the sole purpose of celebrating the divine sacra­ <lb/>
            ments, is, for want of a just protector, become the storehouse <lb/>
            of the people. It is impossible for the congregation to bend <lb/>
            their knees with due reverence before the altar, nor even <lb/>
            stand as they should with ease and devotion in presence of <lb/>
            the Divine Majesty, on account of the heaps of goods <lb/>
            which the defenceless peasants have collected in this house of <lb/>
            God, to save them, in their alarm, from the sons of violence. <lb/>
            The church is thus made the people's stronghold, but even <lb/>

            this, overwhelmed with sorrow, in the presence of God; I <lb/>
            tell it in your ears, my lord king, to inflame your heart with <lb/>
            holy zeal, that you may strive to imitate Phineas,2 Matta­ <lb/>
            thias 3 and his sons. Rouse yourself to action in the name <lb/>
            of the Lord, and with the sword of justice make yourself <lb/>
            master of your father's inheritance, and recover the territory <lb/>
            of your ancestors and the people of God from the dominion or <lb/>
            abandoned men. Your brother Robert is not really in pos­ <lb/>

            duke who ought to guide them in the path of justice, but, <lb/>
            abandoned to sloth, is subservient to William de Conversana, <lb/>
            Hugh de Nonant, the governor of Rouen, Gunhier, his <lb/>
            nephew, and other worthless men. Alas ! he dissipates in <lb/>
            trivial follies the wealth of his noble duchy, while he often <lb/>
            fasts till nones4 for want of bread. The greatest part of <lb/>
            his time he lies in bed, and is prevented from going to <lb/>
            church, because such is his want of clothes, that he has <lb/>
            neither trowsers, stockings, or shoes. The buffoons and <lb/>
            harlots, by whom he is constantly surrounded, carry off his <lb/>
            clothes during the night, while he is drunk and snoring, and <lb/>
            boast with derision that they have robbed the duke. Thus, <lb/>
            the head being sick, the whole body faints, and the prince <lb/>
            Leing weak, the entire country is in peril, and the wretched <lb/>
            people are exposed to all sorts of calamities. From the <lb/>
            time of Rollo, the first of the Normans who ruled in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, from whom you derive your descent, till this weak <lb/>
            prince, Normandy has been governed by powerful dukes. <lb/>

            present, he thus spoke: " In God's name, I will not shrink <lb/>
            from toiling earnestly for the restoration of peace, and with <lb/>
            your aid will use my best endeavours to give tranquillity to <lb/>
            the church."</p>
          <p>The earl of Mellent supported this resolution, and none <lb/>
            of the nobles present dissented from it, but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            joined in earnestly entreating their common father to com­ <lb/>
            mence hostilities with vigour for the general defence of <lb/>
            Normandy against those who were ruining the people.</p>
          <p>The eloquent prelate resumed his sacred discourse, and, <lb/>
            with salutary zeal in his holy office, added: " It is our daily <lb/>
            duty to persevere in discovering the way of life, and to obey <lb/>
            in all things the divine law, which is infallible. Although <lb/>
            we cannot correct all the crimes which are wrought in <lb/>
            secret, at least we should strike with the sword of the <lb/>
            Spirit those which are openly committed against God, and <lb/>
            the offenders should be cut off from amongst us in every <lb/>
            way, according to the commandments of God and the <lb/>
            decrees of the holy fathers. You all wear long hair, in <lb/>
            female fashion, a thing which is unbecoming in you who are <lb/>
            made in the image of God, and ought to exhibit manly <lb/>
            strength. The apostle Paul, the elect vessel, and doctor of <lb/>
            the Gentiles, points out to the Corinthians how indecent <lb/>
            and odious it is for men to wear long hair, saying: ' A mail <lb/>
            ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image <lb/>
            and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.' <lb/>
            And a little afterwards, he adds: ' If a man have long hair it <lb/>
            is a shame unto him ; but if a woman have long hair, it is a <lb/>
            glory to her, for her hair is given her for a covering.'</p>
          <p>" It is not for their ornament or pleasure that penitents <lb/>
            are enjoined not to shave their beards or cut their hair; but <lb/>
            that, as their sins make them appear inwardly rough and <lb/>
            unseemly in the sight of God, so they may in their exterior <lb/>
            exhibit themselves before men unshaven and unshorn, and <lb/>
            mark the deformity of the inner man by their outward <lb/>
            ignominy. By their long beards they make themselves like <lb/>
            goats, whose filthy lasciviousness is shamefully imitated by <lb/>
            fornicators and sodomites, while good men justly treat them <lb/>
            with abhorrence on account of the odious foulness of their <lb/>
            lusts. As for those who nourish their hair, they are con- <note type="footnote"> 1 1 Cor. xi. 7, 14, 15. </note> <pb n="363"/>
            <note type="footnote"> A.D. 1105.] </note> <lb/>
            sidered as fit associates of the women by whose blandish­ <lb/>
            ments they are seduced from manly virtue to evil courses, <lb/>
            and very often involved in the wretchedness of a detestable <lb/>
            apostacy. Alas! see how the salutary medicine which the <lb/>
            doctors of the church, who are spiritual physicians, hereto­ <lb/>
            fore provided, by Divine inspiration, for the cure of souls, <lb/>
            has been used by the sons of perdition, at Satan's instigation, <lb/>
            to fill up the measure of their condemnation, and who by <lb/>
            long use have established the custom. The popes of Rome <lb/>
            and other bishops have prohibited this rash innovation, and <lb/>
            condemned it in their counsels by divine authority, but the <lb/>
            hardened sinners persist in their evil follies, and oppose the <lb/>
            shield of their wickedness to the sword of holy preaching. <lb/>
            They suffer their beards to grow for fear that if they shaved, <lb/>
            the short bristles might prick the faces of their mistresses <lb/>
            when they were kissing them, and are so hairy that they <lb/>
            look like Turks rather than Christians. Thus the personal <lb/>
            neglect which is the mark of penitence is converted into a <lb/>
            token of wantonness! In short these froward sons of Belial <lb/>
            dress their hair like women, while they wear things like <lb/>
            scorpions' tails at the extremities of their feet, thus exhibiting <lb/>
            themselves as women by their effeminacy, and serpents by <lb/>
            their pointed fangs. This kind of men were foretold a <lb/>
            thousand years ago by St. John the mystic, under the figure <lb/>
            of locusts, and he has plainly foreshadowed them in the <lb/>
            Apocalypse, written in the isle of Pathmoth.1 Many persons <lb/>
            adopt this perverted practice from ignorance that there can <lb/>
            be so much mischief in the fashion of wearing the hair in <lb/>
            which they glory.2 For this reason, I beseech you, most <lb/>
            illustrious king, to set your subjects a laudable example, that <lb/>
            they may see in your person, above all others, how they <lb/>
            ought to adjust their own." 3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Another example of the use of the aspirated t or th, mentioned before <lb/>

          <p>The king and all his nobles cheerfully assented to these <lb/>
            observations, upon which the zealous bishop lost no time in <lb/>
            taking a pair of scissors out of his scrip, with which he first <lb/>
            cropped the king's hair with his own hands, and then that <lb/>
            of the count1 and several of his nobles. All the royal house­ <lb/>
            hold and the rest of the congregation contended with each <lb/>
            other who should be cropped first, and, anticipating in alarm <lb/>
            an order from the king, severed the locks which were before <lb/>
            so precious, trampling under foot, like vile refuse, what once <lb/>
            they dearly cherished.</p>
          <p>After having celebrated the feast of Easter, the king of <lb/>
            England sent envoys to Philip, king of France, and summon­ <lb/>

            with which the king and his courtiers submitted ther heads to the bishop's <lb/>

            followed by almost all the other knights, but in the course of a year, all <lb/>

            hardly be suspected of being in the secret of the denouement. The earl <lb/>
            was the moat accomplished gentleman of the age, and all men of fashion <lb/>
            took him for their model, not only in dress, but in their phraseology, and <lb/>
            even in the hour at which their tables were served. In imitation and by <lb/>
            the advice of the emperor Alexius Comnenus, he took only one repast in <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1106, the world saw a variety of <lb/>
            revolutions in the fortunes of princes, and there were several <lb/>
            memorable occurrences in various quarters. In the last <lb/>
            week of February, an extraordinary comet appeared in the <lb/>
            west, which extending its long tail far in the east, struck <lb/>
            terror into the hearts of the multitude, and its brightness <lb/>
            in the evenings, during three weeks, caused the revelation <lb/>
            of many secrets.1</p>
          <p>In the month of March, Duke Bohemond came to France, <lb/>
            in fulfilment of the vow he made to God while he was Dali­ <lb/>
            man's captive, and solemnly accomplished his vow at the <lb/>
            tomb of St. Leonard-the-confessor, in the Limousine <lb/>
            Previous to his arrival in France, he had despatched messen­ <lb/>
            gers to England to inform the king of the reason of his <lb/>
            journey to Italy, and of his desire to cross the sea and visit <lb/>
            his court. The prudent king, however, apprehensive that <lb/>
            Bohemond might induce some of his best knights to leave <lb/>
            his service, sent him word not to risk the danger of a voyage <lb/>
            in the winter, more especially as it was his own intention to <lb/>
            pass over to Normandy before the celebration of Easter, and <note type="footnote"> 1 " On Friday in the first week of Lent, the sixteenth of the calends of <lb/>
            March (February 14), a strange star appeared in the evening, and was seen <lb/>
            at the same hour for fourteen days in the south-western quarter of the <lb/>
            heavens. The body was small and hazy, but the light which shot from it <lb/>
            was of extraordinary brilliance, and it reflected a meteoric brightness from <lb/>
            the east and north. Florence of Worcester, p. 652. As to this meteor, <lb/>
            see L'Histoire des Comètes, t. i. p. 526. </note><note type="footnote"> Ordericus has fallen into an error in fixing its first appearance in the last <lb/>
            week of February. Although some authors have connected the phenome­ <lb/>
            non with the year 1105, the great bulk of testimony favours the date <lb/>
            of 1106, and the circumstantial detail of Friday, 16th of February, fur­ <lb/>
            nished by Florence of Worcester, leaves no doubt that the computation <lb/>
            generally adopted is the right one. and Ordericus agrees with it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has already mentioned this journey of Bohemond (vol. ii. <lb/>

            which is supposed to have been the same as that seen in 1680. The object <lb/>
            of Bohemond's pilgrimage was St. Leonard-le-Noblac, five leagues from <lb/>
            Limoges. His arrival in France did not take place in the month of March, <lb/>
            1106, as Ordericus states, but towards the close of 1105, and he left it in <lb/>

            he was there ; and so it happened.</p>
          <p>In consequence, Bohemond having performed his devo­ <lb/>
            tions and left Noblac,1 where the tomb of the excellent <lb/>
            confessor stands, spent the season of Lent in visiting several <lb/>
            cities and castles in France, and being received in all <lb/>
            quarters both by the clergy and people with great respect, <lb/>
            he related the various events in which he had taken part. <lb/>
            He reverently offered on the holy altars, relics; and mantles <lb/>
            made entirely of silk, and other precious objects, and, de­ <lb/>
            lighting in the attentions paid him in the monasteries and <lb/>
            bishops' seats, returned thanks to God for the welcome <lb/>
            given him by the people of the West. He was accompanied <lb/>
            by the son of the Emperor Diogenes,2 and other eminent <lb/>
            men from Greece and Thrace, whose accusation of the <lb/>
            emperor Alexius for his treasonable usurpation of their <lb/>
            hereditary throne roused the fury of the fierce Franks <lb/>

            the holy font in baptism, and gave them his own name. <lb/>
            His own baptismal name was Mark, but his father, having <lb/>
            heard the story of the giant Bohemond3 in the merriment of <lb/>
            a convivial meeting, jocularly called his son by the giant's <lb/>
            name. It was afterwards spread throughout the world, and <lb/>
            in the mouths of numbers in the three climates of the globe. <lb/>
            From thenceforth this name, which was seldom adopted <lb/>

            the altar for the purpose of reverently receiving the <lb/>
            eucharist, the priest took the consecrated wafer in his hand <lb/>
            for the purpose of putting it into the communicant's open <lb/>
            mouth, but found that he was quite unable to'lift his hand <lb/>
            from the altar. In this dilemma, both parties were ex­ <lb/>

            " Take it, if you can ; for myself, it is out of my power to <lb/>
            move my hand and deliver the Lord's body to you." Upon <lb/>
            this the knight stretched his neck over the altar, with some <lb/>
            effort reached the chalice, and received the host in his open <lb/>
            mouth from the priest's hand. This extraordinary occur­ <lb/>
            rence covered him with confusion, and not knowing what <lb/>

          <p>Three years after he undertook the government, Geoffrey <lb/>

            shot the brave young prince while he was holding a conference <lb/>

            of justice in the arm. The legitimate defender of his <lb/>

            year. The plethoric king of France,' being informed of this <lb/>
            outrage, was greatly displeased, and employed both entreaties <lb/>

            power before long, attended by only a few followers, and <lb/>
            the Normans were to be prepared to lay hands on the king. <lb/>
            This treachery having been planned, abbot Robert went to <lb/>
            Caen and meeting the king said to him in a friendly manner, <lb/>
            “ If you will come with me, I will put into your hands the <lb/>

            pleased with this offer, the abbot added: " It is not requisite <lb/>
            that you should bring an army with you, for such numbers <lb/>
            would occasion a great noise and might be an obstacle to <lb/>
            our enterprise. I have only a small garrison in the place, <lb/>
            and they are entirely devoted to me."</p>

            at the head of seven hundred horsemen rode all night and at <lb/>
            day break found himself near the place. Meanwhile, Rey­ <lb/>
            nold de Warrenne 2 and the young Robert d'Estoteville,3 with <lb/>
            one hundred and forty men-at-arms, had increased the garri­ <lb/>

            him with shouts of laughter and abuse. They were also <lb/>
            followed by many other troops from Falaise and other castles <lb/>

            could to return to Falaise. The victorious king pursued <lb/>
            their steps, but no one ventured to sally forth and encounter <lb/>
            him. Evil fell upon them deservedly, according to what the <lb/>
            apostle says. " If any man defile the temple of God, him <lb/>
            shall God destroy.”1 Behold they had converted the <lb/>
            house of God into a den of thieves, irreverently polluting it <lb/>
            with the dung of men and horses, and they met the fate they <lb/>
            merited by the sword or devouring flame.</p>
          <p>The traitor Robert was taken, and having been thrown <lb/>
            across a horse like a sack, was brought before the king, <lb/>
            who said to him: " Traitor, begone from my territories : <lb/>

            you wear, I would have you this moment torn limb from <lb/>

            submit to the poverty and quiet of a monk in a cloister, he <lb/>
            obtained the office of provost of Argenteuil.2 In the course <lb/>

          <p>THE autumn of this year in Normandy was marked by <lb/>
            thunder storms and violent rains as well as battles, and <lb/>
            the flames of war, fanned by a variety of circumstances, burst <lb/>

            selves to Robert the duke, and fearing the king too much to <lb/>

            chebrai,1 and stationed in it Thomas de St. Jean,3 with a large <lb/>
            body of horse and foot to check the sallies of the garrison. <lb/>
            William, earl of Morton, to whom the place belonged, col­ <lb/>
            lected a gallant band of troops, and threw into it a convoy <lb/>
            of provisions and other things of which he knew the besieged <lb/>
            were in need, in sight of the royal army, and to their great <lb/>
            annoyance. He caused the green corn to be cut in the fields:! <lb/>
            and supplied to the garrison as forage for the horses. The <lb/>
            activity of this young nobleman was such, and he possessed <lb/>
            so large a share of military skill, that the royal army engaged <lb/>
            in the siege could not venture out of their intrenchments <lb/>
            and engage with his troops to intercept the relief they threw <lb/>
            into the fortress. On receiving intelligence of this the king <lb/>
            was very indignant, and took measures for a more determined <lb/>
            attack on the enemy. In consequence he united his troops <lb/>
            before Tinchebrai, and pressed the siege for some time.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, William earl of Morton, <lb/>
            claimed the aid of the duke, and of Robert de Belèsme and <lb/>
            his other friends, and speedly obtained succour against the <lb/>
            king. The duke having assembled an army, required his <lb/>
            brother to raise the siege of a place which lay in his terri­ <lb/>
            tories, or otherwise he challenged him to battle. The king <lb/>
            however, persisted in carrying on the siege, and accepted <lb/>
            the duke's hostility, though it was worse than a civil war, <lb/>
            in order to secure peace for the future. There were four <lb/>
            counts in the royal army, Elias of Maine, William of Evreux, <lb/>
            Robert de Mellent, and William de Warrenne, with several <lb/>
            great barons, viz.: Ranulf of Bayeux,4 Ralph de Conches, <lb/>
            Robert de Montfort, Robert de Grantmesnil, and several <lb/>
            others, with their vassals. On the other side, Duke <lb/>

            contained a more numerous body of infantry. In the oppo­ <lb/>

            arrayed on different sides, and some of them were ready <lb/>
            to exchange blows with each other. Some treacherous <lb/>
            deserters were also under arms, but they were not firm in <lb/>
            their adhesion to the duke, and in their disaffection thought <lb/>
            more of flight than resistance.</p>
          <p>Several men of religion interfered to prevent so horrible <lb/>
            a conflict, dreading to be witnesses of brothers shedding <lb/>
            each other's blood. Especially Vitalis the hermit,1 who <lb/>
            was considered one of the most venerable persons of the <lb/>
            times, was more zealous than the rest, and interposing as <lb/>
            arbiter between the contending brothers, boldly interdicted <lb/>
            them from a single combat, lest the tragedy of the sons of <lb/>
            Œdipus, the horror of all ages, should be again acted, and <lb/>
            the fearful and accursed fate of Eteocles and Polynices <lb/>
            should justly become theirs.</p>
          <p>At length the king carefully reviewed the complicated <lb/>
            state of affairs, and, having collected the opinions of his sage <lb/>
            advisers, reflected deeply on their various counsels. He <lb/>
            then sent à message to his brother of the following tenor: <lb/>
            “ My brother," he said, " I have not come here actuated <lb/>
            by worldly ambitiou, nor did I propose to deprive you of <lb/>
            your rights in the duchy, but, in answer to the sorrowful <lb/>
            complaints of the poor, my desire is to succour the church <lb/>
            of God, which is like a vessel without a pilot, in peril <lb/>

            care or trouble, and I will pay you annually out of the <lb/>
            treasury of England, a sum equivalent to the revenue of the <lb/>
            moiety ceded to me. After that you may revel in feasts <lb/>
            and sports and all such delights with perfect security. As <lb/>
            for me, I shall submit to the toils required for the main­ <lb/>

            of God.”1</p>
          <p>On receiving this message, the duke summoned his coun­ <lb/>
            sellors, and laid before them the king's proposals, which <lb/>
            they unhesitatingly rejected, and deterred the duke by their <lb/>
            violent language from listening to the conditions of peace. <lb/>
            The royal ambassadors having announced on their return <lb/>
            that the duke and his adherents preferred war at all hazards <lb/>
            rather than peace, the king commending himself to God, said: <lb/>
            " God Almighty, in whom I trust, knows that I fight this <lb/>
            battle on behalf of his suffering people. I implore our <lb/>
            Maker, from the bottom of my heart, to grant the victory <lb/>

            duke, even the loss of the battle of Tinchebrai and his long and close cap­ <lb/>
            tivity were considered the just punishment of his crime of treason against <lb/>
            the Divine Majesty. Henry I. made good use of this prejudice, as if the <lb/>
            refusal did not arise from a sense of his own want of ability and judgment, <lb/>
            which rendered him unfit for a post surrounded by so many difficulties and <lb/>
            dangers. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 William of Malmesbury says of the Bretons (whom he calls the <lb/>

            Castle-St. Michael, they being a people who, suffering much want in their own <lb/>
            country, were always ready to sell their services abroad (Hist. b. v.). These <lb/>
            lawless bands were the scourge of Normandy and England, having no <lb/>
            respect either for the persons or the property of the ecclesiastics. They were <lb/>
            particularly addicted to stealing the horses belonging to the clergy, appro­ <lb/>

            Elias made a rapid charge with his auxiliaries on the flank <lb/>
            of the duke's ill-armed infantry, in which two hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-five of them presently fell. As soon as Robert de <lb/>

          <p>Then Baudri seized the duke and delivered him to the <lb/>
            king's guards. This man was one of Henry's chaplains, who <lb/>
            joining a body of knights took part in the battle. He was <lb/>
            shortly afterwards made bishop of Laon, but having deeply <lb/>
            aggrieved the people of his'diocese, he was killed by the <lb/>
            inhabitants of his own city, in a garden, on Friday in Easter <lb/>

            duke, with great part of their troops, fought on foot that they might make <lb/>
            a determined stand, but the Breton knights bore down on the flank of <lb/>
            the duke's army, which, unable to sustain the shock, was presently routed." <lb/>

            was confirmed in his see. But as he was grossly ignorant, associated only <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">A.D. 1106.] </note>The Bretons, on their side, took William earl of Morton,1 <lb/>
            and the king and his friends had great difficulty in getting <lb/>
            him out of their hands. Robert d'Estoteville, William de <lb/>
            Ferrers, and many others were taken prisoners, some on <unclear/> <lb/>
            whom were released by the king's favour, and rejoiced in <lb/>
            the recovery of their liberty, while others, for their offences, <lb/>
            were detained in prison till the day of their death.</p>
          <p>The king, having gained the victory, re-assembled his <lb/>
            troops, made a prudent disposition of affairs, and gave orders <lb/>
            for the strict custody of his captive enemies. The duke <lb/>
            Robert thus addressed him : " Some Norman traitors led me <lb/>
            astray by their perfidious counsels, and deterred me, my <lb/>
            brother, from following your advice, which it would have <lb/>
            been really to my advantage to have embraced. I begged <lb/>
            the people of Falaise, when I left them, not to surrender the <lb/>
            fortress to any one but myself or William de Ferrers, whose <lb/>
            fidelity to me I have never had reason to doubt. Now there­ <lb/>
            fore, my brother, lose no time in sending William to receive <lb/>
            the surrender of the place lest Robert de Belèsme should <lb/>
            forestall you by some stratagem, and being the first to get <lb/>
            possession of this strong fortress, hold it long against you." <lb/>
            Henry led his brother with him in a friendly manner, but <lb/>
            with due caution, and immediately despatched William de <lb/>
            Ferrers to obtain possession of the castle. The king him­ <lb/>
            self, quickly following, made a hasty march to Falaise, <lb/>
            and, by the duke's own order, the fortress was put into his <lb/>
            hands, and the burgesses paid him fealty. They then pre­ <lb/>
            sented to him the young William, who was brought up in <lb/>
            that place, and the king, looking with an eye of compassion <lb/>
            on the boy, who, trembling with fear, was exposed to <lb/>
            such misfortunes in his tender years, comforted him with <lb/>
            promises of kindness. Afterwards to prevent occasion for <lb/>
            calumny, if any mischance should befall the lad while he was <note type="footnote"> of Laon, he was massacred in a popular tumult on Tuesday, the 2'2nd of <lb/>
            AprL, I ' 2, and his body having been subjected to a thousand outrages, <lb/>
            was left naked in the public street till the next day. He was at length <lb/>

            guardianship, and entrusted his education to Elias de St. <lb/>
            Saens.1 For the duke had some time before given his <lb/>
            daughter, by a concubine, in marriage to that knight, and <lb/>
            granting to him the county of Arques,2 made him rank high <lb/>
            among the barons of Normandy.</p>
          <p>The clergy felt exceeding joy on receiving intelligence of <lb/>
            the king's victory, while all who set the law at defiance, and <lb/>
            were abandoned to evil courses, were filled with sorrow and <lb/>
            dismay, knowing well that a yoke they could not shake off was <lb/>
            now imposed by Heaven on their stubborn necks. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the factious free-booters finding that the king who <lb/>
            had already proved a stern administrator of justice, had by <lb/>
            God's aid defeated his enemies in the battle, were so convinced <lb/>
            of his great qualities that they immediately dispersed into <lb/>
            various retreats, and ceased from their outrages from mere <lb/>
            dread of his name. The bands of robbers thus scattered, <lb/>
            even changed their dress in order to escape being recognized <lb/>
            by those they had before oppressed.</p>
          <p>The king proceeded to Rouen, accompanied by the duke, <lb/>
            and the citizens receiving him with acclamations, he restored <lb/>
            the laws of the Conqueror, and re-established the ancient <lb/>
            privileges of the city. Hugh de Nonant, by the duke's orders <lb/>
            surrendered the castle of Rouen into the king's hands, and <lb/>
            recovering his own domains by the king's assistance from <lb/>
            Robert de Belèsme, who had violently usurped them, he held <lb/>
            them free from disturbance for the rest'of his life. The <lb/>
            other lords of castles throughout the whole of Normandy <lb/>
            were released by the duke from their fealty to him, and, with <lb/>
            his consent, transferred them to the victorious king, with <lb/>
            whom they were reconciled.</p>

            who holds in chains the prince, who is my liege-lord, and, <lb/>
            what is more, his own. I am still in possession of thirty <lb/>
            four castles, which are strongly fortified, and from whence I <lb/>
            can assuredly infest the usurper with most harassing irrup­ <lb/>
            tions. I only require your aid to enable me to succour my <lb/>
            captive lord, and restore to him or to his heir the duchy of <lb/>
            Normandy.</p>
          <p>Elias replied to this application in the following words: <lb/>
            "Every prudent man should be careful, in the first instance, <lb/>
            not to enter on any undertaking which he cannot or should <lb/>
            not carry into effect. Again, it is his duty not to attempt to <lb/>
            raise any one to an elevation of which he is not worthy, or <lb/>
            place him in command over others, who cannot rule himself. <lb/>
            For as the common proverb says: 'He who tries to support <lb/>
            a fool's pretensions, has the presumption to contend with <lb/>
            God.' I am in alliance with King Henry, and I can find no <lb/>
            pretence for severing it. I have no desire to give causeless <lb/>
            offence to so powerful a prince, and I ought not to listen to <lb/>
            you or any one else in this affair. He is endowed with <lb/>
            judgment, power, and wealth, and there is no one in my <lb/>
            opinion, who is his equal in these western countries. If, as <lb/>
            you assert, he has made war on his elder brother and his <lb/>
            superior lord, he was driven to it by imperious necessity, and <lb/>
            has been called in by the prayers of the churchmen who <lb/>
            were miserably persecuted by accursed ruffians. Moreover, <lb/>
            to adopt a phrase which is in daily use: 'One must do evil <lb/>
            to prevent what is still worse.' I speak thus according to <lb/>
            the vulgar proverb, but do not mean to claim divine autho­ <lb/>
            rity for it. For once there has been a battle between two <lb/>
            brothers, that those everlasting conflicts which made the <lb/>
            land drunk with the blood of her sons may for ever cease. <lb/>
            From the moment the duke returned from Jerusalem and <lb/>
            resumed the government of the duchy of Normandy, he <lb/>
            abandoned himself to an idle and careless life. Encouraged <lb/>
            by his indolence, the enemies of order have insufferably <lb/>
            devastated Normandy by their ravages, both clandestinely <lb/>
            and in the face of day, and our holy mother church has been <lb/>
            for six years exposed to grievous losses by fire and pillage. <lb/>
            In consequence crowds of poor people have been driven to <pb n="385"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1106.] </note> <lb/>
            to seek refuge in foreign countries, and the converts of <lb/>
            the monks have been spoiled of the property and possessions, <lb/>
            with which they were endowed by pious barons. No one <lb/>
            escaped the violence of these lawless men; distress and <lb/>
            alarm universally prevailed. The flood of evils continually <lb/>
            increasing, almost all reverence for divine worship was lost. <lb/>
            It is needless to dwell on this melancholy state of affairs. <lb/>
            In various parts of Normandy we witness the churches burnt, <lb/>
            the dioceses depopulated of the parishioners, and the cities <lb/>
            and villages in all quarters a prey to disorders and cala­ <lb/>
            mities. It is you and your fellows who have ruined this <lb/>
            noble province, and roused the anger of God against your­ <lb/>
            selves. It is by God's righteous providence that victory <lb/>
            has been divinely vouchsafed to the guardians of peace and <lb/>
            justice, and that their adversaries have been utterly crushed. <lb/>
            I can by no means agree to revolt against King Henry, lest <lb/>
            I should offend the Almighty who is evidently his protector, <lb/>
            and provoke his wrath against myself. If however, aban­ <lb/>
            doning your evil courses and crooked policy, you are desirous <lb/>
            of conciliating the favour of this powerful monarch, you may <lb/>
            rely on my readiness to become a mediator with him on <lb/>
            your behalf."</p>
          <p>Robert de Belèsme, finding Elias inflexible in his resolu­ <lb/>

            duchy of Normandy as well as his kingdom of England with <lb/>
            a firm hand, being to the end of his days careful to maintain <lb/>
            peace; and though he enjoyed his prosperity according to <lb/>
            his own pleasure, he never faltered in his stern career and <lb/>
            the severity with which he administered justice. His able <lb/>
            policy enabled him to keep the greatest nobles and lords of <lb/>
            castles, and the most turbulent barons, in due subjection, <lb/>
            while he was at all times ready to encourage and protect his <lb/>
            peaceable subjects, the men of the church and the commons of <lb/>
            the land. His power being established on both sides of the <lb/>
            channel in the eighth year of his reign,' it was his constant <lb/>
            endeavour to procure peace for the populations under his rule, <lb/>
            and he rigorously punished offenders against whom he <lb/>
            enacted severe laws. Surrounded by all the indulgences <lb/>
            which his vast wealth could procure, he was criminally ad­ <lb/>
            dicted to one vice from the days of his youth until he was <lb/>
            advanced in years, having had several sons and daughters by <lb/>

            meantime both they and their horses were maintained by <lb/>
            Bohemond's liberality. He supported so many troops for <lb/>
            two years that he exhausted his treasury; providing also <lb/>
            cheerfully ships for all without any passage money. He <lb/>
            gave a hearty welcome to Robert de Montfort, and not <lb/>

            he was hereditary marshal of Normandy8 the duke gave <lb/>

            abundant provisions out of his revenues, so that a powerful <lb/>
            armament was prepared for making war on the emperor. At <lb/>

            destine intelligence by which they might avoid their imi­ <lb/>
            nent danger. In this manner Bohemond and his army were <lb/>
            long deceived by the treachery of his friends, and provisions <lb/>
            begining to fail, the crusaders dwindled away in a foreign <lb/>
            land. At length, not being able to endure the severe famine, <lb/>
            they deserted in small bands, and dispersing through Mace­ <lb/>

            of either remaining in his service, or departing where they <lb/>
            pleased. Many of them partook of his ample donations, and <lb/>

          <p>Bohemond was much distressed on finding that he could <lb/>
            not accomplish his vast designs, but although daily pressed <lb/>
            by his comrades to seek the emperor's favour, he long refused. <lb/>
            They argued thus: "We are paying the penalty of our own <lb/>

            native country and beyond our strength, and having pre­ <lb/>

            of ruling in the teritories of another prince to engage in this <lb/>
            arduous enterprise, and, as for us, the love of money has led <lb/>
            us to undergo the burden of toils and battles. But as God <lb/>
            is not mocked, and his judgments fail not, nor does he sub­ <lb/>
            vert justice, he has heard with favour the prayers of those <lb/>
            who cry to him against us in Greece, and has dispersed our <lb/>

            without waiting for the arrival of Baldwin, king of Jeru­ <lb/>

            and brave knight, but inferior to his two predecessors, being <lb/>

            while he was besieging Maubeg,1 and breathing slaughter <lb/>

            line with several others intended to go to Rages, and there <lb/>
            celebrate the solemnities of Easter. He therefore cautiously <lb/>

            ers Josceline de Turbessel and Waleran de Puiset, who were <lb/>
            in advance of the other Christians. Then he concealed him­ <lb/>
            self with his troops, like a wolf, in a dense olive grove, <lb/>
            lying in ambush at Ponte-Torres on the Euphrates, on the <lb/>
            Saturday of Easter, and waiting for King Baldwin, who was <lb/>
            uninformed of what had happened to his friends who pre­ <lb/>
            ceded him. The insidious enemy on the watch first saw the <lb/>
            chaplains and some common people who were unarmed, but, <lb/>
            looking out sharply for a worthier prize, he allowed them to <lb/>
            pass without molestation. The king following without sus­ <lb/>
            picion at the head of thirty-five horsemen, was immediately <lb/>
            seized, and the infidel commander then let loose all his <lb/>
            squadrons like savage tigers on the unarmed crowd, and <lb/>
            commanded the whole to be put to death on the spot. All <lb/>
            these therefore, with the king's chaplains who were in front, <lb/>
            were butchered like sheep on the Saturday of Easter.</p>
          <p>Balad, exulting in his great success, conducted the king <lb/>
            and the knights as prisoners to Charran, and then to <lb/>
            Carpetra,3 where they were confined a long time. This place <lb/>

            one of the first, in the whole world, of those fortresses which <lb/>
            are the strength of tryants.</p>
          <p>In this citadel King Baldwin, with Josceline and Waleran, <lb/>
            Pons de Gavarret, the viscount, the young knight Gervase, <lb/>
            Guiumar the Breton, son of count Alan,1 and thirty-two <lb/>
            knights were confined together for a whole year, as well as <lb/>
            forty Armenian and Syrian Christians who were already <lb/>
            captives there.</p>
          <p>Balad committed the custody of the citadel and the <lb/>
            prisoners to three hundred and fifty soldiers, and ordered the <lb/>
            king to be tortured by fasting, to compel him to yield up the <lb/>
            fortresses which were most desirable. The rest of the <lb/>
            prisoners were employed, under guard, in various works and <lb/>
            daily labours. Balad then levied a numerous army and led <lb/>
            them without delay against the Christian states, whom he <lb/>
            expected to find at his mercy in the absence of their chiefs. <lb/>
            Having laid siege to the castle of Sardanas, near Antioch, he <lb/>
            blockaded the place for a long time, but the mighty God of <lb/>
            Sabaoth protecting the garrison, he could not reduce it.</p>
          <p>Mean while the captives were in servitude to their Gentile <lb/>
            keepers, and obeyed their orders, chained by one of their <lb/>
            feet. They fetched water daily from the Euphrates, at the <lb/>
            distance of a mile, and performed cheerfully other tasks which <lb/>
            were enjoined them. The Gentiles treated them kindly as <lb/>
            they would do good beasts of burden, and finding them useful <lb/>
            artificers and workmen, fed them well that their strength <lb/>
            might not fail. King Baldwin only and Josceline were in­ <lb/>
            dulged with repose, but they were strictly guarded. By <lb/>
            Balad's orders, the king was only allowed food on Sunday <lb/>
            and Friday in every week, and then he gave a meal to the <lb/>
            three hundred and fifty soldiers who composed his guard. <lb/>
            Not only so, but he provided subsistence in great plenty for <lb/>
            his companions in captivity, as well as the forty prisoners <lb/>
            he found in the castle; exhibiting thus a royal munificence, <lb/>
            and at the same time securing the good opinion of the guards. <lb/>
            This liberality was a great advantage to the captives, for the <lb/>
            gentile soldiers treated them with respect, and, contrary to <lb/>
            the orders,of Balad, often privately supplied the king with <note type="footnote"> 1 We know of no son of Alan Fergan called Guiumar, which appears <lb/>

          <p>The crafty Gentiles were sometimes favourably disposed <lb/>
            towards the Christians, but perish for ever their accursed <lb/>
            faith! Twice during their solemn festivals they dragged from <lb/>
            the prison two knights chosen by lot, and binding them to <lb/>
            stakes shot their arrows at them till they fell amidst the <lb/>
            je9rs of the Gentiles.</p>
          <p>At this sight the captives were sorely troubled, and pre­ <lb/>
            ferred a noble death to life in so much misery. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, at the expiration of a year, the Christians roused <lb/>
            themselves to a bold enterprise, and one Sunday, when the <lb/>
            guards had made a plentiful meal provided by the king, they <lb/>
            enticed them to drink till they were intoxicated. As the <lb/>
            Pagans fell asleep, the Franks seized their arms, and being <lb/>
            joined by the forty Armenian and Syrian Christians who <lb/>
            had been long in captivity, slew all the Turks, and having <lb/>
            thus disposed of their guards, took posession of the entire <lb/>
            fortress. The next day they made a bold irruption into <lb/>
            the city, and putting several thousand Pagans to the sword, <lb/>
            carried off the booty they pillaged into the castle, the strong <lb/>
            fortifications of which protected them for nearly eight <lb/>
            months. They then dispatched Josceline and Geoffrey le <lb/>
            Grêle, to demand succour from all the Christian states.1</p>
          <p>About this time, the queen of Jerusalem, who was an <lb/>
            Armenian by birth, employed a hundred chosen men of her <lb/>
            own race to disguise themselves as Turks in their dress and <lb/>

            the captives were delivered by the Armenians in disguise sent by Morphia <lb/>

            into the castle, and being well versed in the language and <lb/>
            manners of the Turks rendered great assistance to the <lb/>
            Franks.</p>
          <p>Josceline and Geoffrey, having to explore a road with which <lb/>
            they were unacquainted, and fearing, in a strange country, all <lb/>
            alike as enemies, chanced to fall in with a peasant who, with <lb/>
            his wife mounted on a little ass, was journeying from <lb/>
            Mesopotamia to Syria. As they travelled and talked together, <lb/>
            the peasant soon recognized Josceline, who, though a valiant <lb/>
            warrior, became so alarmed at the barbarian's assertion, that <lb/>
            he told him he was under a mistake. The Pagan however <lb/>
            said to him: " Your denial is useless, brave knight, for I <lb/>
            know you are Josceline, formerly my own master; I have been <lb/>
            often employed in your household, and was glad to do the <lb/>
            bidding of your humblest servants. I fetched water and <lb/>
            lit fires, receiving from your bounty food and clothing like <lb/>
            the rest of your domestics. After some years, I went among <lb/>
            my Turkish relations, and am now leaving them again, <lb/>
            infidels as they are, intending to rejoin the Christians, under <lb/>
            whom I lived more happily'than with my own kinsmen and <lb/>
            country folk. I have heard, worthy sir, of your misfortunes, <lb/>
            and long and heartily grieved at the disaster which befel you <lb/>
            and your friends. Now that you are released from captivity <lb/>
            and on the way to your own country, I will be your faithful <lb/>
            attendant, and guide you on the road to Antioch." The <lb/>
            Pagan conversing in this manner, with much more to the same <lb/>
            purpose, Josceline was highly delighted with his companion. <lb/>
            They forthwith exchanged clothes, the barbarian taking the <lb/>
            lead as master, and conversing with those they met on the <lb/>
            road, while the two Christian knights followed like vile slaves, <lb/>
            silently praying to the King of Sabaoth for their mutual <lb/>
            safety. They cheerfully carried in their arms by turns the <lb/>
            Saracen's little daughter, who was six years old, and thus <lb/>
            passed through the fortified places and towns without being <lb/>
            recognized.</p>
          <p>Listen now to what befel those who were left in extreme <lb/>
            peril at Karpout. There were three of Balad's wives con­ <lb/>
            cealed in the castle, whose existence the Christians did not <lb/>
            discover for fifteen days. Fatima, daughter of All, king of <lb/>
            the Medes, was the most distinguished of these ladies for <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XI. CH.XXVI."/> <lb/>
            beauty and rank; the second was the daughter of Roduan <lb/>
            of Aleppo, and the third of the emir of Caloiambar. The <lb/>
            daughter of Roduan wrote a letter to her husband who was <lb/>
            besieging Sardanas with a hundred thousand troops, and <lb/>
            fastening it to the neck of a carrier-pigeon, let loose the <lb/>
            bird from the summit of the tower. In this letter she gave <lb/>
            a particular account of the seizure of the castle, the massacre <lb/>
            of the guards, and the devastation of the country. As soon <lb/>
            therefore as Balad received this intelligence, he raised the <lb/>
            siege of Sardanas in violent alarm, and returning hastily to <lb/>
            Karpout collected forces from all quarters and blockaded it <lb/>
            during eight months.</p>
          <p>At this time Josceline and his companions passed through <lb/>
            the camp of Balad without being recognized, and arriving at <lb/>
            home richly rewarded his guide. Causing the whole family <lb/>
            to be regenerated in the waters of baptism, he conferred <lb/>
            great wealth on the husband and wife, and, as for the girl he <lb/>
            had carried in his arms and thus passed undiscovered through <lb/>
            the gentile tribes, he espoused her honorably to a Christian <lb/>
            knight.1</p>
          <p>Balad besieged Karpout for a long time with a numerous <lb/>
            army, but Baldwin and his followers gallantly resisted all <lb/>
            their attacks. The citadel contained a number of spacious <lb/>
            and elegant apartments, and chambers within the main walls <lb/>
            in which vast treasures were deposited, consisting of gold and <lb/>
            silver, precious stones, purple and silk, and all kinds of valua-, <lb/>
            bles. A plentiful stream of water, led from the Euphrates <lb/>
            by a subterranean canal of admirable construction, supplied <lb/>
            abundantly the wants of those who were shut up in the <lb/>
            castle. It contained also stores of bread, wine, and meat, <lb/>
            both fresh and salted, sufficient for the support of a thousand <lb/>
            soldiers for ten years. Thus the indomitable Franks could <lb/>
            confidently rely on maintaining their position until Josce­ <lb/>
            line's return with a reinforcement of Christians.</p>
          <p>In consequence, Balad in great anxiety repeatedly sent <note type="footnote"> 1 " Il fallait que cette jeune fille de six ans eût grandi bien vite."—Le <lb/>

            and the feebleness of women. I entreat you to restore me <lb/>
            my wives, and I will engage by a solemn oath that I will <lb/>
            make no attack on you and your companions for a whole <lb/>
            year, in order that Josceline the bearer of your message may <lb/>
            have time to return with the relief you need. Meanwhile, if <lb/>
            you grant me the favour of sending back my wives, I will <lb/>
            draw off my forces, and attend to the administration of my <lb/>
            affairs, while you will enjoy the peace I grant for the <lb/>
            appointed term. You shall enjoy the liberty of the markets <lb/>
            throughout my territories, and you can freely use for that <lb/>
            purpose the vast treasure belonging to me which chance has <lb/>
            placed in your power. Gazis, Bursethin, and other persons <lb/>
            of rank conveyed this message to King Baldwin, and used <lb/>
            all their eloquence to persuade him to come to terms with <lb/>
            their own prince.</p>
          <p>Baldwin assembled all who were in the castle, and laying <lb/>
            before them B'alad's proposals, demanded their advice. <lb/>
            Various opinions being offered, and there being much <lb/>
            difficulty in arriving at a positive determination on so doubt­ <lb/>
            ful a subject, the queen Fatima thus addressed the assembly: <lb/>
            " I perceive, brave men, that you hesitate what reply you <lb/>
            shall send to my lord's propositions. I beseech you there­ <lb/>
            fore to listen to what I have to say. Give no heed to my <lb/>
            lord's promises, for they are not to be trusted. All the <lb/>
            offers by which be endeavours to wheedle you are treacherous. <lb/>
            As long us you hold possession of this impregnable castle, <lb/>
            and detain me and my companions in your custody, there is <lb/>
            no doubt but Balad will be afraid of you, and not venture to <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XI. CH.XXVI."/> <lb/>
            assault the fortress. He well knows, and often declares in <lb/>
            the company of his intimate friends, that should any evil <lb/>
            happen to us while he is attacking you, he will be afterwards <lb/>
            exposed to endless hostilities. All our relations, who are <lb/>
            lords of the greatest part of the East, would rise in arms <lb/>
            against him, and never rest till they had put him to death. <lb/>
            Wait then until you receive the succour of Heaven and your <lb/>
            faithful friends, and beware prudently of the dangerous wiles <lb/>
            of your crafty foe. You position is commanding, and <lb/>
            enables you to repel assaults by hurling darts and stones <lb/>
            on the enemy. What is wanting, if you are only firm ? <lb/>
            You are well furnished with arms, and abundantly provisioned. <lb/>
            You have in this impregnable fortress bread, water, wine, and <lb/>
            flesh-meat. Call to mind the ten years' siege of Troy, and <lb/>
            think of the heroic deeds which your actors daily represent <lb/>
            before you, and let such recollections supply you with <lb/>
            strength and animate your courage.1 Fight bravely accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the custom of the Franks, and persevere until you <lb/>
            have gained the victory, lest your shame be told in songs <lb/>
            throughout the world. Hitherto the glory of the warriors <lb/>
            of the West is universally celebrated, and the fame of the <lb/>
            Franks has even penetrated to the Persian realms. It does <lb/>
            not grieve us to be confined with you, although King Balad <lb/>
            taunts you with it as a thing to be ashamed of. We prefer <lb/>
            such incarceration to the worship of demons with idolaters, and <lb/>
            willingly adopting your kindly manners are favourably dis­ <lb/>
            posed to your faith and religion, hoping that if, through <lb/>
            the divine favour, we safely make our escape from hence in <lb/>
            your company, we shall speedily be admitted to the heavenly <lb/>
            sacraments of the Christians."</p>
          <p>The other princesses heartily agreed with what Fatima <lb/>
            had said ; and the exhortations of the foreign women pleasing <lb/>
            the Christains, they were encouraged to persist for a long while <lb/>
            in holding the castle. At length, however, King Baldwin <lb/>
            yielded to the prayers and promises of Balad, and restored <lb/>
            him his three wives, much against their own wishes, escorted <lb/>
            by five brave knights. Having conducted them to Balad, <lb/>
            becomingly attired, the knights proposed returning to their <note type="footnote"> 1 "Voilu encore," observes M. Le Prevost, " une veritable Sultane <lb/>

            friends in the castle, but were detained by the tyrant to the <lb/>
            grief of many. Thus Guiumar the Breton, Grevase of Dol, <lb/>
            Robert of Caen, Musched of Mans, and Rivallon of Dinan, <lb/>
            were made prisoners by the treacherous Balad and presented <lb/>
            as captives to Ali, king of the Medes. He was a very pow­ <lb/>
            erful prince, and having detained the Franks and treated <lb/>
            them honourably nine months, gave them to the caliph <lb/>
            of Bagdad.1 On the morrow, the soldan received them from <lb/>
            the caliph, and shortly setting them at liberty loaded them <lb/>
            with presents. There the four knights chose Guiumar, son <lb/>
            of Count Alan, their leader, and took service with the soldan <lb/>
            for three years and a half, returning to Antioch in the course <lb/>
            of the fourth year.2</p>
          <p>The merciful God did not leave his faithful children with­ <lb/>
            out aid in their exile, for the five knights of whom we have <lb/>
            spoken and who were led so far in captivity, found great <lb/>
            favour among the barbarians. The king of the Medes <lb/>
            placed them under the care of the governor of the city, <lb/>
            ordering that they should come to him every day dressed in <lb/>
            the French fashion. They had garments of silk embroidered <lb/>
            with gold, horses, arms, and all sorts of furniture, and what­ <lb/>
            ever they chose to ask of the king or the governor. They <lb/>
            were objects of wonder to the Persians, and the Medes <lb/>
            regarded with admiration the dress of the Franks. Kings' <lb/>
            daughters were struck with their handsome persons and <lb/>
            smiled at their pleasantries, and kings and princes wished <lb/>
            to have descendants of the blood of the Franks. No one <lb/>
            however compelled them to change their religion in the <lb/>
            slightest degree, or depart from the worship of Christ. •</p>
          <p>They tell wonderful stories of the soldan's wealth and of <lb/>
            the strange curiosities they saw in the east. The word <lb/>
            soldan means sole-lord, because he rules over all the princes <lb/>
            of the east. In the fourth year, he gave them permission <lb/>
            to return home, and presented them with a golden arrow, as <note type="footnote"> 1 Mostarchid was caliph of Bagdad at this time, IllS-September 28, <lb/>

            a token of their liberty being restored by the prince. He <lb/>
            offered them the daughters of his most powerful nobles, with <lb/>
            immense riches and posessions, if they chose to remain; but <lb/>
            as they were resolved to depart, he showed them his vast <lb/>
            treasures and wealth of all kinds. At last, having been <lb/>
            loaded with gifts, and taken leave of their acquaintance and <lb/>
            benefactors, they returned to Antioch under the conduct of <lb/>
            David, king of Georgia, and Thorold de Montanis,1 and joy­ <lb/>
            fully related to their friends how they had lived in Nineveh, <lb/>
            Bagdad, and Babylonia, and the many strange things they <lb/>
            had seen in the countries of the East.</p>
          <p>They heard at Antioch that Balad was besieging Monbec, <lb/>
            and still kept King Baldwin in close confinement, after put­ <lb/>
            ting to death all his companions. Josceline, after his escape <lb/>
            from prison, had sent trusty messengers to the emperor <lb/>
            John,2 and the Greeks and Armenians, and after eight <lb/>
            months hastened with a large body of troops to the relief of <lb/>
            the king who, as before related, was left in the castle of <lb/>
            Karpout. Meanwhile Balad had continued the siege and <lb/>
            frequently sent Gazis his nephew, and the young Bursechi­ <lb/>
            nus,3 the commander of his forces, to Baldwin, assuring him <lb/>
            on oath that if he would surrender the castle peaceably he <lb/>
            should have liberty to depart where he would with all his <lb/>
            followers, and receive from him whatever he demanded. <lb/>
            The king, weary of his long confinement and too easily <lb/>
            trusting the treacherous pagan, surrendered the citadel, to <lb/>
            the scandal of the Christians and great joy of the infidels. <lb/>
            The king having marched out, Balad ordered four of his <lb/>
            teeth to be extracted,4 and Waleran de Puiset's left eye to <note type="footnote"> 1 We find no account of the king of Georgia mentioned by our author. <lb/>
            As for the prince of Armenia, who appears here under the disguise of a <lb/>

            successor, after the year 1185, of Leon, Levon, or Livon. Both were sons <lb/>
            of Gabriel, prince of Melitene, as they were brothers of Morphia, queen of <lb/>
            Jerusalem, and wife of Baldwin II. These princes of Armenia were called <lb/>
            by the western nations, de Montanis, from the mountainous character of <lb/>
            their territories. The impregnable castle which was their usual residence, <lb/>
            stood at the distance of an easy day's journey from Antioch, and they <lb/>
            were consequently in continual contact with the lords of that principality. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The emperor John Comnenus, August 15, 1118—April 8, 1143. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The same person we have already met with under the name of Burse­ <lb/>

            so that he might no longer carry a lance. Their companions <lb/>
            were sentenced to lose their heads: all which was carried <lb/>
            into execution. Waleran died from the injuries he received; <lb/>
            the king was again thrown into prison, where during <lb/>
            , four years his sufferings were greater than before; and <lb/>
            twenty-four knights and one hundred and forty Syrians or <lb/>
            Armenians were put to death by being beheaded. May <lb/>
            they live with Christ, whose confessors they were and whom <lb/>
            they served in this life! Josceline, having learnt on his way <lb/>
            the king's surrender and the slaughter of his late fellow <lb/>
            prisoners, halted his troops, and the whole Christian army <lb/>
            joined in lamentations; then after a consultation it dis­ <lb/>
            banded. The intelligence of their disaster being spread in <lb/>
            all quarters, the Christians were overwhelmed with sorrow, <lb/>
            and the Gentiles triumphed with excessive joy.</p>
          <p>Balad, finding that all which we have related succeeded <lb/>
            to his wishes, and that the Christians throughout Syria and <lb/>
            Palestine made a firm resistance without thinking of their <lb/>
            king, sent messengers to the kings and emirs throughout the <lb/>
            Gentile world. Having united their forces to his, he again <lb/>
            laid siege to Monbec. Josceline and all the Christians <lb/>
            rejoiced at receiving this intelligence, and lost no tim e in <lb/>
            assembling to give them battle. At this juncture, by the will <lb/>
            of our Saviour, the five illustrious knights were in the army, <lb/>
            having returned the same week from captivity among the <lb/>
            barbarians. A great battle was fought on the vast plain <lb/>
            between Monbec and Castle-Trehaled, in which Musei and <lb/>
            Heron his brother, and several other emirs, engaged on the <lb/>
            side of Balad, and strove to the utmost to defeat the Chris­ <lb/>
            tians. Balad on the field of battle sent two ass-loads of <lb/>
            gold to Godfrey the Monk, count de Mareis,1 begging him to <note type="footnote">four of Baldwin's teeth, than to our authors etymology of the word soldan. <lb/>
            After Balak's death, Baldwin remained prisoner at Charan, and was <lb/>
            released from his captivity by being ransomed in 1125. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 We have no information relative to this person. He may have been <lb/>

            read in the stars that Godfrey and Balad should slay each <lb/>
            other in the fight, and had sent in alarm a message to her <lb/>
            brother warning him to take precautions for his safety. <lb/>
            The religious count spurned the tyrant's gifts like dross, and <lb/>
            offered himself willingly to the sacrifice in the confession of <lb/>
            Christ. Having avenged the blood of the saints by slaying <lb/>
            Balad, he fell himself gloriously fighting for Christ. His <lb/>
            pennon was found on the corpse of Balad, by whose death a <lb/>
            dreadful and heavy yoke was removed from the necks <lb/>
            of the Christians. In that battle nine hundred Christian <lb/>
            soldiers fought against three hundred thousand Pagans, <lb/>
            and conquered them by the powerful aid of the mighty <lb/>
            God of Israel. On the side of the Christians only <lb/>
            six knights and eleven foot-soldiers fell in the battle, while <lb/>
            thirteen thousand of the Pagans perished, whose names <lb/>
            were found written in Balad's muster-rolls. The Almighty <lb/>
            Emanuel, son of the immaculate Virgin, gave strength and <lb/>
            victory to his Israelites, filling them with joy at the defeat of <lb/>
            their enemies whom he had employed to chastise their <lb/>
            offences like a rod of iron; and after the storms of their <lb/>
            affliction were dispersed, gave them prosperity and peace. <lb/>
            The Lord thundering from heaven broke the horns of the <lb/>
            Gentiles, and the Christians lifted up their hands and gave <lb/>
            praises to the invincible King of Sabaoth.</p>
          <p>The Emir Gazis, nephew and heir of Balad, king of Alep­ <lb/>
            po, succeeded him ;1 but his recent disasters and diminution <lb/>
            of wealth prevented him from undertaking great enterprises <lb/>
            and withstanding the difficulties in which his predecessor, <lb/>
            taught by long experience, had been involved, and which his <lb/>
            fertile genius enabled him to conduct and support. In <lb/>
            consequence Gazis, accepting fifty thousand bezants for the <lb/>
            ransom of King Baldwin, released him from prison, requiring <lb/>
            forty youths, chosen from the principal families of Jeru­ <lb/>

            restoration of all the- Pagans who were in captivity among <lb/>
            the faithful. These terms having been agreed to, he released <lb/>
            the king, and waited at the appointed time near the castle <lb/>
            of Gis in the country of Cæsarea Philippi. The Christians <note type="footnote"> 1 Balak's successor was not called Gazis, and was not his nephew. It <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A CERTAIN Greek of high rank, named Ravendinos, arrived <lb/>
            at Antioch, and brought a message from the emperor <lb/>
            Alexius' to Prince Roger already mentioned, demanding <lb/>
            his daughter in marriage for John, the emperor's son. The <lb/>
            hostility he had long fostered had gradually abated, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of that sagacious monarch having reflected that <lb/>
            the common lot of mortals had carried of Bohemond and Tan­ <lb/>

            that the same fate speedily threatened himself. He, there­ <note type="footnote"> man, a native of England, where he was prior of St. Sepulchre's, and of <lb/>

            with that warlike race,1 that at least his heir might recover <lb/>
            the principality of Antioch by the rights of marriage, as he <lb/>
            despaired of accomplishing it by force of arms. He, there­ <lb/>
            fore, employed in the embassy to the Normans the Greek <lb/>
            already mentioned, who, while he was waiting for a reply to <lb/>
            his message, met with a serious disaster. For, being thus <lb/>
            detained at Antioch until an honourable answer was agreed <lb/>
            on in a general assembly, the emir Gazis, the Persian, made <lb/>
            a sudden irruption, as I have already related, into the terri­ <lb/>
            tories of the Christians, and Ravendinos, accompanying <lb/>
            Roger against the enemy, was taken prisoner and compelled <lb/>
            to pay fifteen thousand bezants for his ransom. The Turks <lb/>
            would not do him any injury because he was a Greek, <lb/>
            sparing him from their knowledge of his nation, which was <lb/>
            a. neighbour of theirs, and from their respect for the <lb/>
            emperor; so that having received the ransom they dismissed <lb/>
            him in safety. The ambassador, finding that Roger and all <lb/>
            his troops had perished, and that King Baldwin had united <lb/>
            the principality of Antioch to the kingdom of Jerusalem, <lb/>
            went to him on the part of the emperor, and demanded his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage for his son John. King Baldwin <lb/>
            received the message with great satisfaction, and, consenting <lb/>
            to the proposal, sent the ambassador to Jerusalem to see his <lb/>
            daughter, furnishing him with a secret despatch addressed <lb/>
            to the queen only. Ravendinos accordingly proceeded to <lb/>
            Jerusalem, and was well received by the queen and her <lb/>
            daughter, the king's commands being cheerfully obeyed. <lb/>
            The beautiful princess, appearing in public, was the delight <lb/>
            of all beholders, and she herself, having heard tidings of her <lb/>
            happy prospects, cherished fruitless hopes. Indeed, nothing <lb/>
            is stable but that which the only Creator of all things orders. <lb/>

            him to Constantinople in fifteen days, commanded them all <lb/>
            to be hospitably entertained until Whitsuntide. Lodgings <lb/>
            were assigned them in a handsome mansion at some distance <lb/>
            from the palace, and while they anxiously waited for the <lb/>
            appointed time, they were supplied abundantly with provi­ <lb/>
            sions at the duke's expense.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, he was assassinated in his own apartments <lb/>
            during a general insurrection, and a plank was removed <lb/>
            from each of the ships which were moored on the sea shore. <lb/>
            The bloody homicides also fixed and published the day on <lb/>
            which the envoy and his fellow travellers should be put to <lb/>
            death, but impediments were adroitly raised, and it was <lb/>
            frequently postponed by a prudent man who was in the con­ <lb/>
            spirators' counsels. He said: " I beseech you, friends and <lb/>
            brothers, to spare these men for your own sakes, and refrain <lb/>
            from dipping your hands in the blood of those who have <lb/>
            done you no injury. Guide your actions by discretion and <lb/>
            the rule of right, lest you exasperate God and man against <lb/>
            you by the enormity of your crimes, and incur the vengeance <lb/>
            of the greatest princes on all sides. You have already per­ <lb/>
            petrated an abominable outrage against the emperor in <lb/>
            having murdered in the night his cousin, one of the dukes <lb/>
            of the empire of Constantinople. As yet you may shelter <lb/>
            yourselves against his anger under the protection of the <lb/>
            king of Jerusalem, against whom you have hitherto com­ <lb/>
            mitted no offence. But if you give umbrage to the mag­ <lb/>

            with war on both sides, what will you do ? Where will you <lb/>
            find refuge ? " By such words as these, the prudent noble­ <lb/>
            man restrained the fury of the fierce rebels, who could <lb/>
            hardly restrain their bloody hands from the massacre of the <lb/>
            innocents ; and with great difficulty he obtained permission <lb/>
            for their departure about the feast of St. John.</p>
          <p>At last, they obtained leave to embark in two old ships, <lb/>
            and, after incurring great risks in a voyage of several days, <lb/>

            Ravendinos reported to those who had commissioned him <lb/>

            on the other hand, learnt that many changes had taken <lb/>
            place in his own country. During the interval, King Bald­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>CONSTANCE, the illustrious daughter of Philip, king of <lb/>
            France, had a son by Bohemond, who was educated by her <lb/>
            with great care at Tarentum, in Italy, and duly kept under <lb/>
            her maternal guardianship until he arrived at the age of <lb/>
            puberty. The young Bohemond, who was naturally endowed <lb/>
            with excellent qualities, grew up worthily, and on his <lb/>
            attaining manhood was invested with knightly arms amidst <lb/>
            general demonstrations of joy. Emulous of his father's <lb/>
            glory, he studied to imitate his courage and conduct, and <lb/>
            led those who observed him to expect great things from the <lb/>
            indications he gave of virtue and valour. The people of <lb/>
            Antioch, having heard of this during King Baldwin's <lb/>
            captivity for six years 2 in Balad's dungeons at Karpout, <lb/>
            sent frequent messages, inviting the lawful heir to cross the <lb/>
            sea in security, and, landing in Syria, take possession of his <lb/>
            father's principality with the good will of his subjects. <lb/>
            However, he was detained by his mother's anxieties until the <lb/>
            king was released from captivity, as already stated. At last, <lb/>
            Baldwin, learning the wishes of the inhabitants of Antioch, <lb/>
            and believing that from the influence of his father's name <lb/>
            it would be advantageous to the people, he offered his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage to Bohemond, with the advice of his <lb/>
            nobles, and invited him to take possession of his father's <lb/>
            duchy without delay. In consequence the amiable young <note type="footnote"> I Our author again alludes to the story of Œdipus, more distinctly <lb/>

            father's principality amidst general rejoicings, and married <lb/>
            Baldwin's daughter, who bore him a daughter. Established <lb/>
            in his government, he ruled his subjects with a gentle <lb/>
            sway, but made war on the Gentiles, and fell, alas! after a <lb/>
            short reign of scarcely three years, when he was suddenly <lb/>
            cut off to the great grief and loss of his friends and people.'</p>
          <p>Dissensions having arisen between the Christian princes, <lb/>
            Bohemond and Leo the Armenian, the blood of the faithful <lb/>
            flowed in this accursed quarrel, and the Gentiles gained a <lb/>
            triumphant victory. This Leo was son of Thorold de Mon­ <lb/>
            tanis,2 and uncle of Bohemond's wife, and the young prince <lb/>
            assembled an army to attack him, and led it into the enemy's <lb/>
            country. Having reached the banks of the Euphrates, <lb/>
            where he pitched his camp, an Armenian brought him <lb/>
            intelligence that the emir Sanguin was at hand with a vast <lb/>
            body of Turks, and was on the point of an irruption into <lb/>
            the Christian territories. Bohemond at first gave little heed <lb/>
            to the news, but being desirous of ascertaining its correct­ <lb/>
            ness, and unwilling to trust the reports of others, he left his <lb/>
            camp, and putting himself at the head of two hundred <lb/>
            youthful troops, climbed to the summit of a mountain to <lb/>
            make his observations. From this eminence he discovered <lb/>
            seven companies of foragers, forming the van of the enemy's <lb/>
            army. Holding them cheap, he instantly charged them, <lb/>
            and, after a sharp engagement, put them nearly all to the <lb/>
            sword, with the loss, however, of his whole party, except <lb/>
            twenty knights. Meanwhile the main body of the enemy <lb/>
            came up, and the survivors perceiving their vast numbers, <lb/>
            and that their impetuous leader was astounded by grief and <lb/>
            surprise, they cried out to him with earnest intreaty: " Lose <lb/>

            ferring, after the loss of his comrades, death to flight. <lb/>
            Thus the beardless youth rushed against a host, and fell <lb/>
            fighting in the cause of Christ.1 Some few who found <lb/>
            means of escaping forded the Euphrates, and bore the sad <lb/>
            tidings of the death of the duke to their companions in <lb/>
            arms. The whole army then immediately dispersed, retiring <lb/>
            in bodies to their fortified places, and putting the province <lb/>
            in a state of defence against the Gentiles.</p>
          <p>Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, on learning the death of his <lb/>
            son-in-law, proceeded by hasty marches at the head of his <lb/>
            troops to oppose the pagans in Syria. Being welcomed by <lb/>
            the faithful in that region, he defended the whole country <lb/>
            against the enemy, retaining possession of the principality <lb/>
            of Antioch for a long period, and bequeathing it to his <lb/>

          <p>In the month of January there was a meeting at Falaise, in <lb/>
            the king's presence, of the principal persons of that neighbour­ <lb/>

          <p>WILLIAM DE Ros, an honoured name, <lb/>
            Left in the church a triple fame: <lb/>
            Bayeux beheld him spurning wealth, <lb/>
            And Caen seeking ghostly health, <lb/>
            Taught in her holy discipline; <lb/>
            While grateful Fécamp's stately shrine <lb/>

            Life's struggle ceased and heaven begun.</p>
          <p>Soon after the death of this father, Roger of Bayeux1 was <lb/>
            elected abbot, and consecrated on the twelfth of the calends of <lb/>
            January [21st December], by William the agedmetropolitan.2 <lb/>
            He was the fourth abbot of Fécamp. The first was William <lb/>
            de Dijon,3 who organized the society with piety and skill in <lb/>
            the time of Duke Richard; he was succeeded by John the <lb/>
            Italian, who governed it fifty'one-years.4 The third abbot was <lb/>
            William of Bayeux, who for his great modesty was surnamed <lb/>
            Puella, and having received the profession of his successor <lb/>
            in the monastic order taught what it would be one day <lb/>
            his turn to teach. Then the aged prelate ordained Roger <lb/>
            and one hundred and twenty other priests on the feast of <lb/>
            St. Thomas the Apostle, and on the following day gave Roger <lb/>

            The new-made priest and abbot returned to Fécamp to keep <lb/>
            the festival of Christmas, and has now continued in the <lb/>
            government of the abbey nearly thirty-two years..</p>
          <p>I have spoken more particularly of this ordination, because <lb/>
            I was present, and, unworthy as I am, took upon me the <lb/>
            burden of the priesthood by the command of the lord Roger, <lb/>
            my own abbot.2 On this occasion great numbers of the <lb/>
            clergy assembled at Rouen, and the household of Christ <lb/>
            received happily an accession of nearly seven hundred clerks <lb/>
            in orders of different degree. Inspired at that time with <lb/>
            the fire of youth I wrote some hexameter verses, in which I <lb/>
            enumerated in a few lines the number of priests and deacons <lb/>
            then ordained.</p>

            Two hundred white-staled Levites3 joined the throng, <lb/>
            And while the arches pealed with chant and song, <lb/>
            Sub-deacons forty-four, in less degree, <lb/>

            at the mercy of robbers, having no protectors. When, <lb/>
            however, King Henry gained the victory of Tinchebrai, his <lb/>
            enemy, Ranulph Flambard, who resided at Lisieux as lord of <lb/>
            the place, considering how best he might adroitly escape the <lb/>
            consequences of this turn of affairs, despatched in all haste <lb/>
            messengers to Henry, while he was rejoicing in his recent <lb/>
            triumph, and, humbly imploring his favour, offered, if <lb/>
            peace was granted him, to give up the city which he held <lb/>
            to the king.' That wise prince, who preferred peace to war, <lb/>
            always the source of so many calamities, pardoned the pacific <lb/>
            bishop his past offences, accepted at once the surrender of <lb/>
            Lisieux, and restored to Flambard, with whom he was recon­ <lb/>
            ciled, his bishopric of Durham. He gave the see of Lisieux <lb/>
            to John, archdeacon of Séez, and having prudently arranged <lb/>
            the affairs of Normandy crossed over to England to attend to <lb/>
            those of that kingdom.2</p>
          <p>That archdeacon was the son of a Norman dean, and was <lb/>
            educated from childhood in the church of Séez, being cotem­ <lb/>
            porary with Robert, Gerard, and Serlo, bishops of that see, <lb/>
            and was distinguished for his ability both in secular and <lb/>
            ecclesiastical affairs. For his singular judgment and <note type="footnote"> having been ordained at the same time, the rest of the seven hundred <lb/>
            clerks must have received minor orders. The great number of clergy <lb/>
            admitted to ecclesiastical offices at one time was probably the consequence <lb/>
            of the distracted state of Normandy for a long period before, and of the <lb/>
            countenance and protection now afforded the church by Henry I. </note><note type="footnote"> I This transaction must have taken place immediately after the battle of <lb/>
            Tinchebrai, as in the middle of October Henry came to Lisieux to preside <lb/>

            After Ranulph Flambard's submission, Hervey, bishop of Bangor, under pre­ <lb/>

            to be translated to Lisieux. The king wrote to St. Anselm on the subject. <lb/>

            of England and Normandy, with fear and trembling." It was, in fact, the <lb/>

            eloquence he was promoted by these bishops to the office of <lb/>
            archdeacon, and took his place in the first rank of judicial <lb/>
            authorities, managing ecclesiastical affairs with great pru­ <lb/>
            dence for many years. At length the fury of Robert do <lb/>
            Belèsme burst forth against bishop Serlo, and his animosity <lb/>
            included the archdeacon who was the main support of his <lb/>
            bishop; Robert therefore began to harass him with fierce <lb/>
            threats and persecutions. As the tyrant was at that time <lb/>
            at the height of his power, and scarcely any one in Normandy <lb/>
            could resist his attacks, the defenceless clerk took refuge in <lb/>
            England, and being graciously received by the king, to whom <lb/>
            he was already known, he remained there in exile. Appointed <lb/>
            one of the king's principal chaplains, he was often summoned <lb/>
            to the royal councils among the king's intimate advisers. At <lb/>
            last, as I have already mentioned, Henry, becoming attached <lb/>
            to him for his intrinsic worth, appointed him to the see of <lb/>
            Lisieux. In the month of September, John the deacon was <lb/>
            ordained priest by Serlo of Séez, and shortly afterwards <lb/>
            he was consecrated bishop by William the metropolitan. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WiLLiAM, count of Evreux, being advanced in years and <lb/>
            justly alarmed at the approach of inevitable death, by the <lb/>
            influence of his wife Helvise,1 determined to erect on his <lb/>
            domains a temple to God, in which a chosen body of monks <lb/>
            might fitly carry on the war of faith under the King of <lb/>
            kings. In consequence, both husband and wife requested the <lb/>
            advice and aid of Roger, abbot of St. Evroult,2 in the matter, <lb/>
            and applied for twelve monks by name, to build a monastery <lb/>
            at Noyon.3 The twelve brothers, with Abbot Roger, assem­ <lb/>
            bled there on the third of the ides [13th] of October,' and <lb/>
            began to live a regular life in a desert place called Boucheron,5 <lb/>
            near the chapel of St. Martin the Archbishop.6 Many <lb/>
            persons of different ages, offering themselves for conversion, <lb/>
            were well received, and zealously taught the regular course <lb/>
            of life, according to the rule of St. Benedict. However, as <lb/>
            the seed sown is subject to many injuries before harvest, <lb/>
            and all the grains of corn do not flourish or perish alike, <lb/>
            but have to struggle through the rains of winter and the <lb/>
            summer heats, so men, in their several orders or congregations <lb/>
            are exposed to various trials, neither enjoying equal pros­ <lb/>
            perity, nor subject to the same calamities.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1108, the count of Evreux, with <lb/>
            his wife, laid the foundations of a spacious church in honour <lb/>
            of St. Mary, mother of God, and applied large sums of <lb/>
            money out of his own funds towards carrying on the works, <note type="footnote"> 1 Notwithstanding his advanced age, we have lately seen this nobleman <lb/>
            present at the battle of Tinchebrai, as he was forty years before at that of <lb/>

            but he was prevented from completing them by grievous <lb/>
            worldly troubles. Indeed, the count's faculties were <lb/>
            naturally somewhat feeble, as well as blunted by age,1 and, <lb/>
            trusting perhaps more than was becoming to his wife's <lb/>
            abilities, he left the government of his county entirely in her <lb/>
            hands. The countess was distinguished for her wit and <lb/>
            beauty; she was one of the tallest women in all Evreux, and <lb/>
            of very high birth, being the daughter of William, the illus­ <lb/>
            trious count of Nevers. Disregarding the counsels of her <lb/>
            husband's barons, she chose rather to follow her own opinion, <lb/>
            and her ambition frequently inspiring bold measures in <lb/>
            political affairs, she was easily led to engage in rash enter­ <lb/>
            prises. The earl of Mellent and other Norman lords were <lb/>
            little inclined to brook this female presumption, and in <lb/>
            consequence they denounced her to the king, and incensed <lb/>
            him against her by their bitter accusations. At length, <lb/>
            Count William and the countess Helvise, having levelled to <lb/>
            the ground the king's donjon at Evreux, and offended him <lb/>
            in other matters in which their fealty was not properly <lb/>
            observed, he deprived them of their possessions in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, and they were twice compelled to become exiles in <lb/>
            Anjou. These troubles caused great hindrances in the work <lb/>
            of building the monastery, and the death of both, which <lb/>
            speedily followed, was a great loss to many persons. The <lb/>
            countess, who died first,2 reposes at Noyon ; the count was <lb/>
            afterwards struck with apoplexy, and died without receiving <lb/>
            the last sacraments; his mouldering corpse is laid with his <lb/>
            father's at Fontenelles.3</p>
          <p>As the count died without issue, and his nephew Amauri <lb/>
            had incurred the royal displeasure by his indiscretion, the <lb/>
            king retained the county of Evreux in his own hands. <lb/>
            Great mischief resulted from this, as will appear in the <lb/>
            sequel; the city and all the country round being exposed to <lb/>
            pillage and burning. Meanwhile the monastery which the <lb/>
            count had begun building at Noyon has remained unfinished <lb/>
            to this day, under the priors Robert, Roger, and Ranulf. <note type="footnote"> 1 We must not forget that the good lord was nephew of Ralph Iête­ <lb/>

            The first of these priors, Robert de Prunières,1 was the son <lb/>
            of Haimon do Prunières, a loyal squire, and was distin­ <lb/>
            guished for his profound erudition among the accomplished <lb/>
            philosophers in the schools of the grammarians and dialec­ <lb/>
            ticians. The king summoned him from his priory to cross <lb/>
            over to England, where he entrusted him with the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the monastery of Thorney,2 on the death of Abbot <lb/>
            Gunter, and be ruled it ably during twenty years.3</p>
          <p>Thorney means in English the Island of Thorns, so called <lb/>
            because a wood of various sorts of trees is surrounded on <lb/>
            all sides by flowing rivulets of deep watery On it stands a <lb/>
            monastery of monks dedicated to St. Mary, mother of God, <lb/>
            which, secluded from all secular habitations, was distin­ <lb/>
            guished for its pure worship of the Supreme Divinity. It <lb/>
            was founded by the venerable Ethelwold, Bishop of Win­ <lb/>
            chester, in the time of King Ethelred, who translated to it <lb/>
            the remains of St. Botolph, abbot of Ikanhoe,5 with many <lb/>
            other relics of saints, after the massacre by the Danes, <lb/>
            in which St. Edmund, king of the East-Angles, fell a martyr <lb/>
            in the confession of Christ. The monks only and their <lb/>
            servants dwell in the deep recesses of Thorney, where in <lb/>
            security they offer faithful service to God. No females <note type="footnote"> 1 The name was afterwards spelt Purnelai, or Punelai. In Henry I.'s <lb/>

            remarked, should have always omitted it in this, where it is required. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It was in 1113 that Robert de Prunelai left the priory of Noyon to <lb/>

            studiously prohibited by the monks within nine miles from <lb/>
            the abbey. After England was conquered by Norman <lb/>
            valour, and King William had reduced it to subjection con­ <lb/>
            formably to his own laws, he gave the government of <lb/>
            Thorney to Fulcher, a monk of St. Bertin's at Sithin; a man <lb/>
            of deep erudition, who administered it for nearly sixteen <lb/>
            years without receiving consecration as abbot. He was <lb/>
            courteous, pleasant, and charitable, and well skilled in <lb/>
            grammar and music. He left to future generations in Eng­ <lb/>
            land some precious monuments of his talents having pub­ <lb/>
            lished several works worthy of memory, containing charming <lb/>
            narratives, suited to be sweetly sung, of the lives of St. <lb/>
            Oswald, bishop of Worcester,1 and other saints of English <lb/>
            origin. In consequence of disputes with the bishop of <lb/>
            Lincoln, he retired, and was succeeded by Gunter of Mans, <lb/>
            a monk of Battle Abbey, who had been archdeacon of Salis­ <lb/>
            bury. This abbot introduced the rules of Marmoutier in <lb/>
            the government of the convent at Thorney, and erected <lb/>
            from the foundation with great industry a most elegant <lb/>
            church, with lodgings for the monks, where, being interred <lb/>
            by his faithful disciples, he now reposes. The following <lb/>
            short epitaph composed on him will convey to the reader in <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1108, Philip, king of France, took <lb/>
            to his bed, and, after a long illness, being sensible of the <lb/>
            approach of death, he made a faithful confession, and <lb/>
            assembling his nobles and particular friends, thus addressed <lb/>
            them; " I am aware that the tombs of the French kings are <lb/>
            at St. Denys, but I feel that I am too great a sinner to pre­ <lb/>
            sume on being interred near the relics of that holy martyr. <lb/>
            So heinous are my crimes that I am under the deepest <lb/>
            alarm lest I should be delivered over to the devil, and be <lb/>

            and seek the favour of God according to the discipline of <lb/>
            his rule." King Philip, having finished this sensible dis­ <lb/>
            course, and added more to the same purpose, died on the <lb/>
            fourth of the calends of August [July 29th], in the forty- <lb/>

            affairs, and in his military enterprises was often the sport of <lb/>
            a fortune, unstable as the rolling wheel. The nobles of <lb/>
            France were frequently in arms against him, and harassed <lb/>
            the king and his adherents with a succession of injuries <lb/>
            and outrages. Even during the life of his father, who &lt;vas <lb/>

          <p>The royal authority had been much weakened in the <lb/>

            had fallen into abeyance. Lewis was therefore compelled, <lb/>

            whole of the kingdom for aid in crushing the tyranny of <lb/>
            freebooters and rebels. At that time the communes in <lb/>
            France were organized by the bishops, so that the priests <lb/>

            against the factious. First, he laid siege to Puiset and <lb/>
            reduced Hugh to submission by the power of his arms. <lb/>
            This knight was handsome but ill-conditioned. His castle <lb/>
            was the special retreat of freebooters and outlaws, where <lb/>
            unheard-of crimes were committed; and their evil deeds <lb/>
            were neither restrained by royal threats and indignation nor <lb/>
            episcopal censures. One day, while a body of the king's <lb/>
            troops were in pursuit of Hugh along a narrow road, and he <lb/>
            was endeavouring by a hasty retreat to get into the castle, <lb/>
            he happened to meet Ansel de Garlande, commander of the <lb/>
            French army, and suddenly killed him with a thrust of his <lb/>

            relief of the besieged with a powerful reinforcement, and <lb/>
            compelled the king to draw off his troops. Lewis afterwards <lb/>
            re-assembling his army, again appeared before Puiset, and <lb/>
            by the superiority of his force compelled the rebels to sur­ <lb/>
            render. He was induced by the importunities of his <lb/>
            auxiliaries to pardon the besieged; but, although he spared <lb/>
            their lives, little as they deserved it, he razed the fortress, to <lb/>
            the great joy both of travellers and the country people <lb/>
            residing in the neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>Lewis also besieged Gournai-sur-Marne, and severely <lb/>
            straightened the garrison for want of provisions. Hugh de <lb/>
            Creel, son of Guy the Red, held the place, and refused to <lb/>
            obey the knight's command to restore it to the heirs of <lb/>
            Garlande who laid claim to it.2</p>
          <p>One day, Count Theobald, at the head of a numerous body <lb/>
            of knights, rode to the bank of the rivulet called Torci,3 and <lb/>
            engaged in battle with the royal troops. As they were, how­ <lb/>

          <p>Theobald, descended from a race of kings and counts, <lb/>
            was distinguished among the French lords for his wealth, <lb/>
            influence, and illustrious birth, and had many powerful and <lb/>
            fierce vassals, who were cruel oppressors of their countrymen <lb/>
            and neighbours. Some of them neither respected God nor <lb/>
            man, as was plainly exhibited by their conduct. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, the king having heard frequent reports of their <lb/>
            outrages, was much incensed, and took measures for <lb/>
            restraining their oppression of the lower orders by his royal <lb/>
            authority. The count's partisans, apprehending the king's <lb/>
            power, and the restraint he endeavoured to impose on their <lb/>
            evil enterprises, sought refuge under the protection of their <lb/>
            powerful lord, and, relying on his support, often dared to <lb/>
            engage in criminal undertakings against God and the church. <lb/>
            This gave rise to frequent quarrels between the king and <lb/>
            the count, and as the malignants persisted in their outrages, <lb/>
            much blood was shed on both sides.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, the king made an irruption against <lb/>
            Count Theobald in the district of Meaux, having in his <lb/>
            company Robert, earl of Flanders, and many other nobles. <lb/>
            Lewis met with a vigorous resistance from the count's troops, <lb/>
            who, being superior in numbers, put to flight the royal <lb/>
            force. During the rout, the earl fell from his horse in a <lb/>
            narrow way, and, being trampled under foot by the cavalry, <lb/>
            he was unable to remount, and, having been raised from the <lb/>
            ground with great difficulty, for his limbs were severely frac­ <lb/>

            and many people deeply lamented his death, and as far as <lb/>
            Arabia the fate of the warlike crusader was deplored both by <lb/>
            Christians and Gentiles. His corpse was carried by the <note type="footnote"> 1 We now return to the year 1111. Robert, the second earl of Flan­ <lb/>

            Willoughby, lord Brook, in whose house the earldom of Warwick was <lb/>
            afterwards restored. Anne, the second daughter, married William Lygon <lb/>
            of Maddresfield, in Worcestershire, in favour of whose descendant, of the <lb/>
            same name, through Margaret, the heiress of that family, the barony of <lb/>
            Beauchamp of Powick was revived by a new erection. (46 George III.) <lb/>
            An earldom was afterwards added ; so that this ancient Norman name <lb/>

            prince was introduced to many great princes and noble <lb/>
            lords of castles, who were attracted by his polished manners. <lb/>
            Both by his importunities and his promises, Elias earnestly <lb/>
            conciliated the regards of all he could influence in his ward's <lb/>
            favour; and, publishing the piteous tale of his wrongs, <lb/>
            inclined the hearts of many to compassionate his misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes. Numbers of Normans espoused his cause, and <lb/>
            ardently desired to have him for their prince, thus offending <lb/>
            the powerful monarch who then ruled them, and exposing <lb/>
            themselves to suspicion in various ways. Above all, Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme, mindful of the friendship and intimate relations <lb/>
            which subsisted between himself and Duke Robert, and not <lb/>
            having forgotten the vast power which, during his govern­ <lb/>
            ment, he exercised over the greatest of the Norman nobles, <lb/>
            used his utmost efforts on behalf of the illustrious exile, <lb/>
            the duke's son. There was a frequent interchange between <lb/>
            them of hasty messengers who communicated secret intelli­ <lb/>
            gence from the one to the other. Thus Robert and Elias <lb/>
            encouraged each other by mutual exhortations, and toiled <lb/>
            unceasingly to advance the cause of their duke's son. <lb/>
            They communicated with Lewis, king of France, William, <lb/>
            duke of Poitiers, Henry, duke of Burgundy, and Alani. <lb/>
            prince of the Bretons, and several other powerful princes; <lb/>
            frequently stirring them up by envoys and letters, and <lb/>
            using every means to engage them to lend their aid to <lb/>
            William Clito.</p>
          <p>At last, Fulk, count of Anjou, betrothed his daughter <lb/>
            Sibylla to him, granting him the county of Maine, and for <lb/>
            a time was a firm supporter of the young prince.1 But <lb/>
            through the prevailing influence of King Henry, who <lb/>
            lavished menaces, entreaties, gold and silver, and a thousand <lb/>
            other weighty arguments, the marriage was broken off. He <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author considerably anticipates these events. It was not till after <lb/>
            the death of his son-in-law, King Henry's son William, in 1122, that Fulk <lb/>

            was called. However, Henry, who in the zenith of his power and prosperity <lb/>

            by all kinds of menace, entreaty, and corruption. He soon afterwards <lb/>
            chose Fulk's son for the husband of his daughter and heiress; so indispen­ <lb/>

            employed able pleaders, who raised the question of consan­ <lb/>
            guinity, which, according to the Christian law, prevented the <lb/>
            union of the young coupler For Richard, son of Gonnor, <lb/>
            and duke of Normandy, was father of Robert I., whose son <lb/>
            was William the Conqueror, the father of Duke Robert, <lb/>
            who was father of William the Clito. On the other side, <lb/>
            Robert the archbishop and count, who was brother of Duke <lb/>
            Richard, had a son named Richard, count of Evreux, which <lb/>
            Richard had a daughter called Agnes, wife of Simon, who <lb/>
            bore Bertrade, Fulk<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>s mother, and whose daughter Sibylla <lb/>
            was. It was thus that the affinity between William and <lb/>
            Sibylla was made out, and the long-expected union of the <lb/>
            illustrious youth wassfrustrated. The young prince was in <lb/>
            consequence forced to leave Anjou, and again compelled to <lb/>
            seek the aid of strangers with fear and toil. At last, after <lb/>
            many wanderings, he took refuge with his cousin Baldwin, <lb/>
            earl of Flanders, throwing himself on his good faith, intre­ <lb/>

            The memory of Innocent III. cannot be too much honoured for having <lb/>
            fixed a reasonable limit in 1245. In the example now before us, there <lb/>
            were eleven degrees of consanguinity between the parties betrothed; but <lb/>
            Henry, that mirror of continence, who did not scruple to marry a nun, and <lb/>
            filled the court of England with his bastards, was ready to invoke the <lb/>
            thunders of the church on the enormity of a marriage between cousins in <lb/>
            the eleventh degree, when it was contrary to his interests; and the impedi­ <lb/>

            immense weight. </note><note type="footnote"> Ivo de Chartres called marriages between kindred of the twelfth degree <lb/>
            incestuous, the very language adopted by the pope on this occasion. It must <lb/>
            be remarked that the court of Rome was as violent as Henry himself. A <lb/>
            few months before his death, Pope Calixtus confirmed the sentence of <lb/>
            excommunication, pronounced by his virtuous legate, John of Crema, <lb/>
            against the betrothed princess. On the 26th of August, 1123, he wrote to <lb/>
            the bishops of Chartres, Orlfans, and Paris to have it executed in their <lb/>
            dioceses, and that the holy mysteries should be suspended wherever a <lb/>
            person guilty of so enormous a crime should reside. It was, indeed, a <lb/>
            strange abuse of words to call such an union incestuous, and a deplorable <lb/>
            use of the thunders of the church to launch them against such imaginary <lb/>
            crimes. But William, the young prince, had not at command the irresistible <lb/>
            arguments alluded to, and although powerful and zealous friends interposed <lb/>
            in his favour, he never possessed the means which were indispensable to <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1109, the second indiction, the <lb/>
            divine vengeance punished the sins of men with a variety of <lb/>
            inflictions, and mercifully terrified mankind, according to the <lb/>
            usual dealings of Providence, in order to bring sinners to <lb/>
            repentance, that so its clemency and pardon might be <lb/>
            extended to the <unclear>penitent</unclear>. In France, particularly about <lb/>
            Orleans and Chartres, numbers were attacked by an inflam­ <lb/>
            matory disease,2 which debilitated them, and in many cases <lb/>
            ended in death. The harvest was rotted by deluges of rain, <lb/>
            so that a terrible dearth ensued, and the vintage almost <lb/>
            totally perished. The gifts of Ceres and Bacchus thus <lb/>
            failing, a severe famine consumed the people in all quarters. <lb/>
            This fatal year was the third of the reign of Lewis, son of <lb/>
            Philip, king of France, and the ninth of Henry, son of <lb/>
            William the Bastard, duke of Normandy and king of Eng. <lb/>
            land.</p>
          <p>The same year, King Henry gave his daughter Matilda in <note type="footnote"> 1 There was an old grudge between the kings of England and the counts <lb/>
            of Flanders, which is worth mentioning. </note><note type="footnote"> William the Conqueror granted to Earl Baldwin, his father-in-law, a <lb/>
            yearly pension of three hundred silver marks for the succour he had afforded <lb/>
            him in his English expedition. In the time of Robert the Frisian, this <lb/>
            pension was not regularly paid ; but William Rufus was induced to admit <lb/>
            the obligation, Robert of Flanders, the crusader, on his return from Jeru­ <lb/>
            salem, haughtily demanded the arrears: it was then that Henry I. replied <lb/>
            that if the matter was left to his generosity, he would do what he could in <lb/>
            it, but if they made too much noise about it, he would not give a sou. How­ <lb/>
            ever, the affair was compromised, and by a convention on the 17th of May, <lb/>
            1101, the payment was raised to four hundred marks, and Robert, on his <lb/>
            part, engaged to furnish the king of England a force of five hundred men <lb/>
            in time of war. The number was even doubled by a fresh convention of <lb/>

            sixteen years, the flower of all the men of worth who <lb/>
            flourished in my time. Dom Eadmer, who had been a monk <lb/>

            from the Lord, departed this life on the eleventh of the <lb/>
            calends of May [April 21], and was interred at the foot of <lb/>
            the crucifix in the church of the holy and undivided Trinity.'</p>
          <p>Likewise, Hugh, the venerable abbot of Cluni, after cele­ <lb/>
            brating the passion and resurrection of Christ, fell sick on <lb/>
            the following Tuesday, and, taking to his bed, prepared <lb/>
            himself, for his passage out of this life to the Lord, by <lb/>
            confession and prayer. Having himself given commands to <lb/>
            the brethren of the convent to choose his successor, be <lb/>
            ratified their election of a young monk, named Pontius, by <lb/>
            the sanction of his own authority. He then caused himself <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1113, the sixth indiction, King <lb/>
            Henry paid a visit to St. Evroult, attended by a numerous <lb/>

            their way of life ; and, having learned their rules of discipline, <lb/>
            gave them commendation.2 The next day he was brought into <lb/>

            and nobles, with their barons, Then, having advised with <lb/>
            Robert, earl of Mellent, the king ordered a charter to be <lb/>
            drawn, in which all the domains possessed at that time by the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Evroult should be briefly enumerated. This was <lb/>
            done accordingly, and afterwards Arnold the prior, and Gil­ <lb/>
            bert des Essarts1 carried the charter to the king at Rouen. <lb/>
            Henry then willingly executed it by making a cross, and deli­ <lb/>
            vered it to the nobles who were present to be similarly ratified <lb/>
            by their each affixing to it the sign of the cross. Those who <lb/>
            subscribed were Robert, earl of Mellent; Richard, earl of <lb/>

            greedy heirs, who were yearly plundering the convent of the <lb/>
            charitable foundations of their ancestors, and constantly ex­ <lb/>
            posed the monks to litigation, to the great injury of ecclesi­ <lb/>

            instrument with his seal, and forbade all men, by his royal <lb/>
            authority, from impleading the monks in respect of any of <lb/>
            the matters specified in the charter, except in his own court. <lb/>

            this, King Henry, assembling the whole military force of <lb/>
            Normandy, laid siege to Belèsme, on the calends [the 1st] of <lb/>
            May, and was more successful than he hoped. For Theobald <lb/>
            count de Blois, Fulk of Anjou, Rotrou of Mortain,1 and <lb/>
            other distinguished nobles marched to the aid of the Nor­ <lb/>
            mans, and investing the place with their troops, entered it <lb/>
            victoriously three days afterwards. It happened to be the <lb/>
            feast of the Invocation of the Holy Cross, and the king had <lb/>
            issued orders to the whole of his army to suspend the attack <lb/>
            and not to engage in any military enterprise. However, the <lb/>
            troops of count Theobald and Rotrou, not having heard of <lb/>
            the kings's command, appeared in arms; upon which some <lb/>
            knights of the garrison issued forth from the castle to engage <lb/>
            in single combat The besiegers charging them impetuously, <lb/>
            they wheeled their horses round and made a hasty retreat to <lb/>
            the western gate; but at its entrance they were overtaken <lb/>
            and beaten down by their pursuers, and the doors were pre­ <lb/>
            vented from being closed by the number of lances, so that <lb/>
            they remained wide open. The royal army forthwith <lb/>
            marched in with loud shouts, and made themselves masters of <lb/>
            the greater part of the place. Then, as those who guarded <lb/>
            the citadel made a vigorous resistance, they set it on fire, <lb/>
            and this noble edifice, which Robert had for a long period <lb/>
            enriched and fortified, was burnt to the ground.</p>
          <p>Henry, thus victorious, having established peace with all <lb/>
            his neighbours, returned to England, and during five years,2 <lb/>
            governed his kingdom over the sea, as well as his duchy on <lb/>
            this side the channel, in great tranquillity; his faithful ad­ <lb/>

          <p>IN the year of our Lord, 1118, the eleventh indiction1, on <lb/>
            Christmas eve, a violent tempest overthrew many buildings <lb/>
            and trees in the western parts.</p>
          <p>On the death of Pope Paschal, John of Gaieta, formerly <lb/>
            chancellor and master of requests in the Roman Church, was <lb/>
            elected pope, and contrary to the emperor's wishes, was <lb/>
            canonically consecrated by the clergy of Rome.2 At the same <lb/>
            time Bourdin, archbishop of Prague, who received from his <lb/>
            adherents the name of Gregory VIII, was by the emperor's <lb/>
            intrigues intruded into the church of Grod.3 In consequence, <lb/>
            a grievous schism was made, and a cruel persecution ensued <lb/>
            to the great injury of the catholics.</p>
          <p>At that time there was a serious misunderstanding <lb/>
            between Lewis, king of France, and Henry, king of Eng­ <lb/>
            land, and the hostilities of those powerful monarchs frequently <lb/>
            devastated their respective territories. King Lewis rendered <lb/>
            aid to the exiled William for the recovery of his inheritance, <lb/>
            and a great number of the Normans espoused his cause with <lb/>
            all their might. Meanwhile, Henry surprised the castle of <lb/>
            St. Clair,4 and holding possession of it for a long time <lb/>
            against Osmond5 and other freebooters in that neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, he inflicted from thence great losses on the French. On <lb/>

            knights being muffled in black cowls; and, fortifying the <lb/>
            cell of the monks of St. Ouen which stands there, shame­ <lb/>
            fully made the house of God, set apart for divine offices, a <lb/>
            den of thieves. The king of England hearing of this, flew to <lb/>
            the spot with his troops, and built two forts, to which the <lb/>
            enemy in derision gave foul names, calling one of them <lb/>
            Malassis, and the other Gête-à-Lièvres.1 This war, furiously <lb/>
            raging for nearly four years, devastated the states of both <lb/>
            princes with fire, rapine, and cruel slaughter.</p>
          <p>Pope Gelasius was a prelate of great erudition, and having <lb/>
            been chancellor of the holy see nearly forty years, had great <lb/>
            experience in affairs and was an able politician. But his <lb/>
            government of the Roman church did not last quite two <lb/>
            years. His avarice was so excessive, that, paying a visit to <lb/>
            France, he oppressed the churches in those parts to supply <lb/>
            the. inordinate expenditure of the Roman court, but he passed <lb/>
            away like the morning dew at the breath of God.</p>
          <p>At that time, in Brittany, the devil appeared to a woman <lb/>
            who was confined by childbirth, in the shape of her husband, <lb/>
            and on her asking for food he gave it her. The woman, de­ <lb/>
            by the guise he assumed, ate of it, and having finished the <lb/>
            meal, the devil vanished. Shortly afterwards her husband <lb/>
            came in, and hearing what had happened, was greatly tern- <lb/>
            Bed, and told it to the priest. The priest having invoked <lb/>
            God's name, touched the woman, sprinkled her with holy <lb/>
            water, and instructed her what to say if 'the deceiver should <lb/>
            appear again. On Satan's return, she put the questions <lb/>
            to him with which she had been furnished. “What,” she <lb/>
            said, " did the violent wind which roared so terribly before <lb/>
            Christmas, and caused us great alarm, portend ? Houses and <lb/>
            churches were unroofed, the pinnacles of towers blown down, <lb/>
            and numberless oaks levelled in the woods." The devil <lb/>
            replied, " God had resolved that great part of mankind <lb/>
            should perish, but the efficacious prayers of the saints <lb/>
            procured pardon for the race of man, and the storm fell on <note type="footnote"> 1 Trulla Leporis; its site is not known. The ruins of Malassis form an <lb/>

            exalted rank will perish." At these words the woman <lb/>
            sprinkled holy water, and the devil vanished.</p>
          <p>About the same time a prodigy was seen in England. <lb/>
            A rustic having bought a pregnant cow at Ely, he killed and <lb/>
            opened it by order of Hervey the Breton, bishop of that <lb/>
            diocese.1 Strange to say, instead of a calf, three little pigs <lb/>
            were. found in it. A certain pilgrim from Jerusalem,2 <lb/>
            who chanced to meet the countryman driving the cow home <lb/>
            from market, told him, and afterwards repeated to the bishop <lb/>
            and other by-standers, that three great persons in the domi­ <lb/>
            nions of King Henry would die that year, and many severe <lb/>
            calamities would follow. The pilgrim's prophecy was justified <lb/>
            by events which occurred in the time specified.3</p>
          <p>In fact, William count of Evreux died on the fourteenth <lb/>
            of the calends of May, [18th April], and was interred at <lb/>
            Fontenelles, in the abbey of St. Wandrille, by the side of his <lb/>
            father Richard.4 Soon afterwards, Queen Matilda, whose <lb/>
            baptismal name was Edith, died on the calends [the 1st] <lb/>
            of May, and lies buried in the church of St. Peter, at West­ <lb/>

            brother in the chapter of the monks, at Préaux.1 After the <lb/>

            in Normandy.</p>
          <p>Amauri de Montfort, son of Simon and Agnes, Count <lb/>
            William's nephew by his sister, laid claim to the country of <lb/>
            Evreux, but the king gave him a prompt denial, by the advice <lb/>
            of Ouen, bishop of that city. In consequence, Amauri <lb/>
            flew to arms with all his force, and nearly the whole of <lb/>
            France espoused his cause against King Henry. He was <lb/>
            warlike and powerful, possessing fortified castles with strong <lb/>
            garrisons; and his kindred abounding in wealth and re­ <lb/>
            sources, he held a high rank among the French nobility.</p>
          <p>The same year, in the month of October, William Poin­ <lb/>
            tell put him in possession of the citadel of Evreux, so that <note type="footnote"> Having quitted the gay and busy court of England, she resumed her <lb/>
            habits of gathering about her the sick, suffering under the most disgusting <lb/>

            encouraged by a lavish use of her revenues. It was not at Westminster, <lb/>
            as our author says, but at Winchester, that her remains were interred, in <lb/>
            vetere coenobio. Afterwards, King Henry transferred them, with the bones <lb/>
            of Queen Frytheswyde, to The Holy Hole. Ordericus makes an important <lb/>
            remark on Queen Matilda's name, which is probably applicable to other <lb/>
            persons of the middle ages. It is, that the name she bore in the world was <lb/>
            not that of her baptism. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Robert, earl of Mellent (comte de Meulan in Normandy), terminated <lb/>

          <p>BALDWIN the younger, the intrepid earl of Flanders,2 took <lb/>
            arms against King Henry with his whole force, to re­ <lb/>
            establish his cousin William in his paternal inheritance. <lb/>
            Henry, Count d'Eu,3 was among the first to aid the rebels <lb/>

            arrested him at Rouen with Hugh de Gournai, and threw <lb/>
            him into prison till he surrendered his fortresses. Upon <lb/>
            this Baldwin, at the head of a large body of Flemings, made <lb/>
            an eruption into Normandy as far as Arques, and burnt <lb/>
            the villages in the Talou in Henry's sight, who, with his <lb/>

            for some time administered by his father-in-law, Dreux, and, <lb/>
            from the king's misplaced confidence, he took possession as a <lb/>
            friend of the fortresses entrusted to his custody. Hugh, <lb/>
            however, did not repay the favours of his munificent patron <lb/>
            with the gratitude he owed him; for he allied himself with <lb/>

            Plessis, of which Bertrand Rumex had the custody, for the king and Hugh <lb/>

            Martin-du-Plessis, on the confines of Brai and the Rumois. Nor can the <lb/>
            exact signification be given of Bertram's strange surname. </note><note type="footnote"> * Hugh Talbot was a vassal of the lords of Gournai. The first member <lb/>
            of this family who bore the name of Hugh appears to have been Hugo <lb/>
            cognomine Taleboth, who was probably father of the Hugh of whom we <lb/>
            are speaking, and who made a charter in favour of La Trinité-du-Mont. <lb/>
            Among the witnesses to it we find a person named Guilbert d'Eu; and <lb/>
            there is reason to believe that the family of Talbot derived its origin from <lb/>
            that county. Then come Richard and Geoffrey Talbot, appearing as <lb/>
            mesne-tenants in Domesday-book. Richard was witness to a grant by <lb/>
            Waiter Giffard in the time of the Conqueror. The English genealogists <lb/>
            make his wife to have been a daughter of Gerard Gournai, and Hugh <lb/>
            Talbot to be the offspring of this marriage, being thus nephew of Hugh <lb/>
            Gournai, son of Gerard. But this opinion is scarcely borne out by the <lb/>
            present passage of Ordericus, and the words nepoli ejus, are susceptible of <lb/>
            another interpretation. However that may be, the person mentioned by <lb/>

            charter to the abbey of Savigni in the time of Turgis, bishop of Avranches. <lb/>
            He held twenty knights' fees in England in the time of Henry I., and prob­ <lb/>
            ably married a sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Essex, in the time of <lb/>
            King Stephen. This family made several grants to the abbey of Beaubee, </note> <pb n="453"/>

          <p>Meanwhile Hugh obstinately persisted in his rebellion, <lb/>
            collecting arms and troops in his castles of Gournai, la <lb/>

          <p>AT that time Fulk, count of Anjou, being called in by <lb/>
            Robert Giroie,1 who was defending the castle of St. Ceneri <lb/>

            garrison, consisting of one hundred and forty knights and <lb/>
            men-at-arms, were forced to surrender, on the terms that <lb/>
            they should not undergo mutilation, and should keep their <lb/>
            arms. Their leaders, Roger de Saint-Jean, and John his <lb/>
            brother, were selected by the king. On the calends [the <lb/>
            1st] of August, the Angevins, having razed the fortress to <lb/>
            the ground, returned triumphant to their own territory. <lb/>
            The garrison retired to Alençon in great distress, and much <lb/>
            ashamed of their surrender, at which the king was very <lb/>
            indignant. However they excused themselves with great <lb/>
            show of reason, alleging that they had frequently sent mes­ <lb/>
            sengers to demand relief, which, though long expected, did <lb/>
            not arrive in time, while they were continually exposed to <lb/>
            the violent assaults of the besiegers.</p>
          <p>Then Henry granted Séez, Alençon, and all the domains <lb/>
            of Robert de Belèsme in that country to Count Theobald1 <lb/>
            and the count, with the king's licence, gave that fief to his <lb/>
            brother Stephen in lieu of his portion of his father's inherit­ <lb/>
            ance which lay inFrance. The young Stephen, therefore, took <lb/>
            possession of Séez, Alençon, Merle-sur-Sarthe, Almenèches, <lb/>
            and La Roche d'Igé, and arming and garrisoning the castles <lb/>
            with his own troops, oppressed the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            country by his outrages and exactions, and, changing their <lb/>
            customary payments and services under the king, made <lb/>
            himself odious, and the vassals disloyal.</p>
          <p>In those days the sons of iniquity sat in the chair of con­ <lb/>
            tagious evil, and were guilty of many crimes throughout the <lb/>
            world. Richer de Laigle claimed his father's lands in <lb/>
            England,2 but the king gave him a positive refusal, saying, <lb/>
            that his brothers Geoffrey and Engenulf served in his <lb/>
            army, and confidently depended on obtaining those domains <lb/>
            by hereditary right. The young Richer frequently urging <lb/>
            his claim with great insolence, the king who was much <note type="footnote"> 1 Theobald, count de Bids, surnamed the Great, for what reason we <lb/>
            cannot discover. It was certainly not for his loyalty to his sovereign. </note><note type="footnote"> The concession of this frontier of Normandy was a humiliating avowal of <lb/>
            weakness on the part of so powerful a monarch as Henry I. It appears <lb/>
            from it that he did not feel himself in a position to defend it against the <lb/>
            invasions of the count of Anjou. By suffering it to be made over to <lb/>
            Stephen, he placed almost insurmountable obstacles in the way of his <lb/>
            direct heirs. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 They lay in the counties of Surrey and Norfolk. </note> <pb n="456"/>

            engaged, altogether rejected his suit, adding some words of <lb/>
            contempt. In consequence the haughty young lord left the <lb/>
            court of Normandy in a rage, and shortly afterwards made <lb/>
            an agreement with the king of France, that unless his <lb/>
            paternal inheritance was restored to him, he would desert <lb/>
            from the king of England. King Lewis promised Richer <lb/>
            that if he came over to his side he would constantly main­ <lb/>
            tain sixty soldiers, and Amauri 1 fifty, in the castle of Laigle.</p>
          <p>After this assurance, Richer returned to the English <lb/>
            court, and again required of the king to restore him his <lb/>
            inheritance ; but he obtained no redress, and retired sorrow­ <lb/>
            ful. The next day, his uncle, Count Rotrou, spoke to the <lb/>
            king on the subject, and tendered him good advice to pre­ <lb/>
            vent the revolt from spreading. The king accepted his <lb/>
            counsels, and gave him a message to Richer that he would <lb/>
            grant him what he asked. Being greatly delighted at this, <lb/>
            he hastened to meet King Lewis, who was already on the <lb/>
            march with a large body of troops. " I, my lord" he said, <lb/>
            lately made an agreement with you which I am unable to <lb/>
            keep: for the king of England, my own sovereign, has <lb/>
            restored to me all that I demanded, and it is but just that <lb/>
            I should perfectly maintain my fealty to him." King Lewis <lb/>
            replied : " Be gone ! I shall effect all that is in my power." <lb/>
            Upon this, Richer returned home, and Lewis following in <lb/>
            his steps, with his whole force, appeared before the gates of <lb/>
            Laigle. As the garrison were determined to resist, the king <lb/>
            commenced the assault, and some one, it is not known who, <lb/>
            having set fire to the place, it was so fanned by a strong <lb/>
            wind that the flames spread, and the whole of it was reduced <lb/>
            to ashes. Richer was compelled by this disaster to resort to <lb/>
            the king, and having confirmed the former compact, he sur­ <lb/>
            rendered the fortress to the French on the third of the nones <lb/>
            [the 3rd] of September. The king of France and his troops <lb/>
            remained there three days in great want, and, retiring on <lb/>

            and Isnard d'Ecublei,1 observing their fealty to Henry, drew <lb/>
            off to Pont Echanfré, and, abandoning all that they held <lb/>
            under the disturber of the peace, attached themselves to <lb/>
            Ralph-the-Red in opposing the king's enemies.2 The <lb/>
            French, finding that the whole place was burnt to the <lb/>
            ground, were not frightened like timid hares; but, bold as <lb/>
            lions, established themselves among the ruins of the houses, <lb/>
            where they pitched their tents, and ransacked the country <lb/>
            for provisions with arms in their hands.</p>
          <p>This state of affairs becoming known, King Henry made <lb/>
            a forced march to Laigle the next day, and lost no time in <lb/>
            laying siege to the place, although it was in ruins, to the <lb/>
            terror of all who were in it. But his plans were frustrated <lb/>
            by the adverse news brought by William de Tankerville, <lb/>
            which the king too easily credited. This person met the <lb/>
            king at a village called Livet,3 and said to him: " My lord, <lb/>
            king, where are you going ? The Cauchois have commis­ <lb/>
            sioned me to entreat you to return with your troops into <lb/>
            their country. Hugh de Gournai, and Stephen d'Aumale, <lb/>
            with their adherents, have taken possession of the hill above <lb/>
            Rouen,4 and are employed in building a fort in the abbey of <lb/>

            great body of French, to take possession of the place which <lb/>
            the citizens are ready to betray to him." As soon as the <lb/>
            king heard this he retraced his steps; and the garrison of <lb/>
            Laigle pursued his army as it retreated by different roads. <note type="footnote"> when we recollect that Rotrou II., count of Perche, was nephew of Sancho <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the second week of November, King Henry approached <lb/>
            Laigle with a strong body of cavalry and infantry, and <lb/>
            ravaged all the country round. Upon this, the garrison of <lb/>

            were not slack in engaging the royal troops. Count <lb/>
            Theobald2 having been thrown from his horse was taken <lb/>
            prisoner, but the King and Count Stephen pursued them <lb/>
            with a band of brave knights and nobly snatched the captive <lb/>
            count from the hands of his enemies. The engagement <lb/>

            warded off the blow without its wounding him.</p>
          <p>At this time the burgesses of Alen9on revolted against <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            respect. Like another Rehoboam he listened to the catteries <lb/>
            of his parasites rather than the counsels of the elders, and <lb/>
            imagined that the people of Alençon were disloyal to himself <lb/>
            and the king. In consequence he oppressed them with <lb/>
            injuries and unusual exactions, little foreseeing what the <lb/>
            consequences would be. At last, he summoned a general <lb/>
            assembly and required them to deliver to him their sons as <lb/>
            hostages for their good behaviour. Obeying this command <lb/>
            reluctantly and by compulsion, they waited their time of <lb/>
            vengeance full of ill-will. At first, they dissembled their <lb/>
            resentment, but it was not long before they took open <lb/>
            measures for their redress.</p>
          <p>The count received the hostages, but did not give them <lb/>
            honourable treatment. He caused the wife of a worthy <lb/>
            townsman, who was daughter of Paganus de Cacei,l a gallant <lb/>
            knight, to be imprisoned in the citadel, where, much to her <lb/>
            sorrow, she was in the hands of debauched guards. Her <lb/>
            husband Amiot,2 being much incensed, and feeling the <lb/>
            disgrace of this affront, made a secret association with <lb/>
            several others who had similar causes of complaint. They <lb/>
            imprudently shrunk from appealing to the king who was a <lb/>
            lover of justice, from apprehension that he would turn a deaf <lb/>
            ear to their charges against his nephew. Under these <lb/>
            circumstances they had recourse to Arnulph de Montgomery, <lb/>
            Robert de Belesme's brother, through whom they sent a <lb/>
            requisition to Fulk, count of Anjou, to take possession of <lb/>
            Alençon, which they were ready to give up to him, upon his <lb/>
            securing the free rights of the townsmen and expelling the <lb/>
            count's garrison from the citadel. The count of Anjou was <lb/>
            well pleased at the proposal, and assembling his knights, <lb/>
            archers, and foot soldiers, marched to Alençon, and his forces <lb/>
            being admitted into the place in the night, he invested the <lb/>
            fortress and vigorously assaulted the garrison. Report, <lb/>
            than which there is nothing swifter, spread the news far and <lb/>
            wide, and it quickly came to the king's ears while he was <lb/>
            deeply anxious about the state of affairs.</p>
          <p>As soon as the undaunted king had ascertained the accu­ <lb/>

            numbers near Alençon for the purpose of affording effectual <lb/>
            relief to the besieged. The gallant brothers, Theobald and <lb/>
            Stephen, had preceded the king's army, and attempted to <lb/>
            throw a convoy of provisions into the place under a guard, <lb/>
            but without success. The count of Anjou marched out <lb/>
            against them, and disposing his troops in battle array, <lb/>
            encountered them boldly. Some were slain, more made <lb/>
            prisoners, and the rest being routed, the count returned to <lb/>
            the town with much booty.1 Thenceforth he pressed the <lb/>
            siege with more security, and cut off the supply of water <lb/>
            by subterranean works, secretly carried on ; for the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants were well acquainted with the conduit by which the <lb/>
            founders of this citadel introduced the water of the Sarthe <lb/>
            into the place. The troops shut up in the fortress finding <lb/>
            their provisions fail, and that no relief arrived from any <lb/>
            quarter, submitted, and surrendering the citadel, marched <lb/>
            out under safe conduct with all their baggage. These dis­ <lb/>
            asters gave occasion to much pillage, and the season of our <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the course of the same year, Eustace de Breteuil,2 Henry's <lb/>
            son-in-law, was frequently advised' by his countrymen and <lb/>
            kinsmen, to break with the king, unless he restored to him <lb/>
            the castle of Ivri, which belonged to his predecessors. Henry <lb/>
            deferred for a time granting his demand, but promised it <lb/>
            at some future period, and, satisfying him by gracious words, <lb/>
            retained his allegiance. He was unwilling to quarrel with <lb/>
            Eustace, who was one of the most powerful of the Norman <lb/>
            nobles, was supported by numerous friends and vassals, and <lb/>
            possessed strongly fortified castles; in order, therefore, to <lb/>
            secure his fidelity, he delivered to him as an hostage, the <lb/>
            son of Ralph-Harenc,3 who had the custody of the fortress, <lb/>
            and in turn took as hostages Eustace's two daughters, who <lb/>
            were his own grand-daughters.</p>
          <p>Eustace shamefully treated the hostages he received, for <lb/>
            at the instigation of Amauri de Montfort, who used every <lb/>
            artifice that malice could suggest to renew the quarrel, <lb/>
            and made many promises to Eustace on oath which he <lb/>
            never performed, he put out the boy's eyes, and in this <lb/>
            state sent him back to his father, a most worthy knight. <lb/>
            Upon this the father went to the king in a rage, and made <lb/>
            known to him the cruel treatment his son had received. <lb/>
            Henry, receiving the intelligence with lively grief, delivered <lb/>
            up his two granddaughters, that the father might imme­ <lb/>
            diately wreak his vengeance on them. Accordingly, Ralph <lb/>
            Harenc, with the permission of the incensed monarch, seized <note type="footnote"> 1 This pope died the 12th or 13th of December, 1124, after governing <lb/>

            cut off the tips of their noses, in retaliation for the cruelty <lb/>
            shown to his son.1 Thus, alas! these innocent children suf­ <lb/>
            fered the penalty of their father's ill deeds, and on both sides <lb/>
            parental regard had to mourn the injury and mutilation of <lb/>
            their offspring. Ralph, consoled by the king, and honoured <lb/>
            with presents, returned to the castle of Ivri, and announced <lb/>
            to Eustace the revenge which the royal severity had ex­ <lb/>
            acted from the persons of his daughters. On learning their <lb/>
            calamity, the father and mother were overwhelmed with grief, <lb/>
            and the count placed his castles of Lire, Glos, Pont-Saint- <lb/>
            Pierre and Pact in a state of defence, that neither the king <lb/>
            or his partizans might obtained admittance into them. He <lb/>
            sent his wife Juliana, the king's daughter by a concubine, <lb/>
            to Breteuil, attended by a sufficient body of troops to guard <lb/>
            the place.</p>
          <p>The burgesses,2 who were faithful to the king and un­ <lb/>
            willing to give him any offence, comprehending that Juliana's <lb/>
            arrival would be the ruin of a number of people, sent a <lb/>
            message to Henry, begging him to lose no time in coming <lb/>
            to Breteuil. That prudent monarch, recollecting what was <lb/>
            said by the audacious Curio to Cæsar, relative to military <lb/>
            enterprises­ <lb/>
            " Delays are dangerous when your plans are laid," 3 <lb/>
            having listened to the envoys of the burgesses, came in all <lb/>
            haste to Breteuil, and the gates being readily opened to him, <lb/>
            passed into the place. He returned thanks to the loyal in­ <lb/>
            habitants for their loyalty to him, and, prohibiting his soldiers <lb/>
            from laying hands on their property, laid siege to the citadel <lb/>
            in which his contumacious daughter had sLut herself up. <lb/>
            Juliana was now involved in anxieties, not knowing where <lb/>
            to turn, and feeling sure that her father was deeply <note type="footnote"> I We shudder at such atrocities, and wonder that they could be perpe­ <lb/>

            exasperated against her, and would never retire from the <lb/>
            castle he had invested, but as a victor. At length, as <lb/>
            Solomon says, "There is no wickedness like that of a woman,”1 <lb/>
            she determined on lifting her hands against the Lord's <lb/>
            anointed. In consequence, she treacherously sought a con­ <lb/>
            ference with her father, and the king who suspected no such <lb/>
            fraudulent design in a woman, giving her the- meeting, his <lb/>
            unhappy daughter attempted his life. Drawing a crossbow <lb/>
            she launched a bolt at him, but through God's protection <lb/>
            he escaped unharmed. Thereupon the king ordered the <lb/>
            drawbridge of the castle to be broken down, so that no one <lb/>
            could either enter or come out.</p>
          <p>Juliana now finding herself blockaded on all points and <lb/>
            that there was no one to succour her, surrendered the castle <lb/>
            to the king; but he would on no account consent to allow <lb/>
            her to depart freely: so that the king's orders compelled her to <lb/>
            let herself down from the summit of the walls without sup­ <lb/>
            port, and as there was no bridge she descended into the foss <lb/>
            indecently, with naked legs. This took place in the beginning <lb/>
            of Lent, the third week of February when the castle-ditch <lb/>
            was full of snow-water which, being half frozen, her tender <lb/>
            limbs of course suffered in her fall from the severity of the <lb/>
            cold. The unfortunate heroine, getting out of it how she <lb/>
            could and covered with shame, joined her husband who was <lb/>
            then at Pact, and gave him a faithful account of the sad <lb/>
            occurrence. Meanwhile the king assembled the burgesses, <lb/>
            commended them for maintaining their allegiance, honoured <lb/>
            them with promises and benefits, and by their advice placed <lb/>
            the castle of Breteuil in the custody of William, son of <lb/>
            Ralph.</p>
          <p>Shortly afterwards, King Henry restored to Ralph de <lb/>

            those who held Courci,1 and other strong places in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, hearing that almost all the Normans had <lb/>
            deserted from the king and espoused the cause of his nephew, <lb/>
            resolved to adopt a similar resolution. In the first instance <lb/>
            Reynold de Bailol2 went to Falaise, and withdrawing his <lb/>
            fealty to the king, insolently rejected his demand for the sur­ <lb/>
            render of his mansion house at Renouard.3 The king then <lb/>
            said to him : " As you are come to my court, I will not have <lb/>
            you arrested; but you will repent of your evil designs against <lb/>
            me." Shortly after his departure, Henry assembled his <lb/>
            troops, and appeared before Reynold's castle in the evening, <lb/>
            almost as soon as he returned to it himself. The knight, <lb/>
            finding that he was not equal to the burden he had taken <lb/>
            on himself, came out in the morning, and imploring the <lb/>
            royal clemency surrendered his fortress. The king immedi­ <lb/>
            ately set fire to the mansion which was built of stone, with <lb/>
            the stores of provisions, and all that it contained. On hear­ <lb/>
            ing this news the garrison of Courci, Grantmesnil, and Mont- <lb/>
            Pincon,4 who had proposed to revolt, remained quiet, and <lb/>
            forthwith abandoning their malicious designs from appre­ <lb/>

            Having driven out the natives of the country who were in <lb/>

            ravaging the lands of his neighbours, so that, old as he was, <lb/>
            he had no shame at being ranked among the public enemies.</p>

            extended to him, he retained faithfully and advantageously <lb/>
            to the end of his days, which was not far distant. Several <lb/>
            others wisely followed his example.</p>
          <p>The king also invited Amauri to make peace with him, <lb/>
            promising that if he would surrender the citadel, he should <lb/>
            occupy the whole county of Evreux without molestation. <lb/>
            The count, being a turbulent man, absurdly rejected the <lb/>
            offers voluntarily made him by the royal grace; and, having <lb/>
            weighty grounds for hostilities in the loss of the inheritance <lb/>
            of his ancestors, he hurried in breathless haste from one <lb/>
            castle to another by night, keeping every one in continual <lb/>
            commotion by his restless activity, encouraging his con­ <lb/>
            federates, and warning them carefully to guard their for­ <lb/>
            tresses, to be on the watch against crafty spies, and, making <lb/>
            irruptions throughout the neighbourhood with prudence and <lb/>
            activity, pillage everything but the churches, and put down <lb/>
            by force of arms all opposition. Such were the hostilities <lb/>
            which he indefatigably urged for the recovery of the county <lb/>
            to which he was heir, but of which the king had deprived <lb/>
            him. Ralph-the-Red3 was generally his most formidable <lb/>

            scarcely gone when Ralph fell into the enemy's hands, but <lb/>

            far as La Ferté Fresnel; and, unless this castle had offered <lb/>
            them a near asylum, they would have suffered greater loss.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards, this same brave knight made an <lb/>
            amicable appeal to the king, humbly representing the <lb/>
            advantages of his only showing himself before Fresnel, the <lb/>
            garrison of which were as cowardly as they were trouble­ <lb/>
            some. In consequence, the king, at last, after Whitsuntide,1 <lb/>
            gave way to the earnest entreaties of Hugh, and was induced <lb/>
            to appear before the fortress from which the devastations of <lb/>
            the territory of St. Evroult were carried on. On the king's <lb/>
            arrival the people of Fresnel were struck with panic, and <lb/>
            in their alarm consulted together what was to be done; <lb/>
            but Ralph-the-Red, of Pont-Echanfré, having vigorously as­ <lb/>
            saulted the place, they laid the keys of the fortress at the <lb/>
            king's feet, and, having submitted to his judgment on their <lb/>
            rebellion, returned to their allegiance.</p>
          <p>About the end of June, the old Richard came to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and, being ill, assumed the monastic habit. He <lb/>
            died shortly afterwards in the beginning of July, and was <lb/>
            buried in the monks' chapter-house, having given to the <lb/>
            abbey one portion of the church of La Gronfrière2 and the <lb/>
            moiety of his tithes, and obtained from William, his eldest <lb/>

          <p>In the course of June, William the Etheling was married <lb/>

          <p>At the same time a brilliant red light was observed <lb/>

            to the rebels, entered the territory of Evreux and laid siege <lb/>
            to that city at the head of a powerful army; but the garrison <lb/>
            of the castle, joined by the citizens, making a stout resistance, <lb/>
            he could not force an entrance. There were with him his <lb/>
            son Richard, his nephew count Stephen, Ralph de Guader <note type="footnote"> on the 10th of October, 1144, dried most of the streams in the south of <lb/>
            England, and even extended ten miles into the sea. These phenomena <lb/>
            are worthy the consideration of geologists. The last is mentioned by several <lb/>

            and a great force of Normans. The king having called <lb/>
            them all together, thus addressed bishop Ouen : " You see, <lb/>
            lord bishop, that we have been repulsed by the enemy, and <lb/>
            there are no means of reducing them but by fire. But if <lb/>
            we set the place on fire, the churches will be burnt and <lb/>
            much injury be done to the innocent. Now therefore, as <lb/>
            the pastor of this church, after careful consideration, tell <lb/>
            us wisely what is best to be done. If, by God's help, the <lb/>
            fire secures our success, by his aid we will repair the <lb/>
            damages the church may receive, freely defraying the cost <lb/>
            out of our own treasury, so that the house of God will, I <lb/>
            think, be rebuilt, even better than it now is. "</p>
          <p>The prelate hesitated how he should reply in a case of so <lb/>
            much difficulty. He was at a loss what to decide as most <lb/>
            conformable to the divine will, and doubted what was best for <lb/>
            him to desire and propose. At length, after consulting men <lb/>
            of prudence, he gave permission for firebrands to be thrown in <lb/>
            and the city given to the flames, in order that it might be <lb/>
            delivered from excommunicated traitors and restored to its <lb/>
            rightful owners. In consequence, Ralph de Guader set it <lb/>
            on fire, on the north side first, and the flames spreading <lb/>
            without obstacle in every quarter, as it was the dry season <lb/>
            of autumn, caught all the buildings. The abbey of St. <lb/>
            Saviour's, which belonged to nuns, was burnt to the ground, <lb/>
            as well as the celebrated church of St. Mary, the glorious <lb/>
            mother and Virgin, in which the bishop and clergy officiated <lb/>
            and where the episcopal court of the diocese was held. The <lb/>
            king and all his nobles humbly gave the bishop pledges, in <lb/>
            consequence of the destruction of the churches by fire, pro­ <lb/>
            mising him distinctly ample contributions from their wealth <lb/>
            for the restoration of the buildings.</p>
          <p>The prudent king had made peace with Robert Goël, as <lb/>
            we have seen before, giving him the custody of the castle of <lb/>
            Ivri to secure his fidelity, and receiving his brothers as hos­ <lb/>
            tages for his good behaviour. Ralph-the-Red was the service­ <lb/>
            able mediator of this pacific agreement, being the knight's <lb/>
            brother-in-law, and thus bound to him by the strictest ties. <lb/>
            Before his expedition to Evreux, the king had given orders <lb/>
            to Goël to attack Amauri and his countrymen in arms, and <lb/>
            manoeuvre along the course of the Eure, near Ivri. He <lb/>
            fixed an appointed day on which these operations should be <lb/>
            commenced. Ralph obeyed the king's commands in every <pb n="478"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.XVIII. </note> <lb/>
            particular, and the affair turned out according to Henry's <lb/>
            wishes. At length, seeing the city entirely in flames, he <lb/>
            despatched a messenger to Roger Goël with the intelligence <lb/>
            of the event. Thereupon Robert shouted in the thick of the <lb/>
            fight: " My lord Amauri, listen to the news I will tell you, <lb/>
            which will bring you nothing but grief. The king has burnt <lb/>
            to-day the city of Evreux, and the garrison of the citadel <lb/>
            are in fear of instant death." On hearing this, Amauri <lb/>
            collected his troops, and returned home sorrowing for the <lb/>
            ruin of his city.</p>
          <p>Philip and Florus,1 sons of Philip, king of France, and <lb/>
            Amauri's nephews by his sister Bertrade, William Pointel, <lb/>
            Richard of Evreux, son of Fulk the provost, and several <lb/>
            other brave knights, defended the citadel. After the city <lb/>
            was burnt their resistance was more secure and bold, for <lb/>
            since the citizens bad fled there was less to protect. The <lb/>
            inhabitants of the ruined city dispersed themselves in all <lb/>
            quarters, and having lost all they possessed, were forced to <lb/>
            wander in wretchedness among the cottages of strangers. <lb/>
            The king, with his usual moderation, sent word to the garri­ <lb/>
            son that if they would surrender the citadel be would par­ <lb/>
            don all their transgressions, adding many other promises; <lb/>
            and as they accepted his terms he hastened to take in hand <lb/>
            other state affairs. However, he returned shortly afterwards <lb/>
            in the night, at the head of a strong body of troops, and <lb/>
            before dawn, with lighted torches, began to fortify his camp, <lb/>
            and having completed the works he entrusted it to some <lb/>
            brave warriors. Ralph-the-Red and Simon de Molines2 were <lb/>
            appointed to the command, with Gilbert d'Exmes and several <lb/>
            others of approved valour. The king placed great confidence <lb/>
            in them, employing them to check the enemy's irruptions <lb/>
            and recover the country which had been taken from him.</p>

            visits to their brethren in arms with great daring and cou­ <lb/>
            rage, encouraging them by their presence, and frequently <lb/>
            disturbing the royal camp by sharp attacks. The king's <lb/>
            troops were never taken by surprise, always anticipating the <lb/>
            manoeuvres of their insidious foe and meeting their adversa­ <lb/>
            ries, fierce as lions, ready armed with coats of mail and hel­ <lb/>
            met::;, and exchanging blows gallantly with sword and spear. <lb/>
            No one would yield to his antagonist, but each burned to <lb/>
            distinguish himself; so that many fell in these daily encoun­ <lb/>
            ters. There the knight, named William, son of Roger de St. <lb/>
            Lawrence, was slain, and his body was interred in the <lb/>
            church of St. Victor the Martyr.1 He was of a noble house <lb/>
            of the most illustrious barons of the district of Caux, and his <lb/>
            bravery was often extolled among the greatest warriors of <lb/>
            the Talou. In this manner much blood was shed in these <lb/>
            constant feats of arms, and the cruel loss of life among the <lb/>
            flower of the Norman youth was the cause of deep sorrow to <lb/>
            numbers.</p>
          <p>King Lewis laid siege to the castle of Dangu, and French <lb/>
            volour closely straitened the governor Robert.2 At last, by <lb/>
            the advice of some friends among the besiegers, he set the <lb/>
            place on fire, and marching out left the enemy nothing but <lb/>
            its ashes. The same week, putting himself at the head of <lb/>
            the troops of Gisors,3 he made a sudden attack on the French, <lb/>
            and carried off much booty from Chaumont and the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring villages. The king of France, greatly elated at the <lb/>
            burning of Dangu, sat down before Chateau-Neuf,4 a castle <lb/>
            which William Rufus built at Fuscelmont on the river Epte, <lb/>
            but he did not obtain the success he desired. Walter Rib­ <lb/>
            lard made a vigorous resistance with the troops of King <lb/>
            Henry, severely wounding the assailants with discharges of <note type="footnote"> 1 In the charter of Hugh de Mortemer in favour of the abbey of St. <lb/>

            been reduced to ashes, and that he had suffered other <lb/>
            disasters; and earnestly demanding instant succour. On <lb/>
            receiving this intelligence the king withdrew from the siege, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>MEANWHILE King Lewis effected his retreat into France <lb/>
            with the utmost expedition, but quickly counter-marched <lb/>
            from Etampes into Normandy, attended by some brave <lb/>
            knights. On the twentieth day of the month of August, <lb/>
            King Henry having heard mass at Noyon marched out with <lb/>
            his principal nobles on an expedition against the French, not <lb/>
            knowing that the king of France had arrived at Andeli.1 <lb/>
            The king of England rode at the head of a gallant troop of <lb/>
            men-at-arms, and caused the harvest in the fields2 about <lb/>
            Etrepagni to be reaped by his rapacious soldiery, giving <lb/>
            orders that great sheaves of corn should be carried on the <lb/>
            backs of their horses to the castle of Lions. Four knights <lb/>
            were stationed by the king on the top of Verclive,3 to keep <lb/>
            watch against any opposition that might be offered to his <lb/>
            enterprise. These sentinels, observing the helmets and <lb/>
            standards of troops moving towards Noyon, gave immediate <lb/>
            notice to King Henry. <note type="footnote"> 1 Henry did not put himself in marching order until he heard that <lb/>
            Lewis had retired. As long as he thought that Lewis-Ie-Gros was in the <lb/>
            Vexin, he prudently shut himself up at Rouen, although fire and pillage <lb/>
            were carried within four miles of his capital city. The king of France, <lb/>
            notwithstanding his corpulence, for which he is jeered by the Norman <lb/>
            writers, was become very active. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It may he thought strange that on the 20th of August the corn should <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 1119.] </note> The same day King Lewis marched from Andeli with the <lb/>
            French army, making frequent complaints to his attendants <lb/>
            that they could not meet with the king of England in an <lb/>
            open field, not knowing that the king was close at hand. <lb/>
            Lewis rode in haste with his brilliant cavalry towards <lb/>
            Noyon, expecting that the castle would be given up to him <lb/>
            the same day, by a concerted treason, but the affair turned <lb/>
            out very differently. Victory did not favour those who were <lb/>
            swelling with pride and eager for the fight, but routed and <lb/>
            put them to flight when they were exulting in the prospect <lb/>
            of triumph. Burchard de Montmorenci,1 and some other <lb/>
            prudent men, dissuaded Lewis from fighting in Normandy, <lb/>
            but the people of Chaumont urged him furiously to give <lb/>
            battle. William the chamberlain2 also tried to prevent Henry <lb/>
            from enagging in the conflict, but William de Warrenne 3 <lb/>
            and Roger de Bienfaite4 gave him great encouragement.</p>
          <p>At last, it was generally understood, by the exchange of <lb/>
            messengers, and by rumours which spread the intelligence far <lb/>
            and wide, that both kings were in presence at the head of <lb/>
            their armies, and, if they wished, battle might be joined. <lb/>
            The French had by this time reached the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Noyon, and had set fire to a granary belonging to the monks <lb/>
            of Boucheron,5 the smoke of which was visible to the <lb/>
            English as it rose in the air. Near Mount Verclive there <lb/>
            is an open ground and vast plain, called by the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the country Brémule.6 King Henry descended to it <lb/>
            with five hundred cavalry, the warlike hero having put on <lb/>

            Roman censors, for their civil virtues and knightly valour, <lb/>
            as the result proved. Edward of Salisbury2 carried the <lb/>
            standard, whose approved intrepidity was in high renown, <lb/>
            and never failed him even when fighting to the death.</p>
          <p>Lewis having come in sight of what he had long desired, <lb/>
            called up four hundred knights, who were ready close at hand, <lb/>
            and exhorted them to do battle valiantly in defence of justice <lb/>
            and the liberty of the kingdom, and not to suffer the glory of <lb/>
            the French arms to be tarnished by their cowardice. There, <lb/>

            with great gallantry, but as they advanced without order, <lb/>
            they were soon overpowered and turned to flight. Richard <lb/>
            the king's son, and a hundred horse were drawn out in <lb/>
            battle array, but the rest with the king held the field on <lb/>
            foot. William Crispin with eighty knights, who rode in <lb/>
            the vain, made the first attack on the Normans, but their <lb/>
            horses being soon killed, they were all surrounded and held <lb/>
            in check. Then Godfrey de Perans, with the troops of <lb/>
            the Vexin, made a resolute assault, which caused the English <lb/>
            army to stagger and fall back a little, but those veteran <lb/>
            warriors soon recovered their courage and strength, and <lb/>
            Burchard, Osmond, and Alberic de Mareuil,3 and several <lb/>
            others, being thrown from their horses, were taken prisoners. <lb/>
            The French perceiving this, said to the king: "Eighty of our <lb/>
            knights, who were in the van of the army, are nowhere to <lb/>
            be seen. The enemy is more than our match in numbers <lb/>
            and strength. Burchard, Osmond, and some others of our <lb/>
            best knights, are already taken; our troops are generally <lb/>
            giving way, and their ranks are thinned. Retreat, my lord, <lb/>
            we pray, ere we are exposed to irreparable ruin."</p>
          <p>At these words Lewis consented to retire, and himself fled <lb/>
            at a gallop with Baudri-du-Bois.4 The victors took one <note type="footnote"> appears under that of Paganus de Mont-Gaio in the chartulary of the <lb/>
            priory of Long-Pont. He was taken prisoner by the Normans, as we have <lb/>
            already seen, in 1097, and he formed an alliance with Count Theobald, <lb/>
            against Lewis-le-Gros, in 1112, but reaped nothing from that war but the <lb/>
            loss of his castle of Livri, near Méluen, which, we are told, caused him <lb/>
            much regret. He died before the year 1127, and Henry de Châtillon, the <lb/>
            wife of his daughter Ermengarde, assumed the title of lord of Montjai, <lb/>
            which his posterity preserved for a long period. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Baudri de Bray has been already noticed. This place, situate on an <lb/>

            hundred and forty prisoners, and pursued the rest to the <lb/>
            very gates of Andeli. The French troops, who had advanced <lb/>
            with pomp by the high road, now fled in confusion by various <lb/>
            by-ways. William Crispin who, with his followers, had been <lb/>
            surrounded as before mentioned, having caught sight of King <lb/>
            Henry whom he mortally hated, charged at him through the <lb/>
            throng of combatants and struck him fiercely on the head <lb/>
            with his sword, but the chevet of the illustrious prince's <lb/>
            hauberk warded off the blow. Roger,l Richard's son, instantly <lb/>
            bore the bold assailant to the earth, and throwing himself <lb/>
            upon him protected him from the king's friends who would <lb/>
            have killed him on the spot in revenge for the insult. But <lb/>
            so many thronged upon Richard that he had great difficulty <lb/>
            in saving his fallen adversary. It was a criminal and au­ <lb/>
            dacious act to raise the hand and strike with the sword <lb/>
            the head which had been anointed by the ministry of the <lb/>
            bishop with the holy chrism, and on which the royal crown <lb/>
            had been placed amidst the acclamations of the people, <lb/>
            lauding and giving thanks to the Lord God 2</p>
          <p>In the battle between the two kings, in which nearly nine <lb/>
            hundred knights were engaged, I have ascertained that three <lb/>
            only were slain. This arose from their being entirely <lb/>
            covered with steel armour, and mutually sparing each other <lb/>
            for the fear of God and out of regard for the fraternity of <lb/>
            arms, and aimed less at killing the fugitives than making <lb/>
            them prisoners. Christian warriors, they did not thirst for <lb/>
            their brothers' blood, but exulted in the victory which God <lb/>
            gave them for the good of holy church and the security of <lb/>
            the faithful. The brave Guy, Osmond, Burchard, and <lb/>
            William Crispin, with several others, were taken on the field, <lb/>
            as I have said before, and conducted to Noyon, where the <lb/>
            English army retired the same day. Noyon is three leagues <lb/>
            from Andeli, and at that time the whole country was a <lb/>
            desert in consequence of the wars which raged so furiously. <lb/>
            It was in the plain between the two places that the princes <lb/>
            suddenly met, and the combatants shouted their war-cries, and <lb/>
            the clash of arms was heard, and noble barons bit the dust. <note type="footnote"> There was a fief called du Bos, or du Bosc, in the commune of Baude­ <lb/>

            a wood,1 but he lighted by chance on a peasant to whom his <lb/>
            person was unknown. The king earnestly entreated him, <lb/>
            adding many promises to which he pledged himself on his <lb/>
            oath, to show him the nearest road to Andeli, or to be his <lb/>
            guide to the town, for a great reward. Sure of being well <lb/>
            recompensed, the peasant consented to conduct the trembling <lb/>
            prince, who feared as much meeting some traveller who <lb/>
            might betray him, as being overtaken by the pursuing <lb/>
            enemy, who would make him prisoner. At last the peasant, <lb/>
            seeing the royal guard respectfully coming from Andeli to <lb/>
            meet the prince, making light of the reward he obtained, was <lb/>
            much grieved at finding what a vast recompense he had lost <lb/>
            from his ignorance of the rank of the person he saved.</p>
          <p>King Henry purchased the standard of King Lewis from <lb/>
            the soldier who took it for twenty silver marks,2 and kept it <lb/>
            as a memorial of the victory Heaven had granted him. The <lb/>
            next day he sent back Lewis's charger, with the saddle and <lb/>
            bridle and all the equipments, as became a king. William <lb/>
            the Etheling also returned his palfrey to William C1ito his <lb/>
            cousin, and at the instance of his prudent father added <lb/>
            other presents serviceable to an exile. The king dispersed <lb/>
            his prisoners, sending them for custody to different castles; <lb/>
            Burchard, Hervey de Gisors,3 and some others who were <lb/>
            vassals of both kings, he did not reserve for ransom, but <lb/>
            liberated at once. The illustrious Guy of Chaumont fell sick <lb/>
            at Rouen, where he died, to the king's grief who had kept <lb/>
            the gallant warrior in prison. Osmond, the wicked old <lb/>
            knight, was conducted to Arques,' and, bound in chains and <lb/>
            fetters as he deserved, was closely confined till peace was <lb/>
            restored between the sovereigns. His infamy in protecting <lb/>

            our reputation and power. Let the bishops and counts <lb/>
            and other lords of the realm be rallied round you, and the <lb/>
            priests with the whole body of their parishioners march <lb/>

            and from thence an attack may be made on Breteuil, which <lb/>
            is in the heart of Normandy. If we can reduce that fortress, <lb/>
            we will restore Eustace, who was disinherited for having <lb/>
            espoused our cause ; and my nephew, Ralph de Conches, will <lb/>
            be on our side with all his vassals and fortresses. He is in <lb/>
            possession of the strong castles of Conches, Toëni, Portes,3 <lb/>
            and Acquigni, and well-tried barons bold under him, who <lb/>
            alone will greatly augment our force. Ralph is now shut <lb/>
            up in Breteuil, and does not at present render us any <lb/>
            assistance, because he is afraid that by so doing he may <lb/>
            expose his territories to devastation." Encouraged by this <lb/>
            discourse the king resolved to act according to the advice <lb/>
            given him by the lord of whom we are speaking. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, he despatched messengers in all haste to convey his <lb/>

            commands, and issued sentences of excommunication against <lb/>
            all the priests in their dioceses, and their parishioners, who <lb/>
            should not hasten to join the king's expedition on the day <lb/>

            began to pillage all that they could lay hands on in their <lb/>

            road, and treated the monks and clergy, who were their own <lb/>
            countrymen, as if they had been enemies. The royal autho­ <lb/>
            rity was of no avail in executing justice on these marauders ; <lb/>
            episcopal censure was benumbed, and every one did what <lb/>

            of Noyon, Laon, and several others, were present at this <lb/>

            they permitted their people to commit every sort of outrage. <lb/>
            They even allowed consecrated places to be violated, under <lb/>
            the colour of their divine authority, that this licence might <lb/>
            increase the number of their followers, and that by winking <lb/>

            possessions the other banished lords who were adherents of <lb/>
            William the exile. Ralph the Breton4 with his troops boldly <lb/>
            opposed the march of the enemy, engaging them with vigour, <lb/>

            and loss. By God's just judgment, the priests returned inglo­ <lb/>
            rious, and overwhelmed with fears, losses, sorrow, and confu­ <lb/>
            sion, because they had suffered the consecrated places, which <lb/>
            they ought to have protected by ecclesiastical censures, to <lb/>
            be defiled and indecently violated by greedy robbers.</p>
          <p>Then William de Chaumont, the king's son-in-law,1 and <lb/>
            several aspiring youths, irritated at having gained nothing <lb/>
            at Breteuil, made an incursion, to the number of two hun­ <lb/>
            dred, towards the castle of Tillières, to obtain for them­ <lb/>
            selves either profit or glory. However Gilbert, the castellan <lb/>
            of Tillières,2 lay in ambush with his people in a place of <lb/>
            concealment, watching all the roads that his farms might not <lb/>
            be pillaged by these freebooters. When the French came <lb/>
            up he suddently burst upon them from his ambuscade, and <lb/>
            made William, the king's son-in-law, his prisoner; for whose <lb/>
            ransom he received two hundred silver marks. He also <lb/>
            took some of his comrades, and put the rest shamefully to <lb/>
            flight.</p>
          <p>France was in great distress when she found the pride of <lb/>
            her sons humbled, and reckoned her losses, the shame of <lb/>
            future generations, recently sustained in Normandy. King <lb/>
            Henry, however, the lover of peace, was crowned with glory, <lb/>
            God having graciously listened to the prayers of the church on <lb/>
            his behalf, and given him repeated victories over his enemies. <lb/>
            Restored prosperity favoured him with her smiles, while she <lb/>
            struck the cruel robbers with alarm, and caused the public <lb/>
            enemies bitter repentance for their fruitless revolt. <note type="footnote"> I This royal alliance of William de Chaumont, which was long consi­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XX. A freebooter's reverence for a way-side cross—King Henry restores order in the district of Ouche.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>RICHER DE LAIGLE carried off Odo from Cisai,' with all the <lb/>
            booty he found there, on the fifteenth of the calends of Octo­ <lb/>
            ber [17th September], the day on which the king appeared <lb/>
            before Breteuil with so many thousands troops, and reaped <lb/>
            nothing but dishonour and wounds. That young soldier <lb/>
            performed an action in this expedition which is worthy of <lb/>
            being handed down to future ages. While the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Gacé and the neighbouring villages were in pursuit of <lb/>
            the robbers, considering by what means they might regain <lb/>
            their cattle, either by force or ransom, the bold troopers, <lb/>
            facing about, charged them, and soon putting them to the <lb/>
            rout, pursued them in turn. The peasants having no <lb/>
            means of defending themselves against an armed band, nor <lb/>
            any strong place in which they could take refuge, and <lb/>
            seeing a wooden cross by the side of the road, all prostrated <lb/>
            themselves together before it. Richer, perceiving this, <lb/>
            struck with the fear of God, and touched with tender love <lb/>
            for his Saviour, piously reverenced his cross. He therefore <lb/>
            commanded his party to permit these trembling creatures <lb/>
            to remain safe; while, in order that they might suffer no <lb/>
            injury, his own troops continued their march. Thus, from <lb/>
            fear of his Creator, the noble youth spared nearly a hundred <lb/>
            peasants, from whom he might have exacted a considerable <lb/>
            ransom if he had recklessly ventured to seize them. The <lb/>
            same week he was reconciled with the king, through the <lb/>
            mediation of his uncle Rotrou,2 and recovered all his father's <lb/>
            lands both in England and Normandy.</p>
          <p>Then the king, at the head of his troops, visited the district <lb/>
            of Ouche, and marched against his enemies who held Glos <lb/>
            and Lire. At that time Roger, son of William, who was son <lb/>
            of Barnon,3 commanded at Glos, and Arnold du Bois4 was <note type="footnote"> 1 Cisai, near Gacé, mentioned in a preceding note. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Rotrou II. count de Perche. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Respecting William de Glos, son of Barnon, see vol. ii. p. 516 ; where <lb/>

            castellan of Lire. These men, perceiving that the king's <lb/>
            power crushed all who resisted him, and that every hope of <lb/>
            success from Eustace and Amauri failed, conferred with <lb/>
            Ralph,1 who was their neighbour, and, having obtained <lb/>
            favourable terms from the king through his intervention, <lb/>
            surrendered the castles they had so long faithfully guarded. <lb/>
            The king restored them to Ralph de Guader, and the <lb/>
            country about Ouche being thus restored to tranquillity, he <lb/>
            returned to Rouen where he offered thanks to God.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Ralph de Guader, who had his suspicions of <lb/>
            Ralph de Conches, and could not visit his own domains on <lb/>
            the other side of the Seine without crossing Guader's <lb/>
            territories, granted him Pont-St.-Pierre and the valley of <lb/>
            Pitres,2 under fealty to himself, and an engagement to <lb/>
            defend the state against the public enemy with all his forces. <lb/>
            The king also gave the rents of Glos to Ralph-tbe-Red, <lb/>
            having found his services useful on many occasions, and cal­ <lb/>
            culating that he might rely on them in time to come. <note type="footnote"> generations of this family are included among the benefactors to the colle­ <lb/>
