          <p>A TRANSLATION of the Dialogues Be Oratore was published <lb/>
            in 1762, by George Barnes, a Barrister of the Inner Temple. <lb/>
            Mr. Barnes's version was made with great care, and, though <lb/>
            less known than Guthrie's, was far superior to it. If he <lb/>
            occasionally mistock the sense of his author, he seems to <lb/>
            have been always diligent in seeking for it. He added some <lb/>
            notes, of which those deemed worth preserving are distin- <lb/>
            guished by the letter B.</p>
          <p>Barnes's translation is the groundwork of the present; <lb/>
            but every page of it has been carefully corrected, and many <lb/>
            pages re-written. The text to which it is made conformable <lb/>
            is that of Orellius, which differs but little from Ellendt's, the <lb/>
            more recent editor and illustrator of the work, from whom <lb/>
            some notes have been borrowed.</p>
          <p>No labour has been spared to produce a faithful and <lb/>
            readable translation cf a treatise which must always be <lb/>
            interesting to the orator and the student.</p>
          <p>The translation of Cicero's “ Brutus; or, Remarks on <lb/>
            Eminent Orators," is by E. Jones, (first published in 1776,) <lb/>
            which has long had the well-deserved reputation of com- <lb/>
            bining fidelity with elegance. It is therefore reprinted with <lb/>
            but little variation. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS Letter was written in the year 694 A.U.C., in the consulship of <lb/>
            Afranius and Metellus, by Cicero to his brother Quintus, who <lb/>
            was commanding in Asia, to inform him that his period of command <lb/>
            was extended for a third year; a year fraught with such im. <lb/>
            portant events to the republic, that we learn from Horace that <lb/>
            Pollio began his history of the civil wars from this date.1 The <lb/>
            consuls themselves were men of no very great importance; they <lb/>
            were both creatures of Pompey, who had assisted them to obtain <lb/>
            the office by the most open corruption: but he was mistaken in <lb/>
            reckoning on the adherence of Metellus, whom he had offended by <lb/>
            divorcing his sister Mucia; while Afranius was a man of no character, <lb/>
            and of very moderate abilities; so weak, according to Cicero, as <lb/>
            to be ignorant of the value of the consulship which he had bought.2 <lb/>
            With such men for its rulers, the city speedily became a scene of <lb/>
            universal dissension. Pompey, who had just celebrated his triumph <lb/>
            over Mithridates with unprecedented magnificence, was instigating <lb/>
            Flavius, one of the tribunes, to bring forward an agrarian law similar <lb/>
            to that of Rullus, for a division of lands in Italy,-partly consisting <lb/>
            of some of the public domains, and partly of estates to be bought <note type="footnote"> 1 Motum ex Metello consule civicum <lb/>

            with the spoils of the war in which he had been so victorious,-among <lb/>
            the veterans of his army, and the poorer classes in Italy. The <lb/>
            senate opposed this measure violently, but Cicero, though he had <lb/>
            resisted the former proposition, was now inclined to support <lb/>
            this,—taking care, indeed, to preserve the vested interests of the <lb/>
            possessors; and thinking that when this was provided for, the bill <lb/>
            would supply a means for relieving the city of some of its most <lb/>
            dangerous inhabitants, and at the same time peopling parts of Italy <lb/>
            which were hitherto little better than a desert.' No doubt he was <lb/>
            partly influenced by his desire to obtain the protection of Pompey in <lb/>
            the struggle which he foresaw for himself with Clodius, who was now <lb/>
            seeking to be adopted into a plebeian family, in order to be elected <lb/>
            a tribune of the people, so as to attack Cicero with greater power of <lb/>
            injuring him—for the great Catulus died at this time, and Cicero <lb/>
            complains to Atticus, that his death had left him without an ally <lb/>
            in the dangers which threatened him, and without a companion in <lb/>
            his course of defending and upholding the interests of the nobles.2</p>
          <p>About the beginning of this year also, news arrived from Gaul of com- <lb/>
            motions in that province, which was always in great danger from the <lb/>
            frequent inroads of the Helvetii, from whom an invasion on a larger <lb/>
            scale was now apprehended. The senate decreed that the consuls <lb/>
            should undertake the defence of the Cisalpine and Transalpine pro. <lb/>
            vinces, and sent men of consular rank to different districts to levy <lb/>
            armies; but Pompey and Cicero remained at Rome, being, as he tells <lb/>
            Atticus, retained by the express command of the senate, as pledges <lb/>
            of the safety of the republic.3</p>
          <p>In the meantime Caesar, who had been serving in Spain as proprætor, <lb/>
            wrote letters to the senate to demand a triumph; but wishing also to <lb/>
            obtain the consulship for the succeeding year, he relinquished the idea <lb/>
            of the triumph, (which would have prevented him from entering the <lb/>
            city till after its celebration,) in order to canvass the citizens for <lb/>
            the more substantial honour. Perceiving, on his arrival in Rome, <lb/>
            the true posture of affairs,—the power which Crass.us possessed, de- <lb/>
            rived from his character and riches; the authority with which <lb/>
            his military renown, and his position as the acknowledged leader <lb/>
            of the aristocratic party, invested Pompey; and his own need <lb/>
            of such coadjutors for the project, which he had already begun to <lb/>
            conceive, of finally making himself master of the republic,—he re- <lb/>
            conciled Pompey and Crassus, who had previously been on no very <lb/>
            friendly terms; and then formed that intimate connexion with them <lb/>
            both, which is known in history as the first triumvirate; the three <lb/>
            chiefs coming to an agreement to prevent measures of any kind <lb/>
            being adopted in the republic without the united consent of them <lb/>
            all. Caesar obtained the consulship, but the senate gave him Bibulus <lb/>
            for his colleague, and made a further attempt to prevent any great <lb/>
            increase to his power or popularity, by assigning to the new consuls <note type="footnote"> 1 Quâ constitute diligenter et sentinam nobis exhaurior ; et Italiæ <lb/>

            only the supervision of the roads and forests : a charge, as Suetonius <lb/>
            calls it, of the slightest possible importance.</p>
          <p>This was the posture of affairs at Rome, at, and soon after, the time <lb/>
            when Cicero addressed this first letter to his brother.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Marcus to his brother Quintus, greeting.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. 1. ALTHOUGH I had no doubt that many messengers, and <lb/>
            common report too, with its invariable rapidity, -would out- <lb/>
            strip this letter; and that, before its arrival, you would hear <lb/>
            from others that a third year has been added to the period <lb/>
            during which I have to regret your absence, and you are to <lb/>
            continue your labours; still I thought that direct informa- <lb/>
            tion of this trouble ought to be conveyed to you from me <lb/>
            also. For in my former letters,-and that not once only, but <lb/>
            repeatedly, even after the matter was despaired of by others, <lb/>
            —I still gave you hope of an early removal; not merely that I <lb/>
            might gratify you as long as possible with the pleasing expec- <lb/>
            tation, but also because such great exertions were made both <lb/>
            by the prætors and by myself, that I would not give up all <lb/>
            hope that the matter might be managed.</p>
          <p>2. But now, since it has so turned out, that the prætors <lb/>
            have not been able to do any good by their influence, nor <lb/>
            I by my own zeal, it is extremely difficult to avoid feeling <lb/>
            great vexation; but still it is not fit that our spirits, which <lb/>
            have been tried in managing and supporting matters of the <lb/>
            greatest moment, should be crushed and rendered powerless <lb/>
            by a petty annoyance. And since men are' naturally most <lb/>
            concerned at misfortunes which have been. incurred by their <lb/>
            own fault, there is something in this business that must be <lb/>
            borne with more vexation by me than by you. For it hap- <lb/>
            pened through my fault, and through acting in opposition to <lb/>
            what you had represented to me, both when setting out and <lb/>
            afterwards by letter, that a successor was not appointed the <lb/>
            year before. In that matter, while I was consulting the <lb/>
            safety of the allies, while I was resisting the impudence of <lb/>
            some commercial people, and while I was desirous that my <lb/>
            reputation should be advanced by your merit, I acted <lb/>
            unwisely; especially as I have given occasion that that second <lb/>
            year of your command may draw on a third after it..</p>
          <p>3. Since, then, I confess that the fault is mine, it will be the <lb/>
            task of your wisdom and- kindness to take care and manage <lb/>
            that this matter, too incautiously considered by me, may be <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            corrected by your own diligence. And if you arouse yourself <lb/>
            with fresh energy to cultivate a good reputation in every <lb/>
            respect, so as to rival, not others, but yourself; if you direct <lb/>
            all the faculties of your mind, all your care and thoughts, to <lb/>
            the pre-eminent object of obtaining praise in all things,-take <lb/>
            my word for it, that one year added to your labour will bring <lb/>
            happiness for many years to us, and glory to our posterity.</p>
          <p>4. I therefore entreat you above all things not to diminish <lb/>
            or lower your spirit, nor to allow yourself to be overwhelmed <lb/>
            by the magnitude of the affair, as by a wave of the sea; but, <lb/>
            on the other hand, to bear yourself erect to resist, and even <lb/>
            of your own accord to meet difficulties. For you do not <lb/>
            manage a department of the public of such a nature that for- <lb/>
            tune has the rule in it, but one in which method and dili- <lb/>
            gence have the greatest influence. If indeed I saw that your <lb/>
            period of command was prolonged while you were engaged <lb/>
            in any great and perilous war, I should feel misgivings in <lb/>
            my mind, because I should know at the same time that the <lb/>
            power of fortune over us was also prolonged.</p>
          <p>5. But at present, that part of the commonwealth is com- <lb/>
            mitted to you, in which fortune has no share, or only an ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly insignificant one, and which appears to me to <lb/>
            depend wholly on your own virtue and moderation of dispo- <lb/>
            sition. We apprehend, I think, no insidious attacks of <lb/>
            enemies, no struggle in the field, no revolt of our allies, no <lb/>
            want of pay or provisions, no mutiny in the army; accidents <lb/>
            which have very often happened to men of the greatest pru- <lb/>
            dence: so that, as the most skilful pilots cannot overcome the <lb/>
            violence of a storm, they in like manner have been unable to <lb/>
            subdue the violent hostility of fortune. To your lot has <lb/>
            fallen the most complete peace, the most entire tranquillity, <lb/>
            though in such a way that it may even 1 overwhelm a sleeping <lb/>
            pilot, or even delight a wakeful one.</p>
          <p>6. For that province of yours consists in the first place of <lb/>
            that class of allies which is the most civilized of all the human <lb/>
            race; and secondly, of that class of citizens who either, be- <lb/>
            cause they are farmers of the revenue,2 are bound to us by <note type="footnote">1 Vel. Emesti condemns this word, and Matthiæ has ejected it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The farmers of the public revenue were generally of the equestrian <lb/>
            order, to which Cicero himself belonged; and in his public character <lb/>
            and speeches he had always taken care to maintain the connexion, by <lb/>
            seizing every opportunity of extolling and defending them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            ties of the closest connexion, or who, because they manage <lb/>
            their dealings so as to become wealthy, think that they pos- <lb/>
            sess their fortunes in safety through the beneficial effects of <lb/>
            my consulship.</p>
          <p>II. 7. But, you will urge, between these very men them- <lb/>
            selves there are grave disputes: many injuries arise, and great <lb/>
            contests follow; as if I supposed that you also do not sustain <lb/>
            a considerable weight of business. I am aware that your <lb/>
            affairs are of very great importance, and require consummate <lb/>
            prudence; but remember that I consider this affair depends <lb/>
            more upon prudence than upon fortune; for what difficulty <lb/>
            is there in restraining those over whom you have authority, <lb/>
            if you also restrain yourself? This may be a great and <lb/>
            arduous task for others, as it is indeed most arduous, but <lb/>
            it has always been a very easy one for you; and in truth sc <lb/>
            it ought to be, since your natural disposition is such that, <lb/>
            even without instruction, it would appear that it might have <lb/>
            been excellently regulated, and such an education has been <lb/>
            bestowed upon it as might exalt even the most vicious natura. <lb/>
            While you yourself resist the temptations of money and of, <lb/>
            pleasure, and of every sort of desire, as you do resist them, <lb/>
            there will be, I suppose, danger lest you may not be able to <lb/>
            check the worthless trader, or the somewhat too covetous <lb/>
            farmer. The Greeks,1 indeed, will look upon you, while you <lb/>
            live in such a manner, as some [hero revived] from the old <lb/>
            traditions of their annals, or even as some divine being <lb/>
            descended from heaven into the province.</p>
          <p>8. And I write this now, not that you may act thus, [for <lb/>
            that you do,] but that you may rejoice in acting and having <lb/>
            acted thus. For it is a glorious thing for you to have lived <lb/>
            three2 years in Asia, invested with the highest military; au- <lb/>
            thority, in such a manner that no statue, no picture, no vase,3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero calls them Greeks, because all the coast of Asia Minor was <lb/>
            colonized by Greeks, and the language had gradually come to prevail <lb/>
            throughout the whole peninsula. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The text has triennium; Ernesti and others would read biennium, <lb/>

            of his province gave him pre-eminent opportunities for displaying it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            no present of robes or slaves, no allurement of personal <lb/>
            beauty, no opportunity of extorting money, (of all which <lb/>
            forms of corruption that province is most prolific,) has been <lb/>
            able to turn you aside from perfect integrity and moderation.</p>
          <p>9. And what can be found so admirable, or so thoroughly <lb/>
            desirable, as that that virtue, that moderation of mind, that <lb/>
            well-regulated abstinence, should not lie hid and be buried <lb/>
            in darkness, but should be displayed in the light of Asia, <lb/>
            and before the eyes of a most splendid province, and cele- <lb/>
            brated in the hearing of every nation and people on the earth ? <lb/>
            That men should not be alarmed at your progresses, or <lb/>
            exhausted by your expenses, or agitated at your arrival <lb/>
            among them; but that, wherever you come, there should <lb/>
            be both publicly and privately the greatest possible joy, while <lb/>
            every city looks upon itself as entertaining a protector, not <lb/>
            a tyrant, and every family feels that it receives a guest, and <lb/>
            not a plunderer ?</p>
          <p>III. 10. But in all these matters experience itself has <lb/>
            already, doubtless, taught you, that it is by no means enough <lb/>
            for you to have these virtues yourself, but that you must also <lb/>
            take diligent care, in this guardianship of the province, that <lb/>
            you may appear to be answerable, not for yourself only, but <lb/>
            for all the officers under your government, to the allies, to <lb/>
            your fellow-citizens, and to the commonwealth. Although <lb/>
            indeed you have lieutenants of such a character that they <lb/>
            will of themselves have regard to their own dignity; among <lb/>
            whom Tubero is the first in honour and dignity and age,-a <lb/>
            man who, I imagine, especially as he is a writer of history, can <lb/>
            find many in the annals of his own family whom he may be <lb/>
            both inclined and able to imitate; and Alienus is completely <lb/>
            one of us, not only in his general disposition and benevolence, <lb/>
            but also in his imitation of our habits of life. For why need <lb/>
            I speak of Gratidius? a man whom I know for certain to be <lb/>
            so anxious about his own character, that out of his brotherly <lb/>
            love for us, he is anxious also about ours.</p>
          <p>11. You have a quæstor, indeed, not chosen by your own <lb/>
            judgment, but the one whom the lot assigned you. It is <lb/>
            necessary that he should be moderate in his own inclinations, <lb/>
            and obedient to your regulations and precepts. If by chance <lb/>
            any one of these men be somewhat sordid, you may bear with <lb/>
            him so far as he merely neglects, of himself, those rules by <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            which you yourself are bound; but not so far that be should <lb/>
            abuse, for his own private gain, that power which you con- <lb/>
            ceded to him for the support of his dignity: for I am not <lb/>
            indeed of opinion, especially as the habits to which I allude <lb/>
            have had such a tendency to excessive lenity and to a courting <lb/>
            of popularity, that you should look too closely into every bit <lb/>
            of meanness, and get rid of every one guilty of it; but I <lb/>
            think that you should trust just so much to each as there is <lb/>
            trustworthiness in each. And of these men, those whom the <lb/>
            republic itself has assigned to you as supporters and assistants <lb/>
            in the discharge of the public business, you will confine to <lb/>
            those limits which I have already laid down.</p>
          <p>IV. 12. But as to those whom you have selected to have <lb/>
            about you as your domestic companions, or your necessary <lb/>
            attendants, and who are generally termed a sort of court of <lb/>
            the *prætor, not only their actions, but even their whole <lb/>
            language, must be answered for by us. But you have such <lb/>
            people about you as you can easily love if they act rightly, <lb/>
            and with the greatest ease restrain, if they show too little <lb/>
            regard for your character; by whom, when you were inex- <lb/>
            perienced, your own ingenuous disposition seems likely to have <lb/>
            been deceived; for the more virtuous any one is himself, the <lb/>
            more unwillingly does he suspect others of being wicked; but <lb/>
            now this third year of office should display the same integrity <lb/>
            as those preceding, with even more caution and diligence.</p>
          <p>13. Let your ears be such as are thought to hear openly <lb/>
            what they do hear, and not such as those into which anything <lb/>
            may be whispered falsely and hypocritically for the sake of <lb/>
            gain. Let your signet ring be not like a piece of furniture, <lb/>
            but as it were another self; not the agent of another person's <lb/>
            will, but the witness of your own. Let your sergeant1 be <lb/>
            kept in that station in which our ancestors wished him to be; <lb/>
            who bestowed the place not as a lucrative appointment, but as <lb/>
            one of labour and duty, and not readily to any but their own <lb/>
            freedmen, to whom they gave their orders, indeed, in a man- <lb/>
            ner not very different from that in which they gave them to <note type="footnote"> 1 The Latin is accensus, which was the name of a public officer <lb/>
            attending on several of the Roman magistrates. He anciently preceded <lb/>
            the consul who had not the fasces; a custom which, having been <lb/>
            long disused, was restored by Cæsar the very next year. ValTo de- <lb/>
            rives this title from acciO, because they summoned the people to the <lb/>
            assemblies. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            their slaves. Let your lictor be the officer, not of his own <lb/>
            lenity, but of yours; and let your fasces and axes give him <lb/>
            greater insignia of dignity than power. Lastly, let it be <lb/>
            known to the whole province, that the safety, the families, <lb/>
            the fame, and the fortunes of all those over whom you <lb/>
            act as governor, are objects of the dearest interest to you. <lb/>
            Moreover, let the opinion prevail, that you will be dis- <lb/>
            pleased, not only with those who have accepted any bribe, <lb/>
            but with those also who have given one, if you discover the <lb/>
            fact. Nor indeed will any one offer a bribe, when it is once <lb/>
            clearly ascertained, that nothing is ever obtained from you <lb/>
            by the influence of those who pretend to have great weight <lb/>
            with you.</p>
          <p>14. Not, indeed, that this advice of mine to you is meant <lb/>
            to have such an effect as to make you too harsh or suspicious <lb/>
            towards your officers; for if there be among them any one <lb/>
            who during two years has never fallen under any-suspicion of <lb/>
            avarice, (as I hear that both Cæsius and Chærippus and <lb/>
            Labeo have not. and because I know them, I believe it;) there <lb/>
            is nothing that I should not think might be most judiciously <lb/>
            and properly committed to them, and to whoever else is of the <lb/>
            same character; but if there be any one in whom you have <lb/>
            detected anything, or in whom you have noticed anything <lb/>
            unfavourable, trust him with nothing; do not put any part of <lb/>
            your own character in his power.</p>
          <p>V. 15. But in the province itself, if you have met with <lb/>
            any one who has entered closely into friendship with you, <lb/>
            and who was previously unknown to us, take great care <lb/>
            how far you ought to trust such a one; not but that there <lb/>
            maybe many honest men among the provincials; but though <lb/>
            we may entertain this hope, it is hazardous to judge that it is <lb/>
            so; for the natural character of each individual is concealed <lb/>
            under numerous wrappings of disguise, and shrouded, as it <lb/>
            were, under veils; the forehead, the eyes, the whole counte- <lb/>
            nance are often false, and the language most frequently of all. <lb/>
            On which account, how are you to find out, among that <lb/>
            class of men, persons who, influenced by desire for money, <lb/>
            can yet do without all those things from which we cannot <lb/>
            separate ourselves, and who will love you, a foreigner, with <lb/>
            all their heart, and not pretend to do so merely for their own <lb/>
            advantage ? To me indeed this seems a consideration of <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            great importance, especially if those very same people scarcely <lb/>
            ever profess a regard for any private individual, but do so <lb/>
            at all times for every governor; therefore, if of this class you <lb/>
            have by chance met with any one really more attached to <lb/>
            yourself than to the opportunity, (for this may have been <lb/>
            possible,) gladly count that man in the list of your friends; <lb/>
            but if you do not discover such a disposition, there is no <lb/>
            sort of men more carefully to be guarded against in respect to <lb/>
            intimacy; because they are acquainted with every avenue <lb/>
            of corruption, and do everything for the sake of money, and <lb/>
            have no notion of regard for the character of a man with <lb/>
            whom they are not going to live permanently.</p>
          <p>16. And even among the Greeks themselves, intimacies <lb/>
            must be formed with strict care, excepting [those with] a <lb/>
            very few men, such as may be worthy of ancient Greece; so <lb/>
            deceitful, indeed, are the greater number of them, and fickle, <lb/>
            and through long slavery inured to excessive flattery; the <lb/>
            whole body of whom I admit ought to be treated with libe- <lb/>
            rality, and all the most deserving of them admitted to hos- <lb/>
            pitality and friendship; but an excessive intimacy with them <lb/>
            is not sufficiently to be trusted, for they do not dare to oppose <lb/>
            our inclinations, and are envious, not only of our people, but <lb/>
            also of their own countrymen.</p>
          <p>VI. 17. If I then desire to be so cautious and diligent in <lb/>
            matters of that sort, in which I am afraid lest I may appear <lb/>
            even somewhat over-rigid; of what opinion do you conceive <lb/>
            me to be with respect to slaves? whom indeed we ought to <lb/>
            rule strictly everywhere, and most especially in the provinces. <lb/>
            With respect to this class of persons, many rules may be <lb/>
            given, but this is the shortest of all, and one which may the <lb/>
            most easily be kept in memory, that they are to behave <lb/>
            themselves in your Asiatic progresses, as they would if you <lb/>
            were travelling along the Appian road,1 and that they are not <lb/>
            to think that it makes any difference whether they arrive at <lb/>
            Tralles or at Formiæ. But if among your slaves there should <lb/>
            be any one of exemplary fidelity, let him be employed in your <lb/>
            domestic and private affairs; but as to matters which relate <lb/>
            to the duties of your command, or to any of the affairs of the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Via Appia, or Appian road, was made by Appius Claudius <lb/>
            Cæcus as censor, about 442 A.U.C., from Rome to Capua. At a later <lb/>
            period it was continued from Capua to Brundusium. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            commonwealth, let him have no concern with any of them: <lb/>
            for there are many things which may without impropriety be <lb/>
            entrusted to faithful slaves, but which, for the sake of avoid- <lb/>
            ing talk and censure, must not be entrusted to them.</p>
          <p>18. But this letter of mine, I know not how, has run into <lb/>
            a- process of laying down precepts, though such was not at <lb/>
            first my intention. For why should I give precepts to one, <lb/>
            whom, particularly in business of this kind, I know to be not <lb/>
            at all inferior in prudence to myself, and in practice even <lb/>
            superior? But still if my authority were added to enforce <lb/>
            the line of conduct which you were already pursuing, I <lb/>
            thought that such line of conduct would be more agreeable <lb/>
            to you. Let these then be your foundations for dignity of <lb/>
            character; first of all, your own personal integrity and mode- <lb/>
            ration; next, self-respect in all those who are about you; <lb/>
            and, also, an extremely cautious and most diligent selection <lb/>
            in forming intimacies, both with men of the province, and <lb/>
            with Greeks; and the maintenance of a steady and consistent <lb/>
            discipline in your household.</p>
          <p>19. As these observances are honourable in our private <lb/>
            and daily habits, they must of necessity appear almost divine <lb/>
            in so high a command, amid manners so depraved, and in <lb/>
            a province which is such a school of corruption. Such a <lb/>
            system and such a discipline can maintain that severity in <lb/>
            deciding and determining on measures, which you have dis- <lb/>
            played in things from which, to my great joy, .we experience <lb/>
            some enmity; unless perchance you fancy that I am moved <lb/>
            by the complaints of I know not what fellow called Paconius, <lb/>
            a person who is not even a Greek, but rather a Mysian or <lb/>
            Phrygian, or by those of Tuscenius, a raving, fellow, foul in. <lb/>
            his language, out of whose most impure jaws you wrested the <lb/>
            prey of his most disgraceful covetousness with consummate <lb/>
            justice.</p>
          <p>VII. 20. These and other regulations, full of strictness, <lb/>
            which you have appointed in that province, we could not <lb/>
            easily maintain without the most complete integrity. Let <lb/>
            there be the most rigorous severity, therefore, in administer- <lb/>
            ing the law, provided that it be never varied from favour, <lb/>
            but observed with uniformity. But still it is of little benefit <lb/>
            that the law be administered with uniformity and care by <lb/>
            you yourself, unless the same rule of conduct be also observed <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            oy those to whom you entrust any share of the same duty. <lb/>
            And to me, indeed, there appears to be no great variety of <lb/>
            ousiness in the government of Asia, but it seems to be all <lb/>
            supported, for the most part, by the exposition of the law; <lb/>
            in which, above all other things, the very system of knowledge <lb/>
            for the regulation of a province lies. But consistency must <lb/>
            be observed, and a dignified gravity, which can resist, not - <lb/>
            only all influence, but even suspicion.</p>
          <p>21. There is to be added likewise affability in listening to <lb/>
            others, gentleness in pronouncing one's decisions, and diligence <lb/>
            in satisfying people, and in discussing their claims. It was by <lb/>
            such qualifications that Cneius Octavius lately became very <lb/>
            popular, as it was under him that the lictor first had nothing <lb/>
            to do, the sergeant was reduced to silence, and every one who <lb/>
            had a suit before him spoke as often and as long as he <lb/>
            pleased. In which particulars he might perchance be looked <lb/>
            upon as too remiss, if this very remissness had not been the <lb/>
            support of that severity. Sylla's men were compelled to make <lb/>
            restitution of the things which they had taken. away by <lb/>
            violence, and through the influence of fear; and those who <lb/>
            in their offices had given unjust decisions, had, when reduced <lb/>
            to the rank of private individuals, to bow beneath similar <lb/>
            law. This severity of his might appear to have been in- <lb/>
            tolerable, had it not been softened by many seasonings of <lb/>
            humanity.</p>
          <p>22. But if this kind of lenity is agreeable at Rome, where <lb/>
            there is such excessive arrogance, such immoderate liberty, <lb/>
            such boundless liceutiousness among men; and besides such <lb/>
            a number of magistrates, so many sources of help, such great <lb/>
            power, such absolute authority belonging to the senate; how <lb/>
            attractive surely may the courtesy of a prætor be in Asia, in <lb/>
            which such a multitude of citizens, such a number of allies, <lb/>
            so many cities, and so many states, look to the nod of one <lb/>
            man; where there is no help, no power of making complaints, <lb/>
            no senate, no assembly of the people! It is therefore the <lb/>
            part of a very great man, and of one who is both moderate <lb/>
            by natural disposition, and who has also been trained by <lb/>
            education, and by the study of the most excellent accomplish- <lb/>
            ments, to conduct himself, when invested with so great <lb/>
            power, in such a manner that no other authority may be <lb/>
            wished for by those over whom he is appointed governor.</p><pb n="12"/>
            
          <p>VIII. 23. The "Cyrus" of Xenophon is written not in <lb/>
            accordance with the truth of history, but to exhibit a represen- <lb/>
            tation of a just government; in whose character the greatest <lb/>
            gravity is united by that philosopher with singular courtesy. <lb/>
            These books our own countryman, the illustrious Africanus, <lb/>
            was accustomed, not without reason, scarcely ever to lay out <lb/>
            of his hand, for in them is omitted no duty belonging to <lb/>
            careful and moderate government; and if he, who was never <lb/>
            to become a private individual, paid such attention to those <lb/>
            precepts, how ought they to be observed by those to whom <lb/>
            authority has been given on condition of laying it down <lb/>
            again, and given them too by those laws to the observance of <lb/>
            which they themselves must again return ?</p>
          <p>24. To me, indeed, everything seems necessary to be re- <lb/>
            ferred, by those who rule others, to this principle, that those <lb/>
            who shall be under their government may be as happy as <lb/>
            possible; an object which has been established by unvarying <lb/>
            fame, and the report of all men, as being of primary import- <lb/>
            ance with you, and as having been so from the commence- <lb/>
            ment, since you first arrived in Asia. And it is the duty, <lb/>
            not only of the man who governs allies and fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            but even of him who manages slaves, or dumb animals, to <lb/>
            have a regard to the comforts and advantage of those beings <lb/>
            over whom he presides.</p>
          <p>25. In this respect I find it agreed by all men that the <lb/>
            greatest assiduity is exerted by you; that no new debt is <lb/>
            contracted by any state, and that many cities have been freed <lb/>
            by you from old, great, and heavy debt; that many cities <lb/>
            previously in ruins and almost deserted, among which I may <lb/>
            mention one, the most eminent city of Ionia, another, the <lb/>
            most eminent city of Caria, Samos and Halicarnassus, have <lb/>
            been restored by you; that there are no seditions in the <lb/>
            towns, no discord; that provision is made by you that the <lb/>
            different states shall be regulated by the counsels of the <lb/>
            most respectable citizens; that depredations in Mysia are <lb/>
            stopped; that bloodshed has been suppressed in many places; <lb/>
            that peace is established throughout the whole province; that <lb/>
            not only the thefts and robberies on the roads and in the <lb/>
            fields, but the more numerous and greater ones in the towns <lb/>
            and in the temples, are brought to an end throughout the <lb/>
            country; that that most spiteful minister to the avarice of <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            governors, false accusation, has been repelled in its attacks on <lb/>
            the fame and fortune and ease of the wealthy; that the ex- <lb/>
            penses and tributes levied on the different cities are borne <lb/>
            with equanimity by all who inhabit the territories of those <lb/>
            cities; that access to you is most easy; that your ears are <lb/>
            open to the complaints of all men; that no man's poverty or <lb/>
            desolateness is excluded by you, not merely from access to <lb/>
            you in public and on the tribunal, but even from your house, <lb/>
            and your private chamber; that, in short, throughout your <lb/>
            whole government, there is nothing severe, nothing cruel; <lb/>
            but that everything is full of clemency, and gentleness, and <lb/>
            humanity.</p>
          <p>IX. 26. Again, how great a benefit is it on your part, that <lb/>
            you have delivered Asia from that iniquitous and heavy tax <lb/>
            imposed upon it by the aediles, though at the expense of <lb/>
            great enmity to us. In truth, if one man of noble birth <lb/>
            makes a complaint openly that you, by issuing an edict " that <lb/>
            money should not be voted for the games at Rome," caused <lb/>
            him a loss of two hundred sestertia; how great a sum of <lb/>
            money must have been paid, if, as had become the custom, <lb/>
            it was exacted in the name of all, whoever they were, that <lb/>
            exhibited games at Rome? Although we checked these com- <lb/>
            plaints of our citizens with this design, (which is extolled in <lb/>
            Asia, I know not to what extent, and at Rome with no ordi- <lb/>
            nary admiration,) inasmuch as when the cities had voted sums <lb/>
            of money to erect a temple and monument in our honour, <lb/>
            and when they had done so of their own extreme good-will, <lb/>
            in return for my great services, and for your excessive kind- <lb/>
            nesses, and when the law made an exception in our favour by <lb/>
            name, providing that " it might be permitted to receive money <lb/>
            for a temple and a monument;" and that which was then <lb/>
            given was not likely to perish, but to remain among the <lb/>
            ornaments of the temple, so as to appear to have been given, <lb/>
            not more for my sake than that of the Roman people and the <lb/>
            immortal gods; nevertheless I did not think that even that, in <lb/>
            which concurred merit, a special law, and the good-will of <lb/>
            those who made it, ought to be accepted by me, both for <note type="footnote"> 1 The expense of the games exhibited by the ædiles had grown to be <lb/>
            so enormous that they had established a custom of extorting vast sums <lb/>
            from the provinces to meet it. The exact sum mentioned in the text <lb/>
            would be 161,458l. 6s. 8d. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            other reasons, and in order that others to whom nothing was <lb/>
            due, and in whose favour no permission was given, might bear <lb/>
            the matter with more equanimity.....</p>
          <p>27. Apply yourself, therefore, with all your heart and with <lb/>
            all your zeal to the course of conduct which you have hitherto <lb/>
            pursued, that you may love, and in every way protect, those <lb/>
            whom the senate and people of Rome have committed and <lb/>
            entrusted to your good faith and power, and that you may <lb/>
            take thought for their being as happy as possible. But if <lb/>
            chance1 had set you over Africans, or Spaniards, or Gauls, <lb/>
            savage and barbarous nations, it would still have become your <lb/>
            humanity to consult their advantage, and to show a regard <lb/>
            for their comfort and safety. Since, however, we govern that <lb/>
            race of mankind, among whom not only humanity itself pre- <lb/>
            vails, but from whom it is even thought to have spread to <lb/>
            other nations, we certainly ought, in the greatest possible <lb/>
            degree, to exhibit it to those from whom we received it.</p>
          <p>28. For I shall not now be ashamed to assert this, (espe- <lb/>
            cially amidst such a course of life, and after performing such <lb/>
            actions, on which no suspicion of indolence or levity can affix <lb/>
            itself,) that we have attained those successes which we have <lb/>
            achieved, by the aid of those studies and arts which have <lb/>
            been handed down to us by the records and discipline of <lb/>
            Greece. On those accounts, besides that common good faith <lb/>
            which is due to all mankind, we also appear to be in an <lb/>
            especial manner the debtors of that race of men, so that we <lb/>
            may show a readiness to display in action those principles in <lb/>
            which we have been instructed before that very people from <lb/>
            which we have learned them.</p>
          <p>X. 29. And, indeed, that chief of all genius and learning, <lb/>
            Plato, thought that republics would then at last become happy, <lb/>
            if either learned and wise men began to govern them, or <lb/>
            if those who governed them devoted all their attention to <lb/>
            learning and wisdom. This union of power and wisdom he <lb/>
            assuredly thought would be security to a state; a union <lb/>
            which may have at some time fallen to the lot of our whole <lb/>
            republic, but which has certainly, at this present time, <lb/>
            fallen to that province of yours; so that he might have the <lb/>
            chief power in it, by whom, from his childhood, the most <note type="footnote"> 1 The Latin is sors, lot. The different Roman magistrates had their <lb/>
            provinces assigned to them by lot. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            study and time has been bestowed on acquiring a thorough <lb/>
            understanding of virtue and humanity.</p>
          <p>30. Be careful, therefore, that this year which is added to <lb/>
            your labour may appear at the same time to have been added <lb/>
            for the prosperity of Asia. Since Asia has been more for- <lb/>
            tunate in her efforts to detain you than we have been in ours <lb/>
            to recal you, take care that our regret may be mitigated by <lb/>
            the gladness of the province. For if you have been the most <lb/>
            diligent of all men in deserving that such great honours <lb/>
            should be paid to you as I know not whether any one has <lb/>
            received, you ought to exert far greater diligence in preserving <lb/>
            those honours.</p>
          <p>31. I have, indeed, written to you before what I think of <lb/>
            honours of that kind. I have always thought them, if they <lb/>
            were common, worthless; if they were appointed for some <lb/>
            temporary occasion, trifling; but if, as has been the case <lb/>
            now, they were granted to your merits, I thought that <lb/>
            much exertion should be used by you to preserve them. <lb/>
            Since, therefore, you reside with supreme power and authority <lb/>
            in those cities in which you see your virtues consecrated and <lb/>
            ranked in the number of [those of] the gods, in everything <lb/>
            which you shall determine, or decree, or do, you will recol- <lb/>
            lect what you owe to such high opinions of mankind, such <lb/>
            favourable judgment concerning you, such exalted honours. <lb/>
            This resolution will be of such influence, that you will consult <lb/>
            the welfare of all, will remedy the distresses of the people, <lb/>
            and provide for their safety, and that you will wish to be both <lb/>
            called and thought the father of Asia.</p>
          <p>XI. 32. No doubt the farmers of the public revenue offer <lb/>
            great obstacles to your desires and efforts. But if we oppose <lb/>
            them, we shall separate both from ourselves and from the <lb/>
            republic an order of men which deserves well of ourselves per- <lb/>
            sonally, and which is by our means attached to the republic. <lb/>
            Yet, if we comply with their wishes in everything, we shall be <lb/>
            allowing those persons to be utterly ruined, not only whose <lb/>
            safety, but whose advantage, we are bound to consult. This, <lb/>
            if we would form a correct judgment, is the one difficulty <lb/>
            which pervades your whole government. For to be disin- <lb/>
            terested, to restrain all one's desires, to keep s, check upon <lb/>
            one's people, to maintain an equitable system of law, to show <lb/>
            oneself courteous in inquiring into matters of business, and <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            affable in listening and giving access to people, is honourable <lb/>
            rather than difficult: for it does not depend on any labour, <lb/>
            but rather on a certain inclination and willingness of mind.</p>
          <p>33. How great distress the line of conduct adopted by the <lb/>
            farmers causes the allies, we have learned from those citizens <lb/>
            of our own, who lately, in the matter of the removal of the <lb/>
            harbour-dues of Italy, complained not so much of the tax <lb/>
            itself, as of certain wrongs committed by the tax-collectors. <lb/>
            So that I cannot be ignorant what of happens, to the allies in <lb/>
            remote districts, when I hear the complaints of my own <lb/>
            countrymen in Italy, That you should so conduct yourself, <lb/>
            in such circumstances, as both to satisfy the farmers, (espe- <lb/>
            cially if they made an unlucky contract for the revenues,) and <lb/>
            not to allow the allies to be ruined, appears an achievement <lb/>
            worthy of some divine virtue, that is, of your own.</p>
          <p>And in the first place, that which to the Greeks is a most <lb/>
            bitter consideration, namely, that they are liable to pay taxes, <lb/>
            ought not to appear so bitter; because, without any inter- <lb/>
            ference of the power of the Roman people, while they lived <lb/>
            under their own laws, they were themselves, and of them- <lb/>
            selves, in the same condition; and they have no right to <lb/>
            disdain the name of farmer, as they themselves could not pay <lb/>
            the tax which Sylla had, with perfect fairness, levied upon <lb/>
            them, without a farmer. And that, in exacting the taxes, the <lb/>
            Greek farmers are not more lenient than our own, may be <lb/>
            seen from this fact, that a little while ago the Caunians, and <lb/>
            all the inhabitants of the islands which had been made over <lb/>
            to the Rhodians by Sylla, fled to the senate with entreaties to <lb/>
            be allowed to pay tribute to us rather than to the Rhodians. <lb/>
            Those, therefore, have no right to express any horror of the <lb/>
            name of farmer, who have always been liable to the payment <lb/>
            of taxes; nor ought those who by themselves could not pay <lb/>
            the taxes, to disdain him; nor ought those to object to him, <lb/>
            who have actually asked for his appointment.</p>
          <p>34. Let Asia at the same time recollect, that no calamity <lb/>
            of foreign war, or of domestic dissension, would have been <lb/>
            absent from her, if she were not held under the dominion <lb/>
            of this country. And as that dominion can by no means be <lb/>
            upheld without taxes, let her contentedly purchase for herself <lb/>
            perpetual peace and tranquillity with a certain portion of her <lb/>
            revenues.</p><pb n="17"/>
            
          <p>XII. 35. And, if they will endure that class of men, and <lb/>
            the name of farmer, with patience, other grievances, through <lb/>
            your wisdom and prudence, may possibly appear lighter to <lb/>
            them. They may, in making contracts, regard, not the mere <lb/>
            Censorian law,1 but rather the convenience of transacting <lb/>
            business, and their freedom from trouble. You, too, may do, <lb/>
            what you have already done admirably, and what you still <lb/>
            are doing, namely, to take frequent occasions to mention how <lb/>
            great worth there is in the farmers, and how much we owe to <lb/>
            that order; so that, laying aside authority, and the exertion <lb/>
            of power and of the fasces, you may bind the farmers to the <lb/>
            Greeks by affection and influence. But you may also beg of <lb/>
            those of whom you have deserved extremely well, and who <lb/>
            indeed owe everything to you, to allow us, by good-temper <lb/>
            on their part, to secure and maintain that connexion which <lb/>
            already exists between us and the farmers.</p>
          <p>36. But why do I exhort you to this course of conduct, <lb/>
            which you can not only pursue of your own accord without <lb/>
            directions from any one, but have already to a great extent <lb/>
            practised ? For highly honourable and important companies <lb/>
            do not cease to address their thanks to us, and this is the <lb/>
            more acceptable to me, because the Greeks do the same. <lb/>
            And it is difficult to unite in good-will those things which in <lb/>
            interests, utility, and almost in their very nature, are dif- <lb/>
            ferent from each other. But I have written what is written <lb/>
            above, not for the purpose of instructing you, (for your <lb/>
            wisdom stands in need of no instructions from any one,) but <lb/>
            because, while thus writing, the commemoration of your <lb/>
            virtues was a pleasure to me, although I have been more <lb/>
            prolix in this letter than I either intended or expected to be.</p>
          <p>XIII. 37. There is one thing to which I shall not cease <lb/>
            to exhort you; nor will I allow your praises to be spoken, as <lb/>
            far as shall be. in my power, with any abatement; for all who <lb/>
            come from those regions speak in such a manner of your <lb/>
            virtue, integrity, and humanity, as to make, among your <lb/>
            great praises, proneness to anger the only exception. This <note type="footnote"> 1 The terms on which the revenues of the provinces were let were <lb/>
            fixed by the censors, in the edicts called Leges Censoriœ; but these were <lb/>
            sometimes modified to raise the credit or popularity of the publicans. <lb/>
            In the censorship of Cato, 568 A.U.C., the senate itself interfered to lower <lb/>
            the terms which his rigour had sought to impose.—Liv. xxxix. 44. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            fault, even in our private'and daily life, appears to be that of <lb/>
            an unsteady and weak mind; but nothing is so unseemly as <lb/>
            to unite the acerbity of natural ill-temper to supreme power. <lb/>
            For this reason I will not now proceed to set before you the <lb/>
            observations which are commonly made on passionateness, <lb/>
            both because I am unwilling to be too prolix, and because you <lb/>
            can easily learn them from the writings of many authors; <lb/>
            but that which peculiarly belongs to a letter, I mean that he, <lb/>
            to whom it is written, should be informed of matters of which <lb/>
            he is ignorant, I think that I ought not to omit.</p>
          <p>38. Every one makes us almost the same report, that, when <lb/>
            ill-temper does not affect you, nothing can be more agreeable <lb/>
            than your behaviour; but that, when any one's dishonesty <lb/>
            or perverseness has provoked you, you become so excited that <lb/>
            your natural kindness is missed by every one. Since, there- <lb/>
            fore, it is not so much any thirst for glory as mere circum- <lb/>
            stances and fortune that have brought us into that station of <lb/>
            life in which we are, so that the conversation of mankind <lb/>
            respecting us will be incessant, let us, as far as we can pos- <lb/>
            sibly achieve and succeed, take care that no remarkable vice <lb/>
            may be said to have been in us. Nor do I now insist upon <lb/>
            that which is perhaps difficult in every disposition, and is <lb/>
            certainly so at our time of life, namely, to change the temper, <lb/>
            and suddenly to pluck out whatever is deeply implanted in <lb/>
            the character; but I give you this admonition, that if you <lb/>
            cannot wholly avoid this habit, because your mind is occu- <lb/>
            pied by anger before reason can prevent it from being so <lb/>
            occupied, you should still prepare yourself beforehand, and <lb/>
            meditate every day that you must resist this proneness to <lb/>
            anger, and that, when it has the greatest effect upon your <lb/>
            mind, your tongue must then be most carefully restrained; <lb/>
            for this appears to me at times a virtue not inferior to that <lb/>
            of never being angry. For the latter is the consequence, <lb/>
            not merely of gravity of temper, but sometimes even of <lb/>
            dulness; but to restrain your passion and language when <lb/>
            you are provoked, or even to be silent, and to keep your <lb/>
            agitation of mind and indignation under control, although it <lb/>
            be not a proof of perfect wisdom, is certainly an indication of <lb/>
            no moderate mental power.</p>
          <p>39. In this respect men report that you have already <lb/>
            become much more moderate and gentle. No extremely <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            violent bursts of passion, no reproaches, no insults, are <lb/>
            reported to us; faults which are not only inconsistent with <lb/>
            learning and politeness, but at variance with authority and <lb/>
            dignity: for if our anger is implacable, it is extreme rancour; <lb/>
            but if easily appeased, it is extreme levity; which, however, <lb/>
            in a choice of evils, is to be preferred to rancour.</p>
          <p>XIV. 40. But since it was your first year that caused the <lb/>
            most talk on this subject of censure (I imagine because <lb/>
            injustice, and avarice, and insolence in men occurred to you <lb/>
            contrary to your anticipation, and on that account appeared <lb/>
            intolerable); while the second year was much more quiet, <lb/>
            because habit, and reason, and, as I flatter myself, my letters <lb/>
            also, have rendered you more patient and gentle; the third <lb/>
            year ought to be so corrected that no one may be able to find <lb/>
            even the slightest cause for censure in it.</p>
          <p>41. And now, on this topic, I speak to you not with ex- <lb/>
            hortation and precepts, but with brotherly entreaty, beseech- <lb/>
            ing you to devote all your thought, care, and meditation <lb/>
            to securing the praise of all men in all quarters. If our <lb/>
            rank in life were in a moderate position for talk and dis- <lb/>
            cussion about us, nothing extraordinary, nothing beyond the <lb/>
            common conduct of other men, would be required of you: <lb/>
            but now, by reason of the splendour and importance of the <lb/>
            circumstances in which we are placed, unless we secure the <lb/>
            highest possible praise from that province, we seem scarcely <lb/>
            in a condition to escape extreme censure. Such is our posi- <lb/>
            tion, that while all good men look with favour on us, they at <lb/>
            the same time require and expect from us all imaginable <lb/>
            diligence and virtue; but all the unprincipled, because we <lb/>
            have engaged in everlasting war against them, seem to be <lb/>
            contented with the very smallest pretext for censuring us.</p>
          <p>42. Since, therefore, a theatre of such a kind, that of all <lb/>
            Asia, has been presented for the display of your virtues- <lb/>
            a theatre crowded with a numerous body of spectators, most <lb/>
            ample in size, with an audience of most cultivated judgment; <lb/>
            and so well adapted for sound, that the sense and expressions <lb/>
            of the actors reach even to Rome; strive, I entreat you, and <lb/>
            labour, not only to appear worthy of the circumstances in <lb/>
            which you are placed, but even superior to them by your <lb/>
            own good qualities.</p>
          <p>XV. 43. And since, among the different offices of the state, <note type="footnote"> c2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            chance has assigned to me the domestic administration of the <lb/>
            republic, but to you a provincial government, if my part is <lb/>
            inferior to none, take care that yours may surpass that of <lb/>
            others. At the same time reflect that we are not now <lb/>
            labouring for a reputation as yet unattained, and only ex- <lb/>
            pected; but that we are striving for the preservation of one <lb/>
            already earned, which indeed was not so much to be desired <lb/>
            previously, as it is now to be maintained by us. And if I <lb/>
            could have any interests separate from yours, I should desire <lb/>
            for myself nothing more honourable than this position which <lb/>
            has been already acquired by me. But such is now the state <lb/>
            of affairs, that unless all your actions and expressions in that <lb/>
            quarter harmonize with my conduct, I shall think that I <lb/>
            have gained nothing by such toils and such dangers on my <lb/>
            part, in all of which you were a sharer. But if you alone, <lb/>
            above all others, assisted me in obtaining a most honourable <lb/>
            fame, you will now assuredly strive beyond all others that <lb/>
            I may retain it. You must not regard only the opinions and <lb/>
            judgments of men who are now living, but also of those who <lb/>
            will live hereafter, though indeed their judgment will be more <lb/>
            just, as being free from all detraction and malevolence.</p>
          <p>44. Lastly, you ought to remember this too, that you are <lb/>
            not seeking glory for yourself alone; though, even were that <lb/>
            the case, you would not neglect it, especially when you had <lb/>
            desired to consecrate the memory of your name by the most <lb/>
            honourable records; but it is also to be shared with me, <lb/>
            and to be handed down to our children. In regard to it, <lb/>
            therefore, you must take care lest, if you are too remiss, <lb/>
            you should seem, not merely to have managed ill for yourself, <lb/>
            but even to have grudged reputation to your relations.</p>
          <p>XVI. 45. These remarks are not made with this view, <lb/>
            that my words may seem to have roused you when asleep, <lb/>
            but rather to have given you an impulse while running; for <lb/>
            you will always give all men cause, as you have done, to <lb/>
            praise your equity, your moderation, your strictness, and <lb/>
            your integrity. But from the singular love which I bear <lb/>
            you, an insatiable eagerness for your glory possesses me; <lb/>
            although I am of opinion, that when Asia ought now to be <lb/>
            as well known to you as his own private house is to every <lb/>
            man, and when such great experience is added to your excel- <lb/>
            lent natural sense, there is nothing which can contribute to <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            glory that you do not thoroughly appreciate, and that does <lb/>
            not present itself daily to your mind without exhortation <lb/>
            from any one. But I, who, while I read your letters, think <lb/>
            that I am listening to you, and while I am writing to you, <lb/>
            think that I am conversing with you, am consequently most <lb/>
            delighted with your longest letters, and am myself often <lb/>
            somewhat prolix in addressing you.</p>
          <p>46. In conclusion, I entreat and exhort you, that as good <lb/>
            poets and careful actors are accustomed to do, so you, at <lb/>
            the end and termination of your office and administration, <lb/>
            should be especially careful, that this third year of your <lb/>
            command may, like the third act of a play,l appear to be <lb/>
            the most highly-finished and ornate of the whole. This you <lb/>
            will do most easily if you shall imagine that I, whom you <lb/>
            have always desired to please more than all the rest of the <lb/>
            world, am always present with you, and take part in every- <lb/>
            thing which you shall say and do.</p>
          <p>It only remains for me to beg you to take most diligent <lb/>
            care of your health, if you wish me and all your friends to be <lb/>
            well. Farewell.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>The following letter was written in the year after Letter I. Cæsar had <lb/>
            begun his contests with the aristocratic party; and had brought in <lb/>
            an agrarian law substantially the same as that of Rullus : proposing <lb/>
            among other enactments, to plant 20,000 colonists in the public <lb/>
            domain in Campania; and the appointment of the commissioners <lb/>
            to superintend the distributions of these lands was to be vested <lb/>
            in Cæsar himself. Cato opposed the bill in the senate, and Caesar <lb/>
            ordered his lictors to seize him and carry him to prison, though <lb/>
            he was deterred from executing this menace by the indignation <lb/>
            of the whole senate. His colleague Bibulus was resolute in his <lb/>
            opposition; but when he endeavoured to resist the passing of the <lb/>
            measure in the comitia, he was thrown down the steps of the temple <note type="footnote"> 1 Why does Cicero say the third act, which is the middle act of a <lb/>
            play ? Does he mean by acts those three parts of a play to which the <lb/>

            on the last of which they bestowed the utmost art and industry to <lb/>
            secure the applause of the audience? He has used the same com- <lb/>
            parison, in almost the same words, in his Cato. If this explanation <lb/>
            satisfy the learned, there is no reason why we should read, as has been <lb/>

            of Castor and Pollux, his fasces were broken, and he himself and <lb/>
            some of his attendants wounded. Cæsar now released the farmers <lb/>
            of the public revenues in Asia from some of the conditions of their <lb/>
            contracts, with which they were dissatisfied. (See preceding Letter.) <lb/>
            And on the motion of Vatinius, the province of Cisalpine Gaul and <lb/>
            Illyricum was assigned to him for five years; to which Transalpine <lb/>
            Gaul was afterwards added, through the influence of Pompey, who <lb/>
            married Julia, Cæsar's daughter. Clodius was carrying on the mea- <lb/>
            sure of his adoption into a plebeian family, and openly threatening <lb/>
            Cicero with impeachment. The consuls-elect for the ensuing year, <lb/>
            696 A.U.o., were Aulus Gabinius, and L. Calpurnius Piso, whose <lb/>
            daughter Cæsar had just married.</p>

          <p>I. 1. STATIUS1 arrived at my house on the 25th of October, <lb/>
            His arrival, as you had written that you should be torn to <lb/>
            pieces by your people while he was away, was a disagreeable <lb/>
            one to me. But as it put aside the expectation of yourself, <lb/>
            and that concourse of people which would have occurred <lb/>
            if he had departed at the same time with you, and had not <lb/>
            appeared till you did yourself, it seemed to me to have hap- <lb/>
            pened not altogether disadvantageously; for the talk of men <lb/>
            is now exhausted, and expressions of this kind are uttered <lb/>
            by many, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_15_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which I am glad is accomplished in your absence.</p>
          <p>2. But whereas he seems to have been sent by you for <lb/>
            the purpose of clearing himself in my opinion, that was not <lb/>
            at all necessary: for, in the first place, he never was sus- <lb/>
            pected by me; nor, in what I wrote to you about him, did <lb/>
            I write on my own judgment: but as the estimation and safety <lb/>
            of all of us who have joined in the affairs of the common- <lb/>
            wealth depended not only on truth, but also on reputation, I <note type="footnote"> I A freedman of Quintus Cicero, and one who had had far too much <lb/>

              have constantly written to you the reports of others, and <lb/>
              not my own opinions. How common, indeed, and how un- <lb/>
              favourable, such reports were, Statius himself learned on his <lb/>
              arrival; for he came just in time to hear the complaints of <lb/>
              certain persons, which were made to me concerning himself, <lb/>
              and had an opportunity of experiencing that the conversation <lb/>
              of the disaffected broke forth especially against his name.</p>
          <p>3. But that which used to move me most, was when I <lb/>
            heard that he had greater influence with you than the gravity <lb/>
            of your age, or the prudence requisite for such a command <lb/>
            required; (for how many people do you think have applied <lb/>
            to me to recommend them to Statius? how many things do <lb/>
            you think he has himself made known, without intending it, <lb/>
            in conversation to the same effect?) that did not please me; <lb/>
            I warned, advised, deterred you. In such proceedings, even <lb/>
            if there is the greatest fidelity in him, (as, indeed, I fully <lb/>
            believe, since such is your opinion of him,) yet the mere <lb/>
            appearance of a freedman or of a slave having so much <lb/>
            influence over you, can contribute nothing to your dignity. <lb/>
            And you may be assured, (for I feel bound neither to say <lb/>
            anything without reason, nor to suppress anything through <lb/>
            policy,) that Statius has furnished entire matter for the con- <lb/>
            versation of those who seek to disparage you: previously, it <lb/>
            could only have been understood that some persons were <lb/>
            offended with your severity; but since he has been emanci- <lb/>
            pated, there has not been wanting to those who were offended <lb/>
            a subject on which they might enlarge.</p>
          <p>II. 4. I will now reply to those letters which L. Cæsius <lb/>
            delivered to me, (whom, as I understand that such is your <lb/>
            wish, I will on no occasion fail to support,) one of which <lb/>
            relates to Zeuxis of Blandus,1 who, you write, is urgently <lb/>
            recommended by me to you, while -he has most unques- <lb/>
            tionably murdered his mother. On this subject, and con- <lb/>
            cerning this whole class of persons, attend to a few words <lb/>
            from me, lest you should, perchance, be surprised that I am <lb/>
            become so solicitous of pleasing the Greeks. As I perceived <lb/>
            that the complaints of the Greeks had too much weight, <lb/>
            owing to the natural talent of that nation for deceiving, I <lb/>
            sought to pacify, by every means in my power, whomsoever <lb/>
            I heard make any complaint of you. In the first place, I <note type="footnote">1 A town of Phrygia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            soothed the people of Dionysopolis, who were most bitter <lb/>
            enemies of mine; and their chief man, Hermippus, I won <lb/>
            over, not merely by talking to him, but. by admitting him <lb/>
            to intimacy. I received, with all the courtesy and friend- <lb/>
            ship in my power, Hephæstus of Apamea, and that most <lb/>
            contemptible of men, Megaristus of Antandros, and Nicias <lb/>
            of Smyrna, and all the despicable fellows of the district, even <lb/>
            Nymphon of Colophon. All this I did, not because those <lb/>
            men, or their whole nation, gave me any pleasure; for I am <lb/>
            thoroughly weary of their levity, their flattery, and their <lb/>
            minds that regard no duty but merely time-serving.</p>
          <p>5. But, to return to Zeuxis, when he repeated the very same <lb/>
            things which you write, about a conversation held by Marcus <lb/>
            Cascellius with him, I objected to what he said, and admitted <lb/>
            the man to my intimacy. But I know not what strong <lb/>
            desire there was in you, when you say that you wished, since <lb/>
            you had sewn up two Mysians in a sack at Smyrna, to give <lb/>
            a similar example of your severity in the upper part of <lb/>
            the province, and therefore desired by all means to draw <lb/>
            forth Zeuxis,—who, if brought before the tribunal, ought <lb/>
            perhaps not to have been let go; but it was not necessary <lb/>
            that he should be sought out and enticed by blandishments, <lb/>
            as you write, before the court, especially being a man of such <lb/>
            a character, that I know him, from the reports of his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, and, every day more and more, from those of many <lb/>
            other persons, to be almost of greater respectability than his <lb/>
            native city.</p>
          <p>6. But, you will say, I am partial to Greeks only. What? <lb/>
            did I not pacify Lucius Cæcilius by every means in my <lb/>
            power? and what a man he was! of what anger! of whai <lb/>
            pride! Whom, indeed, except Tuscenius, whose case cannot <lb/>
            be mended, have I not pacified? There just occurs to me <lb/>
            Catienus, a fickle and sordid man, though of the equestrian <lb/>
            order: even he shall be smoothed down. That you were <lb/>
            somewhat severe to his father, I do not blame you, for I well <lb/>
            know that you acted with sufficient reason. But what need <lb/>
            was there of letters of such a character as you sent to him? <lb/>
            telling him that he was of his own accord erecting a cross for <lb/>
            himself, from which you had already taken him down; and <lb/>
            that you would now take care that he should be burnt alive <lb/>
            with the applause of the whole province. Again, what did <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            rou write to an unknown fellow called Caius Fabius, (for <lb/>
            Titus Catienus carries about that letter too,) telling him that <lb/>
            it was reported to you that Licinius, the kidnapper, with his <lb/>
            young chick of an extortioner, is exacting tribute? You <lb/>
            then ask Fabius to burn both father and son alive if he can, <lb/>
            and if not, to send them to you, that they may be burnt by <lb/>
            judicial sentence. These letters, sent doubtless in joke by <lb/>
            you to Caius Fabius, if indeed they are yours at all, appear, <lb/>
            when they are read, to contain a barbarity of language cal- <lb/>
            culated to excite odium.</p>
          <p>7. And if you look back at the precepts contained in all <lb/>
            my letters, you will see that there is nothing censured by me <lb/>
            except the bitterness of your language and your proneness <lb/>
            to anger, and perhaps, in one or two instances, your care- <lb/>
            lessness as to letters sent by you. If in these matters my <lb/>
            authority had had a little more influence over you than either <lb/>
            your own natural disposition, which is somewhat too hasty, <lb/>
            or a certain pleasure which you find in passionateness, or wit <lb/>
            and facetiousness in speaking, there would really be nothing <lb/>
            whatever for us to regret. And do you think that I feel only <lb/>
            a trifling concern, when I hear in what estimation Vergilius, <lb/>
            and your neighbour Caius Octavius, are held? for if you <lb/>
            prefer yourself to your inland neighbours, the Cilician and <lb/>
            the Syrian, you do something very great! And it is a bitter <lb/>
            feeling, that while those men whom I have mentioned are <lb/>
            not superior to you in innocence, they yet surpass you in <lb/>
            the art of conciliating good-will; men who have never read <lb/>
            either the Cyrus of Xenophon or his Agesilaus, kings from <lb/>
            whom, though possessed of absolute power, no one ever heard a <lb/>
            single harsh word. But how much good I have done in recom- <lb/>
            mending this conduct to you from the first, I am not unaware.</p>
          <p>III. 8. Now however that you are departing, as you seem <lb/>
            to me to be already doing, leave behind you, I entreat, as <lb/>
            pleasant a recollection of yourself as possible. You have an <lb/>
            exceedingly courteous successor. Your other qualities will <lb/>
            be much regretted on his arrival. In sending letters, as I <lb/>
            have often written to you, you have shown yourself too easy. <lb/>
            Put out of the way, if you can, all that are unjust, all that <lb/>
            are of an unusual character, all that are inconsistent one with <lb/>
            another. Statius has told me that the letters written to you <lb/>
            are often brought, and read by him, and that. if they are <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            unjust, you are informed of it; but that, before he cams to <lb/>
            you, there was no selection of your letters, though since that <lb/>
            time there have been rolls of selected letters which commonly <lb/>
            met with reprobation.</p>
          <p>9. On this subject, indeed, I do not give you any advice <lb/>
            now, for it is too late, and you must be aware that I have <lb/>
            given you much advice, in various ways, and with great <lb/>
            care. Attend to that, however, which I bade Theopompus <lb/>
            tell you, when I was reminded of the circumstance by himself, <lb/>
            namely, that by means of men well affected to you, these dif- <lb/>
            ferent kinds of letters, as-is easy, may be put out of the way: <lb/>
            in the first place, those which are unjust; next, those which <lb/>
            are contradictory; then those written in an absurd and un- <lb/>
            usual manner; and lastly, all that are insulting to any one. <lb/>
            I do not indeed believe that these are exactly such as they <lb/>
            are stated to be, and if they have escaped observation through <lb/>
            the pressure of your business, at least examine them now, and <lb/>
            get rid of them. I have read a letter which your nomen- <lb/>
            clator Sylla was said to have written himself, and which <lb/>
            cannot be approved; I have read some very angry ones.</p>
          <p>10. We will speak, however, of the letters at a fitting <lb/>
            time. For while I had hold of this page, Lucius Flavius the <lb/>
            prætor-elect came in to me, a man with whom I am on terms <lb/>
            of great intimacy. He told me that you had sent letters to <lb/>
            his agents which appeared to me most unreasonable, com- <lb/>
            manding them to take nothing from the property which had <lb/>
            belonged to Lucius Octavius Naso, to whom Lucius Flavius is <lb/>
            heir, until they had paid a sum of money to Caius Fundanius; <lb/>
            and that you had sent also to the people of Apollonia not to <lb/>
            allow any portion of the property which had belonged to <lb/>
            Octavius to be taken away, until the debt due to Fundanius <lb/>
            was paid. These things do not seem to me to be probable, <lb/>
            for they are wholly inconsistent with your usual prudence. <lb/>
            That the heir shall take none of the property! What if he <lb/>
            demurs ? What if there is no debt at all owing ? What! is <lb/>
            the prætor accustomed to decide that there is a debt owing ? <lb/>
            What! (you will say) shall I not desire to serve Fundanius ? <lb/>
            Am I not his friend ? Am I not moved with compassion for <lb/>
            him ?—No one more so, but in some cases the path of law is <lb/>
            of such a character that there is no room for favour. And <lb/>
            Flavius told me that it was so expressed in that letter which <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            he affirmed to be yours, that you would either give the people <lb/>
            thanks as your friends, or bring trouble on them as enemies.</p>
          <p>11. In short, he was greatly concerned; he addressed <lb/>
            vehement complaints to me on the subject, and entreated me <lb/>
            to write to you with all the earnestness possible; as I now <lb/>
            do, and entreat you most earnestly again and again, to allow <lb/>
            the agents of Flavius to use their own discretion as to taking <lb/>
            the property, and to write nothing to the people of Apollonia <lb/>
            that is contrary to the interest of Flavius, and, besides, to do <lb/>
            everything to gratify Flavius, and consequently Pompey. I <lb/>
            should, in truth, be reluctant to appear to you over liberal, <lb/>
            because of your injustice to him; but I entreat you to leave <lb/>
            of your own accord some authority and some record of a <lb/>
            decree or paper in your own hand-writing, which may have <lb/>
            a favourable bearing on the business and cause of Flavius. <lb/>
            For the man being at the same time one who pays me great <lb/>
            respect, while he is tenacious of his own rights and dignity, <lb/>
            is dissatisfied that he had no influence with you, either from <lb/>
            considerations of friendship or of right. And, I believe, on <lb/>
            some occasion or other, both Pompey and Cæsar recommended <lb/>
            Flavius's interest to you, and Flavius had written to you <lb/>
            himself on the subject, and so, I am sure, did I. If, therefore, <lb/>
            there is any one thing which you think you ought to do at <lb/>
            my request, let this matter be that one. If you have any <lb/>
            regard for me, take care, strive, and manage, that Flavius <lb/>
            may feel all the gratitude possible both to you and to me. I <lb/>
            ask this of you with such earnestness that I cannot ask any- <lb/>
            thing with greater solicitude.</p>
          <p>IV. 12. As to what you write to me about Hermias, it <lb/>
            was indeed a matter of great annoyance to me. I had <lb/>
            written you a letter, by no means in a brotherly style, which <lb/>
            I wrote in excessive anger, when I was provoked by a com- <lb/>
            munication from Diodotus, the freedman of Lucullus, stating <lb/>
            what I had heard at the moment about the agreement; and <lb/>
            I wished to recal it. This letter, written in au unfraternal <lb/>
            spirit, you ought in a fraternal spirit to forgive.</p>
          <p>13. With respect to Censorinus and Antonius, Cassius <lb/>
            and Scævola, I am very glad indeed that you are, as you <lb/>
            write, beloved by them. The other matters in that letter <lb/>
            were of a graver character than I wished: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθὰν πὰν ναῦν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅπαξ θανεῖν</foreign>.</p><pb n="28"/>
            
          <p>Those matters will be more serious. My reproofs were full <lb/>
            of affection; they were not absolutely of no importance, but <lb/>
            moderate and light.1 I should never have thought you de- <lb/>
            serving of the very slightest reprehension in anything, while <lb/>
            you were conducting yourself with the most rigid propriety, <lb/>
            if we had not many enemies. Whatever I wrote at all in <lb/>
            the tone of admonition or reproof, I wrote from the anxiety <lb/>
            of my caution, in which I still continue, and shall continue, <lb/>
            and shall not cease to press you to act in a similar way.</p>
          <p>14. Attains the Iphemian has applied to me to prevail on <lb/>
            you not to hinder the money which has been voted for the <lb/>
            statue of Quintus Publicenus from being levied; and I do <lb/>
            beg this of you, and exhort you not to allow the honour of <lb/>
            a man of such a character, and so intimately connected with <lb/>
            us, to be at all diminished or obstructed by your means. <lb/>
            In the next place, Licinius, the slave of Æsop the tragedian, <lb/>
            my great friend, with whose person you are acquainted, has <lb/>
            fled; he was at Athens, staying with Patro the Epicurean, <lb/>
            as a free man: from thence he proceeded into Asia. After- <lb/>
            wards, a man called Plato, a citizen of Sardis, and an Epi- <lb/>
            curean, who is accustomed to be a good deal at Athens, and <lb/>
            who was at Athens at the time when Licinius went thither, <lb/>
            arrested the man, when he subsequently learned from Æsop's <lb/>
            letters that he was a runaway slave, and delivered him into <lb/>
            custody at Ephesus; but whether he put him in the public <lb/>
            prison, or in the private house of correction, I could not well <lb/>
            understand from his letter. As he is at Ephesus, I should <lb/>
            wish you, by some means or other, to search for the man, <lb/>
            and use all your diligence to bring him over with you. Dc <lb/>
            not consider of what value he is, for he is of little value <lb/>
            who has now proved himself worthless; but Æsop is so con- <lb/>
            cerned and indignant at the wickedness and audacity of the <lb/>
            slave, that you can do him no greater favour than to be the <lb/>
            means of his recovering him.</p>
          <p>V. 15. Attend now to what you are most desirous to hear. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is rather obscure. Manutius interprets it, that the meaning <lb/>
            of the Greek quotations in the letter which Cicero repented of, was, <lb/>
            -Let us keep the vessel straight on her course; if we fail, we <lb/>
            can die but once. And now he says, the advice which I am giving <lb/>
            you is of greater consequence than the affairs which impelled me <lb/>
            then to use that language, in which despondency was mingled with <lb/>
            reproof. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            The republic we have utterly lost; insomuch, that Cato, <lb/>
            a young man of no wisdom, but still a Roman citizen and <lb/>
            a Cato, scarcely escaped with his life, because, when he was <lb/>
            resolved to impeach Gabinius for corruption, and the prætors <lb/>
            would not grant access for some days, or give him any oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of addressing them, he made his way to the rostrum, <lb/>
            and called Pompey a "private dictator." Nothing was ever <lb/>
            more nearly happening, than that he should be killed. From <lb/>
            this circumstance you may see what the state of the whole <lb/>
            republic must be.</p>
          <p>16. Still men are not likely to be wanting to my own <lb/>
            caused They make professions of adherence to me to a <lb/>
            wonderful extent, and offer themselves, and make promises. <lb/>
            In truth, I am in the greatest hopes, and even in greater <lb/>
            confidence. I hope that we shall get the upper-hand. I <lb/>
            feel confident that I need fear no misfortune in this state of <lb/>
            affairs. But still this is the condition of things. If Clodius <lb/>
            impeaches me, all Italy will throng around me to secure my <lb/>
            coming off with increased glory; but if he attempts to carry <lb/>
            his point by violence, I then hope that we shall resist him <lb/>
            .with force, not only through the efforts of our friends, but <lb/>
            even those of strangers. All men promise me the aid of <lb/>
            themselves, and their friends, and freedmen, and slaves, and <lb/>
            even of their money. Our ancient band of worthies glows <lb/>
            with zeal and love for me. If in times past any of them <lb/>
            have been at all alienated, or cool, they now, from hatred <lb/>
            to these kings,2 unite themselves with the good citizens. <lb/>
            Pompey promises everything, and so does Cæsar; whom I <lb/>
            trust so far as to abate nothing of my own preparation. The <lb/>
            tribunes of the people elect are my friends; the consuls <lb/>
            show themselves in a very favourable light. I find the prætors <lb/>
            most excellent friends, and most energetic citizens, especially <lb/>
            Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius, and Lentulus; I find the <lb/>
            others3 also good, but these particularly so. Study there- <lb/>
            fore to cherish much courage and good hope. Of everything, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">LETTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This letter was written in the next year, 696 A.U.C. Cæsar, on the <lb/>
            expiration of his consulship, did not depart at once for his province, <lb/>
            but remained outside the city with his legions. Clodius, through his <lb/>
            influence, obtained the tribuneship, and having won over the consuls <lb/>
            by his promises, began a set of revolutionary measures; introducing <lb/>
            a bill to limit the power of the censors, and another to restore the <lb/>
            colleges or guilds which had been suppressed a few years before; and <lb/>
            a third to repeal the Lex Ælia Fufia, which gave the consuls a power <lb/>
            of dissolving the comitia by declaring the auspices unfavourable. <lb/>
            Having strengthened himself by these measures, he proceeded in his <lb/>
            threatened attack upon Cicero. Caesar offered him one of his Cam- <lb/>
            panian commissionerships as a means of withdrawing in honour for <lb/>
            a while; or a lieutenancy in Gaul under himself; but he refused <lb/>
            these offers, trusting to the attachment of the people and Pompey. <lb/>
            When he found them likely to fail him, he, and the greater part of <lb/>
            the senate and knights, put on black garments, as a dress of suppli- <lb/>
            cation ; and Cicero made personal application to Piso for his protec- <lb/>
            tion. At last, in the beginning of April, by the advice of his friends, <lb/>
            Cicero withdrew from the city, taking an image of Minerva, and <lb/>
            placing it in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus as a deposit; and <lb/>
            this letter was written while he was in exile at Thessalonica.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Marcus to his brother Quintus, greeting.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. 1. My brother, my brother, my brother, were you afraid <lb/>
            that, under the influence of some angry feeling, I had sent to <lb/>
            you slaves without any letters; or that I was even unwilling <lb/>
            to see you? I angry with you! How could I have been <lb/>
            angry with you? I dare say; for you, I suppose, have crushed <lb/>
            me; your enemies, your unpopularity has ruined me; and it <lb/>
            is not I who have miserably undone you. That consulship <lb/>
            of mine, so much extolled, has torn from me you, my <lb/>
            children, my country, my fortunes; would that it may havo <lb/>
            taken nothing from you but me alone! But certainly, on <lb/>
            your part, everything honourable, agreeable, has befallen me, <lb/>
            from me there arises to you only sorrow for my ill-fortune, <lb/>
            fear for your own, regret, grief, aud solitude. Could I be un- <lb/>
            willing to see you? Nay, rather I was unwilling to be seen <lb/>
            by you.1 For you would not have seen your brother; you <note type="footnote"> 1 Quintus was just quitting his government in Asia, and returning to <lb/>
            Rome, where his enemies were preparing to impeach him. He pro- <lb/>
            posed to come out of his way to Thessalonica, to see his brother; but <lb/>
            Cicero urged him rather to hasten to Rome. He says to Atticus, (Ep. <lb/>
            iii. 19,) that it was necessary for his brother " to hasten to Rome with <lb/>
            all speed, lest any injury should be done to him in his absence." ... </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            would not have seen him whom you had left, him whom you <lb/>
            had known, him to whom. weeping, you had bidden farewell, <lb/>
            yourself weeping, of whom you, when departing, had taken <lb/>
            leave, after he had attended you some way on your journey: <lb/>
            you would have seen not even a trace or image of him, but <lb/>
            a sort of effigy of a breathing corpse. And I wish that you <lb/>
            had rather seen or heard that I was dead; I wish that I had <lb/>
            left you surviving, not only my life, but my dignity.</p>
          <p>2. But I call all the gods to witness, that I have been re- <lb/>
            called from death by this single expression alone, that all men <lb/>
            declared that a part of your life also was laid up in my life. <lb/>
            I have therefore erred and acted wrongly: for if I bad died, <lb/>
            my death of itself would have been an ample proof of my love <lb/>
            and affection for you; but I have been the cause, that though <lb/>
            I am alive, you are without me, and that while I am alive, <lb/>
            you are in need of the assistance of others; and that my <lb/>
            voice is silent above all in our domestic dangers, after having <lb/>
            often been a protection against perils which did not at all <lb/>
            affect ourselves. For as to the fact of slaves having come <lb/>
            to you without any letters, since you see it did not happen <lb/>
            through anger, the cause was assuredly indolence, and an <lb/>
            infinite multitude of sorrows and miseries.</p>
          <p>3. With what sorrow do you think that these very words <lb/>
            are written? with as much as I know that you read them. <lb/>
            Can I ever cease to think of you, or ever think of you without <lb/>
            tears? For when I regret your absence, is it a brother alone <lb/>
            that I am regretting? Nay, I rather regret one who is <lb/>
            almost a contemporary in affection;1 a son in reverential <note type="footnote">"Therefore I preferred that he should hasten to Rome, instead of <lb/>
            coming to see me; and at the same time, (for I will tell the plain truth, <lb/>
            by which you will be able to see the greatness of my distress,) I could <lb/>
            not bring my mind to see him who is so greatly attached to me in such <lb/>
            trouble; nor to exhibit to him my own misery and grief, and the utter <lb/>
            ruin of my fortune; nor could I endure to be seen by him. And I <lb/>
            feared, too, what no doubt would have been the case, that he would not <lb/>
            be able to tear himself from me." This letter to Atticus bears the same <lb/>
            date as the one in the text to Quintus.' </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Suavitate prope œqualem. Cicero's meaning (if the text be as <lb/>
            Cicero wrote it) seems to be, that his brother is almost his equal, not <lb/>
            merely in length of life, but in length of affection. Marcus has loved <lb/>
            Quintus longer than Quintus has loved Marcus, because Marcus loved <lb/>
            Quintus in his infancy before Quintus could return his love. In saying <lb/>

            a youth of greater wisdom than I could have wished; for the <lb/>

            should I speak of your son, your own image, whom my boy <lb/>
            Cicero both loved as a brother and respected even as an elder <lb/>
            brother? Why should I observe that I did not permit that <lb/>
            most miserable woman, my most faithful wife, to attend me <lb/>
            in my exile, in order that there might be some one to protect <lb/>

          <p>4. But still, I did write you a letter, in such a way as <lb/>
            I could, and gave it to Philogonus your freedman, and I <lb/>
            imagine that it was subsequently delivered to you; in which <lb/>
            I continued to exhort and entreat you, as your slaves told <lb/>
            you in the verbal message which they gave you from me, to <lb/>
            go straight to Rome, and to go with speed. For, in the first <lb/>
            place, I wished you to be there to protect yourself, in case <lb/>
            there were still any enemies of ours whose cruelty was not <lb/>
            yet satisfied with the calamities which had befallen me; and, <lb/>
            in the second place, I dreaded the lamentations which must <lb/>
            have broken out at our meeting, and I could not have en- <lb/>
            dured your departure; I feared too that very thing which <lb/>
            you mention in your letter, that you would not have been <lb/>
            able to tear yourself from me. For these reasons, this great <lb/>
            misfortune of not seeing you at all, than which it does not <note type="footnote">suavitas or œqualis. But we can hardly take cequalis in the sense of <lb/>
            " equal," for Cicero would have offered poor praise to his brother if he <lb/>
            had said to him, “You are almost my equal in suavitas." " Suavitas," <lb/>
            says Malespina, “est inter amicos." But the soundness of the text is <lb/>
            extremely doubtful. The old editions have suavitate prope œqualem, <lb/>
            prope fratrem; the modern editors omit prope fratrem. Lambinus <lb/>
            would read suavitatefratrem, ætate prope œqualem, which Gruter calls <lb/>
            a frigid emendation, but which would materially improve the passage. <lb/>
            Ætate, however, is by no means necessary; for, if it were omitted, <lb/>
            aqualis would still be taken in the sense of “ equal in age." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            seem possible for any more painful and bitter grief to have <lb/>
            befallen affectionate and devoted brothers, was less bitter and <lb/>
            less distressing than our meeting and our separation would <lb/>
            have been.</p>
          <p>5. Now, if you can, do what I, who have always appeared <lb/>
            to you to be a man of fortitude, cannot; raise and strengthen <lb/>
            yourself if there is any contest to be encountered. I hope, <lb/>
            if my hope has any weight, that your own integrity, and the <lb/>
            affection which the city bears you, and even pity for me, will <lb/>
            bring you some protection. But if you find yourself free <lb/>
            from that danger, you will do, I am sure, anything which <lb/>
            you shall think possible to be done in my behalf. On this <lb/>
            subject many of my friends write me many letters, and show <lb/>
            that they still entertain hopes; but I myself do not see clearly <lb/>
            what to hope, as my enemies have very great power; and of <lb/>
            my friends, some have deserted me, and some have even <lb/>
            betrayed me, as they fear perhaps in my return a reproof to <lb/>
            their own wickedness. But what is the real position of affairs <lb/>
            in that respect, I should wish you to examine thoroughly, <lb/>
            and to let me know. For myself, as long as it shall be of <lb/>
            any use to you, if you shall see that there is danger to be <lb/>
            met, I will continue to live; longer than that I cannot exist: <lb/>
            for no prudence and no learning has power enough to endure <lb/>
            such a weight of sorrow.</p>
          <p>6. I know that there has been a more honourable and <lb/>
            a more useful opportunity of dying, but I not only let that <lb/>
            slip, but many other things too; but, if I chose to waste <lb/>
            time in lamenting what is past, I should be doing nothing <lb/>
            but increasing your sorrow, and exhibiting my own folly. <lb/>
            What, however, neither ought to be done nor can be done, <lb/>
            is for me to remain in so miserable and dishonourable an ex- <lb/>
            istence as this any longer than the chance of an opportunity <lb/>
            of serving you or any well-grounded hope shall require; so <lb/>
            that I, who was formerly most happy in my brother, in my <lb/>
            children, my wife, my resources, and even in respect of richest <lb/>
            and in dignity, authority, repute, and favour, not inferior <lb/>
            to the greatest men who have ever existed, now, in these <lb/>
            crushed and ruined circumstances, am no longer able even to <lb/>
            lament myself and my friends. <note type="footnote"> 1 Genere ipso pecuniœ. Paul Manutius would read, gencre ipso <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>7. Why, therefore, have you written to me about any bills <lb/>
            of exchange ? As if your resources did not now support me. <lb/>
            in which very matter, miserable that I am, I both see and <lb/>
            feel how great an error I have committed: while you have <lb/>
            to satisfy those in whose debt you are, out of your own <lb/>
            means and those of your son, I have squandered to no pur- <lb/>
            pose money drawn out of the treasury in your name. But <lb/>
            still, the sum which you mentioned in your letters has been <lb/>
            paid to Mark Antony, and the same amount to Cæpio. And <lb/>
            what I have with me is quite sufficient for the objects which <lb/>
            I have in view; for whether I am restored, or whether I am <lb/>
            forced to abandon all hope, I want nothing more here; and <lb/>
            as for you, if perchance any annoyance should arise, I advise <lb/>
            you to apply to Crassus and to Calidius.</p>
          <p>8. How much trust may be placed in Hortensius I do not <lb/>
            know. He treated me with the greatest possible dishonesty <lb/>
            and treachery, though with the greatest pretences of affection, <lb/>
            and with unremitting attention day after day, Arrius being <lb/>
            also in league with him; and it was from being deceived by <lb/>
            their advice, and promises, and recommendations, that I fell <lb/>
            into this misfortune. But you will take no notice of this, <lb/>
            that they may not injure you; only be on your guard on <lb/>
            this point, (and with this view I would have you cultivate <lb/>
            the friendship of Hortensius himself through the instru- <lb/>
            mentality of Pomponius,) 1 that that verse which was quoted <lb/>
            against you with reference to the Aurelian law, when you <lb/>
            were a candidate for the ædileship, may not be confirmed <lb/>
            by false witness. For there is nothing that I am so much <lb/>
            afraid of as that, when men find out how much pity for me, <lb/>
            your prayers, and a regard for your safety, is likely to excite, <lb/>
            they will oppose you with greater violence.</p>
          <p>9. I believe that Messala is well affected towards you; and <lb/>
            I think that even Pompey pretends to be so ; but I wish that <lb/>
            you may have no occasion to experience this. And I would <lb/>
            pray to the gods that you might not, if they had not given <note type="footnote">1 Titus Pomponius Atticus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cicero was afraid, I imagine, that his brother Quintus might be <lb/>
            accused of bribery, because, when he was a candidate for the ædileship, <lb/>

            verse had beet quoted about him, in reference to the Aurelian law, <lb/>
            touching upon bribery. We may suppose that by the Aurelian law <lb/>

            may be content with the infinite misfortunes which have fallen <lb/>
            upon me; in which, however, there is not only no dishonour <lb/>
            from wickedness, but my whole sorrow is that most severe <lb/>
            punishments are inflicted upon the most virtuous actions.</p>
          <p>10. Why, my brother, need I recommend to you my daughter <lb/>
            and yours, and my little Cicero? One of my sorrows is that <lb/>
            their orphaned state will cause you no less grief than it <lb/>
            causes me. But, as long as you are safe, they will not be <lb/>
            orphans. As to the rest, so may some safety be granted me, <lb/>
            and an opportunity of dying in my native land, as tears <lb/>
            suffer me to write no more. I would have you also take <lb/>
            care of Terentia, and write me an answer with a full account <lb/>
            of everything. Keep up your courage as far as the nature <lb/>
            of circumstances will allow.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. I ENTREAT you, my brother, if you and all my friends are <lb/>
            involved in my individual ruin, do not attribute it to any <lb/>
            dishonesty or evil-doing of mine, but rather to my impru- <lb/>
            dence and ill-fortune. There is no error on my part, except <lb/>
            that I have believed those men, by whom I thought it would <lb/>
            be impious for me to be deceived, or even for whose very <lb/>
            interests I did not think it would be advantageous. But <lb/>
            every one of my most intimate friends-every one most <lb/>
            nearly connected with me, and most dear to me, either <lb/>
            feared for himself or envied me; and so, wretched that I <lb/>
            was, I had nothing but the good faith of my friends. * * * <lb/>
            My own prudence was at fault.</p>
          <p>2. But if your own innocence, and the pity which men feel, <lb/>
            sufficiently protect you at this moment from annoyance, you <lb/>
            no doubt see clearly whether there is any hope of safety left <lb/>
            for me. For Pomponius and Sestius, and my friend Piso, <lb/>
            have hitherto detained me at Thessalonica, as they prevented <lb/>
            me from departing to a greater distance from the city, on <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            account of I know not what changes; but I looked for seme <lb/>
            result, more because of their letters, than from any well- <lb/>
            founded hope of ray own. For what could I hope, with my <lb/>
            enemy in full power, under the rule of my detractors, with <lb/>
            my friends faithless, and numbers envious of me 1</p>
          <p>3. Of the new tribunes of the people,1 Sestius indeed is full <lb/>
            of wishes to serve me, and so, as I hope, are Curius, Milo, <lb/>
            Fadius, and Fabricius; though Clodius is most bitter against <lb/>
            a man who, even when out of office, will be able to exert the <lb/>
            same power to stir up the assembly: and then, some one <lb/>
            will also be prepared to interpose his veto.</p>
          <p>4. These things were not set before me when I was leaving <lb/>
            the city, but I was constantly told that I should be brought <lb/>
            back in three days with the greatest honour. How did you <lb/>
            act then? you will ask me.—How? Many things came <lb/>
            together to disturb my mind; the sudden defection of <lb/>
            Pompey, the alienation of the consuls, also that of the <lb/>
            prætors, the fears of the farmers of the public revenues, the <lb/>
            dread of civil war. The tears of my friends prevented me <lb/>
            from going forth to encounter death; a course which cer- <lb/>
            tainly would have been best suited to my honour, and the <lb/>
            best calculated to afford me a refuge from my intolerable <lb/>
            miseries. But on this subject I wrote to you in that letter <lb/>
            which I gave to Phaethon. Now, since you too are sunk <lb/>
            down into such grief aud perplexity as no one else ever <lb/>
            suffered, if the pity of men can afford any relief in our <lb/>
            common calamity, you will certainly gain an incredible <lb/>
            advantage; but if we are utterly ruined (alas, me!) then <lb/>
            I shall have been the destruction of all my friends, to whom <lb/>
            I was previously no disgrace.</p>
          <p>5. But do you, as I wrote to you before, examine the <lb/>
            matter in all its bearings, and acquaint yourself with it <lb/>
            thoroughly, and write me the exact truth, as the state of the <lb/>
            time with reference to me, and not as your affection for me, <lb/>
            dictates. I will cling to life as long as I shall think that it <lb/>
            is for your advantage, or that it is possible to retain any <lb/>
            hope; you will know Sestius, who is most friendly to me; <lb/>
            and I imagine you will wish, for your own sake, to know <note type="footnote">1 The election of tribunes took place in the middle of July, and this <lb/>

            your solitary condition and our common distress, something <lb/>
            will be able to be effected by you, or else not by any means. <lb/>
            But if your enemies begin to attack you, do not be idle,; <lb/>
            for against me they will not proceed with swords, but with <lb/>
            law-suits. However, I trust that there may be nothing of <lb/>
            this. I entreat you to write me full information of every- <lb/>
            thing; and to think, if you please, that there is in me less <lb/>
            courage or wisdom than before, and but less love and affection <lb/>

          <p>This letter was written at the end of the year 697 A.U.C., in the consul- <lb/>
            ship of Lentulus Spinther and Metellus Nepos. Cicero had never <lb/>
            been formally banished; for though Clodius had prevailed to inter- <lb/>
            dict him from fire and water, he yet did not propose any vote that <lb/>
            he should be banished, nor did he attempt to have his name removed <lb/>
            from the roll of the senate. He did indeed destroy his house, and <lb/>
            dedicate the site to the goddess Liberty; and the consuls seized <lb/>
            his Tusculan villa; but still no legal sentence had ever been pro- <lb/>
            nounced against him. At the end of the year 696, when his enemy <lb/>
            Piso, the late consul, was coming to Macedonia, which had been <lb/>
            allotted to him as his province, Cicero moved to Dyrrhachium, in <lb/>
            order to be nearer Italy, where his brother, and Pomponius Atticus <lb/>
            (mentioned in the last letter), were making great exertions to render <lb/>
            the people favourable to his return. Pompey had become alienated <lb/>
            from Clodius by his violence and insolence; and Lentulus, one of <lb/>
            the consuls, was wholly devoted to Cicero. The consuls formally <lb/>
            proposed that Cicero should be invited to return. One of the trio <lb/>
            bunes, Serranus, prevented the formal adoption of any such measure <lb/>
            for a time; but in August it was carried, and in September Cicero <lb/>
            returned to Rome, where he was received with acclamations. He <lb/>
            immediately began to cultivate the good-will of Pompey, by pro- <lb/>
            posing his appointment to an extraordinary commission for supplying <lb/>
            the city, which was in great distress from scarcity; and he himself <lb/>
            accepted a subordinate commissionership. The site of his house on <lb/>
            the Palatine hill was restored to him, it being declared to have been <lb/>
            illegally and informally consecrated; and a sum of money was voted <lb/>
            to him to recompense him for his other losses, though Cicero was <lb/>
            not at all satisfied with the amount of compensation. The consuls- <lb/>
            elect for the ensuing year were Lentulus Marcellinus, and Marcius <lb/>
            Philippus.</p>

          <p>1. THE letter which you read I had written in the morning, <lb/>
            but Licinius acted with kind consideration in coming to me <lb/>
            in the evening as soon as the senate was adjourned, in order <lb/>
            that, if I chose, I might write you an account of all that <lb/>
            had taken place. The senate was more numerous than we <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            had thought it could possibly have been in the month of <lb/>
            December, close upon the festival days.1 Of the men of <lb/>
            consular dignity, we were there ourselves, and the two con- <lb/>
            suls-elect; and Publius Servilius, and Marcus Lucullus, and <lb/>
            Lepidus, and Volcatius, and Glabrio, proctors. We certainly <lb/>
            were a very numerous assembly, in all about two hundred. <lb/>
            Lupus had excited our expectations; he discussed the ques- <lb/>
            tion of the Campanian land with sufficient accuracy. He <lb/>
            was listened to with profound silence. You are not ignorant <lb/>
            of the subject. He did not pass over a single one of our <lb/>
            actions. Some sharp things were said against Caius Cæsar; <lb/>
            some insulting observations were made on Gelhus; and some <lb/>
            expostulations addressed to Pompey in his absence. When <lb/>
            he had summed up the whole matter at a late hour, he said <lb/>
            he would not ask us for our votes, lest he should lay on us <lb/>
            the burden of incurring any one's enmity; from the reproaches <lb/>
            which had been uttered on previous occasions, and from the <lb/>
            present silence, he was well aware what the feelings of the <lb/>
            senate were. Immediately he began to adjourn the senate. <lb/>
            Then Marcellinus said, "Do not, Lupus, from our silence <lb/>
            attempt to judge what on this occasion we either approve <lb/>
            or disapprove; I, as far as I myself am concerned, and I <lb/>
            believe that the same feelings influence the rest, am silent, <lb/>
            because I do not think that, as Pompey is absent, it is <lb/>
            proper for the question of the Campanian land to be dis- <lb/>
            cussed." Then he said that he had no wish to detain the <lb/>
            senate any longer.</p>
          <p>2. Racilius rose, and began to make a motion with respect <lb/>
            to the threatened impeachments. And, first of all, he asked <lb/>
            Marcellinus's opinion. He, after having complained with <lb/>
            great bitterness of the conflagrations, and murders, and <lb/>
            stonings perpetrated by Clodius, gave his opinion that he <lb/>
            himself should assign the judges by lot with the assistance <lb/>
            of the city prætor; that when the business of assigning of <lb/>
            the judges was finished, the comitia should be held; and that <lb/>
            whoever offered any obstacle to the tribunals would act con- <lb/>
            trary to the interests of the republic. After his opinion had <lb/>
            been received with great approbation, Caius Cato spoke against <note type="footnote"> 1 From the middle of December to the end of the year, the whole <lb/>
            time was taken up with the different festivals,-Saturnalia, Opalia, <lb/>

            it, and so did Cassius, calling forth great acclamations from <lb/>
            -the senate, as "he expressed his opinion that the comitia <lb/>
            ought to take precedence of the impeachments. Philippus <lb/>
            agreed with Lentulus.</p>
          <p>3. Afterwards Racilius asked me my opinion, first of all the <lb/>
            senators out of office. I made a long speech about the whole <lb/>
            frenzy and piratical wickedness of Publius Clodius; I accused <lb/>
            him as if he had been on .his trial, with incessant and favour- <lb/>
            able murmurs of assent 'from the whole senate. Severus <lb/>
            Antistius praised my speech at tolerable length, and in lan- <lb/>
            guage far from ineloquent; and he supported the cause of <lb/>
            the courts of justice, and said that he should always consider <lb/>
            it of the greatest importance. That opinion was adopted. <lb/>
            Then Clodius, when he was asked his opinion, began to take <lb/>
            up all the rest of the day with his speech; he declared in <lb/>
            furious language, that he had been attacked by Racilius in <lb/>
            a most insulting and discourteous manner. And then his <lb/>
            factious mob on a sudden, in the space in front of the senate- <lb/>
            house, and on the steps, raised a very'great disturbance, being <lb/>
            excited, I imagine, against Quintus Sextilius, and "the friends <lb/>
            of Milo. The fear of this uproar spreading abroad, we im- <lb/>
            mediately broke up, with great complaints from all parties.</p>
          <p>You have an account of the transactions of one day. The <lb/>
            rest of the business, I imagine, will be postponed till the <lb/>
            month of January. Of the tribunes of the people, we find <lb/>
            Racilius by far the best. Antistius, too, seems likely to be <lb/>
            friendly to us. As for Plancius, he is wholly devoted to us. <lb/>
            If you love me, be very considerate and careful how you put <lb/>
            to sea in the month of December.</p>

          <p>1. IT is not from pressure of business, with which, how- <lb/>
            ever, I am pretty much hindered, but from a slight attack <lb/>
            of weak eyes, that I am led to dictate this letter, instead of <lb/>
            writing with my own hand, as I usually do to you. And <lb/>
            in the first place I excuse myself to you in the very par- <lb/>
            ticular in which I accuse you; fcr no one has ever yet asked <lb/>
            me, "Whether I wished to send anything to Sardinia?” but <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            I suppose you often find people ask you, " Whether you <lb/>
            wish to send anything to Rome ?” As to what you wrote to <lb/>
            me in the name of Lentulus and Sestius, I spoke on that <lb/>
            matter with Cincius. However the business stands, it is <lb/>
            not a very easy one; but iu truth Sardinia has something <lb/>
            very well suited to recal to people's. mind a circumstance <lb/>
            which had escaped their recollection. For as the great Grac- <lb/>
            chus, when he was augur, after he-arrived in that province, <lb/>
            recollected what had happened to him contrary to the auspices, <lb/>
            when holding the comitia in the Campus Martius for the <lb/>
            election of consuls, so you, too, seem to me, now that you are <lb/>
            in Sardinia,l to have reflected again at your leisure on the <lb/>
            shape of the house of Minucius, and on the debt which you <lb/>
            owe to Pomponius. But as yet I have bought nothing. The <lb/>
            auction of Culleo's property has taken place. There was no <lb/>
            one to purchase the property; if the terms should be very <lb/>
            favourable, perhaps I may not let it slip myself.</p>
          <p>2. About your building, I do not cease to press Cyrus, and <lb/>
            I hope that he will attend to his duty; but everything is a <lb/>
            little slow, because of the expectation which is entertained of <lb/>
            a frantic ædileship.2 For the comitia seem likely to take <lb/>
            place without delay; they have been given out for the 22d <lb/>
            of January. However, I would not wish you to be uneasy <lb/>
            about them; every kind of caution shall be practised by us.</p>
          <p>3. A vote of the senate has been passed about the king of <lb/>
            Alexandria,3 that it appears dangerous to. the republic for <lb/>
            him to be restored with a multitude; and when there fol- <lb/>
            lowed a contest in the senate, whether Lentulus'or Pompey <lb/>
            should be appointed to restore him, Lentulus appeared to <lb/>
            have the majority. In this transaction I satisfied my sense <lb/>
            of obligation to Lentulus to admiration, and -that of good- <note type="footnote">1 Quintus was in Sardinia, as one of Pompey's commissioners to <lb/>
            procure corn for the city. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Clodius was standing for the ædileship. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This was Ptolemy Auletes, who was now at Rome, and who had <lb/>
            procured a vote to be passed that he should be restored to his king- <lb/>
            dom. The vote that he should not be restored with a multitude, waa <lb/>
            caused by a verse which Caius Cato, a tribune, professed to have <lb/>
            found in the Sibylline verses, and which he interpreted to mean that <lb/>
            an army ought not to be employed in the matter; while one of the <lb/>
            reasons which made so many desirous of the appointment to rest on <lb/>
            him, was, that it would furnish a pretext for levying an army. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            will to Pompey with honour. But, by those who wished to <lb/>
            disparage Lentulus, the matter was protracted by means of <lb/>
            false accusations. The days of the comitia followed, during <lb/>
            which a senate could not be held. What will be the result of <lb/>
            the bandit-like conduct of the tribunes, I cannot conceive; <lb/>
            but still I suspect that Caninius will carry his motion by <lb/>
            force. What Pompey's wishes in that matter are, I do not <lb/>
            clearly see; but every one discerns what his friends want: <lb/>
            and the creditors of the king, without any disguise, furnish <lb/>
            money to be used against Lentulus. Beyond all doubt, the <lb/>
            matter now appears to be out of the reach of Lentulus, to <lb/>
            my great sorrow, although he has done many things for <lb/>
            which, if it were proper, we might fairly feel angry with him.</p>
          <p>4. I should wish you, if it is convenient, as soon as the <lb/>
            weather is fine and settled, to embark on board ship, and <lb/>
            come to me; for there are great numbers of things in which <lb/>
            I want you daily in every way. Your family and mine are <lb/>
            well. 19th January.</p>

          <p>1. I WROTE to you already what happened before; learn <lb/>
            now what took place afterwards. The business of embassies <lb/>
            was postponed from the 1st of February to the 13th. On <lb/>
            that day the matter was not settled. On the 2d of February, <lb/>
            Milo was present; and Pompey came to give him his counte- <lb/>
            nance. Marcellus spoke, being asked by me. We came off <lb/>
            very respectably. The day of trial was put off to the 6th of <lb/>
            February. In the meantime, as the business of the embas- <lb/>
            sies was postponed till the 13th, a motion was made about <lb/>
            the provinces of the quaestors, and about some compliments <lb/>
            to be paid to the prætors; but, from the introduction of <lb/>
            frequent complaints about the general state of affairs, no <lb/>
            business was transacted. Caius Cato proposed a law to take <lb/>
            away his command from Lentulus. His son changed his dress.</p>
          <p>2. On the 6th of February Milo appeared; Pompey spoke, <lb/>
            or rather, intended to speak; for as soon as he was on his <lb/>
            legs, the mob in Clodius's pay raised a disturbance, which <lb/>
            lasted throughout his whole speech; and in such a manner <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            that he was hindered from being heard, not merely by the <lb/>
            noise, but by reproaches and abuse. When he had summed <lb/>
            up what he had been saying, (for in that matter he behaved <lb/>
            with courage enough; he was not deterred from proceeding; <lb/>
            he said all that he meant to say; and, indeed, there were <lb/>
            moments when he was heard in silence; and he continued <lb/>
            to the end with great authority; but when he had summed <lb/>
            up,) up rose Clodius, when such a shout was raised against <lb/>
            him by our party, for we determined to pay him off, that <lb/>
            he was master neither of his senses, nor of his expressions, <lb/>
            nor of his countenance. This scene was continued till two <lb/>
            o'clock, Pompey having scarcely finished his peroration at <lb/>
            twelve, while every sort of abuse, and even the most obscene <lb/>
            verses, were uttered in the way of attack upon Clodius and <lb/>
            Clodia. He, furious with passion, and pale with terror, amid <lb/>
            the uproar, addressed questions to his mob: “Who was <lb/>
            it that was killing the people with famine The mob <lb/>
            replied, " Pompey." " Who was it that wanted to go to <lb/>
            Alexandria?" They replied again, "Pompey." "Whom did <lb/>
            they wish to go 1" They answered, " Crassus." And he, on <lb/>
            this occasion, was present with Milo; but with a disposition <lb/>
            far from friendly. At about three o'clock, as if a signal had <lb/>
            been given, Clodius's mob began to spit upon our party. <lb/>
            Indignation rose to a great height; they began to press on in <lb/>
            order to drive us from our seats. A rush was made upon <lb/>
            them by our party; and a flight of the mob took place. <lb/>
            Clodius was driven from the rostrum, and we too then fled, <lb/>
            lest we should meet with any accident in the confusion. The <lb/>
            senate was summoned to the senate-house; Pompey went <lb/>
            home. Nor did I indeed attend the senate, that I might neither <lb/>
            be silent on matters of such importance, nor offend the feelings <lb/>
            of the well-affected citizens, by defending Pompey; for he <lb/>
            was attacked by Bibulus, and Curio, and Favonius, and the <lb/>
            younger Servilius. The matter was put off till the next day. <lb/>
            Clodius deferrred the day of impeachment to the Quirinalia.</p>
          <p>3. On the 9th of February, the senate met in the temple <lb/>
            of Apollo, in order that Pompey might be present. The <lb/>
            matter was handled by him with great gravity. On that day <lb/>
            nothing was done. On the 10th of February, a decree of <lb/>
            senate was made in the temple of Apollo, " That what had <lb/>
            been done on the 6th of February had been contrary to the <lb/>
            interests of the republic." On that day Cato inveighed <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            against Pompey with great vehemence ; and throughout his <lb/>
            whole speech accused him as if he had been upon his trial. <lb/>
            Of' me, much against my will he said a great deal; extolling <lb/>
            me very highly; and when he exposed Pompey's treachery <lb/>
            towards me, he was listened to with profound silence by the <lb/>
            disaffected. Pompey replied to him with great energy, and <lb/>
            gave a character of Crassus, and said in plain words, that he <lb/>
            would be better prepared to defend his life than Africanus <lb/>
            had been, whom Caius Carbo had killed.</p>
          <p>4. Thus great matters appeared to me to be in agitation; for <lb/>
            Pompey understands these things, and communicates them <lb/>
            to me, being well aware that plots are formed against his life; <lb/>
            that Caius Cato is supported by Crassus, that money is fur- <lb/>
            nished to Clodius, and that both of them are encouraged by <lb/>
            him, by Curio, and Bibulus, and the rest of those who are <lb/>
            always disparaging him; and that he has to take the most <lb/>
            diligent care not to be overwhelmed, while the populace which <lb/>
            attends all the assemblies is almost entirely alienated from <lb/>
            him; while the nobility is hostile to him, the senate un- <lb/>
            favourable, and the youth of the city corrupted. He is, <lb/>
            therefore, preparing himself, and sending for people from the <lb/>
            country. And Clodius is strengthening his mob of artisans. <lb/>
            A strong force is being prepared for the Quirinalia, and in <lb/>
            that respect we are much superior to the number of Pompey's <lb/>
            adherents. But a great body of men is also expected from <lb/>
            Picenum and Gaul, that we may also resist Cato's motion <lb/>
            about Milo and Lentulus.</p>
          <p>5. On the 10th of February, Sestius was impeached under <lb/>
            the Pupinian law by Cuæus Nerius the informer, on a charge <lb/>
            of corruption, and on the same day by a certain Marcus <lb/>
            Tullius for violence. He was sick. Immediately, as it was <lb/>
            our duty to do, we went to see him at his house, and pro- <lb/>
            mised our entire energies to his service; and we did this con- <lb/>
            trary to the general expectation, (as men thought that we <lb/>
            were with reason offended with him,) in order to appear both <lb/>
            to him and to all men to be of a most humane and grateful <lb/>
            disposition. And so we shall continue to do.</p>
          <p>But this same informer, Nerius, added to the number <lb/>
            of those whom he affirmed to be his accomplices, Cnæus <lb/>
            Lentulus Vaccias, and Caius Cornelius. On the same day, a <lb/>
            vote of the senate was passed, that all the different com- <lb/>
            panies, and those who belonged to the different decuriæ, <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            should depart; and that a law should be enacted respecting <lb/>
            them, to the effect, that those who should not depart, should <lb/>
            be liable to the punishment which is inflicted for violence.</p>
          <p>6. On the 11th of February I made a speech in defence of <lb/>
            Bestia, who was accused of corruption before Cnæus Domitius <lb/>
            the prætor, in the middle of the forum, in the presence of <lb/>
            a vast crowd of people, and while speaking, I happened to <lb/>
            touch upon that occasion when Sestius, after receiving many <lb/>
            wounds in the temple of Castor, was saved by the assistance <lb/>
            of Bestia. Here I very seasonably made the best of those <lb/>
            things which were imputed to Sestius as crimes, and I extolled <lb/>
            him with well-deserved praises, with the great approbation of <lb/>
            all men. The affair was exceedingly grateful to the man. <lb/>
            And I mention this to you now, because in your letters you <lb/>
            have often given me a hint on keeping well with Sestius.</p>
          <p>7. On the 12th of February I wrote this letter before <lb/>
            daybreak; on that day I was going to sup with Pomponius <lb/>
            on the occasion of his marriage. Everything else in our <lb/>
            affairs of this nature is, as you described to me, though I <lb/>
            could hardly believe you, full of dignity and influence, which <lb/>
            have been restored both to you and to me, my brother, in <lb/>
            consequence of your prudence, patience, integrity, piety, and <lb/>
            courteousness. The house of Licinius at the grove of Pis: <lb/>
            is hired for you; but I hope that within a few months after <lb/>
            the 1st of July, you will move into your own. Those elegant <lb/>
            tenants, the Lamiæ, have hired your house in the Carinæ. I <lb/>
            have never received any letter from you since that which was <lb/>
            dated at Olbia. I want to know what you are doing, and <lb/>
            how you are amusing yourself; and above all things, I want <lb/>
            to see you as soon as possible. Take care to preserve your <lb/>
            health, my brother, and though it is winter, recollect that it <lb/>
            is a Sardinian1 winter. <lb/>

          <p>1. OUR friend Sestius was acquitted on the 14th of March, <lb/>
            and ho was acquitted unanimously; a point which was o <note type="footnote"> 1 Sardinia had a bad character as an unhealthy island. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            very great importance to the republic, that there should <lb/>
            appear to be no difference of opinion in a cause of that kind. <lb/>
            As to that other object too, which I knew was often a cause <lb/>
            of anxiety to you, namely, that we should give no oppor- <lb/>
            tunity to any ill-disposed person to censure us, (who might <lb/>
            say that we were ungrateful if we did not bear with that <lb/>
            man's perverseness in some particulars as patiently as pos- <lb/>
            sible,) you may be assured that we completely attained it in <lb/>
            that trial, so that I was considered to have displayed the <lb/>
            greatest possible sense of gratitude; for in defending the <lb/>
            ill-tempered man I abundantly satisfied him; and, for my <lb/>
            own gratification, I, as he was above all things desirous <lb/>
            should be done, cut up Vatinius, by whom he was openly <lb/>
            attacked, amid the applause of gods and men. Moreover, <lb/>
            when our friend Paullus was produced as an evidence against <lb/>
            Sestius, he confirmed the statement that he was going <lb/>
            to lay an information against Vatinius, if Macer Licinius <lb/>
            delayed to do so; when Macer rose from the seats occupied <lb/>
            by the friends of Sestius, and declared that he would not fail <lb/>
            to stand by him. Would you know the result? Vatinius, <lb/>
            petulant and audacious as he is, went away in great agitation, <lb/>
            and greatly weakened in his influence.</p>
          <p>2. Your son Quintus, a most excellent boy, is going on <lb/>
            with his education remarkably well; and I have now the more <lb/>
            opportunity of noticing this, as Tyrannic gives him lessons <lb/>
            at my house. The building of both our houses is going on <lb/>
            vigorously. I have provided for the payment of half his <lb/>
            money to your contractor; and I hope that before the winter <lb/>
            we shall be both living together under one roof. Respecting <lb/>
            my daughter Tullia, a girl who is really very much attached <lb/>
            to you, I hope that I have concluded matters with Crassipes.1 <lb/>
            There were two days after the Latin holidays which are <lb/>
            accounted sacred, or else it would have been settled. Latiar2 <lb/>

          <p>1. I HAD written you a letter before, in which it was men- <lb/>
            tioned that my daughter Tullia was betrothed to Crassipes <lb/>
            on the 4th of April; and I gave you also other details of <lb/>
            the affairs of the republic, and of my own private matters. <lb/>
            The following particulars have taken place since :-On the <lb/>
            5th of April, a sum of money, to the amount of more than <lb/>
            three hundred and twenty thousand pounds,1 was voted to <lb/>
            Pompey, by a decree of the senate, to purchase corn for the <lb/>
            city. But on the same day there was a violent discussion <lb/>
            about the lands in Campania, with an uproar in the senate <lb/>
            almost equal to that of an assembly of the people. The <lb/>
            want of money, and the high price of corn, made the dispute <lb/>
            sharper.</p>
          <p>2. I must not omit to mention this either. The Capitoline 2 <lb/>
            college, and the priests of Mercury, have expelled Marcus <lb/>
            Furius Flaccus, a Roman knight, and a most worthless <lb/>
            fellow, from the college, though he was present when they <lb/>
            came to the decision, and threw himself at the feet of every <lb/>
            one of them.</p>

          <p>1. ON the 6th of April I gave the wedding-feast to Cras- <lb/>
            sipes. But at this banquet that excellent boy, your and <note type="footnote"> 1 HSCCCC. Paul Manutius considers that quadringenties centena <lb/>

            £320,000. Let it be observed, however, that with regard to most, or <lb/>
            all,.of the sums of money mentioned in these letters, there is very <lb/>
            great uncertainty. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Capitoline college consisted of men dwelling in the Capitol <lb/>

            instituted for the preservation of the CapitoL See Livy, v. SO. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            my Quintus, was not present, because he had taken some <lb/>
            slight offence; and therefore, two days afterwards, I went to <lb/>
            Quintus, and found him quite candid; and he held a long <lb/>
            conversation with me, full of good feeling, about the quarrels <lb/>
            of our wives. What would you have more? Nothing could <lb/>
            be in better taste than his language. Pomponia, however, <lb/>
            made some complaints of you; but these matters we will <lb/>
            discuss when we meet.</p>
          <p>2. When I left the boy I went into your grounds; the <lb/>
            business was going on with plenty of builders. I urged <lb/>
            Longilius, the contractor, to make haste. He assured me <lb/>
            positively that he was anxious to give us satisfaction. It will <lb/>
            be a very fine house, for a better notion could now be formed <lb/>
            of it than we had conceived from the plan. At the same time, <lb/>
            my house, too, was going on with great speed. That day I <lb/>
            supped with Crassipes; and after supper I went in a litter to <lb/>
            see Pompey at his villa. I had not been able to meet Lucceius, <lb/>
            because he was away, and I was very anxious to see him, <lb/>
            because I was going to leave Rome the next day, and because <lb/>
            he was going to Sardinia. At last I found the man, and begged <lb/>
            him to send you back to us as soon as possible. He said he <lb/>
            would do so immediately. And he was going to set out as <lb/>
            he said on the 11th of April, with the intention of embarking <lb/>
            either at Leghorn or at Pisa.</p>
          <p>3. As soon as he shall have arrived, my brother, do not <lb/>
            let slip the first opportunity for sailing, provided the weather <lb/>
            be favourable. That abundance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιλαφία</foreign>) which you are <lb/>
            in the habit of talking of, I desire sufficiently; that is to say, <lb/>
            so as to receive it willingly if it comes, but not so as now to <lb/>
            hunt for it if it keeps out of my way. I am building in <lb/>
            three places; restoring and embellishing in others; I live <lb/>
            a little more liberally than I used to do. If I had you <lb/>
            with me, I should be forced to give a little play to the <lb/>
            masons; but, as I hope, we shall soon talk these things over <lb/>
            together.</p>
          <p>4. Affairs at Rome, however, arc in the following con <lb/>
            dition:—Lentulus makes a very good consul, his colleague <lb/>
            offering no hindrance; indeed ne is, I repeat, so good, that <lb/>
            I never saw a better. He prevented anything whatever being <lb/>
            done in the days of the comitia; for even the Latin holidays <lb/>
            are renewed; and yet supplications were not wanting.</p><pb n="49"/>
            
          <p>5. In this manner some most pernicious laws are success- <lb/>
            fully resisted, especially those proposed by Cato, whom our <lb/>
            friend Milo has admirably baffled. For that avenger of <lb/>
            gladiators and matadors had bought some matadors from <lb/>
            Cosconius and Pomponius, and never appeared in public <lb/>
            without a troop of them armed. He could not maintain <lb/>
            them, so that he could scarcely keep them about him. Milo <lb/>
            became aware of this; and gave a commission to a man who <lb/>
            was no particular friend of his, to buy the whole establish- <lb/>
            ment from Cato without any suspicion; and as soon as it <lb/>
            was removed from Cato's house, Racilius, who at this moment <lb/>
            is the only real tribune of the people, divulged the whole <lb/>
            matter, and said that those men had been bought for him, <lb/>
            (for so it had been agreed upon,) and stuck up a notice, <lb/>
            that he was going to sell the establishment of gladiators and <lb/>
            matadors belonging to Cato. Much laughter followed this <lb/>
            announcement. So now Lentulus has tired Cato of proposing <lb/>
            new laws, as well as those persons who proposed those mon- <lb/>
            strous enactments with reference to Cæsar, which no one <lb/>
            chose to impede by his veto. For as to what Caninius <lb/>
            intended about Pompey, that has doubtless cooled consider- <lb/>
            ably; since the thing itself is disapproved; and our friend <lb/>
            Pompey is much blamed for his conduct with respect to <lb/>
            Lentulus,1 who had behaved to him in a friendly manner. <lb/>
            And indeed he is not the same person that he used to be; <lb/>
            for he has given no slight offence by his exertions on behalf of <lb/>
            Milo to those most infamous and despicable dregs of the <lb/>
            people that adhere to Clodius; and the well-disposed citizens, <lb/>
            too, want a good deal which they do not find in him, and <lb/>
            blame a good deal which they do.</p>
          <p>In one respect Marcellinus indeed does not satisfy me; <lb/>
            which is this, that he treats him with too much asperity; <lb/>
            although he does this not at all against the will of the senate. <lb/>
            On this account I withdraw with the less reluctance from the <lb/>
            senate-house and from all connexion with public affairs.</p>
          <p>6. With respect to law proceedings, we are much in the <lb/>
            same state that we were; my house is thronged by the <note type="footnote"> 1 Lentulus had been the principal means of the commission to <lb/>
            supply Rome with food being entrusted to Pompey; who, however, <lb/>

            restore Ptolemy to his kingdom. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>

            greatest crowds of people imaginable. One thing has hap- <lb/>
            pened unpleasantly, through the imprudence of Milo, with <lb/>
            respect to Sextus Cœlius, whom I did not wish to be prose- <lb/>
            cuted at this time, or by accusers who wanted influence. He <lb/>
            just wanted three votes of the most worthless men on the <lb/>
            bench; and so the people insist upon it that the man shall <lb/>
            be tried again ; and tried again he must be, for men will not <lb/>
            bear it. And because he was almost convicted while pleading <lb/>
            his cause before his own friends, they look upon him as vir- <lb/>
            tually convicted. In that matter also the unpopularity of <lb/>
            Pompey was a hindrance to us : for the votes of the senators <lb/>
            acquitted him by a majority; those of the knights were <lb/>
            equally balanced; those of the tribunes of the treasury con- <lb/>
            demned him. But the daily convictions of some or other <lb/>
            of my enemies console me for this disappointment, among <lb/>
            whom Servius had a very narrow escape, to my great joy. <lb/>
            the rest are entirely crushed. Caius Cato made a speech, to <lb/>
            the effect that he would not permit the comitia to be held <lb/>
            if the days for doing business were taken away from the <lb/>
            people. Appius had not yet returned from Cæsar.</p>
          <p>7. I am amazingly anxious for a letter from you. And I <lb/>
            am aware that till this time the sea has been impassable; <lb/>
            but still people said that some persons had come from Ostia, <lb/>
            who extolled you in an extraordinary degree; and said that <lb/>
            you were very highly esteemed in the province. They added, <lb/>
            that the same persons brought word, that you intended to <lb/>
            cross at the first opportunity for sailing. I hope you will: <lb/>
            but although I am most desirous of all to see yourself, still <lb/>
            I hope for a letter from you first. My brother, farewell.</p>

          <p>1. 0 LETTER of yours, most acceptable to me, long ex- <lb/>
            pected, at first indeed with eager desire, but now even with <lb/>
            some apprehension. Know, too, that this is the only letter <lb/>
            which I have received since that which your sailor brought <lb/>
            me, and dated from Olbia. But let everything else, as you <lb/>
            say in your letter, be reserved till we can talk it over toge- <lb/>
            ther. Yet this one thing I cannot forbear to mention. On <lb/>
            the 15th of May the senate, being very crowded, was most <lb/>
            admirably disposed, as it showed by refusing a supplication in <lb/>
            honour of Gabinius.2 Racilius swears that such a thing never <lb/>
            happened to any one before. It is very well received out- <lb/>
            of-doors. To me it is agreeable on its own account, and more <lb/>
            agreeable, because the decision was made in my absence, (for <lb/>
            it expresses the real sentiments of the senate,) and without <lb/>
            any opposition or influence of mine. I was at Antium at <lb/>
            the time.</p>
          <p>2. As to what was said, namely, that there would be a dis- <lb/>
            cussion, on the fifteenth and the day after, on the subject of <lb/>
            the lands in Campania, there was no discussion. What I <lb/>
            myself should say on the subject, I am in doubt; but I shall <lb/>
            probably say more than I had intended, for he will be present. <lb/>
            Farewell, my most excellent and most wished-for brother, and <lb/>
            hasten to me. Our children make you the same request; <lb/>
            begging you to be sure to mind this, that you will sup hero <lb/>

          <p>Thin letter was written the year after those preceding, in the consul <lb/>
            ship of Pompey and Crassus; both for the second time. Then <lb/>
            election had been carried against the senate by the most open vio- <lb/>

          <p>1. I HAD a suspicion that my book would please you; that <lb/>
            it has pleased you so much as you write that it has, I am <lb/>
            greatly delighted. As to what you remind me about our <lb/>
            Urania, and advise me to remember the speech of Jupiter, <lb/>
            which is at the end of that book, I remember it well enough, <lb/>
            and have written all those things more to please myself than <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>2. But still, the day after you went, I went, late at night <lb/>
            with Vibullius to call upon Pompey; and when I had talked <lb/>
            to him about these works and inscriptions, he answered me <lb/>
            with exceeding kindness, and gave me great hopes. He said <lb/>
            that he should like to talk with Crassus, and advised me to <lb/>
            do the same. I attended Crassus as consul home from the <lb/>
            senate; he undertook the business, and said that there was <lb/>
            a point which Clodius, at this moment, was very desirous to <lb/>
            carry by means of his and Pompey's assistance; and that <lb/>
            he thought, if I threw no obstacle in his way, that I might <lb/>
            obtain what I wished without any struggle. I entrusted the <lb/>
            whole affair to him, and said that I would leave myself <lb/>
            entirely in his hands. Publius Crassus was present at this <lb/>
            conversation; a young man, as you are aware, devotedly <lb/>
            attached to me. Now, what Clodius wants is some embassy; <lb/>
            and if he cannot obtain it from the senate, he would have <lb/>
            .it by means of the people; a free embassy1 to Bvzantium, or <note type="footnote">1 The Latin is legatio libera. "During the latter period of the republic <lb/>
            it had become customary for senators to obtain from the senate permis- <lb/>
            sion to travel through or stay in any province, at the expense of the pro- <lb/>
            vincials, merely for the purpose of managing and conducting their own <lb/>
            personal affairs. There was no restraint as to the length of time the sena- <lb/>
            tors were allowed to avail themselves of this privilege, which was a heavy <lb/>
            burden on the provincials. This mode of sojourning in a province was <lb/>
            called legatio libera, because those who availed themselves of it enjoyed </note> <lb/>

            to Brogitarus, or to both. It is a means for making a great <lb/>
            deal of money. I shall not give myself much trouble on <lb/>
            the subject, even though I do not obtain what I want myself. <lb/>
            However, Pompey talked the matter over with Crassus; and <lb/>
            they seem to have undertaken the business. If they do so, <lb/>
            well; if not, then we will return to our Jupiter.1</p>
          <p>3. On the 13th of May, a decree of the senate was <lb/>
            passed on the subject of corruption, in accordance-with the <lb/>
            opinion of Afranius, on which I spoke when you were pre- <lb/>
            sent; but with great indignation on the part of the senate. <lb/>
            The consuls did not follow up their opinions; and when <lb/>
            they had expressed their assent to Afranius's proposal, they <lb/>
            added a wish that the prætors should be created in such a <lb/>
            manner as to leave them private individuals for sixty days. <lb/>
            On that day they plainly repudiated Cato. In short, they are <lb/>
            absolute masters of everything, and they wish every one to be <lb/>
            aware that that is the case.</p>

          <p>1. You are afraid of interrupting me. In the first place, <lb/>
            if I were as much occupied as you fancy, you know what <lb/>
            alone can be properly called interruption. Does Ateius ever <lb/>
            interrupt you? In truth, you seemed to me to teach me a <lb/>
            degree of politeness on that head which I certainly never <lb/>
            practise towards you. I would wish you to summon me, and <lb/>
            interrupt me, and put in your word, and converse with me; <lb/>
            for what can be more agreeable to me ? Upon my word, no <lb/>
            Muse-stricken poetaster more gladly reads his last poem than <lb/>
            I listen to you on every subject, public or private, rural or <lb/>
            civil. But it happened through my own stupid shamefaced- <lb/>
            ness, that when I was going away, I did not take you with <note type="footnote"> all the privileges of a public ambassador, without having any of his <lb/>
            duties to perform. In Cicero's time this practice was greatly abused; <lb/>
            and in his consulship he endeavoured to put an end to it, but only <lb/>
            succeeded in limiting its duration to one year. And Cæsar afterwards <lb/>
            extended the time again to five years, which enactment lasted lown ta <lb/>
            very late period."—Smith, Diet. Ant. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It is not known what this book was. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            ..te. On one occasion, you opposed to my wishes an excuse <lb/>
            which there was no gainsaying-the delicate health of our <lb/>
            dear Cicero: I had nothing to say. A second time you <lb/>
            urged the Ciceros: again I ceased to press you.</p>
          <p>2. But now this letter of yours, so full of agreeableness, <lb/>
            has caused me this trifle of annoyance, that you seem to me <lb/>
            to have feared, and still to fear, lest you should be trouble- <lb/>
            some to me. I could quarrel with you, if it were allowable; <lb/>
            but in truth, if I ever suspect anything of the sort, I will <lb/>
            say nothing further, but that I shall be afraid lest I should <lb/>
            ever be troublesome to you, when I am with you. I see <lb/>
            that you groan. This is the case- <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δ' ἐν αϊᾳ ἒζησας</foreign> :1 <lb/>
            for I will never say, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒα πάσας</foreign>. <lb/>
            And I would, indeed, have forced my friend Marius into the <lb/>
            litter with me; not that Anician one of king Ptolemy. For <lb/>
            I recollect when I was taking the man to Baiæ from Naples, <lb/>
            in the litter given by the king to Anicius, which was borne <lb/>
            by eight men, with a hundred guards following us, we were <lb/>
            laughing exceedingly, when he, not aware of the escort which <lb/>
            was accompanying him, suddenly opened the litter, and <lb/>
            almost fell to the ground with fear, while I did the same with <lb/>
            laughing. On that occasion, I say, I should certainly have <lb/>
            taken him with me, so as at last to enjoy some of the subtlety <lb/>
            of his antique wit, and most agreeable conversation ; but I <lb/>
            did not like to invite a man in a weak state of health, and <lb/>
            who is not even now very strong, to a villa which was hardly <lb/>
            covered in.</p>
          <p>3. But this indeed will be a peculiar pleasure to me, to <lb/>
            enjoy his society here too: for you must know that the light <lb/>
            of Marius is in the neighbourhood of those farms of mine; <lb/>
            we shall see at Anicius's house in what state of forwardness <lb/>
            his affairs are. For as for ourselves, we are so desirous to <lb/>
            acquire information of any sort, that we can even endure <lb/>
            living among masons. We have this philosophy, not from <lb/>
            Hymettus, but from the Syrian school. Marius is weak <lb/>
            both in health and by nature. <note type="footnote"> 1 It ia not known whence these quotations come, or to what Cicero <lb/>
            alludes in them. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I.e., says Manutius, Marius, who is as welcome as the light. </note> <pb n="55"/>
            </p>
          <p>4. In regard of your interruptions, I will take smuch <lb/>
            time from your visit, for the purpose of writing, as you will <lb/>
            give me. I wish you would give me none, so that I may <lb/>
            be idle rather from your ill-treatment, than from my own <lb/>
            indolence. I am sorry that you are so anxious about the <lb/>
            commonwealth, and that you are a better citizen than Phi- <lb/>
            loctetes, who, after he had received an injury, sought those <lb/>
            sort of spectacles which I see are disagreeable to you. I <lb/>
            entreat you hasten to me; I will comfort you, and wipe <lb/>
            away all your sorrow. And, if you love me, bring Marius <lb/>
            with you; but come quickly. I have a garden at home.</p>

          <p>This letter was written in the year 700 A.U.C., in the consulship of <lb/>
            Domitius and Appius Pulcher. In the preceding year, Cicero had <lb/>
            done his best to ingratiate himself with Pompey, who had paid him <lb/>
            a visit: and after Crassus had departed for his province of Syria, he <lb/>
            studied also to gain his good-will; but he applied himself at this <lb/>
            time more to philosophy than to politics. Quintus went this year <lb/>
            into Gaul as one of Cæsar's lieutenants.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Marcus Cicero to his brother Quintus, greeting.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. YOUR little notes have wrung this letter from me by <lb/>
            their reproaches; for the circumstance itself, and the day in <lb/>
            which you set out, gave me no subject for writing; but as, <lb/>
            when we are together, conversation is not wont to fail us, so <lb/>
            too our letters ought at times to have something sparkling <lb/>
            in them.</p>
          <p>2. The liberty of the Tenedians,1 therefore, has been cut <lb/>
            down with a Tenedian axe, as no one, except Bibulus, and <lb/>
            Calidius, and Favonius, and me, was found to defend them.</p>
          <p>3. Mention has been made of you by the Magnesians of <lb/>
            Sipylus, the more honourable as they said that you were <lb/>
            the only person who resisted the demands of Lucius Sextius <lb/>
            Pansa. <note type="footnote"> I The people of Tenedos had petitioned to be allowed to live under <lb/>
            their own laws. The expression, " a Tenedian axe," is said to refer to <lb/>
            a story of their ancient king Tennes, who gave his name to the island; <lb/>
            and one of whose laws was, that if any one detected an adulterer in <lb/>
            the fact, he was to be slain with an axe. </note> <pb n="56"/>
            </p>
          <p>4. For the rest of the time, if there should be anything <lb/>
            which it is desirable for you to know, or even if there is <lb/>
            nothing of the sort, still I will write something every day. <lb/>
            On the 12th of April I will not be wanting either to you or <lb/>
            to Pompon ius.</p>
          <p>5. The poems of Lucretius are just what you describe them; <lb/>
            remarkable for no great brilliancy of genius, but for a great <lb/>
            deal of art. But when you come, I shall think you a man <lb/>
            indeed, if you can read the Empedoclea of Sallust; an <lb/>
            ordinary man I shall not think you. Farewell.</p>

          <p>1. I AM glad that my letters are acceptable to you, and yet <lb/>
            I should not even now have had any subject for writing <lb/>
            upon, if I had not received yours; for, on the 14th, when <lb/>
            Appius had assembled the senate, which met in very scanty <lb/>
            numbers, it was so bitterly cold that he was compelled by <lb/>
            the grumbling of the people to dismiss us.</p>
          <p>2. About the king of Commagene, Appius, both in his own <lb/>
            letters to me, and by the mouth of Pomponius, caresses me <lb/>
            wonderfully for having frustrated the whole affair; for he sees <lb/>
            that if I adhere to this kind of speaking on other matters, <lb/>
            February will be quite barren; and I touched him off in <lb/>
            a tolerably sportive humour, and wrung from him not only <lb/>
            that little town which was situated on the Euphrates at <lb/>
            Zeugma, but ridiculed his prætexta gown which he had re- <lb/>
            ceived in the consulship of Cæsar, with much laughter from <lb/>
            everybody.</p>
          <p>3. As to his not wishing, said I, to renew the same honours, <lb/>
            so as not to have to furbish up his prætexta every year, I <lb/>
            do not think we need come to any vote on that point: 1 but <lb/>
            you, nobles, who could not bear a man from Bostra wearing <lb/>
            the prætexta, will you endure one from Commagene ? You <lb/>
            see the kind, and the topics, of my jokes. I said a great <note type="footnote">1 Manutius confesses that he is not at all aware what is meant or <lb/>
            referred to here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            deal against an ignoble king, and at the end he was com- <lb/>
            pletely hissed out. With this sort of speech, Appius, as I <lb/>
            said, being delighted, is entirely devoted to me; for nothing <lb/>
            can be more easy than to get rid of all the rest of the <lb/>
            business. But I will do nothing to offend him, lest he im- <lb/>
            plore the protection of Jupiter Hospitalis; and call together <lb/>
            all the Greeks by whose intervention I have been reconciled <lb/>
            to him.</p>
          <p>4. We will give satisfaction to Theopompus. About Cæsar <lb/>
            it had escaped me to write to you, for I see what a letter you <lb/>
            expected; but he wrote to Balbus, that that bundle of letters, <lb/>
            in which mine and Balbus's were, was brought to him soaked <lb/>
            through and through with water, so that he did not even <lb/>
            know that there had been any letter at all from me. But of <lb/>
            the letter of Balbus, he had been able to make out a few <lb/>
            words; to which he replied in these terms:—I see that you <lb/>
            have said something about Cicero which I have not been able <lb/>
            to make out; but as far as I could guess, it was something of <lb/>
            this kind, that I should think him rather to be wished for <lb/>
            than hoped for.</p>
          <p>5. I, therefore, subsequently sent Cæsar another copy of <lb/>
            that letter; do not you overlook his jest about his difficulties. <lb/>
            And I wrote him word also in reply, that there was nothing <lb/>
            that he would be able to throw into disorder from relying <lb/>
            on my strong-box: and in this way I jested with him fami- <lb/>
            liarly, and at the same time with a proper dignity. His <lb/>
            exceeding good-will towards me is communicated by mes- <lb/>
            sengers from all quarters. Letters, indeed, referring to what <lb/>
            you expect, will very nearly coincide with your return. The <lb/>
            other events of each day I will write to you, that is to say, <lb/>
            if you'will provide couriers. Although, such terrible cold has <lb/>
            prevailed, that there was very great danger of Appius's house <lb/>
            being burnt down.1 Farewell. <note type="footnote"> I From his trying to warm it with a stove. </note> <pb n="58"/>

          <p>1. I LAUGHED at the black snow; 1 and I am very glad that <lb/>
            you are in a cheerful humour, and so well inclined to jest. <lb/>
            About Pompey I agree with you; or rather you agree with <lb/>
            me. For as you know, I have been for a long time talking <lb/>
            of nothing but Cæsar.2 Believe me, I have taken him to <lb/>
            my heart, nor am I to be torn from him.</p>
          <p>2. Now you must learn what was done at the Ides. The <lb/>
            tenth day was fixed for the impeachment of Cœlius; and <lb/>
            Domitius had not collected judges in sufficient number. I <lb/>
            am afraid lest that rude and brutal man, Servius Pola, may <lb/>
            come to the accusation; for our friend Cœlius is violently <lb/>
            attacked by the whole train of Clodius's friends. There is <lb/>
            as yet nothing certain; but we are kept in a state of alarm. <lb/>
            On the same day a very full senate assembled to hear the <lb/>
            ambassadors of the Tyrians:4 on the other side, the Syrian <lb/>
            farmers of the revenue mustered in great numbers; Gabinius <lb/>
            was violently attacked; however, the farmers were roughly <lb/>
            handled by Domitius, for having escorted him on horseback. <lb/>
            Our friend Caius Lamia spoke somewhat boldly, when Domi- <lb/>
            tius had said, " It is through your fault, Roman knights, that <lb/>
            these things have happened, because you are such profligate <lb/>
            judges." He replied: "We judge; you praise." Nothing <lb/>
            was done that day, and night put an end to the discussion.</p>
          <p>3. On the days appointed for holding the comitia, which <lb/>
            come immediately after the Quirinalia, Appius explains his <lb/>
            notion that he is not prevented by the Pupian law from <lb/>
            holding a senate, and that on the contrary, it is especially <lb/>
            provided by the Gabinian law, that the senate is obliged to <note type="footnote">1 This has some reference to a ridiculous doctrine of Anaxagoras, <lb/>

            think that the comitia may be put off till the month of <lb/>
            March. But on these days of the comitia the tribunes of <lb/>
            the people declare that they will bring on the question <lb/>
            about Gabinius. I collect all reports, to have some news to <lb/>
            send to you; but, as you see, matter itself fails me.</p>
          <p>4. I return, therefore, to Callisthenes1 and Philistus,2 in <lb/>
            whose works I see you are occupied. Callisthenes indeed is <lb/>
            relating a common and well-known set of transactions, in a <lb/>
            style such as that in which several of the Greeks express <lb/>
            themselves. But the Sicilian is an admirable writer, impres- <lb/>
            sive, acute, concise; almost a little Thucydides, but which of <lb/>
            his books you have, (for there are two volumes of them,) <lb/>
            or whether you have them both, I know not. He pleases me <lb/>
            most in his account of Dionysius. For Dionysius was a <lb/>
            great intriguer, and made himself very familiar with Philistus. <lb/>
            But as to what you add in your letter, are you thinking of <lb/>
            undertaking a history? In my judgment, you may do so. <lb/>
            And since you furnish couriers, you shall have at the Luper- <lb/>
            calia an account of what is done to-day. Amuse yourself <lb/>
            with my Cicero as well as you can.</p>

          <p>1. I HAVE as yet received but two letters from you: one <lb/>
            of them written just after I had left you; the other dated <lb/>
            from Ariminum. The additional ones, which you say that <lb/>
            you sent, I never received. I have been amusing myself <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood of Cumæ and Pompeii, pleasantly <lb/>
            enough, except that I was without your company; and <lb/>
            I intended to stay in those parts till the 1st of June. I <lb/>
            was writing those political treatises which I had mentioned <lb/>
            to you; a very large and laborious work; but still, if the <lb/>
            result is to my satisfaction, labour will have been well em- <lb/>
            ployed; if not, I will throw it into the sea, which I have <note type="footnote"> 1 Callisthenes was an Olynthian, and had written a life of Alexander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Philistus was a Sicilian, and wrote many books, and among them <lb/>
            an account of Dionysius the elder. </note> <lb/>

            before my eyes while I am writing. I shall attempt some <lb/>
            other things, too, since I cannot remain idle.</p>
          <p>2. I will attend carefully to your injunctions, both as to <lb/>
            conciliating some men, and avoiding to alienate others. But <lb/>
            it will be my chief object to see your Cicero, and mine, I <lb/>
            mean, every day; but I will examine as often as I can, what <lb/>
            he is learning; and, unless he is above it, I will even offer <lb/>
            myself as his teacher; an employment in which I have <lb/>
            obtained some practice in my leisure during these few days, <lb/>
            by training my own Cicero the younger.</p>
          <p>3. You, (as you write me word you will, and as I should <lb/>
            be quite certain of your doing most carefully, even if you <lb/>
            did not write;) you, I say, will take care to digest my <lb/>
            instructions; follow them up, and fulfil them. When I come <lb/>
            to Rome I will never let one single courier of Cæsar's go <lb/>
            without giving him a letter for you; but while I have been <lb/>
            here (you will excuse my silence), there has been no one to <lb/>
            whom I could give one before this Marcus Orfius, a Roman <lb/>
            knight, attached to me, both as being exceedingly intimate <lb/>
            with me, and as being from the municipality of Atella, which <lb/>
            you know is faithful to me. I therefore recommend him to <lb/>
            you in an extraordinary degree, as being a man of a high <lb/>
            consideration at home, and of great influence away from <lb/>
            home. Take care to bind him to yourself by your libe- <lb/>
            rality. He is a military tribune in our army. You will <lb/>
            find him a man of a very grateful disposition, and eager to <lb/>
            be of service to you. I press upon you earnestly to be very <lb/>
            civil to Trebatius. Farewell.</p>

          <p>1. ON the 2d of June, the day on which I arrived at <lb/>
            Rome, I received your letter dated from Placentia ; and then, <lb/>
            the next day, I received a second dated at Blandeus,1 with <lb/>
            a letter from Cæsar, full of expressions of respect, zeal to <lb/>
            serve me, and courtesy. These are things of great, or rather <lb/>
            of the very greatest consequence; for they contribute very <note type="footnote">1 There is some error in the text here </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            greatly to our reputation and high dignity. But, believe me, <lb/>
            whom you know well, that what I value most in all these <lb/>
            matters I have already secured; namely, that, in the first <lb/>
            place, I see you contributing so much to our common dig- <lb/>
            nity; secondly, the extraordinary liking of Julius Cæsar for <lb/>
            me, a man whom I prefer to all the honours which he wishes <lb/>
            me to expect from him. His letter was dated at the same <lb/>
            time with your own; the beginning of it is, how acceptable <lb/>
            your arrival was to him, and his recollection of our old <lb/>
            friendship; then assuring me that he would take care that in <lb/>
            the midst of my sorrow and regret for your absence, while <lb/>
            you are away, I should be pleased, above all, that you were <lb/>
            with him. The letter delighted me amazingly.</p>
          <p>2. You, therefore, act in a most brotherly spirit when you <lb/>
            exhort me, though in truth I am running of my own accord <lb/>
            the same way, to devote all my energies to his single service; <lb/>
            and perhaps by my eager zeal I shall do what often happens <lb/>
            to travellers when they are in haste, that if by chance they <lb/>
            have got up later than they intended, they still, by making <lb/>
            haste, arrive where they wish earlier than they would have <lb/>
            done if they had lain awake a great part of the night; and <lb/>
            so now I, since I have been asleep a long time as to paying <lb/>
            attention to that man, though you in truth have often tried <lb/>
            to wake me, shall now by my speed make amends for my <lb/>
            slowness, both on horseback, and (since you write me word <lb/>
            that ray poem is approved by him) in the coach and four of <lb/>
            poetry; only give me Britain to paint with your colours <lb/>
            and my pencil. But of what am I thinking? what spare <lb/>
            time presents itself to me, particularly while I remain at <lb/>
            Rome, as he begs me to do ? However, I will see. For <lb/>
            perhaps, as is often the case, my affection for you will over- <lb/>
            come every difficulty. He thanks me with a good deal. of <lb/>
            humour, and with great civility too, fcr having sent him <lb/>
            Trebatius; for he says that in all that number of persons <lb/>
            who were with him, there was not one who could draw a <lb/>
            bail-bond. I asked him for the tribuneship for Marcus <lb/>
            Curtius, (for Domitius would have thought that he was being <lb/>
            turned into ridicule if he had been solicited by me, since it <lb/>
            is a daily saying of his, that he cannot make even a tribune <lb/>
            of the soldiers; and even in the senate he rallied Appius his <lb/>
            colleague, saying that he had gone to Cæsar, with the view of <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            getting some tribuneship or other,) but only for the year <lb/>
            after next. And that was what Curtius wished too.</p>
          <p>3. Know that, as you think it behoves you to be, in regard <lb/>
            to public affairs and our private enmities, so I myself both <lb/>
            am, and shall be, of a very gentle and moderate demeanour.</p>
          <p>4. Affairs at Rome were in this state. There was some <lb/>
            expectation of the comitia, but a doubtful one: there was <lb/>
            some suspicion of a dictatorship, but not even that was <lb/>
            certain. There is a perfect cessation of all business in the <lb/>
            courts of law, but more as if the state was growing indolent <lb/>
            from age than from real tranquillity. Our own opinion deli- <lb/>
            vered in the senate was of such a kind that others agreed <lb/>
            with it more than we did ourselves. <note type="footnote"> Such are the evils of disastrous war.1 </note></p>

          <p>1. WHAT is to be done shall be done with a pen, and the <lb/>
            finest ink, and glazed paper : for you say that you have <lb/>
            hardly been able to read my last letters, for which, however, <lb/>
            my brother, there were none of the reasons which you fancy; <lb/>
            for I was neither busy, nor had I been worried or angry with <lb/>
            any one; but I always make it a practice, whatever pen <lb/>
            comes first to hand, to use it as if it were a good one.</p>
          <p>2. But listen now, my most excellent and kind brother, <lb/>
            while I answer the things which you wrote in this same short <lb/>
            letter of yours in a very business-like manner. As to what <lb/>
            you ask, that I should write to you without concealing any- <lb/>
            thing, or dissembling anything, or saying anything merely <lb/>
            for the sake of pleasing you, but frankly and as a brother, <lb/>
            that is, whether you should hasten, as we said, or, if there <lb/>
            should be sufficient reason, delay, for the purpose of setting <lb/>
            yourself clear,—if, my dear Quintus, it were any unimportant <lb/>
            matter on which you were asking me my wishes, still after <lb/>
            having left it to yourself to do what you thought best, I <lb/>
            should point out what I wished myself. But in the present <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοιαυθ' ὸ τλήμων πλεμος ἐξεράζεται</foreign>. A line from the Supplices <lb/>
            of Euripides. </note> <lb/>

            state of affairs, you ask me plainly what sort of year I expect <lb/>
            the ensuing one to be; certainly one of tranquillity for me, <lb/>
            or at least one of very great security, as the state of my own <lb/>
            house, and my reception in the forum, and the way in which <lb/>
            I am greeted at the theatre, indicate every day. And1 * * * <lb/>
            no man is unwilling to see * * * that I am in favour with <lb/>
            both Cæsar and Pompey-these things give me confidence. <lb/>
            If any rage from that senseless man2 breaks out, everything <lb/>
            is prepared for putting him down.</p>
          <p>3. These are my real sentiments and opinions, and I write <lb/>
            them to you in all plainness. And I beg of you not to fee <lb/>
            a doubt, speaking not like a flatterer, but as a brother; so <lb/>
            that, for the sake of your enjoying the pleasant condition in <lb/>
            which I find myself, I should wish you to come at the time <lb/>
            which you have mentioned. But still I should prefer beyond, <lb/>
            that the events which you expect * * * * And I attach <lb/>
            great consequence to your abundance, and to the expectations <lb/>
            of your obligations being acquitted. Of this you may be <lb/>
            assured, that if we succeed, nothing can be more fortunate <lb/>
            than we shall be when freed from all annoyance. There is <lb/>
            not much which is wanting to make us happy after our own <lb/>
            fashion; and that is very easy to be procured, provided I <lb/>
            keep my health.</p>
          <p>4. An amazing degree of corruption, prevails again; never <lb/>
            was it so great. In the middle of July, interest was double <lb/>
            what it had been, from the coalition into which Memmius <lb/>
            entered with Domitius for the sake of beating Scaurus. <lb/>
            Messala has a bad chance;3 I do not exaggerate, when I say <note type="footnote">1 There is something lost here, which makes this sentence unintel- <lb/>
            ligible ; and it is probable that there is a little corruption in the former <lb/>
            part of the letter, and a few sentences later. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Clodius. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The candidates for the consulship in the next year, 701 A.U.C., <lb/>
            were Memmius, Domitius Calvinus, AEmilius Scaurus, and Valerius <lb/>
            Messala. Memmius and Domitius had won over the existing consuls <lb/>
            by a promise of procuring them whatever provinces they chose; but at <lb/>
            last Pompey persuaded Memmius to break with Domitius, and join the <lb/>
            triumvirs. The senate instituted an inquiry. The year 700 passed <lb/>
            without any election of consuls for the ensuing year. Interest rose to <lb/>
            8 per cent. a-month; and the year 701 opened with an interregnum, <lb/>
            and it was not till half the year had elapsed, that Cnæus Domitius <lb/>
            Calvinus, and Messala, were elected consuls for the remainder of the <lb/>

            that the prerogative century will get above eighty thousand <lb/>
            pounds for its vote. The business is extremely unpopular; <lb/>
            the candidates for the tribuneship have come to an agree- <lb/>
            ment, that every one of them shall place above four thousand <lb/>
            pounds a-piece in Cato's hands, as a pledge to conduct their <lb/>
            canvass as he approves; and those who forfeit their pledge are <lb/>
            to forfeit the money. And if the comitia for their election <lb/>
            is really unbribed, as is expected, Cato alone will have had <lb/>
            more influence than all the laws and all the judges.</p>

          <p>1. WHEN you have received a letter from me written in <lb/>
            the hand of my secretary, you must consider that I had not <lb/>
            even a little leisure; when it is written in my own hand, that <lb/>
            I had a little. For you must understand, that I was never <lb/>
            more distracted by causes and trials, and that too at a most <lb/>
            unhealthy time of the year, and when the heat is greatest. <lb/>
            But this, since that is your advice, must be borne; nor must <lb/>
            I give cause for appearing to have been wanting, either to <lb/>
            your hopes or opinion; especially when, although that is <lb/>
            somewhat more difficult, I am still likely to gain great <lb/>
            influence and great dignity from these exertions; therefore, <lb/>
            as you wish, I take great pains to offend no one, and even <lb/>
            to be loved by those very men who are sorry to see me <lb/>
            so united with Cæsar, and also to be earnestly caressed and <lb/>
            loved by all impartial persons, and even by those who are <lb/>
            inclined to favour the other side.</p>
          <p>2. While there was a most violent discussion in the senate <lb/>
            for many days on the subject of corruption, because the con- <lb/>
            sular candidates had gone such lengths that it could not be <lb/>
            endured any longer, I was not present in the senate. I de- <lb/>
            termined not to come forward to offer any remedy for the <lb/>
            evils of the commonwealth without strong protection.</p>
          <p>3. The day that I wrote this, Drusus had been acquitted <lb/>
            of prevarication1 by the tribunes of the treasury, by four <note type="footnote">' Prevarication was the betrayal of his client's cause by an advocate <lb/>
            wno had undertaken it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            votes in all, after the senators and knights had condemned <lb/>
            him. The same day, in the afternoon, I appeared in court <lb/>
            to defend Vatinius; that was not a difficult task. The <lb/>
            comitia are postponed till the month of September. The trial <lb/>
            of Scaurus will be brought on immediately, and we shall <lb/>
            not be wanting in our exertions on his behalf. I by no <lb/>
            means approved of the Messmates of Sophocles, although I <lb/>
            see that the piece was very neatly acted by you.</p>
          <p>4. Now I come to that, which perhaps ought to have made <lb/>
            the first part of my letter. 0 how delightful to me are your <lb/>
            letters from Britain. I was afraid of the ocean : I was afraid <lb/>
            of the shore of the island. I do not indeed despise the <lb/>
            obstacles which may yet remain, but they present more <lb/>
            ground for hope than for fear, and I am anxious more because <lb/>
            of the eagerness of my expectation than from any alarm. And <lb/>
            I see that you have an admirable subject for writing about. <lb/>
            What a situation you have to describe, what natural cha- <lb/>
            racteristics of circumstances and places, what customs of the <lb/>
            people, what nations and battles, and even what a commander! <lb/>
            I will with all my heart help you, as you ask, in whatever you <lb/>
            wish; and will send you the verses for which you ask, like <lb/>
            an owl to Athens.</p>
          <p>5. But ah! I see that I am kept in the dark by you; for <lb/>
            how, my dear brother, did Caesar express himself about my <lb/>
            verses ? for he wrote me word before, that he had read my first <lb/>
            book, and praised the beginning so much that he says he has <lb/>
            not read anything better even in Greek. What came after, <lb/>
            he thought, was in some places a little <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥαθυμότερα</foreign> (more <lb/>
            careless), this is the very word that he uses. Tell me the <lb/>
            truth, is it the matter, or the style that does not please him 1 <lb/>
            There is no reason why you should fear to tell me the truth. <lb/>
            for I shall not be an atom the less satisfied with myself. <lb/>
            Write to me on this subject with frankness, and, as you <lb/>
            always do, with brotherly affection.</p><pb n="66"/>

          <p>I. 1. AFTER the great heat, (for I do not recollect ever <lb/>
            having felt greater,) I refreshed myself in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Arpinum, with the extreme agreeableness of the river, <lb/>
            during the days of the games, 1 having recommended the <lb/>
            men of my tribe to Philotimus. I was at Arcanum on the <lb/>
            10th of September: there I found Messidius and Philoxenus, <lb/>
            and the water which they had contracted to bring near the <lb/>
            villa flowing pleasantly enough, especially considering the <lb/>
            great general drought; and they said that they would collect <lb/>
            it in somewhat larger quantities. Everything was going on <lb/>
            well with Herus.2 At your Manlian farm I found Diphilus <lb/>
            slower than Diphilus; yet nothing remained for him to do, <lb/>
            except the bath-rooms, the colonnade to walk under, and <lb/>
            the aviary. The villa pleased me exceedingly, because the <lb/>
            paved portico had an appearance of great dignity, which was <lb/>
            now for the first time visible to me, since it is completely <lb/>
            uncovered, and the columns-are polished. Everything now <lb/>
            depends on the ceiling being elegant, which shall be an object <lb/>
            of attention to me. The pavements appeared to me to be <lb/>
            done correctly; some of the rooms I did not quite like, and <lb/>
            ordered them to be altered.,</p>
          <p>2. Where they say that you have written orders for a small <lb/>
            hall to be made in the colonnade, the place pleased me <lb/>
            better as it is; for there did not seem to be room enough even <lb/>
            for a little hall, nor is one usually made, except in houses in <lb/>
            which there is a larger hall; nor could it have any bed- <lb/>
            chambers attached to it, or apartments of that kind. But <lb/>
            now, even from the mere beauty of the vaulted roof, it will <lb/>
            get the character of an excellent summer retreat.3 However, <note type="footnote">1 The Roman games took place in September. </note><note type="footnote">2 The bailiff. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Manutius thinks this quite corrupt and unintelligible. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            if you are of a different opinion, write again at the first <lb/>
            opportunity. In the bath-rooms I have moved forward the <lb/>
            stoves into the other corner of the dressing-room; because <lb/>
            they were before placed in such a manner, that their chimney, <lb/>
            from which the heat comes, was situated under the bed- <lb/>
            chambers. But I greatly approved of having a tolerably <lb/>
            large bed-chamber and a lofty winter-room, because they <lb/>
            were of a good size, and admirably situated on one side of <lb/>
            the covered walk,-on that side, I mean, which is next to the <lb/>
            bath-rooms. Diphilus had not put the pillars upright, nor <lb/>
            opposite to one another; he will accordingly pull them down <lb/>
            again. Some day or other he will learn how to use a perpen- <lb/>
            dicular and a line. Altogether, I hope that Diphilus's work <lb/>
            will be finished in a few months, for Cæsius, who was with <lb/>
            me on that occasion, gives most diligent attention to it.</p>
          <p>II. 3. From that place we went straight along the Vitu- <lb/>
            larian road to your Fufidian farm, which, according to the <lb/>
            last communication, I had bought of Fufidius at Arpinum, <lb/>
            for a little more than eight thousand pounds. I never saw a <lb/>
            place more shady in the summer, with water flowing through <lb/>
            the land in many places, and in great abundance. What <lb/>
            would you have ? Cæsius thought that you would easily be <lb/>
            able to irrigate fifty acres of meadow-land. This, at all events, <lb/>
            which I understand better, I can affirm positively, that you <lb/>
            will have a villa of exceeding pleasantness, with a fish-pond, <lb/>
            and springs of water besides, and a palæstra, and a green <lb/>
            wood. I hear that you wish to retain this farm near Bovillæ; <lb/>
            what you may choose to do about it, you will decide yourself. <lb/>
            Calvus said that though the water was excepted, and the <lb/>
            right over that water reserved, and though a service1 lay upon <lb/>
            the farm, still we could keep up the price if we chose to sell <lb/>
            it. I had Messidius with me : he said that he had agreed <lb/>
            with you at three sestertii2 a foot; and observed that he <lb/>
            himself'had measured the distance, by steps, making fourteen <lb/>
            hundred paces. To me it appeared more; but I will under- <lb/>
            take to say, that the money could nowhere be more advan- <lb/>
            tageously spent. I had sent for Chilo from Venafrum; but <note type="footnote"> Service, servitus, on a piece of land, when there was a right of way <lb/>
            through it, of carrying water through it, of taking water from it, <lb/>
            feeding cattle on it, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The sestertius was equal to 1 penny 31 farthings </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            that very day a subterraneous passage at Venafrum had crushed <lb/>
            four of his fellow-workmen aud apprentices.</p>
          <p>4. On the 13th of September I was at Laterium. I saw <lb/>
            the road, which pleased me so much, that I thought it was <lb/>
            a public work, with the exception of a hundred and fifty <lb/>
            paces; for I measured it from the little bridge, which is close <lb/>
            to the temple of Farina on the side of Satricum. At that <lb/>
            spot, dust has been thrown in and not gravel; but that shall <lb/>
            be altered; and that part of the road is very steep; but I was <lb/>
            told that it could not have been carried in any other direction, <lb/>
            especially as you did not wish to have it go through the farm <lb/>
            of Locusta, or through that of Varro. Varro had almost com- <lb/>
            pleted the roads through his estate before. Locusta had not <lb/>
            touched his; but I shall call upon him at Rome, and, as I <lb/>
            expect, shall move him ; and at the same time I will ask <lb/>
            Mucus Taurus, who is now at Rome, and who, I hear, gave <lb/>
            you a promise on the subject, about carrying the water through <lb/>
            his farm.</p>
          <p>5. I conceived a good opinion of Nicephorus, your bailiff, <lb/>
            and I asked him, whether you had given him any charge <lb/>
            about that little building at Laterium of which you spoke to <lb/>
            me. And then he told me, in reply, that he himself had <lb/>
            contracted for that work for about a hundred and thirty <lb/>
            pounds; but that afterwards you had added a good deal <lb/>
            to the work to be done, but nothing to the money to be paid <lb/>
            for it; and that, therefore, he had given up the contract. I <lb/>
            am in truth exceedingly well-pleased that you should add <lb/>
            those things as you determined; although the villa which <lb/>
            at present exists, seems to be something like philosophy re- <lb/>
            proving the insanity visible in other villas: however, that <lb/>
            addition will give great pleasure.</p>
          <p>I praised, too, your ornamental gardener; he clothes every- <lb/>
            thing so with ivy, not only the foundations of the villa, but <lb/>
            the spaces between the pillars of the covered walk. So that <lb/>
            those figures in the Greek dresses appear to be cutting the <lb/>
            trees into shape, and to be selling the ivy. As for the dressing- <lb/>
            room, nothing can be more cool and mossy.</p>
          <p>6. You have now heard nearly all that I have to say about <lb/>
            country affairs. He and Philotimus and Cincius are press- <lb/>
            ing forward the polishing of your town-house; but I myself <lb/>
            also frequently go to look at it, as is easy to be done; and I <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            therefore hope you will feel relieved from that cause of <lb/>
            Anxiety.</p>
          <p>III. 7. As to what you are always asking me about Cicero, <lb/>
            I pardon you, indeed; but I also wish you to pardon me. For <lb/>
            I will not allow you to love him more than I do myself; <lb/>
            and I wish that he had been with me during those days <lb/>
            in the country near Arpinum, as he himself had desired, <lb/>
            and I no less. As to Pomponia, if it seems good to you, I wish <lb/>
            you would send an order, that when we go anywhere she is <lb/>
            to go with us, and take the boy. I shall raise a perfect <lb/>
            uproar if I can have him with me without his having any- <lb/>
            thing to do ; for at Rome he has no breathing room. You <lb/>
            know that I promised you that before gratuitously: what do <lb/>
            you think now that so great a bribe is offered me from you?</p>
          <p>8. I now come to your letters; of which I received several <lb/>
            while I was in the neighbourhood of Arpinum ; for three <lb/>
            were delivered to me on one day, and indeed, as they seemed, <lb/>
            all written by you at one time. One was at great length, in <lb/>
            which the first statement was, that an earlier day was men- <lb/>
            tioned in your letter than in that of Cæsar. Oppius some- <lb/>
            times does that from necessity; because, after he has arranged <lb/>
            to send off the couriers, and has received a letter from us, he <lb/>
            is hindered by some new business; and of necessity sends it <lb/>
            off later than he had intended to do ; nor do we, when the <lb/>
            letter is once dated, care about the date being altered.</p>
          <p>9. You mention Cæsar's exceeding regard for us : you will <lb/>
            -do your best to cherish this ; we too will increase it by all the <lb/>
            means in our power. With regard to Pompey, I do with all <lb/>
            diligence, and will continue to do, what you advise. That <lb/>
            my permission for you to remain longer is acceptable to you, <lb/>
            though to my own great sorrow and regret, I am yet partly <lb/>
            glad. What your object is in sending for horsebreakers and <lb/>
            others I have no notion• there is not one of that sort of people <lb/>
            who will not expect a present from you equal to a suburban <lb/>
            farm. And as for your mixing up my friend Trebatius with <lb/>
            that fellow, for that you have no foundation. I sent him to <lb/>
            Cæsar, because he had previously satisfied me; if he does not <lb/>
            please him equally, I am not bound to anything, and I acquit <lb/>
            and release you also of any charge in respect of him. With <lb/>
            regard to your statement, that you are every day more and <lb/>
            more esteemed by Cæsar, I am rejoiced beyond all expression. <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            I am also very much attached to Balbus, who is, as you write, <lb/>
            an active assistant in that business; I am very glad too that <lb/>
            my friend Trebonius is beloved by you, and you by him.</p>
          <p>10. As to what you write about the tribuneship, I asked <lb/>
            it for Curtius by name; and Caesar wrote me back word that <lb/>
            it was secured for Curtius, also mentioning him by name; <lb/>
            and he reproached me for my shamefacedness in asking. If <lb/>
            I ever ask for any one again, (as I told Oppius too, that <lb/>
            he might write to him,) I shall easily allow a refusal to be <lb/>
            given me, since those who are troublesome to me do not easily <lb/>
            allow refusals to be given them from me. I love Curtius, (as <lb/>
            I told the man himself,) on account not only of your asking, <lb/>
            but of your testimony in his favour,-because from your <lb/>
            letters I easily perceived his zeal for our safety.</p>
          <p>With respect to the affairs of Britain, I learned from your <lb/>
            letters that there was no reason either why we should fear, <lb/>
            or why we should rejoice. With respect to public affairs, on <lb/>
            which you wish Tiro to write to you, I was already writing to <lb/>
            you rather carelessly myself; because I knew that everything, <lb/>
            as well of the smallest as of the greatest importance, was sent <lb/>
            to Cæsar.</p>
          <p>IV. 11. I have now completed my answer to your longest <lb/>
            letter: hear now as to your little one; in which the first <lb/>
            remark is, about Clodius's letter to Cæsar, in which affair I <lb/>
            approve of Cæsar's conduct, in not granting you leave, though <lb/>
            you asked it in the most affectionate manner, to write a single <lb/>
            word of answer to that Fury. The next observation is about <lb/>
            the speech of Marius Calventius. I marvel at your saying <lb/>
            that you think I should write a reply to it, especially as no <lb/>
            one is likely to read it if I write nothing in reply, while all <lb/>
            the children will learn my answer to him by heart as a lesson.</p>
          <p>I have begun those books of mine which you are looking <lb/>
            for, but am unable to finish them at the present time. I have <lb/>
            completed the required speeches for Scaurus and for Plancius. <lb/>
            The poem to Cæsar, which I had composed, I have destroyed.2 <lb/>
            What you ask, I will write for you, since the springs them- <lb/>
            selves are now thirsty, if I have any room. <note type="footnote"> 1 Noble considers that the text is here incorrect or defective. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Incidi. Ernesti interprets this verb by conscindere ; and Schillet <lb/>
            agrees with him in giving it the sense of "cutting to pieces," of <lb/>
            " annulling." </note> <pb n="71"/>
            </p>
          <p>12. I now come to the third letter. As to what you say, <lb/>
            that Balbus is soon coming to Rome with a number of com- <lb/>
            panions, and that he will be constantly with me till the <lb/>
            middle of May; that will be very pleasant and delightful to <lb/>
            me. As to the exhortations which you give me, in the same <lb/>
            letter, as oftentimes before, to ambition and to diligence, I will <lb/>
            observe them; but when am I to enjoy life?</p>
          <p>13. A fourth letter was delivered to me on the 13th of <lb/>
            September, which you had dated from Britain on the 10th <lb/>
            of August. In it there was no news, except about the Erigona; <lb/>
            which if I receive from Oppius, I will write you word what <lb/>
            I think of it; and I have no doubt that it will give me <lb/>
            pleasure. And (a matter which I have passed over) with <lb/>
            respect to the person who, you say, wrote to Cæsar about the <lb/>
            applause which Milo received, I readily allow Cæsar to imagine <lb/>
            that the applause was very great; and, in fact, so it was; and <lb/>
            yet the applause which is given to him appears in some degree <lb/>
            to be given to us.</p>
          <p>14. A very old letter from you has also been brought me, <lb/>
            but brought rather late, in which you give me instructions <lb/>
            about the temple of Tellus, and the portico of Catulus. Both <lb/>
            works are going on with all speed; at the temple of Tellus, in- <lb/>
            deed, I have also placed your statue. Also, as to the wishes that <lb/>
            you express about the gardens, I never was very desirous of <lb/>
            such things; and my house now makes up to me for the want <lb/>
            of the luxury of a garden.</p>
          <p>When I came to Rome, on the 19th of September, I found <lb/>
            the roof of your house completed, which, above the chambers, <lb/>
            you had decided should not have any great number of gables; <lb/>
            but it slopes down in anything but a neat manner to the roof <lb/>
            of the colonnade below. While I have been absent, my Cicero <lb/>
            has not ceased from his attendance on the rhetorician: you <lb/>
            have no reason to be anxious about his attainments, since <lb/>
            you know his natural abilities; and his studious disposition I <lb/>
            see myself. All his other interests I look to, as if I thought <lb/>
            that I were going surety for them.</p>
          <p>V. 15. As yet, three parties are prosecuting Gabinius : <lb/>
            Lucius Lentulus, the son of the flamen, who has already lodged <lb/>
            an accusation of treason1 against him; Tiberius Nero, with his <lb/>
            well-disposed backers; and Caius Memmius, the tribune of <note type="footnote"> 1 Majestas. See noto, p. 74. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            the people, with Lucius Capito. He arrived in the city on <lb/>
            the 20th of September; no entrance was ever more mean or <lb/>
            more solitary. But I do not dare to place any confidence in <lb/>
            these trials. Because Cato was indisposed, he has not as yet <lb/>
            been prosecuted for peculation. Pompey labours very hard <lb/>
            to reconcile me to him; but he has not succeeded as yet, and, <lb/>
            if 1 retain any portion of my liberty, he shall not succeed. I <lb/>
            am extremely anxious for a letter from you.</p>
          <p>16. As to what you write me word that you have heard, <lb/>
            namely, that I interfered in the coalition of the candidates for <lb/>
            the consulship, it is not true; for agreements were made in <lb/>
            that coalition of such a character (which Memmius subse- <lb/>
            quently exposed) that no respectable person ought to have <lb/>
            been concerned in them: and, besides, it was not a proceed- <lb/>
            ing for me, to have anything to do with a coalition from which <lb/>
            Messala was excluded,-a man with whom I agree perfectly in <lb/>
            all points; and, in my opinion, also with Memmius. I have <lb/>
            already done many things for Domitius, which he wished, and <lb/>
            which he requested of me; and I have laid Scaurus under <lb/>
            great obligations to me by defending him. As yet it has been <lb/>
            uncertain, both-when the comitia would take place, and who <lb/>
            were to be the new consuls.</p>
          <p>17. When I was just folding up this letter, a courier <lb/>
            arrived from you on the 21st of September, having made the <lb/>
            journey in twenty days. 0 how anxious I am ! How much <lb/>
            I have grieved over that most kind letter from Caesar; but <lb/>
            the more kind it was, the greater grief did that misfortune <lb/>
            of his cause me.1 But I come to your own letter. In the <lb/>
            first place, I approve above all things of your intention of <lb/>
            remaining, especially since, as you write me word, you have <lb/>
            consulted Cæsar on the subject. I wonder that Oppius should <lb/>
            have said anything to Publius, for I did not like the man.</p>
          <p>18. As to what you write in your enclosure, that I should <lb/>
            be appointed one of Pompey's lieutenants in the middle <lb/>
            of September, I have not heard it; and I have written to <lb/>
            Cæsar, that Vibullius brought directions from Cæsar about <lb/>
            my stay to Pompey, but not to Oppius. With what object ? <lb/>
            Although I detained Oppius, because the right of speaking <note type="footnote">1 It seems probable that this refers to a storm mentioned in the <lb/>
            fourth book of his account of the Gallic war, in which he lost a great <lb/>
            number of ships. His daughter Julia, too, died nearly about this time. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            first to Pompey belonged to Vibullius; for Cæsar had talked <lb/>
            the matter over in an interview with him; to Oppius he had <lb/>
            written. However, I can have no second thoughts in Cæsar's <lb/>
            affairs. He is next to you and to our children in my heart; <lb/>
            so near, indeed, that he is almost equal to them. I seem to <lb/>
            myself to feel thus from judgment; for indeed I ought; but <lb/>
            still I am warmed with love for him.</p>
          <p>VI. 19. When I had written these last lines, which are in <lb/>
            my own hand, your Cicero came in to us to supper, as Pom- <lb/>
            ponia was supping out. He gave me your letter to read, <lb/>
            which he had received a short time before; a letter written <lb/>
            in the Aristophanic spirit, being in truth both pleasant and <lb/>
            sensible; and I was greatly pleased with it. He also gave <lb/>
            me that other letter of yours, in which you enjoin him to <lb/>
            attach himself as much to me as to his tutor. How those <lb/>
            letters delighted himl how they gratified me! Nothing <lb/>
            can be more engaging than that boy,—no one can be more <lb/>
            attached to me. These lines I dictated to Tiro while at <lb/>
            supper, that you may not be surprised at their being in <lb/>
            a different hand.</p>
          <p>20. Your letters were very acceptable also to Annalis, as <lb/>
            they showed that you were very anxious about him, and, <lb/>
            at the same time, assisted him with most serious advice. <lb/>
            Publius Servilius the father, from the letters which he says <lb/>
            have been sent him from Cæsar, intimates that you have done <lb/>
            what was very acceptable to him, in having spoken with <lb/>
            great courtesy and great earnestness of his attachment to <lb/>
            Caesar.</p>
          <p>21. When I had returned to Rome from the neighbour- <lb/>
            hood of Arpinum, I was told that a horsebreaker had set out <lb/>
            to go to you. I cannot say that I was astonished at his <lb/>
            having acted so like a barbarian as to go without any letter <lb/>
            from me to you; I merely say that it was vexatious to me,— <lb/>
            for I had been thinking of it for a long time,-in consequence <lb/>
            of what you wrote to me, that if there should be anything <lb/>
            which I should wish to be conveyed to you with extra- <lb/>
            ordinary care, I was to give it to him; because, in truth, in <lb/>
            these letters which I usually send to you, I generally write <lb/>
            nothing which would cause me any annoyance if it fell into <lb/>
            other hands. I used to keep myself for Minucius. and <lb/>
            Salvius, and Labeo. Labeo will either go at a late period, or <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            will remain here. The horsebreaker did not even ask if I <lb/>
            wished to send anything.</p>
          <p>22. Titus Pinarius sends very kindly-expressed letters about <lb/>
            you to me; saying that he is beyond all measure delighted <lb/>
            with your letters, conversation, and, besides, with your sup- <lb/>
            pers. That man has always pleased me, and his brother is a <lb/>
            great deal with me. Do you, therefore, as you have begun <lb/>
            to do, cherish that young man.</p>
          <p>VII. 23. As I have had this letter under my hands several <lb/>
            days, owing to the delay of the couriers, many different <lb/>
            things have consequently been thrown into it, one thing at <lb/>
            one time, and another at another; as for instance this: Titus <lb/>
            Anicius has already often said to me, that he should not <lb/>
            hesitate to purchase a suburban villa for you, if he could <lb/>
            meet with one. In regard to this remark of his, I cannot but <lb/>
            wonder at two things: that though you write to him about <lb/>
            buying you a suburban villa, you not only do not write to me <lb/>
            about it, but even write to quite the contrary effect; and <lb/>
            also, that when you are writing to him, you recollect nothing <lb/>
            about him, nothing about those letters of his which you <lb/>
            showed me when you were at Tusculum, and nothing about <lb/>
            the precepts of Epicharmus, " Take notice how he treats any <lb/>
            one else." You forget, in short, the mane; whole countenance, <lb/>
            and language, and disposition; and, as I conjecture, just as <lb/>
            if—1 but to these things you must look yourself.</p>
          <p>24. Take care that I may know what you really wish <lb/>
            about this suburban villa, and take care at the same time that <lb/>
            he does not cause any trouble. What more have I to say? <lb/>
            What? Oh, this : Gabinius, on the 28th of September, <lb/>
            entered the city by night; and to-day, at the eighth hour, <lb/>
            when, according to the edict of Caius Alfius, he ought to have <lb/>
            appeared to the accusation of majesty,2 he was almost over- <lb/>
            whelmed by the concourse and by the detestation of the whole <lb/>
            people. Nothing ever was more contemptible than his ap- <lb/>
            pearance. Piso, however, comes very near to him; I am <lb/>
            therefore thinking of introducing a marvellous episode in the <note type="footnote"> 1 Orellius says that this is not an aposiopesis, but that some Greek <lb/>
            word or phrase is lost. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Majesty was nearly equivalent to treason. It was a general <lb/>
            term for any offence committed against the Roman people, or its <lb/>

            dicting what sort of return that of the two generals will be, of <lb/>
            whom one has lost his army, and the other has sold it.</p>
          <p>25. Cæsar wrote me a letter from Britain on the 1st of <lb/>
            September, which I received on the 28th, giving a satis- <lb/>
            factory account of the affairs of Britain; in it, that I may <lb/>
            not be surprised at receiving no letter from you, he says that <lb/>
            he had been without your company, as he had gone to the <lb/>
            coast. I have not sent him any answer to that letter, not <lb/>
            even to congratulate him, because of his private mourning. <lb/>
            Again and again, my dear brother, I beg you to take care of <lb/>
            your health.</p>

          <p>1. ON the 10th of October, Salvius went by sea to Ostia, <lb/>
            late in the evening, with the things which you wished to have <lb/>
            sent to you from home. On the same day, Memmius had <lb/>
            given Gabinius a warming before the people with so lucid an <lb/>
            accusation, that Calidius was unable to utter a single word on <lb/>
            his behalf. But the day after, which was coming on as I was <lb/>
            writing this before dawn, a great argument was to be held <lb/>
            at Cato's between Memmius and Tiberius Nero, and Caius- <lb/>
            Antonius and Lucius Antonius, the sons of Marcus, as to who <lb/>
            should manage the prosecution against Gabinius. We thought <lb/>
            that it would be allotted to Memmius, although there was <lb/>
            an extraordinary struggle on the part of Nero. What would <lb/>
            you have? The matter is well pressed forward, did not our <lb/>
            friend Pompey, in spite of both gods and men, upset the, <lb/>
            business.</p>
          <p>2. Understand now the boldness of the man, and that some- <lb/>
            thing still amuses us in so distressed a condition of public <lb/>
            affairs. After Gabinius, wherever he went, had said that he <lb/>
            was demanding a triumph, and after this good general had <lb/>
            suddenly entered the city by night, (as if, evidently, it had been <lb/>
            the city of an enemy,) he did not venture to present himself <lb/>
            before the senate. In the meantime, on the tenth day after <lb/>
            his arrival, on which he ought to have given in his report of <lb/>
            the numbers of the enemies and of our troops, he sneakei <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            into the senate-house with a very small following. When he <lb/>
            was about to depart, he was detained by the consuls. The <lb/>
            farmers of the revenues were introduced. The man, being <lb/>
            attacked on all sides, and being wounded by me most of all, <lb/>
            could bear it no longer, and with a trembling voice called <lb/>
            me an exile. On this, (0 ye gods! nothing more honourable <lb/>
            ever happened to me,) the whole senate to a man rose in an <lb/>
            uproar against him, so that they came close to him; while <lb/>
            the farmers of the revenue started up with a similar noise <lb/>
            and rush. What more do you ask? All of them behaved <lb/>
            as if you yourself had been there. Nothing can be more <lb/>
            complimentary than the language of men out-of-doors. I, <lb/>
            however, restrain myself from accusing him, with difficulty <lb/>
            indeed, but I do restrain myself, not only because I do not <lb/>
            wish to oppose Pompey, (the business which presses me about <lb/>
            Milo is quite enough,) but because we have no judges whom <lb/>
            we can trust. I dread a failure. I may take also into con- <lb/>
            sideration the malevolence of men, and I am afraid that if I <lb/>
            were to accuse him, something might happen to him; nor- <lb/>
            do I despair that the matter may be accomplished without <lb/>
            me, though in some degree by my means.</p>
          <p>3. All who are candidates for the consulship are impeached <lb/>
            on the charge of bribery. Domitius by Memmius, Memmius <lb/>
            by Quintus Curtius, a good and accomplished young man; <lb/>
            Messala by Quintus Pompey, Scaurus by Triarius. It is a <lb/>
            -great measure in agitation, because the ruin either of th3 <lb/>
            men, or of the laws, is threatened. Some efforts are made, <lb/>
            that no trials may take place. The affair appears to point to <lb/>
            an interregnum. The consuls wish to hold the comitia; tha <lb/>
            impeached parties are against it, and Memmius above all, <lb/>
            because on the arrival of Cæsar he hopes to become consul. <lb/>
            But he has an extraordinarily bad chance. Domitius and <lb/>
            Messala appeared sure of success; Scaurus had lost heart. <lb/>
            Appius asserts, that if it were not for a lex curiata, he shouli <lb/>
            succeed our friend Lentulus, who on that day showed won- <lb/>
            derful vigour against Gabinius, (a thing which I had almost <lb/>
            forgotten to mention;) he accused him of treason; names <lb/>
            witnesses were given in; while Gabinius did not say a word <lb/>
            You now know the affairs of the forum. At home things go <lb/>
            on well, and the house itself is proceeding with great rapidity <lb/>
            under the hands of the contractors.</p><pb n="77"/>

          <p>1. THE hand of my secretary may be a sign to you how <lb/>
            busy I am. Be assured that there does not a day pass in <lb/>
            which I do not speak on behalf of some accused person. <lb/>
            Thus, whatever I compose or meditate, I generally throw into <lb/>
            the time of my walk. In this state is my public business; <lb/>
            our domestic affairs go on as I wish. The boys are well; <lb/>
            they learn with great diligence; they are taught with great <lb/>
            pains; they love us, and love one another. The polishing <lb/>
            of both our houses is going on; while your rural matters <lb/>
            at Arcanum and Laterium are advancing to completion.1 <lb/>
            Besides, in one of my letters, I omitted nothing to give you <lb/>
            a clear account about the water, and the road.</p>
          <p>But this subject of anxiety disturbs and annoys me, that <lb/>
            for the space of now more than fifty days, not only no letter <lb/>
            has come from you, none from Cæsar, none from that country, <lb/>
            but not even a single report; and that sea, and that country, <lb/>
            keep me now in a state of anxiety. Nor do I cease (as is <lb/>
            the case with persons in love) to imagine the things which I <lb/>
            least wish. I do not therefore now ask you to write to me <lb/>
            about yourself and about affairs in that quarter, (for I know <lb/>
            that you never omit to do so when you have an oppor- <lb/>
            tunity,) but I wish you to know, that I scarcely ever longed <lb/>
            for anything so much, as, when I wrote this, I did for a letter <lb/>
            from you.</p>
          <p>2. Hear now what is going on in the republic. Day after <lb/>
            day appointed for the comitia is constantly cancelled by <lb/>
            notices of ill omens, to the great joy of the well-affected <lb/>
            citizens, in such unpopularity are the consuls on account of <lb/>
            the suspicion of their having bargained for bribes from the <lb/>
            candidates. There are four candidates for the consulship; <lb/>
            all are prosecuted; the causes are difficult ones; but still we <lb/>
            will exert ourselves that Messala may come off safe; a result <lb/>
            which is even connected with the safety of the rest. Publius <lb/>
            Sylla has impeached Gabinius of bribery, his stepson Mem- <lb/>
            mius supporting the accusation, as well as his brother Cæcilius, <note type="footnote">1 A corrupt passage, says Orellius. There are various readings, but <lb/>
            none satisfactory. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            and his son Sylla. Lucius Torquatus made objections, but <lb/>
            failed in his purpose, to the great joy of all men.</p>
          <p>3. Do you ask, what is to become of Gabinius? We shall <lb/>
            know in three days about the impeachment for treason; on <lb/>
            which charge he is weighed down by the detestation of all <lb/>
            classes; and is especially damaged by the evidence. He has <lb/>
            very cool accusers; the bench is of a varied character; the <lb/>
            chief judge, Alfius, is a man of high and resolute temper. <lb/>
            Pompey is earnest in canvassing the judges; how it will end <lb/>
            I know not; but I see no room for him in the city. I have <lb/>
            a moderate wish for his downfal, but the faintest possible as <lb/>
            to the result of the whole proceedings.</p>
          <p>4. You have now an account of almost everything. I will <lb/>
            add this one particular: your Cicero and mine is now apply- <lb/>
            ing himself with great diligence to the instructions of Pæonius, <lb/>
            a rhetorician, a man, in my opinion, well accomplished, and <lb/>
            of excellent character; but you know well enough that my <lb/>
            own style of education is a little more learned and philo- <lb/>
            sophical. Though, therefore, I do not wish Cicero's progress, <lb/>
            and that course of instruction, to be impeded; and the boy <lb/>
            himself seems to be greatly charmed and delighted with the <lb/>
            exercise in declamation; (and as I was myself also practised <lb/>
            in it, I would allow him to go on in ray steps, for I feel sure <lb/>
            that he will arrive at the same end,) but still, if I take him <lb/>
            anywhere into the country with me, I shall lead him into <lb/>
            my own method and practice. For a great reward is offered <lb/>
            me from you, which certainly I shall not fail to gain through <lb/>
            my own fault. In what parts you are going to winter, and <lb/>
            with what expectations, I should wish you to write me word <lb/>
            with all possible minuteness. Farewell.</p>

          <p>1. GABINIUS has been acquitted. Altogether, nothing could <lb/>
            be more childish than Lentulus, his accuser, and his fellow- <lb/>
            prosecutors, nothing more corrupt than the bench ; but still, <lb/>
            if the exertion and entreaties of Pompey had not been extra- <lb/>
            ordinary, and if the report of a coming dictatorship had not <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            been full of alarm, he would not have made any reply even <lb/>
            to Lentulus; and yet with him for his accuser, and with that <lb/>
            bench for his judges, he had thirty-two votes against him, <lb/>
            seventy persons voting. Certainly, this trial is of so severe <lb/>
            a character, that he seems likely to be convicted on the other <lb/>
            accusations, and especially on that of peculation; but you <lb/>
            see that there is really no republic at all, no senate, no <lb/>
            judges, no dignity in any one of us.</p>
          <p>Why should I say more about the judges ? Two men of præ- <lb/>
            torian rank were on the bench; Domitius Calvinus; he voted <lb/>
            openly for his acquittal, so that all might see it; and Cato;1 <lb/>
            he, after the votes had been counted, withdrew himself from the <lb/>
            circle, and was the first to announce the result to Pompey.</p>
          <p>2. Some say, and Sallust among them, that I ought to have <lb/>
            been the accuser. Should I trust myself to such judges? <lb/>
            What would have been thought of me if he had escaped <lb/>
            while I had pleaded against him ? But other considerations <lb/>
            influenced me. Pompey would have thought that he had <lb/>
            a dispute with me, not about the safety of Gabinius, but his <lb/>
            own dignity. He would have entered the city. The matter <lb/>
            would have come to a regular quarrel; I should have seemed <lb/>
            like Pacideianus when matched with Æserninus the Samnite; <lb/>
            perhaps he would have bitten off my ear. He would at least <lb/>
            have been reconciled to Clodius. With my own conduct <lb/>
            certainly, I am thoroughly satisfied, particularly if you do <lb/>
            not disapprove of it. He, after he had been honoured by mo <lb/>
            with eminent exertions on my part, and though I owed Lim <lb/>
            nothing, and he owed everything to me, was still unable to <lb/>
            bear my differing in opinion with him about the affairs of the <lb/>
            commonwealth, (I will not use a harsher expression;) anti <lb/>
            even at the period when he was less powerful, he showed how <lb/>
            much he could do against me when I was at the height on <lb/>
            my reputation. Now, when I myself am not even anxious t: <lb/>
            acquire any great influence, when the republic itself has cer <lb/>
            tainly no power at all, and when he has power over everything <lb/>
            could I possibly contend with him ? For so I must have <lb/>
            done. I do not believe that you think that I ought to have <lb/>
            undertaken such a task.</p>
          <p>3. [You should,] Sallust still argues, [have done] cne of <note type="footnote">1 What Cato, is uncertain ; but it was not, as Paul Manutius observes, <lb/>
            the Cato afterwards called Uticensis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            two things; [if you did not accuse him,] you should have <lb/>
            defended him, and have granted that to the entreaty of <lb/>
            Pompey : for indeed he did entreat very earnestly. A plea- <lb/>
            sant friend certainly Sallust is, who thinks that I was bound <lb/>
            either to incur a most dangerous enmity or everlasting <lb/>
            infamy. But I myself am pleased with this middle course ; <lb/>
            and it is gratifying to me, that after I had with great serious- <lb/>
            ness given my evidence in accordance with good faith and <lb/>
            religion, the defendant said, that if he could possibly have <lb/>
            been in the city, he would have satisfied me;1 nor did he put <lb/>
            a single question to me.</p>
          <p>4. With respect to the verses which you wish me to writs <lb/>
            out for you, the task cannot be undertaken by me, a task <lb/>
            which requires not only time, but also a mind free from all <lb/>
            care. But enthusiasm is also wanting, for I am not altogether <lb/>
            without anxiety as to the coming year, though I am without <lb/>
            apprehension. And at the same time (I assure you that I <lb/>
            speak without the slightest irony) I assign a higher place in <lb/>
            that kind of writing to you than to myself.</p>
          <p>5. As to completing your Greek library, changing some <lb/>
            books, and procuring some Latin ones, I wish indeed that those <lb/>
            matters may be done, especially as they have reference to my <lb/>
            accommodation. But I myself have no person by whose <lb/>
            agency I can get such things done for me ; for the books <lb/>
            which have attractions for me are not for sale, and cannot be <lb/>
            completed except by a man who is both skilful and diligent: <lb/>
            however, I will give Chrysippus a commission, and I will <lb/>
            speak with Tyrannic. I will inquire too, what Scipio has <lb/>
            done about the money. Whatever seems proper, I will attend <lb/>
            to it. As to Ascanio, you shall do whatever you please; I <lb/>
            will interpose no obstacle on my own account. I commend <lb/>
            you for not being iu a hurry about your suburban villa, but <lb/>
            I advise you to have one.</p>
          <p>6. I have written this on the 24th of October, the <lb/>
            day on which the games were beginning, as I was going <lb/>
            to my Tusculan villa, and taking my Cicero with me for a <lb/>
            game 2 of instruction, not of amusement; on that account <note type="footnote">1 Would have thanked me, for not having been his accuser, but <lb/>
            having merely given testimony against him.—Paul Manutius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In ludum discendi, non lusionis. He plays on the word Indus, which <lb/>

            I did not go further than I wanted, because I desired to be <lb/>
            present at the triumph of Pomptinius,1 on the 3d of Novem- <lb/>
            ber ; for there will be I know not what trifle of business ; <lb/>
            since Cato and Servilius, the prætors, threaten that they will <lb/>
            prevent it; and I do not know what they can do, as he will <lb/>
            both have Appius the consul with him, and the majority of <lb/>
            the prætors, and the tribunes of the people. However, they <lb/>
            so threaten, and especially Quintus Scævola, who breathes <lb/>
            nothing but war. My kindest and dearest brother, take care <lb/>
            of your health.</p>

          <p>1. WITH respect to your question, what I have done about <lb/>
            those books which, when I was in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Cumæ, I began to write, I have not been idle, nor am I idle; <lb/>
            but I have several times changed my whole plan and method <lb/>
            of treating the subject: for after two books were completed, <lb/>
            in which, during that nine days! festival which took place in <lb/>
            the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius, a conversation is <lb/>
            commenced by me between Africanus,2 a little before his <lb/>
            death, and Lælius, Philus, Manilius, Quintus Tubero, and <lb/>
            Fannius and Scævola, the sons-in-law of Lælius ; and that <lb/>
            conversation is extended over nine days, and through nine <lb/>
            books, being on the best form of government, and the charac- <lb/>
            ter of the best citizen, (the work in truth was put together <lb/>
            with sufficient clearness, and the dignity of the speakers added <lb/>
            some weight to the arguments;)—when these books were read <lb/>
            by me at my Tusculan villa in the hearing of Sallust, I was <lb/>
            assured by him that opinions might be given on those sub- <lb/>
            jects with much greater authority, if I myself were to speak <lb/>
            on the republic, especially as I was not a Heraclides of Pon- <lb/>
            tus, but a man of consular rank, and one who had myself been <lb/>
            concerned in the most important affairs of state; but that <lb/>
            what I attributed to characters of such antiquity, would <lb/>
            appear to be fictitious; that as to the dialogue upon oratory <note type="footnote"> 1 Over the Allobroges. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, the younger Africanus. The book alluded to is the treatise <lb/>
            Do Republicâ, discovered in this century. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            in th jse treatises of mine, I had done well not to utter in my <lb/>
            own character what was said on the art of speaking, but to <lb/>
            refer it to those men whom I had seen myself; but that <lb/>
            Aristotle himself delivers in his own character what he writes <lb/>
            about the commonwealth, and the most excellent kind of <lb/>
            citizen.</p>
          <p>2. He made an impression upon me, and so much the <lb/>
            more because, [by the plan that I had adopted,] I was unable <lb/>
            to touch upon the greatest disturbances in our commonwealth, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they were posterior to the age of the speakers ; <lb/>
            though at first I had made this very thing one of my objects, <lb/>
            lest in touching on our own times, I should give offence to any <lb/>
            one. Now I shall both avoid that, and shall myself converse <lb/>
            with you; but, nevertheless, if I come to Rome, I shall send <lb/>
            you what I had originally written; for I imagine that you <lb/>
            will be of opinion, that those books were not put aside by <lb/>
            me without some feeling of disappointment.</p>
          <p>3. I am exceedingly gratified by Cæsar's great good-will, of <lb/>
            which he has assured me in his letter: but I do not depend <lb/>
            much on the promises which he holds out. I am neither <lb/>
            eager for honours nor anxious for glory; and I am more <lb/>
            desirous of the duration of his good-will, than the fulfilment <lb/>
            of his promises. Nevertheless, I live amidst the same ambi- <lb/>
            tion and labour, as if I were expecting what I never solicit.</p>
          <p>4. As to what you ask me about making verses, it is in- <lb/>
            credible, my dear brother, how much I want time; nor indeed <lb/>
            am I sufficiently animated in thought to sing of those things <lb/>
            which you wish. And do you, who have surpassed all men <lb/>
            in that description of language and expression, ask me for <lb/>
            suggestions on a subject which I cannot fully grasp even with <lb/>
            the utmost exertion of thought ? Nevertheless, I would do <lb/>
            it as well as I could, but, (what by no means escapes your <lb/>
            knowledge,) there is need, for composing a poem, of a certain <lb/>
            cheerfulness of spirit, which the times altogether take away <lb/>
            from me. I indeed free myself, as far as I can, from all <lb/>
            anxiety on account of the commonwealth, and devote myself <lb/>
            to literature; but still I will tell you what in truth I wished <lb/>
            above all things concealed from you: I am made wretched, <lb/>
            my dearest brother, I am made wretched by the consideration <lb/>
            that there is no commonwealth; no courts of justice; and that <lb/>
            this present time of life of mice, which ought to be in full <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            possession of the authority of a senator, is either harassed <lb/>
            with the labour of pleading in the forum, or endured with <lb/>
            the aid of private literary pursuits; and that the idea which <lb/>
            I cherished from my childhood, <lb/>
            At all times to excel, and be above <lb/>
            My fellows, <lb/>
            is all come to nothing; that of my enemies, some are not <lb/>
            attacked by me, some are even defended; that not only my <lb/>
            inclinations, but my very dislikes are not free; and that <lb/>
            Cæsar is the only one of all men who is found to love me as <lb/>
            much as I desire; or even, as some think, is the only one who <lb/>
            is inclined to love me.</p>
          <p>Yet none of these vexations are of such a nature that <lb/>
            I cannot every day soothe myself with great consolation; but <lb/>
            the greatest consolation of all will be if we shall be together <lb/>
            again; but, at present, to those other disquietudes of mine, <lb/>
            there is added even the most vehement longing to see you.</p>
          <p>5. If, as Pansa thinks that I ought to have done, I had <lb/>
            defended Gabinius, I should have been utterly ruined; those <lb/>
            who hate him, and they are all ranks of men, would have <lb/>
            begun to hate me, on account of him whom they already <lb/>
            hate. I bore myself, in my opinion, admirably, so as to do <lb/>
            only so much as every one might see. And in the whole of <lb/>
            my conduct, as you advise me, I devote myself greatly to the <lb/>
            cultivation of ease and tranquillity.</p>
          <p>6. In respect of the library, it is Tyrannic who is the <lb/>
            idler. I will speak to Chrysippus; but it is a troublesome <lb/>
            task, and one that requires a very diligent man. I find this <lb/>
            myself, who, with a great deal of trouble, meet with no suc- <lb/>
            cess. But for Latin books, I know not whither to turn my- <lb/>
            self; so faultily are they copied, and so dishonestly are they <lb/>
            sold; however, I will not neglect to do what may be done. <lb/>
            Crebrius, as I wrote you word before, is at Rome, and the <lb/>
            men who take their oaths to anything, tell me that he is under <lb/>
            great obligations to you. I fancy that the money matters have <lb/>
            oeen settled in my absence.</p>
          <p>7. When you say that you have finished four tragedies in <lb/>
            sixteen days, are you borrowing anything from any one else ? <lb/>
            And are you aiming at credit.1 by copying out the Electra <lb/>
            or the Troades ? Do not be an idler; and do not fancy that <note type="footnote">1 Most texts have <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρέος</foreign> : Gronovius and some others prefer tell <foreign xml:lang="grc">έι</foreign>s. </note> <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            the saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνω̑θι σεαυτόν</foreign> is intended merely to diminish <lb/>
            arrogance, but that it also intimates that we should know <lb/>
            our own powers. However, I would wish you to send me <lb/>
            both them, and the Erigona. You have in this packet my <lb/>
            last two letters.</p>

          <p>1. THERE is a wonderful flood at Rome, and especially <lb/>
            along the Appian road, as far as the temple of Mars; the <lb/>
            walks of Crassipes, and his gardens, have been carried away, <lb/>
            and many shops. There has been an amazing quantity of <lb/>
            water down as far as the public fish-ponds. The passage of <lb/>
            Homer' is powerfully illustrated :— <lb/>
            As on an autumn day, when Jupiter <lb/>
            Pours violent waters forth, whene'er, enraged, <lb/>
            His anger burns 'gainst men : <lb/>
            For it applies well to the acquittal of Gabinius :— <lb/>
            Men who by force in council will pronounce <lb/>
            Judgments unjust, and banish right, the voice <lb/>
            Of heav'n not heeding.</p>
          <p>But I have made up my mind not to trouble myself about <lb/>
            these matters.</p>
          <p>2. When I arrive at Rome, I will write you word what <lb/>
            I observe, and especially about the dictatorship; and I will <lb/>
            give the courier letters, both for Labienus and for Ligurius.</p>
          <p>I wrote this before daybreak, by the light of a little wooden <lb/>
            candlestick, which was very acceptable to me, because they <lb/>
            said that you, when you were at Samos, had had it made. <lb/>

          <p>1. THERE is no need for me to reply to your former letter, <lb/>
            which is full of discontent and complaints; of which kind <lb/>
            too you say that you had given Labienus another the day <lb/>
            before; but he has not arrived yet. For your more recent <note type="footnote"> 1II. xvi. 386. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            letter has removed from me every feeling of annoyance ; only <lb/>
            I both advise and entreat you, to recollect amid all those <lb/>
            annoyances and labours and feelings of regret, what our <lb/>
            intention was in your journey. For we were not aiming at <lb/>
            any trifling or ordinary advantages; for what advantage could <lb/>
            there have been which we should have thought worth pur- <lb/>
            chasing at the price of our separation ? We were seeking <lb/>
            most powerful protection, for the full maintenance of our <lb/>
            dignity, from the good-will of a most excellent and most <lb/>
            influential man. More is risked on hope than on money; <lb/>
            everything else will go1 to loss. If, therefore, you often turn <lb/>
            back your thoughts to the consideration of our old objects <lb/>
            and hopes, you will more easily bear those hardships of <lb/>
            military service, and other things which annoy you; and <lb/>
            still you will be able to shake them off when you please. <lb/>
            But the full time for that matter has not arrived yet, though <lb/>
            it is approaching.</p>
          <p>2. Moreover, I recommend you not to trust anything tc <lb/>
            your letters, from which, if it should be divulged, we should <lb/>
            suffer annoyance. There are many things of which I had <lb/>
            rather be ignorant than be informed of them at any risk. <lb/>
            I will write to you further with a mind at ease, when my <lb/>
            Cicero is going on well again, as I hope he will. I would <lb/>
            wish you to take care and let me know to whom I must give <lb/>
            the letter which I am to send you next; whether to the <lb/>
            couriers of Caesar, that he may at once send them on to you, <lb/>
            or to those of Labienus; for where those Nervii are, or how <lb/>
            far off they are, I know not.</p>
          <p>3. I derived great pleasure from your letter concerning the <lb/>
            virtue and gravity of Cæsar, which he had displayed when <lb/>
            under deep affliction. And as to your requesting me to <lb/>
            finish the poem which I have begun to him, although I am <lb/>
            distracted with labour, and still more in mind, still, since <lb/>
            Cæsar has learned from the letter which I had sent to you, <lb/>
            that I have begun something, I will resume what I had <lb/>
            commenced, and complete it in these idle days of supplica- <lb/>
            tions; during which I am extremely glad that our friend <note type="footnote">1 Struentur is the reading of Orellius and most other editors; Nobbe <lb/>
            has struantur. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Nervii in Gaul, among whom Quintus was in winter quarters <lb/>

            Messala and the rest are relieved from annoyance, and when you <lb/>
            set him down as quite sure to be consul with Domitius, ycu do <lb/>
            not in the least dissent from my own opinion. I will under- <lb/>
            take for Messala's conduct to Cæsar; but Memmius places <lb/>
            hopes in the arrival of Cæsar, in which I think he is mis- <lb/>
            taken ; here at least he is coldly regarded: as for Scaurus, <lb/>
            Pompey cast him off some time ago.</p>
          <p>4. Matters are postponed; the comitia are brought to an <lb/>
            interregnum. The rumour of a dictator is disagreeable to the <lb/>
            well-affected; but what they say is far more disagreeable to <lb/>
            me. However, the whole business is regarded with alarm, <lb/>
            and goes on slowly. Pompey plainly denies that he has any <lb/>
            inclination for it. Before he did not use to deny it to me. <lb/>
            Hirrus seems likely to propose it. 0 ye gods, what a fool of <lb/>
            a man ! how does he love himself without a rival! He <lb/>
            frightened off, by my means, Crassus Junianus, 1 a man wholly <lb/>
            devoted to me. It is very hard to know whether he wishes it, <lb/>
            or whether he does not. However, while Hirrus is acting, he <lb/>
            will not make people believe that he has any disinclination. <lb/>
            People at this time were talking of nothing else with regard <lb/>
            to public affairs; at all events, nothing else is done.</p>
          <p>5. The funeral of Serranus Domesticus the son, was a very <lb/>
            mournful one: it took place on the 19th of November. The <lb/>
            father spoke a funeral panegyric over him, of my writing.</p>
          <p>6. Now as to Milo: Pompey has given nothing to him, <lb/>
            and everything to Gutta; and says that he will take care <lb/>
            that Cæsar shall use all his endeavours to further his interest. <lb/>
            Milo is apprehensive of this,-and not without reason,-and <lb/>
            almost despairs, if he becomes dictator. If he with any armed <lb/>
            force, or with his protection, should assist any one who inter- <lb/>
            posed a veto to his dictatorship, he fears Pompey would be <lb/>
            his enemy; and if he does not assist some one, then he is <lb/>
            afraid that matters will be carried by violence. He is pre- <lb/>
            paring the most magnificent games,2 of such a character that <lb/>
            no man has ever exhibited any more costly ones; a double <lb/>
            and a treble piece of folly, as they are not demanded,3—either <lb/>
            because he had already exhibited a very fine show, or because <note type="footnote">1 The name is probably corrupt. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In honour of the dead, by whose will he had received a bequest <lb/>

            means were wanting, or because he was a director,1 or because <lb/>
            he might fairly look upon himself as a director, and not as <lb/>
            an ædile.2 I have now written nearly all that I had to say. <lb/>
            My dearest brother, take care of your health.</p>

          <p>1. IN the matter of Gabinius, none of those things which <lb/>
            were most affectionately imagined by you, were necessary to <lb/>
            be done: <lb/>
            Then may the wide-mouthed earth, with ample yawn, <lb/>
            Swallow me quick.</p>
          <p>I acted with the most consummate dignity, as all men are of <lb/>
            opinion, and also with the greatest lenity, in all the steps <lb/>
            which I took: I neither pressed him hard, nor relieved him. <lb/>
            I was a very strong witness; in other respects I was quiet. <lb/>
            The disgraceful and ruinous result of the trial I took very <lb/>
            easily; and my prudence indeed now redounds to my ad- <lb/>
            vantage; so that I am not in the least moved by these <lb/>
            calamities of the commonwealth, and the licentiousness of <lb/>
            audacious citizens, with which I used to be distracted; for <lb/>
            nothing can be more utterly lost than these men and these <lb/>
            times.</p>
          <p>2. Since, therefore, no pleasure can now be derived from <lb/>
            public affairs, I do not know why I should vex myself. <lb/>
            Literature, my studies, and leisure, my country-houses, and <lb/>
            especially our boys, give me great pleasure. Milo is the only <lb/>
            one that gives me annoyance; but I wish that the consulship <lb/>
            may put an end to it; in regard to which I will use no less <lb/>
            exertions than I used about my own; and you, from where <lb/>
            you are, will be able to help me, as indeed you do. Concerning <note type="footnote"> 1 Magister. A director or trustee to see the property divided among <lb/>
            the legatees.—Idem. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cicero's meaning is, that to exhibit games was the part of ædiles, <lb/>
            not of magistri, directors or trustees, and that Milo, therefore, as he <lb/>
            was only a magister, and not an ædile, ought to have forborne from <lb/>
            exhibiting games.—Idem. </note> <lb/>

            that matter, the other points, unless violence breaks them off, <lb/>
            are going on well. For his estate I am in fear: <lb/>
            But the man rages beyond all endurance, <lb/>
            and is preparing games which are to cost a hundred thousand <lb/>
            pounds.1 But in this one particular I will bear with his in- <lb/>
            considerateness as well as I can; and it is for your firmness <lb/>
            to be able to bear it.</p>
          <p>3. With respect to the commotions of the coming year, I <lb/>
            had wished you to understand that there is no cause for <lb/>
            domestic apprehension, but only for the common condition of <lb/>
            the republic, about which, if I am not able to effect any good, <lb/>
            I am still unable to be wholly indifferent. But how cautious <lb/>
            I wish you to be in writing, you may conjecture from this, <lb/>
            that I do not even write to you any account of the disturb- <lb/>
            ances which are openly made in the republic, lest my letters, <lb/>
            being intercepted, should hurt any one's feelings. I there- <lb/>
            fore would have you free from domestic anxiety. As to the <lb/>
            interests of the commonwealth, I know how anxious you <lb/>
            always are about them.</p>
          <p>I see that our friend Messala is consul; if by the interven- <lb/>
            tion of the interrex, without any proper decision; if by the <lb/>
            dictator's' influence, still without danger; he has no unpopu- <lb/>
            laxity to contend with. The ardour of Hortensius will have <lb/>
            great influence: the acquittal of Gabinius is looked on as the <lb/>
            promulgation of a law of impunity. By the bye, there has <lb/>
            not been anything done yet about a dictator.</p>
          <p>Pompey is away; Appius disturbs everything; Hirrus is <lb/>
            preparing to act. Many people are counted ready to inter- <lb/>
            pose their veto. The people does not care; the chiefs are <lb/>
            adverse; I take no part.</p>
          <p>4. I am greatly obliged to you for the promises which you <lb/>
            make about the slaves, and I am, as you write word, but very <lb/>
            poorly attended both in Rome and in the country; but take <lb/>
            care of troubling yourself, I intreat you, about anything which <lb/>
            regards my convenience, unless it is entirely convenient to <lb/>
            you, and quite within your power. <note type="footnote"> 1 Copies vary as to this sum. Most of them have HSCCC; which has <lb/>
            been generally thought corrupt. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Per dictatorem. An allusion to Pompey, whom a party wished to <lb/>
            make dictator. </note></p><pb n="89"/>
            
          <p>5. I laughed at Vatinius's letter; but I am well aware that <lb/>
            I am observed by him in such a manner, that I must not <lb/>
            only swallow his existing hatred, but even digest [and put <lb/>
            up with] it.</p>
          <p>6. As to the work which you exhort me to finish, I have. <lb/>
            finished a very pleasant epic poem, (as it appears to me,) to <lb/>
            Cæsar; but I want a trustworthy courier, lest that should <lb/>
            happen which happened to your Erigona, for which alone, <lb/>
            since Cæsar has had the command, the road out of Gaul has <lb/>
            not been safe.</p>
          <p>7. ** * * Well? if I have not good mortar; <lb/>
            ought I to pull down the house 1 which indeed pleases me <lb/>
            more and more every day; and, above all, the lower portico; <lb/>
            and the rooms out of it are admirably made. As to Arcanum, <lb/>
            that is a work of Cæsar himself, or indeed of some still neater <lb/>
            workman: for those images, and that palæstra, and fish-pond, <lb/>
            and stream, is the work of many Philotimi, not Diphili. But <lb/>
            I will myself go there, and send orders, and give directions.</p>
          <p>8. You would complain still more of the will of Felix, if you <lb/>
            knew the truth; for the documents which he thought that <lb/>
            he was signing, in which he had laid down strict directions as. <lb/>
            to the division of his property, he did not sign; (he mistook <lb/>
            partly though his own blunder, and partly through that of <lb/>
            his slave, Sicuras ;) and he signed documents which he did <lb/>
            not intend to sign. But let him bemoan himself. Let us. <lb/>
            take care of ourselves.</p>
          <p>9. I love your Cicero as you beg me, and as he deserves, <lb/>
            and as I ought; but I do not keep him always with me, both. <lb/>
            that I may not withdraw him from his teachers, and because. <lb/>
            his mother Porcia is away, without whom I am afraid of the. <lb/>
            boy's appetite; but still we are a great deal together. I have- <lb/>
            now replied to everything in your letter, my most affectionate <lb/>
            and most excellent brother. Fare you well.</p><pb n="90"/>

          </ab>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The genuineness of this volume has been very commonly doubted; <lb/>
            but that question is one on which it seems now hardly worth while <lb/>
            to enter.</p>
          <p>The first of these Letters was written in the year of Cæsar's murder, <lb/>
            710 A.U.C., in the consulship of Antonius and Dolabella, who seized <lb/>
            that office on the death of Cæsar, which he himself had previously <lb/>
            promised to resign to him.</p>
          <p>Cicero, though he had not been privy to the conspiracy, yet as soon as <lb/>
            the deed was done, ranged himself on the side of the conspirators, <lb/>
            as being the only party with sufficient power to secure order. In <lb/>
            a few days, however, they negotiated with Antony, and he, desirous <lb/>
            to grasp the power which had been possessed by Cæsar, procured <lb/>
            them distant provinces, some of which had been previously assigned <lb/>
            to them by Cæsar. Brutus was to have Macedonia; Cassius, Syria; <lb/>
            and Decimus Brutus, Cisalpine Gaul. Soon afterwards Octavius re- <lb/>
            turned to Italy, arriving at Naples in the middle of April, where he <lb/>
            had an interview with Cicero; and before the end of the month, he <lb/>
            arrived in Rome. Brutus and Cassius had already become unpopular <lb/>
            in the city, and retreated to Lavinium; and Antony now began to <lb/>
            show his hostility to their party, forbidding Decimus Brutus to go <lb/>
            to his province, and prevailing on the senate to transfer Macedonia <lb/>
            and Syria from Marcus Brutus and Cassius to himself and Dolabella, <lb/>
            while they were to have, instead, the charge of supplying the city <lb/>
            with grain. The day after this vote was passed, (June 6,) Cicero had <lb/>
            an interview with Brutus and Cassius at Antium, where nothing was <lb/>
            decided on. As the city-prætor, Brutus ought to have exhibited the <lb/>
            Ludi Apollinares; but he was afraid to return to the city, which <lb/>
            indeed even Cicero did not think that he could do with safety. He <lb/>
            retired to the neighbourhood of Baiæ, while his colleague presided <lb/>
            over the games, which were celebrated at his expense, and with great <lb/>
            magnificence. The conspirators were a little encouraged by news of <lb/>
            some advantages which Sextus Pompey had gained in Spain, though <lb/>
            he did not belong to their party; but he, in consequence, and <lb/>
            learning that Lepidus was raising an army to attack him, proposed <lb/>
            a general disarming of all parties.</p>
          <p>Cicero himself was absent from Rome, visiting different places on the <lb/>
            coast, during the summer. Antony reconciled himself to Antonius, <lb/>
            and by his aid prevailed on the senate to allow him to resign Mace- <lb/>
            donia to his brother Caius, and to give him Decimus Brutus's <lb/>
            province of Cisalpine GauL Brutus and Cassius, as prætors, had no <lb/>
            right to be absent from the city without leave; but they obtained if <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            from the senate, and subsequently quitted Italy for the East with <lb/>
            the resolution to endeavour to make themselves masters by force of <lb/>
            the provinces which had been originally assigned to them, and of <lb/>
            which they had now been deprived. Cicero sailed from Italy, and <lb/>
            went to Syracuse, intending to proceed to Athens; but the wind <lb/>
            being unfavourable, he was driven back to Italy. He returned to <lb/>
            Rome on the last day of August, where he was received with accla- <lb/>
            mations by all parties; but as he refused to appear the next day in <lb/>
            the senate, Antony was offended, and attacked him: and the day <lb/>
            afterwards Cicero delivered his first Philippic. Antony and Octavius <lb/>
            quarrel: Antony leaves Rome for Brundusium, to take the command <lb/>
            of the legions assembled there; and Octavius visits the colonies in <lb/>
            Campania, and then Ravenna, and the towns between Rome and the <lb/>
            frontiers of Gaul. Cicero supports Octavius. Antony returns to <lb/>
            Rome, and again leaves it, and goes northward to attack Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus, who throws himself into Mutina. The consuls-elect for the <lb/>
            ensuing year were Hirtius and Pansa.</p>

          <p>Lucius Clodius, tribune of the people elect, has a very great <lb/>
            liking for me; or, that I may use a more emphatic expression, <lb/>
            has a very great love for me; and as I am quite certain of <lb/>
            that, I have no doubt that you (for you know my disposition <lb/>
            thoroughly) will suppose that he also is beloved by me: for <lb/>
            nothing appears to me to be less becoming to a man, than <lb/>
            not to respond in attachment to those by whom you are in- <lb/>
            vited to it.</p>
          <p>He appeared to me to suspect, (and not indeed, without <lb/>
            great concern,) that something has been reported to you by <lb/>
            his enemies, or rather through the agency of his enemies, by <lb/>
            which your affection has been alienated from him. It is <lb/>
            not my custom, my dear Brutus, (and this I think you know,) <lb/>
            to say anything rashly about another; for it is dangerous, <lb/>
            on account of the secret nature of men's wishes, and the <lb/>
            variety of their characters. But I have thoroughly examined <lb/>
            and understood and appreciated the disposition of Clodius: <lb/>
            there are many indications of it, but not necessary to be <lb/>
            written; for I wish you to look upon this rather as a testi- <lb/>
            monial than as a letter. He was promoted by the favour of <lb/>
            Antony, and a great portion of that very favour is owing tc <lb/>
            you; and therefore, as long as it did not interfere with our <note type="footnote"> 1 Nothing more is known of this Clodius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            safety, he would be glad to see him safe. But he is aware <lb/>
            that matters have been brought into such a state, (for he is, <lb/>
            as you are aware, by no means deficient in acuteness,) that <lb/>
            both cannot be safe: and therefore he prefers that we should <lb/>
            be so. And of you yourself he speaks and feels with the <lb/>
            greatest friendliness: so that if any one has written you a <lb/>
            different account of him, or has sought to give you a different <lb/>
            impression in conversation, I beg of you over and over again <lb/>
            rather to believe me, who am both able to judge of him more <lb/>
            easily than any obscure informer, and am more sincerely at- <lb/>
            tached to you : think therefore that Clodius is most friendly <lb/>
            to you, and that he is such a citizen as a man of the greatest <lb/>
            prudence and of the most affluent fortune ought to be.</p>

          <p>I HAVE been earnestly expecting your letter, which you <lb/>
            wrote after you received the news of the state of our affairs, <lb/>
            and of the death of Trebonius;1 for I have no doubt that you <lb/>
            fully explain your views to me. By a most shameful atrocity, <lb/>
            we have lost a most excellent citizen, and have been expelled <lb/>
            from the possession of the province, which it is easy to <lb/>
            recover; nor will it be less disgraceful or iniquitous that it <lb/>
            should not be recovered, if it be possible. Antony2 is as yet <lb/>
            with us; but, I assure you, I am both moved by the entreaties <lb/>
            of the man, and I am afraid that the madness of some parties <lb/>
            may fall upon him. I am altogether in perplexity. But if I <lb/>
            knew what you thought best, I should be free from anxiety, <note type="footnote"> 1 This was the first blood shed by either party after the death of <lb/>
            Caesar. Trebonius had been assigned the province of Asia Minor, and <lb/>
            had taken possession of it; but Dolabella proceeded through Asia <lb/>
            Minor, to take possession of Syria, where Cassius was already in arms-. <lb/>
            Trebonius did not dare openly to defy him; but the gates of the dif- <lb/>
            ferent cities were closed against him. He attacked Smyrna, in which <lb/>
            Trebonius himself was, scaled the walls by night, seized him in his bed, <lb/>
            and beheaded him; while the soldiers mutilated the body, and tearing <lb/>
            down the head from Dolabella's tribune, kicked it about the streets, till <lb/>
            the features could no longer be recognised. This occurred about the <lb/>
            end of February 711 A.U.C. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Caius Antony, who was a prisoner. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            for I should feel sure that that really was the best. As <lb/>
            soon as possible, therefore, make me acquainted with your <lb/>
            opinions.</p>
          <p>Our friend Cassius has Syria, and the Syrian legions; having <lb/>
            been invited spontaneously by Murcus and Martius, and by <lb/>
            the troops themselves. I have written to my sister Tertia, <lb/>
            and. to my mother, not to spread any account of this most <lb/>
            admirable and fortunate exploit of Cassius, till they knew <lb/>
            your opinion, and till you thought it desirable to do so.</p>
          <p>I have read your two speeches; of which you spoke one <lb/>
            on the 1st of January, and the other was in reply to Calenus, <lb/>
            on the subject of my letters. You now doubtless expect me <lb/>
            to praise them: I know not whether the merit of courage or <lb/>
            of ability displayed in them be the greater. I now grant that <lb/>
            they may be called Philippics, as you wrote, jestingly, in one <lb/>
            of your letters. We are in need of two things, my dear <lb/>
            Cicero; money, and reinforcements; one of which may be <lb/>
            hastened by you, I mean that some portion of the troops <lb/>
            from Italy may be sent to us, either secretly, and in spite of <lb/>
            Pansa, or else by an open motion in the senate; the other <lb/>
            thing, money, which is still more necessary, not more for my <lb/>
            troops than those of the other commanders, * * <lb/>
            On this account I am the more concerned that we have lost <lb/>
            Asia; which I hear is oppressed to such a degree by Dolabella, <lb/>
            that the murder of Trebonius no longer appears his most <lb/>
            barbarous action. Vetus Antistius, however, has aided me <lb/>
            with money.</p>
          <p>Your son Cicero endears himself to me so greatly by his <lb/>
            industry, patience, diligence, and magnanimity,-in short, by <lb/>
            the performance of every kind of duty, that he seems never <lb/>
            for a moment to forget whose son he is. Though, therefore, <lb/>
            I cannot make you love him more than you do, since he is <lb/>
            already most dear to you; at least allow so much weight to <lb/>
            my opinion, as to feel sure that he will not have to appropriate <lb/>
            any of your glory, in order to arrive at honours similar to <lb/>
            those of his father. <lb/>

          <p>You have been able to learn the admirable disposition of <lb/>

            of his legions and auxiliary troops, and, in short, of his whole <lb/>

              (who, next to his own brother, hates his relations above all <lb/>
              people,) and his invariably hostile feelings towards the com- <lb/>
              monwealth. My expectation disquiets me, the fulfilment of <lb/>
              which is wholly reduced to an extremely critical state; for all <lb/>
              my hopes depend on the delivery of Brutus, for whom I was <lb/>
              in a state of great alarm.</p>
          <p>At present, I have sufficient difficulty here, with that mad- <lb/>
            man Servilius, with whom I have borne longer than my <lb/>
            dignity fairly allowed; but I did bear with him for the sake <lb/>
            of the republic, that I might not give the profligate portion <lb/>
            of the citizens a man, not indeed of great wisdom, but of <lb/>
            noble birth, to whom they might flock as a leader—which, <lb/>
            nevertheless, they do. But I did not think it right that he <lb/>
            should be alienated from the republic. However, I have done <lb/>
            with enduring him now, for he had begun to show such inso- <lb/>
            lence, that he looked upon no one as free. In the case of <lb/>
            Plancus, he burst forth with incredible indignation, and con- <lb/>
            tended with me in such a spirit for two days, and was so <lb/>
            completely beaten by me, that I hope that he will be more <lb/>
            modest hereafter. And while this very contest was going <lb/>
            on, at the time when the debate was proceeding with the <lb/>
            greatest vehemence, on the 9th of April, a letter was deli- <lb/>
            vered to me in the senate, from our friend Lentulus, with an <lb/>
            account of Cassius and his legions, and Syria; and as soon <lb/>
            as I had read it aloud, Servilius lost heart, as well as many <lb/>
            others, for there are several other persons of high rank who <lb/>
            are thoroughly disaffected: but Servilius was exceedingly <lb/>
            indignant that assent was expressed to my opinion about <lb/>
            Plancus. He is a great monster in regard to the common- <lb/>
            wealth, but * * *</p>

          <p>As to your remark that you are in need of two necessary <lb/>
            things, reinforcements and money, it is very difficult to know <lb/>
            what advice to give you; for no means occur to my recol- <lb/>
            lection, which I consider that you can use, except those which <lb/>
            the senate has voted, giving you the power of borrowing <lb/>
            money from the different cities. But about the reinforce- <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            ment, I do not see what can be done; foi so far is Pansa <lb/>
            from being able to afford you any portion of his army, or <lb/>
            of his new levies, that he is even greatly annoyed at so many <lb/>
            volunteers going to you; in my opinion, because he thinks <lb/>
            -that for those affairs about which there is now a contention <lb/>
            in Italy, no forces can be too great; but as many people <lb/>
            suspect, because he has no desire for you to become too strong. <lb/>
            I, however, have no suspicion of this kind.</p>
          <p>With regard to what you say, that you have written to <lb/>
            your sister Tertia, bidding her not to make public the things <lb/>
            which have been done by Cassius, till I approved of it, I see <lb/>
            that you were afraid of what there was good reason to fear, <lb/>
            namely, that the disposition of Cæsar's party (as parties have <lb/>
            still distinctive appellations) would be greatly excited by the <lb/>
            intelligence. But, before we received your letters, the affair <lb/>
            was known and spread abroad; and, besides, your couriers <lb/>
            had brought letters to many of your friends. The fact was <lb/>
            therefore not to be suppressed, since, indeed, it could not be <lb/>
            done; and if it could have been done, we should have thought <lb/>
            it a matter not to be published, rather than wholly concealed. <lb/>
            With respect to my Cicero, if there really is as much in him <lb/>
            as you say in your letter, I am as glad as I ought to be; and <lb/>
            if, because you love him, you make his merits so much the <lb/>
            greater, I still rejoice extremely on that very account, that he <lb/>
            is beloved by you. <lb/>

          <p>AFTER I had given Scaptius letters for you on the morning <lb/>
            of the 11th of April, the same day I received one from you <lb/>
            in the evening, dated on the 1st of April, from Dyrrhachium; <lb/>
            and, therefore, when on the next day I was informed by <lb/>
            Scaptius that the men to whom he had given the letters the <lb/>
            day before had not started, but were going to set off imme- <lb/>
            diately, I scratched these few lines to you in the midst of the <lb/>
            confusion of my morning levee. About Cassius I am delighted, <lb/>
            and congratulate the republic on his success; I congra- <lb/>
            tulate myself too, for having delivered my opinion in spite of <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            the opposition and anger of Pansa, that Cassius should pur- <lb/>
            sue Dolabella actively as an enemy; and I declared with <lb/>
            great boldness that he was already carrying on that war with <lb/>
            out waiting for any decree of the senate from us. I also said <lb/>
            about you what I thought at that time ought to be said.</p>
          <p>This speech of mine will be sent to you, since I see that you <lb/>
            are pleased with my Philippics.</p>
          <p>As to my advice that you ask respecting Caius Antonius, <lb/>
            I think that you ought to keep him prisoner till we know the <lb/>
            result of the affairs of Brutus.1 From the letters which you <lb/>
            have sent me, Dolabella seems to be oppressing Asia, and <lb/>
            conducting himself most shamefully in that province; but <lb/>
            you have written to several people that " Dolabella has been <lb/>
            shut out by the Rhodians." Now, if he has been to Rhodes, <lb/>
            it seems to me that he must have left Asia; and if that <lb/>
            be the case, I think that you ought to stay there; but if <lb/>
            he has once got possession of the place, then, believe me, you <lb/>
            ought not, but should, as I think, pursue him into Asia. <lb/>
            You seem to be likely to do nothing better at the present <lb/>
            moment * * *</p>

          <p>I CONCLUDE that your relations, to none of whom do I yield <lb/>
            in attachment to you, have informed you what letter was <lb/>
            read publicly in the senate on the 13th of April in your <lb/>
            name, and at the same time in that of Antony. But it <lb/>
            was not necessary that we should all write about the same <lb/>
            things; what was necessary for me to write to you was, what <lb/>
            I thought of the entire conduct of this war, and what my <lb/>
            deliberate opinion and sentiments were. My feeling, my <lb/>
            dear Brutus, with respect to the republic in general, has <lb/>
            always been the same as your own; my plan of action in some <lb/>
            points, not indeed in all, may perhaps have been a little more <lb/>
            vigorous. You know that my opinion has always been, that <lb/>
            the republic should be delivered not only from the tyrant, but <lb/>
            also from the tyranny. You adopted more gentle notions, <note type="footnote"> 1 Docimus Brutus. </note> <note type="footnote"> IT </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            certainly, to your own immortal honour; but which of the <lb/>
            two plans was the better, we have felt with great grief, and <lb/>
            still feel, to our great danger. On that recent occasion you <lb/>
            referred everything to the object of ensuring peace, which <lb/>
            could not be managed by mere speeches; I directed all my <lb/>
            aims to secure liberty, which indeed can have no existence <lb/>
            without peace; and peace itself I thought could be best esta- <lb/>
            blished by war and arms.</p>
          <p>Zeal was not wanting to those who cried for arms, but we <lb/>
            repressed their impetuosity, and checked their ardour. In <lb/>
            consequence, our affairs fell into such a state, that if some <lb/>
            god had not inspired Cæsar Octavianus with the feelings which <lb/>
            animated him, we must have fallen into the power of that <lb/>
            most abandoned and infamous man, Mark Antony, with whom <lb/>
            you see how great and perilous a contest there is; and there <lb/>
            would have been none, if Antony had not been spared on <lb/>
            that occasion.1</p>
          <p>But I forbear to speak of those matters; for the exploit <lb/>
            then performed by you,2 an exploit ever memorable, and almost <lb/>
            divine, precludes all blame; and, indeed, it cannot be extolled <lb/>
            with all the praise that it deserves.</p>
          <p>You have lately appeared of a grave countenance. You <lb/>
            have collected by yourself, in a short time, an army, and <lb/>
            troops, and a sufficient number of legions. 0 ye immortal gods, <lb/>
            what an announcement was that, what a letter! how great <lb/>
            was the joy of the senate! how extreme the alacrity of the <lb/>
            whole city! I never saw anything extolled with such unani- <lb/>
            mity. There had been some expectation about the remains <lb/>
            of Antony's force, whom you had deprived of his cavalry and <lb/>
            of the chief part of his legions; but it came to such an end <lb/>
            -as we could have wished; for your letter, which was read in <lb/>
            the senate, shows the wisdom of the general, the valour of the <lb/>
            soldiers, the industry of your friends, and among them of my <lb/>
            Cicero. Had it seemed advisable to your friends that a <lb/>
            motion should be made respecting your letter, and had it not <lb/>
            arrived at a most turbulent time, after the departure of Pansa <lb/>
            the consul, proper and deserved honours would have been <lb/>
            decreed to the immortal gods on the occasion.</p>
          <p>Behold, on the 13th of April, early in the morning, your <lb/>
            rapid courier, Pilus, arrives. What a man! 0 ye gods, how <note type="footnote"> 1 When Cæsar was murdered. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 The assassination of Cæsar. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            grave! how steady! how well affected to the republic! He <lb/>
            brings two letters, one in your name, and one in that of <lb/>
            Antony. He delivers them to Servilius the tribune of the <lb/>
            people, Servilius gives them to Cornutus; they are read in <lb/>
            the senate : “ Antony the proconsul." There was great asto- <lb/>
            nishment, just as if any one had read “Dolabella the <lb/>
            emperor :” from whom, indeed, couriers had arrived, but no <lb/>
            one like Pilus, bold enough to produce the letters, or deliver <lb/>
            them to the magistrates.</p>
          <p>Your letter was read; it was short, indeed, but very <lb/>
            mild towards Antony. The senate admired it greatly; to me <lb/>
            it was not quite clear what I ought to do. Should I pronounce <lb/>
            it forged ? But what if you owned it ? Should I pronounce <lb/>
            it genuine ? That was not for your honour.1 The day, there- <lb/>
            fore, was suffered to pass in silence.</p>
          <p>But the next day, when conversation on the matter had <lb/>
            become general, and when Pilus had given a great deal of <lb/>
            apparent offence, a commencement was fairly made on my <lb/>
            part. I said a good deal about the “ proconsul Antony." <lb/>
            Sextius was not wanting to the cause; and afterwards he <lb/>
            spoke to me, observing in how much danger he thought his <lb/>
            son and mine would be, if they had taken up arms against a <lb/>
            proconsul. You know the man; he did full justice to the <lb/>
            argument. Others spoke too; and our friend Labeo remarked <lb/>
            that your seal was not affixed to the letter, or the date added, <lb/>
            and that you had not written to your relations, as you used <lb/>
            to do. By this he wished to prove that the letter was forged; <lb/>
            and, if you wish to know more, did prove it.</p>
          <p>Now, my dear Brutus, you have to decide upon the whole <lb/>
            plan of the war. I see that you are pleased with lenity, and <lb/>
            think it of the greatest advantage. It is very honourable, but <lb/>
            it is in a different situation of affairs, and at other seasons, <lb/>
            that there is room for clemency. At present, my dear <lb/>
            Brutus, what is the state of affairs ? The hopes of the needy <lb/>
            and profligate point to the destruction of the temples of the <lb/>
            immortal gods; nor, indeed, is anything else to be determined <lb/>
            by this war, but whether we are to exist, or not.</p>
          <p>Who is it that we are sparing, and what are we doing I <note type="footnote"> 1 For if Antony had been a legal proconsul, it must have been not <lb/>
            only dishonourable, but criminal in Brutus, to act against him as an <lb/>
            enemy.—Middleton. </note> <note type="footnote"> n 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            Are we thinking of the safety of those, by whom, if they should <lb/>
            be victorious, not a trace of us will be left ? For what differ- <lb/>
            ence is there between Dolabella and any one of the three <lb/>
            Antonies ? If we spare any one of them, we shall have been <lb/>
            too harsh with Dolabella. Although the state of affairs <lb/>
            themselves compelled the senate and people of Rome to <lb/>
            embrace such opinions as these, still it was only brought about <lb/>
            in a very great degree by my prudence and authority.</p>
          <p>If you do not approve this course, I will defend the opinion <lb/>
            which you may express, but shall not abandon my own. Men <lb/>
            expect from you nothing careless on the one hand, or cruel <lb/>
            on the other. Moderation in this matter is easy, by being <lb/>
            strict to the leaders, but liberal to the common soldiers.</p>
          <p>I wish, my dear Brutus, that you would have my Cicero <lb/>
            with you as much as possible. He will find no better school <lb/>
            of virtue than the contemplation and imitation of you. <lb/>

          <p>SUCH are the feelings of Vetus Antistius towards the com- <lb/>
            monwealth, that I do not doubt that he would have proved <lb/>
            himself a most strenuous defender of the common liberty in <lb/>
            reference to Cæsar and Antony, if he could have found an <lb/>
            opportunity; for he who, when he encountered Dolabella in <lb/>
            Achaia, furnished with infantry and cavalry, preferred to run <lb/>
            any risk from the treachery of a bandit ready for everything, <lb/>
            rather than seem either to have been compelled to give, or to <lb/>
            have given willingly, any money to that most profligate and <lb/>
            infamous person, has of his own accord promised us, and <lb/>
            actually given, above sixteen thousand pounds1 out of his <lb/>
            own funds; and, what is much more valuable still, he has <lb/>
            offered us himself, and united himself to us.</p>
          <p>I have endeavoured to persuade him to remain as general <lb/>
            in the camp, and to aid in the defence of the republic ; but <lb/>
            he considered that he ought to depart, since he had disbanded <note type="footnote"> 1 HSXX. Paul Manutius admonishes us that we must take this for <lb/>

            his army; but he promised to return to us immediately, <lb/>
            accepting an appointment as lieutenant, unless the consuls <lb/>
            should proceed to hold comitia for the election of prætors. <lb/>
            For I earnestly recommended him, as he was so well affected <lb/>
            to the commonwealth, not to postpone offering himself as a <lb/>
            candidate. His conduct ought to be acceptable to all, at <lb/>
            least such as look upon this as the army of the republic ; and <lb/>
            so much the more pleasing to you, as you defend our liberty <lb/>
            with greater courage and glory, and as you will gain a greater <lb/>
            accession of dignity, if that result for which we hope shall <lb/>
            attend our counsels.</p>
          <p>Moreover, my dear Cicero, I beg of you most particularly, <lb/>
            and as a friend may, to look favourably on Vetus, and to <lb/>
            exert yourself to add to his honours; since, although nothing <lb/>
            can turn him aside from the path which he has chosen, yet <lb/>
            he may be excited by your praises and kindness to adhere <lb/>
            more vigorously and tenaciously to his resolution; and this <lb/>
            will very much oblige me.</p>

            the republic and by your pre-eminent dignity, he would be <lb/>
            glad to obtain some post by your means.</p>
          <p>I recommend to you, my dear Brutus, a brave man, a pru- <lb/>
            dent man, and, if that be anything to the purpose, a wealthy <lb/>
            man. It will give me great pleasure if you treat him in such <lb/>

          <p>AT the time that I was writing this letter, matte:? were <lb/>
            supposed to have been reduced to the last extremity; for <lb/>
            melancholy letters and news arrived about our friend Brutus. <lb/>
            They did not indeed very much disturb me, for I could by no <lb/>
            means distrust the armies and generals whom we have; <lb/>
            yet I did not agree with the majority, for I had not a bad <lb/>
            opinion of the fidelity of the consuls, which was strongly <lb/>
            suspected. I desired in some particulars more prudence and <lb/>
            promptness; and if they had exerted those qualities, we <lb/>
            should have already reestablished the republic.</p>
          <p>For you are not ignorant how great is the importance <lb/>
            of seasonableness in public affairs, and what a difference it <lb/>
            makes, whether the same thing be determined, undertaken, <lb/>
            or done, a little sooner or a little later. If everything that <lb/>
            was voted with resolution in this tumult, had either been <lb/>
            done on the day on which I delivered my opinion, and not <lb/>
            postponed from day to day, or if, from the time when things <lb/>
            were engaged to be done, they had not been still delayed and <lb/>
            procrastinated, we should now have no war at all.</p>
          <p>I, my dear Brutus, have done everything for the republic <lb/>
            that a man is bound to do, who has been placed in the rank <lb/>
            in which I have been, by the deliberate judgment of the <lb/>
            senate and people; not merely those things, which indeed are <lb/>
            all that are to be required of a man, good faith, vigilance, <lb/>
            and attachment to my country; for those are duties which <lb/>
            every man ought to practise; but, by him who delivers his <lb/>
            opinion on affairs of a state among the chief men of it, I <lb/>
            think that prudence ought also to be exhibited; nor, when. <lb/>
            I have taken so much upon myself as to assume the helm <lb/>
            of the state, do I think myself less liable to reproof if I have <lb/>
            given any unprofitable advice to the senate, than I should <lb/>
            be if I had given any that is treacherous.</p>
          <p>I am aware that a careful account is sent to you of what <lb/>
            has been done, and what is going forward. But there is also <lb/>
            something on my part of which I wish you to be informed, <lb/>
            namely, that my mind is fixed on the war, and that I attend <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            to no other obje A, unless perchance the advantage of the <lb/>
            republic calls me to something else; and the chief part of <lb/>
            my thoughts are directed towards Cassius and yourself. Pre- <lb/>
            pare yourself, therefore, my dear Brutus, to understand, that <lb/>
            if affairs turn out well at this crisis, it is by you that the <lb/>
            republic must be improved; or, if any miscarriage takes place, <lb/>
            it is by you that the republic must be restored.</p>

          <p>OUR affairs seemed to be in a better position; for I know <lb/>
            for a certainty that an account has been sent to you of <lb/>
            what has taken place. The consuls have proved to be just <lb/>
            such men as I often described them to you ; but the natural <lb/>
            inclination of young Cæsar for virtue is marvellous. I trust <lb/>
            that when he is in the full possession of honours and influence, <lb/>
            we may be able to guide and restrain him with as much ease- <lb/>
            as we have controlled him hitherto. No doubt that will be <lb/>
            a more difficult task, but still we do not despair, for the <lb/>
            young man feels altogether persuaded, chiefly by me, that it <lb/>
            is through his means that we have been saved; and, doubt- <lb/>
            less, if he had not kept Antony away from the city, all would <lb/>
            have been lost.</p>
          <p>But three or four days before this most fortunate event,. <lb/>
            the whole city, under the influence of some alarm, were <lb/>
            running off with their wives and children to you; but having <lb/>
            by the 20th of April recovered their spirits, they were de- <lb/>
            sirous rather that you should come hither, than that they <lb/>
            should go to you. On that day, indeed, I reaped the greatest <lb/>
            reward of all my great labours and long anxiety, if indeed <lb/>
            there is any reward in solid and true glory; for a concourse <lb/>
            of as numerous a multitude as our city can contain flocked to <lb/>
            my house; by whom I was conducted as far as the Capitol, <lb/>
            and then, with the utmost acclamations and applause, placed <lb/>
            in the rostrum. There is no vanity in me, nor ought there <lb/>
            to be any; but yet the unanimity, the avowed gratitude, and <lb/>
            the congratulations of all ranks of men excite me, because it <lb/>
            is glorious for me to be popular from having secured the <lb/>
            welfare of the people. But I would rather that you should <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            hear of these things from others; and I would wish you <lb/>
            to keep me informed, with the utmost care, of all your affairs <lb/>
            and plans, and to beware lest your easiness of dealing with <lb/>
            people may seem to resemble indifference. The senate feels, <lb/>
            and the Roman people feel, that no enemies were ever more <lb/>
            worthy of the last extremity of punishment, than those <lb/>
            citizens who in this war have taken up arms against their <lb/>
            country; on whom I cry for vengeance, and whom I attack <lb/>
            with every vote that I give, while all honest men approve of <lb/>
            my conduct.</p>
          <p>How you ought to judge of this matter, is a question for <lb/>
            your own prudence. My opinion is, that the cause of the <lb/>
            three brothers is one and the same. We have lost two con- <lb/>
            suls, honest men, indeed, but honest men merely. Hirtius, <lb/>
            it is true, died in the hour of victory, after he had defeated <lb/>
            the enemy, a few days before, in a great battle; for Pansa <lb/>
            had retired from the field, after receiving some wounds under <lb/>
            which he could not support himself. Brutus 1 is pursuing <lb/>
            the remains of the enemy, and so is Cæsar. All those who <lb/>
            have adhered to the party of Mark Antony have been de- <lb/>
            clared public enemies; and accordingly most men interpret <lb/>
            that decree of the senate as affecting those whom you have <lb/>
            in your hands, whether captured, or having surrendered. I <lb/>
            myself, indeed, advanced nothing more severe when I was <lb/>
            giving judgment on Caius Antonius by name, as I had settled <lb/>
            my opinion, that the senate ought to learn his case from you. <lb/>

          <p>ON the 22d of April, when opinions were given in the <lb/>
            senate about the propriety of pursuing with war those who <lb/>
            had been declared enemies, Servilius included Ventidius in <lb/>
            the number, and added, that Cassius ought to pursue Dola- <lb/>
            bella. Having expressed my agreement with him, I proposed <lb/>
            further, that you also, if you thought it desirable, and for the <lb/>
            advantage of the state, should pursue Dolabella with your <note type="footnote"> i Decimus Brutus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            army; but that, if you could not do so with any benefit to <lb/>
            the state, or if you did not conceive that it would be fof <lb/>
            the public advantage, you should keep your army where it <lb/>
            is. The senate could do nothing more honourable, than to <lb/>
            leave it wholly to you to decide upon what appeared to you <lb/>
            most beneficial for the commonwealth.</p>
          <p>My own opinion, indeed, is, that if Dolabella has any force, <lb/>
            if he has a camp, or any ground on which to make a stand, <lb/>
            it will be becoming your character and your dignity to pur- <lb/>
            sue him.</p>
          <p>Of the forces of our friend Cassius we knew nothing, for <lb/>
            no letters have come from him, nor was any news brought <lb/>
            upon which we could rely as certain. But of how much <lb/>
            importance it is that Dolabella should be crushed, you are <lb/>
            certainly aware, not only that he may receive the punishment <lb/>
            due to his atrocities, but that there may be no place to <lb/>
            which the leaders of the rebels may betake themselves in <lb/>
            their flight from Mutina. And that this was my opinion <lb/>
            even before, you may call to mind from my former letters; <lb/>
            although at that time there was a haven of refuge in your <lb/>
            camp, and a resource for safety in your army; for which <lb/>
            reason, now that we are delivered from our dangers, as I <lb/>
            trust that we are, we ought the more to devote ourselves to <lb/>
            the destruction of Dolabella. However, you will give a still <lb/>
            more diligent consideration to these matters, and come to a <lb/>
            wise determination respecting them. You will give us in- <lb/>
            formation, if you please, how you decide, and what you are <lb/>
            doing.</p>
          <p>I am very anxious to have my Cicero elected into your <lb/>
            college,1 and I certainly think that, in the comitia for the <lb/>
            election of priests, a regard for the wishes of the absent mem- <lb/>
            bers may be had; for such a thing has been done before ; <lb/>
            since Caius Marius, when he was in Cappadocia, was made <lb/>
            augur by the Domitian law: nor has any law prohibited such <lb/>
            a thing from being done in future.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in the Julian law, which is the most recent law <lb/>
            on the subject of appointments to the priesthood, there is a <lb/>
            clause in these words, " Who is present as a candidate, or to <lb/>
            whom regard shall be had," which clearly shows that regard <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, of the Pontifices, or minor priests, in which there weri <lb/>
            several vacancies at th's time.—See Letter XIV. Middleton. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            may be had to a person, even though he is not present. On <lb/>
            this subject I have written to him to follow your advice, as in <lb/>
            everything else. You must also determine what is to be done <lb/>
            with respect to Domitius and to our friend Cato. But, though <lb/>
            it may be lawful for regard to be had to a person in his <lb/>
            absence, yet everything is easier to those who are on the spot. <lb/>
            If you decide, however, that you must go into Asia, there will <lb/>
            be no possibility of bringing our friends hither for the <lb/>
            comitia.</p>
          <p>We certainly expected that if Pansa had been alive, every- <lb/>
            thing would have been sooner settled; for he would at once have <lb/>
            chosen himself a colleague, [in the room of Hirtius,] and then <lb/>
            the comitia for the election of priests would have taken place <lb/>
            before those for the election of prætors; but now I foresee a <lb/>
            great deal of delay by means of the auspices; for, while there <lb/>
            shall be one patrician magistrate, the auspices cannot lapse <lb/>
            into the hands of the senators. Certainly affairs are in a state <lb/>
            of great confusion. I should wish you to put me in posses- <lb/>
            sion of your sentiments on the whole matter.-The 5th of <lb/>

          <p>IT is easier for you to imagine, than for me to express, how <lb/>
            much delight I felt on learning the exploits of our Brutus <lb/>
            and the consuls. I am pleased with other things, and am glad <lb/>
            that they happened; but I am especially delighted that the <lb/>
            sally made by Brutus was not only advantageous to him- <lb/>
            self, but of the greatest service to the attainment of the <lb/>
            victory. As to what you say, in your letter, that the cause <lb/>
            of the three Antonies is one and the same, and that it is for <lb/>
            me to determine what opinions I should entertain, I have <lb/>
            no opinion but this, that the right of decision concerning <lb/>
            those citizens who were not killed in the battle against us, <lb/>
            belongs to the senate or people of Rome.</p>
          <p>But, you will reply, you are wrong in this, that you call <lb/>
            men of a hostile disposition to the republic, citizens. Nay, <lb/>
            I am strictly right; for what the senate has not yet decreed, <lb/>
            or the Roman people ordered. I do not arrogantly pre- <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            judge, or bring under my own decision. Nor do I change <lb/>
            my feelings with regard to this particular in my conduct, <lb/>
            that from him whom circumstances did not compel me to <lb/>
            put to death,l I neither took anything away with cruelty, <lb/>
            nor did I treat him with at all too much indulgence, but kept <lb/>
            him in my power as long as the war lasted. I look upon it <lb/>
            as by far more honourable, and what the republic may <lb/>
            better allow, to abstain from persecuting the miserable in <lb/>
            their misfortunes, rather than to heap boundless powers on <lb/>
            those already powerful, which may but excite their cupidity <lb/>
            and arrogance.</p>
          <p>In this respect, my dear Cicero, best and bravest of men,. <lb/>
            deservedly most dear to me for my own sake, and for that of <lb/>
            the republic, you seem to trust too much to your hopes, and to <lb/>
            be too willing, as soon as any one has done anything properly, <lb/>
            to give and entrust everything to him, as if it were not easy <lb/>
            for a mind corrupted by bribery to be led away to evil counsels. <lb/>
            Such is your good temper, that you will bear an admonition <lb/>
            with equanimity, especially in regard to the safety of the <lb/>
            commonwealth. Still, you will do what you yourself think <lb/>
            best, and I will do the same when you have given me your <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>At present, my dear Cicero, we must take care not to exult <lb/>
            idly at the overthrow of Antony, and not to allow our method <lb/>
            of eradicating the first evil to cause the production of a <lb/>
            second and worse calamity; for no misfortune can now befal <lb/>
            us, either through inadvertence, or passive permission, in <lb/>
            which there would not be something to blame in all, and <lb/>
            especially in you, whose authority the senate and people of <lb/>
            Rome not only allow, but desire to be, as great as that of one- <lb/>
            man can possibly be in a free state;—authority which you <lb/>
            are bound to uphold by cherishing sentiments, not only of <lb/>
            honour, but of prudence. Nor is any exercise of prudence, <lb/>
            of which you have abundance, necessary to be demanded <lb/>
            from you, except moderation in dispensing honours. All <lb/>
            other eminent qualities are found in you in such a degree <lb/>
            that they may be compared to those of any of the ancients ; <lb/>
            but this one propensity of yours, proceeding, as it does, from- <lb/>
            grateful and liberal feelings, requires to be checked by a more <note type="footnote"> 1 He refers again to Cams Antony, who was in his power, and seem. <lb/>
            to think the war terminated by the battle of Mutina. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            cautious and moderate exercise of generosity; fcr the senate <lb/>
            ought to give nothing to any one, wh ch may be either a pre- <lb/>
            cedent or a protection to disaffected persons. I am very <lb/>
            apprehensive, therefore, about the consulship, lest your friend <lb/>
            Cæsar should think that he has already mounted higher <lb/>
            through your decrees than he will rise from his present <lb/>
            eminence, if he become consul. But if Antony found in <lb/>
            the instruments of regal power left him by another an oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of assuming regal power himself, of what disposition <lb/>
            do you think any one likely to be, who by the authority, not <lb/>
            of a slain tyrant, but of the senate itself, imagines that he has <lb/>
            a right to covet all imaginable power ?</p>
          <p>I shall then, accordingly, praise your good fortune and your <lb/>
            prudence, when I begin to see clearly that Cæsar will be <lb/>
            contented with the extraordinary honours which he has al- <lb/>
            ready received. Are you then, you will say, going to make <lb/>
            me liable for the misconduct of another? For another's mis- <lb/>
            conduct assuredly, if measures might have been taken to <lb/>
            prevent its occurrence. I only wish that you could clearly <lb/>
            see my fears respecting him.</p>
          <p>After I had written this letter, I heard that you were made <lb/>
            consul. If I really see that come to pass, I shall then indeed <lb/>
            begin to imagine to myself a true republic, relying on its own <lb/>
            strength. Your son is well, and has beeu sent forward into <lb/>

          <p>No one can know better than yourself, whose exertions and <lb/>
            anxieties for the commonwealth have been so great, how dear <lb/>
            Lucius Bibulus ought to be to me. And, therefore, either <lb/>
            his own virtue, or our friendship, ought sufficiently to recom- <lb/>
            mend him to you; so that I think I need not write at any <lb/>
            length to you. For my wishes ought to have influence with <lb/>
            you, provided they are reasonable, or provided they are ex- <lb/>
            pressed in compliance with a necessary duty. He has resolved <lb/>
            to be a candidate for l'ansa's place; and we both solicit <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            a nomination for it from you; for you cannot confer this <lb/>
            favour on one more closely connected with you than I am, or <lb/>
            nominate any one more deserving than Bibulus.</p>
          <p>Why need I say anything about Domitius and Apuleius, <lb/>
            when they are thoroughly recommended to you by their own <lb/>
            good qualities? Still you ought to support Apuleius by your <lb/>
            influence; but the character of Domitius will be made <lb/>
            apparent from his own letter. Do not exclude Bibulus from <lb/>
            your confidence, a man of such merit already, that, believe <lb/>
            me, he is likely to become one that may deserve the praises <lb/>
            of the few resembling yourself.</p>

          <p>Do not wait for me to offer you any formal expression of <lb/>
            thanks; for such formality ought long ago to have been <lb/>
            banished from our friendship, which has arrived at the utmost <lb/>
            degree of affection.</p>
          <p>Your son is not with me at present; but we are to meet in <lb/>
            Macedonia; for he has been ordered to bring the cavalry <lb/>
            from Ambracia through Thessaly, and I have written to him <lb/>
            to meet me at Heraclea. When I see him, since you give me <lb/>
            leave to do so, we will settle the matter together about his <lb/>
            returning to offer himself a candidate, or to recommend him- <lb/>
            self for that honour. I most earnestly recommend to you <lb/>
            Glycon, Pansa's physician, who is married to the sister of our <lb/>
            friend Achilles; for we hear that he has fallen under sus- <lb/>
            picion with Torquatus of having been accessory to the death <lb/>
            of Pansa, and is kept in prison as a murderer; but nothing <lb/>
            is less worthy of belief; for who has suffered more misfortune <lb/>
            by the death of Pansa ? Moreover, he is a modest and pru- <lb/>
            dent man; one whom no personal advantage seems likely <lb/>
            to have prompted to crime. I entreat you, and, indeed, <lb/>
            earnestly entreat you, (for our friend suffers no less anxiety <lb/>
            than is natural,) to deliver him from custody and to save <lb/>
            him. I think that this concerns my duty in regard to my <lb/>
            private affairs as much as any other thing whatever.</p>
          <p>While I was writing this letter to you, a letter was <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            delivered to me by Satrius, the lieutenant of Cams Trebonius, <lb/>
            from Tullius and Deiotarus, with the news that Dolabella had <lb/>
            been defeated and put to flight.</p>
          <p>I have sent you a Greek letter from a man named Cyche- <lb/>
            reus, which was written to Satrius.</p>
          <p>My friend Flavius has chosen you as arbitrator in a dis- <lb/>
            pute which he has with the people of Dyrrhachium about an <lb/>
            estate; and both I and Flavius, my dear Cicero, entreat you <lb/>
            to bring the affair to a settlement. There is no doubt what- <lb/>
            ever, that the city was indebted to the man who has made <lb/>
            Flavius his heir; nor do the Dyrrhachians themselves deny <lb/>
            this; but they declare that the debt was remitted by Cæsar. <lb/>
            Do not allow an injury to be done by your friends to my <lb/>
            friend.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AFTER my letter had been written and sealed up, a letter <lb/>
            was brought to me from you full of news: and, what was the <lb/>
            strangest of all things, saying, that Dolabella had sent five <lb/>
            cohorts into the Chersonese. Has he such an abundance of <lb/>
            men with him, that he, who was said to be fleeing from Asia, <lb/>
            can attempt to attack Europe? And did he think that he <lb/>
            would be able to do anything with five cohorts, when you <lb/>
            have in that country five legions, an excellent body of cavalry, <lb/>
            and a very numerous force of allies? I hope indeed that <lb/>
            those cohorts are already yours, since that robber has been <lb/>
            so insane.</p>
          <p>I greatly approve of your wisdom, in not having moved <lb/>
            your army from Apollonia and Dyrrhachium until you heard <lb/>
            of the flight of Antony, the sally of Brutus, and the victory <lb/>
            of the Roman people. As to what you write, therefore, that <lb/>
            you have since determined to lead your army into the <lb/>
            Chersonese, and not to permit the empire of the Roman <lb/>
            people to be a sport to a most profligate enemy, you act as <lb/>
            becomes your own dignity, and for the advantage of the <lb/>
            republic. <note type="footnote"> 1 A. mountainous district between Macedonia and Illyricum. </note> <pb n="111"/>
            </p>
          <p>With respect to your intelligence of the sedition which has <lb/>
            taken place in the fourth legion about Caius Antony, (you <lb/>
            will take what I say in good part,) the severity of the soldiers <lb/>
            pleases me better than your own.</p>
          <p>I am very glad indeed that you have experienced the good- <lb/>
            will of the army and of the cavalry.</p>
          <p>If you have any news about Dolabella, you will send me <lb/>
            word of it, as you promise; with respect to whom, I am <lb/>
            very much pleased that I had provided beforehand that your <lb/>
            judgment should be unfettered as to carrying on war against <lb/>
            him; it was of very great importance to the republic, as I <lb/>
            perceived at the time; and, as I now think, to your own <lb/>
            dignity.</p>
          <p>As to what you write, that " I have managed so as to be <lb/>
            able to pursue the Antonies at perfect leisure," and praise me <lb/>
            for having done so, I dare say that such appears to you to be <lb/>
            the case; but I myself am far from approving of the dis- <lb/>
            tinction which you draw; for you write, that " civil wars are <lb/>
            to be prevented with more resolution, than revenge is to be <lb/>
            inflicted on the vanquished." On this point, my dear Brutus, <lb/>
            I most completely disagree with you; not that I yield to <lb/>
            you in clemency; but a salutary severity is far superior to an <lb/>
            empty show of mercy. If we are determined to be merciful, <lb/>
            we shall never be without civil wars. However, this you <lb/>
            must settle. As to myself, I may say what the Father in <lb/>
            Plautus's Trinummus says, <lb/>
            But for my part, my life is almost ended; <lb/>
            You are the most concern'd.</p>
          <p>Take my word for it, my dear Brutus, you will be crushed, <lb/>
            if you do not take care: for you will not always have the <lb/>
            people in the same disposition as at present; nor the senate; <lb/>
            nor the leader of the senate. You may receive this as do- <lb/>
            clared to you by the oracle of the Pythian Apollo; nothing <lb/>
            can be more true. 18th of May.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>You write me word, that Cicero is surprised that I never <lb/>
            give any opinion of his actions. Since you press 1 he question, <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            I will, under compulsion from you, tell you what I think. 1 <lb/>
            know that Cicero has done everything with the best inten- <lb/>
            tions: for what is better known to me than his disposition <lb/>
            towards the republic? Yet he seems to me, though of all <lb/>
            men the most prudent, to have done some things (what shall <lb/>
            I say?) imprudently, or with a view to popularity, since in <lb/>
            the cause of the republic he has not hesitated to make the <lb/>
            most powerful Antony his enemy. I know not what to say <lb/>
            to you, except this one thing, that the cupidity and boldness <lb/>
            of the boy Caesar have been rather excited than repressed by <lb/>
            Cicero; and that he gives way so much to his indulgence for <lb/>
            him, as not to restrain himself from attacks upon others, <lb/>
            attacks which recoil upon himself with double force; since <lb/>
            he himself has put more persons than one to death,1 and <lb/>
            since he must confess himself to be an assassin before he <lb/>
            makes the objections to Casca's2 act which he does make, and, <lb/>
            in his conduct to Casca, imitates Bestial</p>
          <p>Because we are not every moment boasting of the ides of <lb/>
            March, as he is always talking of the nones4 of December, <lb/>
            will Cicero, for that reason, condemn that most laudable act <lb/>
            on a better pretext than that on which Bestia and Clodius <lb/>
            have been accustomed to inveigh against his consulship ? <lb/>
            Our good friend Cicero boasts to me, that he has supported <lb/>
            the whole war against Antony in the garb of peace. Of <lb/>
            what profit is that to me, if a succession to the position occu- <lb/>
            pied by Antony is demanded as the wages for having put <lb/>
            Antony down, and if he, who has repressed that evil, has <lb/>
            become the author of another, which will have a more solid <lb/>
            foundation, and a deeper root, if we will but allow it ? for the <lb/>
            line of conduct which he has taken is that of one who is <note type="footnote"> 1 In Catiline's plot, for which he put five of the principal conspira- <lb/>
            tors to death.—Middleton. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The passage seems to imply that Cicero had reproached him for <lb/>
            killing Cæsar, and called him an assassin.—Middleton. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 L. Calpurnius Bestia was a tribune of the people, at the expiration <lb/>
            of Cicero's consulship; supposed to have been deeply engaged in <lb/>
            Catiline's conspiracy; and, when Cicero laid down his office, joined <lb/>
            with his colleague Metellus in prohibiting him from speaking to the <lb/>
            people; and was ever after a perpetual enemy and reviler of his admi- <lb/>
            nistration.—Vid. Sallust, c. 43 ; Plutar. in Cic.—Middleton. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 It was on the nones of December that Cicero crushed the con- <lb/>
            spiracy of Catiline. The whole tone of this letter proves it to be a <lb/>
            forgery, and a very clumsy we </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            afraid, not of tyranny itself, but of Antony being the <lb/>
            tyrant.</p>
          <p>But I do not thank the man who, provided that he is not <lb/>
            slave to an angry master, does not object to slavery itself; <lb/>
            but to whom even triumphs and rewards are decreed, and <lb/>
            who is honoured with every sort of complimentary vote. <lb/>
            A man ought to be ashamed to desire that fortune of which <lb/>
            he has now taken on him the name ! Is this the conduct of <lb/>
            a man of consular rank ? Does this become Cicero ? Since <lb/>
            you would not let me be silent, you will read what must of <lb/>
            necessity be unpleasant to you. Indeed, I feel myself with <lb/>
            how much uneasiness I write this to you; nor am I ignorant <lb/>
            what your sentiments are with regard to the present state of <lb/>
            affairs, which, though desperate, you think may still be <lb/>
            retrieved. And in truth, my dear Atticus, I do not blame <lb/>
            you; for your age, your habits, and your family, render you <lb/>
            inactive, as, indeed, I have learned from the report of our <lb/>
            friend Flavius.</p>
          <p>But I return to Cicero. What difference is there between <lb/>
            Salvidienus and him ? or what more would Salvidienus pro- <lb/>
            pose to be voted to Octavius than he does ? You will reply, <lb/>
            he is still afraid of the remains of civil war. Is there then <lb/>
            any one so afraid of a defeated enemy, as not to think that <lb/>
            there is also reason to fear the power of one who has a vic- <lb/>
            torious army, and the rashness of a boy ? Or does he act <lb/>
            thus, because he thinks that everything ought to be sur- <lb/>
            rendered to Octavius, at once and voluntarily, because of his <lb/>
            great dignity 1 0 the great folly of fear, so to guard against <lb/>
            that very object which we fear, that, when we perhaps might <lb/>
            have avoided it, we of- our own accord invite it and draw it <lb/>
            upon ourselves! We are too much afraid of death and exile <lb/>
            and poverty: these things appear to Cicero to be the very <lb/>
            extreme of evils; and as long as he finds people from whom <lb/>
            he can obtain what he wishes, and by whom he may be <lb/>
            honoured and praised, he does not despise slavery, provided <lb/>
            it be honourable; if indeed anything can be honourable in <lb/>
            the worst and most wretched of all contumely.</p>
          <p>Though Octavius, therefore, call Cicero his father; though <lb/>
            ne refer everything to him, and extol him, and thank him; <lb/>
            yet it will be seen at last that his words are at variance with <lb/>
            his acts : for what can be so inconsistent with every feeling of <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            a human being, as to look upon that man as a parent, who <lb/>
            is not even in the condition of a free man ? Yet that excel- <lb/>
            lent man directs his efforts only to this end, makes this his <lb/>
            aim, hastens to attain this object, that Octavius may be <lb/>
            favourable to him. I indeed now think nothing of those <lb/>
            accomplishments, with which I know that Cicero is so com- <lb/>
            pletely furnished; for of what profit to him are the writings <lb/>
            which he has composed in such vast abundance, in defence of <lb/>
            the liberty of our country, concerning dignity, concerning <lb/>
            death, and exile, and poverty ? and how much more justly <lb/>
            does Philippus appear to understand things, who has given <lb/>
            less to a stepson than Cicero gives to a stranger 7 Let him <lb/>
            cease, therefore, in his boasting, to insult our sorrows; for what <lb/>
            advantage is it to us that Antony has been defeated, if he is <lb/>
            defeated only that what he held may be open to another ? <lb/>
            Although your letter intimates that things are doubtful.</p>
          <p>Let Cicero then live, as he can endure to do so, a suppliant, <lb/>
            and submissive to another; if he has no regard either to <lb/>
            his age, his honours, or his past achievements. As for me, <lb/>
            there will assuredly be no condition of slavery so attractive, <lb/>
            as that I should be diverted by it from waging war with the <lb/>
            thing itself, that is to say, with kingly authority, with extra- <lb/>
            ordinary commands, with absolute dominion, and with power <lb/>
            that seeks to set itself above the laws, even though Antony <lb/>
            be a good man, as you describe him, but as I never thought <lb/>
            him to be. But our ancestors would have no master over <lb/>
            them, even if he had been their father.</p>
          <p>If I did not love you really as much as Cicero is persuaded <lb/>
            that he is loved by Octavius, I should not have written this <lb/>
            to you. I am sorry that you must be vexed at what I have <lb/>
            now written, since you are greatly attached to all your friends, <lb/>
            and especially to Cicero; but assure yourself that nothing is <lb/>
            abated of my good-will towards him, though much of my <lb/>
            favourable opinion of him; for it can never be, but that as <lb/>
            anything appears to a man, so he will form his opinion of it. <lb/>
            I wish you had sent me word, what are the conditions offered <lb/>
            to my dear Attica;2 I might have been able to tell you some- <note type="footnote"> I Philippus had married Atia, the mother of Octavius ; but the letter <lb/>
            is mistaken, for Philippus had gone far beyond Cicero in the honours <lb/>
            which he wished to procure for Octavius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The daughter of Atticus. Paul Manutius supposes that the allu- <lb/>

            that the health of my dear Portia is an object of concern to- <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I will cheerfully do what you ask me ; for my <lb/>

          <p>I SHOULD perform the same office for you, which you per- <lb/>
            formed for me in my sorrow, 1 and should endeavour to comfort <lb/>
            you by letter, if I did not know that you do not require in, <lb/>
            your distress the remedies with which you alleviated my <lb/>
            grief; and I wish that you may now cure yourself with. <lb/>
            greater ease than I, on that occasion, cured myself. For it <lb/>
            is inconsistent with the character of so great a man as you. <lb/>
            arc, not to be able to do himself, what he has recommended. <lb/>
            to another. As for myself, not only the arguments which you <lb/>
            had collected, but your authority, deterred me from indulging <lb/>
            in too much sorrow: for, when I appeared to you to bear my <lb/>
            distress with less fortitude than became a man, especially one <lb/>
            who was in the habit of addressing consolation to others, yon <lb/>
            reproached me in your letters in harsher language than was <lb/>
            your habit. Having, therefore, a high opinion of your <lb/>
            wisdom, and being in awe of it, I recollected myself, and. <lb/>
            attached the more weight to the things which I had formerly <lb/>
            learned and read and heard, after your authority was added, <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>And at that time, my dear Brutus, I had to obey only- <lb/>
            duty, and my natural disposition; you have to regard the <lb/>
            people, and the public stage (as we say) on which you are; <lb/>
            for since the eyes, not only of your own army, but of all your <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, and almost of all nations, are turned upon you,. <lb/>
            it least of all becomes him by whose means we are rendered <lb/>
            bolder, to appear himself weakened in spirit. You have <lb/>
            indeed met with affliction, (for you have lost that to which <lb/>
            ,here was nothing similar on earth,) and you must grieve at; <note type="footnote"> 1 For his daughter Tullia. </note> <note type="footnote"> iT 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            so severe a misfortune, lest to want all sense of grief should <lb/>
            be found more wretched than to grieve; but as it is bene- <lb/>
            ficial to others to mourn with moderation, it is for you <lb/>
            necessary.</p>
          <p>I would say more, if even what I have said was not too <lb/>
            much to say to you.</p>
          <p>We are looking for you and your army, without which, <lb/>
            (though everything else may succeed to our wish,) we <lb/>
            scarcely seem likely to have sufficient freedom. Of the <lb/>
            general aspect of the affairs of the commonwealth, I will <lb/>
            write more at length; and, perhaps, with more certainty, <lb/>
            in a letter which I was thinking of entrusting to our friend <lb/>
            Vetus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ALTHOUGH I was just going to give a letter to Messala <lb/>
            Corvinus, still I did not like my friend Vetus to go to you <lb/>
            without a letter from me. The republic, my dear Brutus, is <lb/>
            in a situation of the greatest danger; and though victorious, <lb/>
            we are forced to fight again; this has happened through the <lb/>
            wickedness and folly of Marcus Lepidus.</p>
          <p>For the republic, there was nothing at which I felt greater <lb/>
            concern, than that I was unable to yield to the entreaties of <lb/>
            your mother and sister; for I thought that I should easily <lb/>
            satisfy you, which is an object of the highest importance <lb/>
            with me.</p>
          <p>For in no way could the cause of Lepidus be distinguished <lb/>
            from that of Antony; indeed, in everybody's judgment it was <lb/>
            the worse of the two, because after Lepidus had been com- <lb/>
            plimented by the senate with the highest honours, and after <lb/>
            he had only a few days before sent an admirable letter to <lb/>
            the senate, he suddenly not only received the relics of our <lb/>
            defeated enemies as his friends, but is even carrying on a most <lb/>
            vigorous war against us by land and sea, of which it is'uncer- <lb/>
            tain what will be the result. When we are asked, therefore, <lb/>
            to show pity to his children, no argument is advanced why <lb/>
            the greatest severities are not to be endured by us, (may <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            Jupiter avert the omen!) if the father of those children should <lb/>
            be victorious.</p>
          <p>Not indeed that it escapes my recollection, how bitter <lb/>
            a thing it is that the crimes of fathers should be atoned for <lb/>
            by the punishment of their children; but this has been <lb/>
            admirably provided by the laws, that their affection for their <lb/>
            children may make the parents more truly attached to the <lb/>
            republic. It is Lepidus, therefore, who is cruel to his chil- <lb/>
            dren, not he who pronounces Lepidus a public enemy; and <lb/>
            if he, after laying down his arms, had been condemned for <lb/>
            violence to the state, in a trial for which he would have <lb/>
            had nothing to say in his defence, his children would suffer <lb/>
            the same punishment, — their property being confiscated; <lb/>
            although what your mother and sister deprecate for those <lb/>
            children, the same and many more cruel evils Lepidus, <lb/>
            Antony, and the rest of our enemies, are denouncing against <lb/>
            us all.</p>
          <p>At this time, therefore, our greatest hope is placed in you, <lb/>
            and in your army. It is of the very greatest consequence, <lb/>
            both to the general state of the commonwealth, and also to <lb/>
            your own glory and dignity, that you, as I have written before, <lb/>
            should come into Italy with all possible speed; for the <lb/>
            republic is in the greatest need, both of your forces, and of <lb/>
            your wisdom.</p>
          <p>Because of your letter, I gladly embraced Vetus, out of <lb/>
            regard to his good-will and singular service to you; and I <lb/>
            see that he really is most thoroughly attached and devoted <lb/>
            both to you and to the republic. I shall see my Cicero, as I <lb/>
            hope, shortly, for I trust that he will very soon come into <lb/>
            Italy with you.</p>

          <p>THE fear that every one else entertains of Marcus Lepidus, <lb/>
            makes me also fear. If he should withdraw himself from us, <lb/>
            (a suspicion which I hope that men have entertained of him <lb/>
            groundlessly and wrongfully,) I beg and entreat you, my <lb/>
            dear Cicero, invoking our intimate friendship and your good- <lb/>
            will to me, to forget that the children of my sister are sons <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            of Lepidus, and to think that I have succeeded to the place <lb/>
            of father to them; if I obtain this of you, then there is <lb/>
            nothing, assuredly, which you will hesitate to undertake in <lb/>
            their behalf.</p>
          <p>Other people live with their relations on different terms; <lb/>
            I can do nothing for the children of my sister sufficient to <lb/>
            satisfy either my inclination or my feelings of duty. But <lb/>
            what is there that good citizens can grant me, (if I am worthy <lb/>
            of having anything granted me,) or what is there that I can <lb/>
            do for my mother or sister, or for these children, if their <lb/>
            uncle Brutus has no weight with you, and the rest of the <lb/>
            senate, to counterbalance the conduct of their father Lepidus <lb/>
            I am not able to write you a long letter, for my anxiety <lb/>
            and sorrow; nor, indeed, have I any reason: for if in a <lb/>
            matter of such importance, and one that touches me so <lb/>
            closely, there is need of words to arouse or to encourage <lb/>
            you, there is no hope that you will do what I wish, and <lb/>
            what you ought.</p>
          <p>Do not, therefore, expect a long entreaty from me. Look <lb/>
            upon me ; consider who I am; a man that has a right to <lb/>
            obtain this favour either from Cicero, as one closely attached <lb/>
            to me as a private individual, or from a man of consular <lb/>
            rank, and of such a character, without reference to private <lb/>
            friendship. What you resolve to do, I should wish you as <lb/>
            soon as possible to let me know iu reply. <lb/>

          <p>As yet I have received no letter from you; nor even any <lb/>
            report to tell me that you, having received the authority of <lb/>
            the senate for such a step, were proceeding with your army <lb/>
            to Italy; though the republic was very desirous for you to do <lb/>
            that, and to do it with all speed. For our intestine evil <lb/>
            grows worse and worse every day; nor do we suffer more <lb/>
            from our foreign enemies than from our domestic foes, who <lb/>
            existed, indeed, at the very beginning of the war, but who at <lb/>
            that time were more easily put down. The senate then <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            assumed a more erect attitude, being roused not only by my <lb/>
            known opinions, but also by my exhortations.</p>
          <p>In the senate, Pansa was energetic and fierce enough, both <lb/>
            against the rest of this faction, and especially against his <lb/>
            father-in-law, who, as consul, wanted neither courage at the <lb/>
            beginning of his office, nor fidelity at the end. The war was <lb/>
            carried on at Mutina in such a way that there was no fault to <lb/>
            be found with Cæsar. There may have beon something to <lb/>
            blame in Hirtius; and the general fortune of the war, if <lb/>
            compared with prosperous ones, has been wavering; if with <lb/>
            disastrous ones, good. The republic was victorious, the troops <lb/>
            of Antony having been routed, and he himself expelled by <lb/>
            Brutus. But so many errors were afterwards committed, <lb/>
            that, as one may say, victory slipped through our fingers; <lb/>
            our generals did not pursue the enemy, though disheartened, <lb/>
            disarmed, disabled; and an opportunity was given to Lepidus, <lb/>
            through which we might feel his inconstancy, often felt <lb/>
            indeed before in still greater disasters. The armies of Brutus <lb/>
            and Plancus are good, but untrained. The auxiliary forces <lb/>
            from the Gauls are very faithful and very numerous. But <lb/>
            some persons, by most scandalous letters, and by treacherous <lb/>
            accounts and information, have excited Cæsar, who has <lb/>
            hitherto been governed by my counsels, and who is himself <lb/>
            of a most excellent disposition and admirable steadiness, to <lb/>
            conceive a confident hope of obtaining the consulship. And <lb/>
            as soon as I perceived that such was the case, I never ceased <lb/>
            to warn him, as he was absent, by letter, nor to reproach his <lb/>
            friends, who were here on the spot, and who appeared to be <lb/>
            encouraging that desire of his: nor did I, in the senate, <lb/>
            hesitate to lay open the true source of those most flagitious <lb/>
            counsels; nor do I remember the senate or the magistrates to <lb/>
            have been on any occasion better disposed. For it has never <lb/>
            happened before, when there has been a question about con- <lb/>
            ferring some honour out of the usual course of things on <lb/>
            a powerful man—I may even say, on the most powerful man <lb/>
            in the state (since power now depends on force and arms)— <lb/>
            that no tribune of the people, no one invested with any other <lb/>
            magistracy, no private individual, ever could be found to <lb/>
            propose it.</p>
          <p>But still, with all this exhibition of lesolution and virtue, <lb/>
            the city was nevertheless in an anxious state ; for we are <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            mocked, my dear Brutus, both by the licentiousness of the <lb/>
            soldiers and the insolence of the generals. Every one de- <lb/>
            mands to have as much authority in the republic as he has <lb/>
            force at command. Neither reason, nor moderation, nor <lb/>
            law, nor precedent, nor duty, nor even the deliberate judg- <lb/>
            ment and opinion of the citizens, nor regard for the estima- <lb/>
            tion of posterity, has any weight at all.</p>
          <p>I, foreseeing all this a long time ago, was fleeing from Italy, <lb/>
            at the very time when the news of your edicts caused me to <lb/>
            return. But you, Brutus, roused me again at Velia; for <lb/>
            although I grieved that I was going to a city from which you, <lb/>
            who had delivered it, were taking flight, (which indeed had <lb/>
            formerly happened to me also, under a similar danger and <lb/>
            sadder fortune,1) still I proceeded, and came to Rome, and <lb/>
            without any support made Antony quake; and, in opposi- <lb/>
            tion to his impious arms, I by my authority and counsels <lb/>
            secured for us the protection of Caesar, which was volun- <lb/>
            tarily offered; and if he remains in the same disposition <lb/>
            and continues to be guided by me, we seem likely to have <lb/>
            quite sufficient defence. But if the counsels of bad men <lb/>
            have more weight than mine, or if the tenderness of his age <lb/>
            prove unable to support the heavy burden of affairs, all our <lb/>
            hope is in you. Fly to us, therefore, I beseech you ; and, in <lb/>
            the result, complete the deliverance of that republic which <lb/>
            you have already delivered, more through your own virtue and <lb/>
            magnanimity than through any train of circumstances. A <lb/>
            general concourse of all classes will gather round you. Exhort <lb/>
            Cassius to the same course by letter. There is no hope of <lb/>
            liberty anywhere except in the head-quarters of your united <lb/>
            armies. In the west, we find both generals and armies <lb/>
            entirely true to us. And, for my part, I feel confident that <lb/>
            the support of the young Octavius may be relied on; but so <lb/>
            many persons are trying to shake his fidelity, that I some- <lb/>
            times am afraid that he may be influenced by them.</p>
          <p>You now know the general aspect of the affairs of the com- <lb/>
            monwealth, as they stood at the time when I wrote this letter. <lb/>
            I trust that, in process of time, they may grow better; but if <note type="footnote"> 1 He alludes to the case of his exile, when he was not only driven <lb/>
            out of the city by his enemies, as Brutus now was, but was banished <lb/>

            did in a short time after.—Middleton. </note> <lb/>

            the contrary should be the case, (which presage may the gods <lb/>
            avert!) I shall grieve for the fate of the republic which de- <lb/>
            served to be immortal: but for myself how short a space of <lb/>

          <p>YOUR letter was short. Short, do I say ? It was no letter <lb/>
            at all. Does Brutus, at such a crisis as this, write me those <lb/>
            lines only. You had better have written nothing at all; and <lb/>
            yet you expect letters from me. Which of your friends has <lb/>
            ever come to you without a letter from me And which of <lb/>
            my letters had not something of consequence in it ? If, indeed, <lb/>
            they have failed to reach you, I suppose that not even your <lb/>
            own family letters have arrived either.</p>
          <p>You write me word, however, that you will send me a <lb/>
            longer letter by my son Cicero. You will indeed do well; <lb/>
            but still this one ought to have been longer. But I, as soon <lb/>
            as you wrote to me about Cicero's departure from you,1 im- <lb/>
            mediately packed off a courier with letters for him, bidding <lb/>
            him, even if he had reached Italy, to return to you; for <lb/>
            nothing could be more agreeable to me, or more honourable- <lb/>
            to him, although I had several times written to him that the- <lb/>
            comitia for the election of priests had, by my extreme exer- <lb/>
            tions, been postponed to another year; a delay which I exerted <lb/>
            myself to procure, not only for the sake of Cicero himself, but <lb/>
            for that of Domitius, Cato, Lentulus, and the Bibuli, as I also <lb/>
            wrote to you.</p>
          <p>However, when you sent off to me that dwarfish letter c f <lb/>
            yours, this was not yet known to you.</p>
          <p>I do therefore, my dear Brutus, beg of you with all earnest- <lb/>
            ness, not to let my son depart from you, but to bring him <lb/>
            with you when you come; and this, if you have any just <lb/>
            regard for the republic, for the benefit of which you were <lb/>
            born, you ought to do instantly. For the war has revived, <lb/>
            and that through the no small wickedness of Lepidus. And <note type="footnote"> 1 This alludes, as Middleton observes, to Letter XIII., in which it <lb/>
            was said that young Cicero was to come to Rome, to be a candidate for <lb/>
            one of the vacant priesthoods. </note> <lb/>

            Cæsar's army, which was most excellent, is not only of no use <lb/>
            to us, but even compels us to demand the presence of yours. <lb/>
            If that once reaches Italy, then there will be no citizen, at <lb/>
            least no one who deserves to be called a citizen, who will not <lb/>
            betake himself to your camp, although we have Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus admirably united with Plancus. But you are not <lb/>
            ignorant how little to be trusted the dispositions of men are <lb/>
            when infected with party spirit, and how uncertain, too, are <lb/>
            the events of battles.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if we conquer, as I hope we shall, still affairs will <lb/>
            require the powerful direction of your wisdom and influence <lb/>
            to guide them. Come therefore to our assistance, I implore <lb/>
            you, and come as soon as possible; and be assured that you <lb/>
            did not do a greater service to your country on the ides of <lb/>

          <p>You have Messala with you: how then shall I be able, by <lb/>
            any letter which I may write with ever so much care, to ex- <lb/>
            plain to you more clearly than he can what is going on in <lb/>
            the republic, and what is the state of affairs in it, since he is <lb/>
            thoroughly acquainted with everything, and is able also to <lb/>
            set it before you, and represent it to you in the neatest pos- <lb/>
            sible manner? For do not fancy, my dear Brutus (although <lb/>
            it is not necessary for me to write to you what is already well <lb/>
            known to you, yet I cannot pass over in silence such excel- <lb/>
            lence in all qualities which deserves praise); do not fancy, <lb/>
            I say, that there is any man like him for honesty, consistency, <lb/>
            anxiety, and zeal for the commonwealth; so that eloquence, <lb/>
            in which he wonderfully excels, seems scarcely to find in his <lb/>
            character any room as a subject of praise, although in this <lb/>
            very particular his wisdom is the more conspicuous; with <lb/>
            such dignified judgment and exceeding skill has he practised <lb/>
            himself in the soundest kind of oratory. So great, too, is <lb/>
            his modesty, so incessant his application to study, that it is <lb/>
            not to his genius (eminent as it is) that his greatest obligations <lb/>

            not less known than to myself, and to whom are still better <lb/>
            known those studies of his which I am now praising. And <lb/>
            though I was grieved at taking leave of him, I was comforted <lb/>
            by this one consideration, that as he was going to you, whom <lb/>
            I look upon as another self, he was both performing his duty <lb/>
            and pursuing a path to the greatest glory.</p>
          <p>But enough of this. I come now, after a long interval <lb/>
            certainly, to a certain letter of yours, in which, while praising <lb/>
            me on many accounts, you found fault with me in one point <lb/>
            as being too liberal, and as it were prodigal, in giving my <lb/>
            voice for awarding honours.1 It is for this that you blame <lb/>
            me; others, perhaps, charge me with being too severe as to <lb/>
            punishment and penalties; unless, perhaps, you bring both <lb/>
            accusations against me. If such be the case, I desire that my <lb/>
            opinion on both these subjects should be thoroughly under- <lb/>
            stood by you; not merely that I may cite the saying of <lb/>
            Solon, who was both the wisest of the seven wise men, and <lb/>
            also the only legislator of the seven, and who said that com- <lb/>
            monwealths were held together by two things, rewards and <lb/>
            punishments; for I would add, that there certainly is mode- <lb/>
            ration to be observed in both these points as in all other <lb/>
            things, and a certain medium to be kept as to each of them. <lb/>
            But it is not my purpose to discuss so important a topic in <lb/>
            this place.</p>
          <p>However, I do not think it improper to explain to you <lb/>
            what I have aimed at during this war in the several votes <lb/>
            which I have given in the senate.</p>
          <p>After the death of Cæsar and your memorable ides of <lb/>
            March, my dear Brutus, you have not forgotten what I <lb/>
            said had been omitted 2 by you, and how great a tempest <lb/>
            I declared to be hanging over the republic. A great plague <lb/>
            had been repelled by you, a great stain on the Roman <lb/>
            people had been effaced, and an immortal glory had been <lb/>
            gained by yourselves. But the whole equipage of kingly <lb/>
            power was only transferred to Lepidus and Antony, one of <lb/>
            ,hom was a vacillating man, the other polluted with vice; <lb/>
            both of them were afraid of peace, and enemies to tranquillity, <note type="footnote"> 1 Especially to Octavius. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I.e. the Dutting Antonv to death. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            While these men were burning with a desire of throwing the <lb/>
            republic into confusion, we had no force that could be opposed <lb/>
            to them; but the whole city had roused itself with entire <lb/>
            unanimity to preserve its freedom. We were at that time <lb/>
            too energetic; you perhaps acted more wisely in quitting the <lb/>
            city which you had delivered, and declined the aid of Italy, <lb/>
            which offered its services in your cause. When, therefore, <lb/>
            I saw the whole city occupied by traitors, that neither you <lb/>
            nor Cassius could be safe in it, and that it was overawed by <lb/>
            the forces of Antony, I thought that I also ought to depart. <lb/>
            For a city overwhelmed by wicked men, and deprived of all <lb/>
            power of helping itself, was a wretched spectacle.</p>
          <p>But the same disposition which is always in me, through <lb/>
            devotion to my country, could not bear to be absent from its <lb/>
            dangers ; and accordingly, in the middle of my voyage to <lb/>
            Achaia, when, at the times of the Etesian winds, the west <lb/>
            wind, as if dissuading me from my resolution, had brought <lb/>
            me back to Italy, I met you at Velia, and expressed the <lb/>
            greatest concern on the occasion. For you were retreating, <lb/>
            my dear Brutus: you were retreating, I say; since out <lb/>
            friends the Stoics deny that it is for a wise man to flee. When <lb/>
            I came to Rome, I immediately put myself forward to check <lb/>
            the wickedness and insanity of Antony; and when I had <lb/>
            exasperated him against myself, I began to adopt resolutions <lb/>
            quite in the character of Brutus himself (for such resolutions <lb/>
            are the peculiar inheritance of your family) to deliver the <lb/>
            republic.</p>
          <p>The long recital of what followed I shall omit, for it relates <lb/>
            to myself; I will only say that the character of this young <lb/>
            man Cæsar, by whose means, if we would but confess the <lb/>
            truth, we still exist, has sprung wholly from the source of <lb/>
            my counsels. No honours have been paid him from me, my <lb/>
            dear Brutus, that were not justly his due; none that were <lb/>
            not absolutely necessary. For when we first began to recover <lb/>
            our liberties, when not even the divine virtue of Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus had exerted itself in such a manner that we could <lb/>
            appreciate its value, and when our whole hope of defence lay <lb/>
            in that boy who had turned Antony away from our throats, <lb/>
            what honour was too great to be voted to him? Although <lb/>
            at that moment I paid him honour only in words, and that <lb/>
            expressed in moderate terms, I also proposed to invest him with <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            military command; and though this may have appeared a <lb/>
            compliment to one of his age, yet it was indispensable, as he <lb/>
            had an army; and what is an army without such command? <lb/>
            Philippus proposed to vote him a statue; Servius, first of all, <lb/>
            voted him the privilege of standing for offices before the usual <lb/>
            time; Servilius made that time still earlier; nothing at that <lb/>
            moment appeared too great for him.</p>
          <p>But, I know not how, men are more commonly found to be <lb/>
            liberal under the influence of fear than grateful in the hour of <lb/>
            victory. For I myself, when Decimus Brutus had been de- <lb/>
            livered; when that day, most joyful to the city, had shed its <lb/>
            light upon it, and that very day, as it happened, was the birth- <lb/>
            day of Brutus, proposed a vote that the name of Brutus should <lb/>
            be attached to that day in the calendar. And in this proposi- <lb/>
            tion I followed the precedent of our ancestors, who paid this <lb/>
            compliment to Larentia,1 a woman at whose altar in the Vela- <lb/>
            brum you pontiffs are in the habit of offering sacrifice. When <lb/>
            I proposed this honour to Brutus, my object was that there <lb/>
            should be in the calendar a memorial of his most welcome <lb/>
            victory; but on that day I found that there were rather <lb/>
            more malevolent than grateful people in the senate. At that <lb/>
            very time too I lavished, if you will have it so, honours on the <lb/>
            dead, Hirtius and Pansa, as well as Aquila ; and who would <lb/>
            blame me for so doing but those who, now that they are <lb/>
            delivered from their fear, have forgotten also their past <lb/>
            danger 1</p>
          <p>To the grateful recollection of these services there was <lb/>
            added another reason for my conduct, which I hoped might <lb/>
            have a beneficial effect upon posterity; for I wished that <lb/>
            there should exist undying records of the public hatred to our <lb/>
            most cruel enemies. I suspect, too, that this other matter is <lb/>
            the less approved by you, because it is not approved by your <lb/>
            friends, who are very excellent men indeed, but of no expe- <lb/>
            rience in public affairs; namely, the vote which I proposed, <lb/>
            that Cæsar might be permitted to enter the city with an <lb/>
            ovation. But I am of opinion (though I may perhaps be <note type="footnote"> 1 It is rather uncertain who Larentia was: the tradition is that she <lb/>
            was Romulus's nurse, and that Romulus instituted a yearly sacrifice <lb/>
            and festival in her honour. The Velabrum was a street or square, as <lb/>
            Middleton remarks, where the Forum Boarium and Temple of Janus <lb/>
            stood. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            mistaken, nor is my temper such that my own opinions <lb/>
            delight me in preference to those of others): that during the <lb/>
            whole of this war I have not done a wiser thing. Why it is so <lb/>
            I must not explain, lest I should seem to have been prudent <lb/>
            rather than grateful; and even to say this is to say too much; <lb/>
            let us therefore turn to something else.</p>
          <p>I proposed that honours should be voted to Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus, and also to Lucius Plancus. Those, indeed, are noble <lb/>
            dispositions which are attracted by glory; but the senate <lb/>
            also is wise, which employs every method, provided it be <lb/>
            honourable, by which it thinks that any one can be induced <lb/>
            to support the republic.</p>
          <p>But in the case of Lepidus I am blamed; inasmuch as <lb/>
            after I had proposed to erect a statue to him in the rostra, <lb/>
            I at a subsequent time proposed to remove it. The truth <lb/>
            was, that I sought by means of that honour to recall him <lb/>
            from desperate measures; but the insane folly of that most <lb/>
            vacillating of men defeated my prudence; nor was so much <lb/>
            harm done in raising a statue to Lepidus, as good in over- <lb/>
            throwing it.</p>
          <p>I have said enough on the subject of honours; I must now <lb/>
            add a few words on the subject of punishment; for I have re- <lb/>
            peatedly understood from your letters, that you were desirous <lb/>
            of having your clemency extolled towards those whom you <lb/>
            had defeated in war. I believe that nothing is done by you <lb/>
            otherwise than wisely; but to omit inflicting punishment on <lb/>
            guilt, (for that is what is called pardoning,) even though <lb/>
            under other circumstances it may be endurable, I think <lb/>
            ruinous in this war. For of all the civil wars which within <lb/>
            ray recollection have taken place in our republic, there has not <lb/>
            been one of such a character that, whichever side proved vic- <lb/>
            torious, there would not still have been some form of a com- <lb/>
            monwealth left: but in this war, what sort of republic we <lb/>
            shall have, if victorious, I would not willingly say; if defeated, <lb/>
            we shall certainly have none at all. I therefore pronounced <lb/>
            very severe opinions against Antony; I pronounced severe <lb/>
            ones against Lepidus; not so much for the sake of inflicting <lb/>
            vengeance upon them, as with a view at present to deter un- <lb/>
            principled citizens by fear from making war on their country, <lb/>
            and, for the future, to raise a record to prevent any one from <lb/>
            imitating such rashness, although this opinion was not more <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            my own in particular than that of all the citizens. And in it <lb/>
            there is indeed this appearance of cruelty, that the penalty <lb/>
            reaches to their children who have deserved no punishment. <lb/>
            But it is an ancient custom, and one which prevails in all <lb/>
            states; since even the children of Themistocles were reduced <lb/>
            to want. And if the same punishment falls on citizens <lb/>
            judicially condemned, how could we be more merciful to <lb/>
            enemies ?</p>
          <p>And what ground of complaint has any one against me, who <lb/>
            must confess that if he had been victorious, he would himself <lb/>
            have been more severe towards me?</p>
          <p>You have now the ground of the opinions which I de- <lb/>
            livered, at least on this subject of honours and penalties. <lb/>
            What opinions I entertained, and what votes I gave, on <lb/>
            other matters, I think you have heard; but to mention these <lb/>
            is not of so much necessity; what is absolutely necessary is, <lb/>
            that you, my dear Brutus, should come into Italy with <lb/>
            your army with all speed; there is the strongest desire for <lb/>
            your arrival; if you but set foot in Italy, all will flock to you. <lb/>
            For whether we are victorious (and we should indeed already <lb/>
            have been most gloriously victorious, if Lepidus had not <lb/>
            chosen to overturn everything, and ruin himself as well as his <lb/>
            friends), we shall require your authority to establish some <lb/>
            constitution in the state; or whether there be still struggles <lb/>
            to come, our greatest hope is still in your authority and in <lb/>
            the power of your army. But hasten to us, I conjure you <lb/>
            by the gods ; for you know how much depends on opportu- <lb/>
            nities, how much depends on promptness.</p>
          <p>I will take all possible care of the interests of your sister's <lb/>
            sons, as I hope that you will learn from the letters of your <lb/>
            mother and your sister; in which cause I have a greater <lb/>
            regard for your wishes, which are most dear to me, than, as <lb/>
            some think, for my own consistency. But in nothing have I <lb/>
            a stronger wish both to be and to seem consistent, than in <lb/>
            my affection for you.</p><pb n="128"/>

            <title type="sub">LETTER XXIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Brutus to Cicero, greeting.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE read a small part of your letter, which you sent to <lb/>
            Octavius, and which was forwarded to me by Atticus. Your <lb/>
            real and anxiety for my safety have given me no new delight; <lb/>
            for it is not only a common thing, but one of even daily <lb/>
            occurrence, for me to hear something about you which you <lb/>
            have said or done, faithfully and honourably, for the mainte- <lb/>
            nance of my dignity. Yet that same part of the letter <lb/>
            which you wrote to Octavius about me has caused me as <lb/>
            much concern as I am capable of feeling; for you thank him <lb/>
            on behalf of the republic in such language, in such a suppliant <lb/>
            and humble tone, (what shall I say? I am ashamed of our <lb/>
            condition and fortune, but still I must write it; you recom- <lb/>
            mend my safety to him ; and what kind of death would not <lb/>
            be preferable to safety so secured?) that you show plainly <lb/>
            that the overbearing power has not been removed, but only <lb/>
            the master changed. Recollect the words that you have <lb/>
            used, and then deny, if you can, that they are the language <lb/>
            of prayer addressed by a slave to his king. You say that <lb/>
            there is one thing only which is demanded and expected from <lb/>
            him; namely, that he should allow those citizens, of whom <lb/>
            virtuous men and the Roman people have a favourable <lb/>
            opinion, to live in security. But what if he will not allow <lb/>
            it ? Are we to have no existence ? But it would be better to <lb/>
            have none than to exist only through his permission. I, <lb/>
            assuredly, do not believe that all the gods are so unfavourable <lb/>
            to the safety of the Roman people that Octavius must be <lb/>
            entreated for the safety of any citizen; I will not say for <lb/>
            that of the deliverers of the whole world. For I am glad to <lb/>
            take a high tone; and it is fit that I should do so towards <lb/>
            those who know not what is to be feared for each individual, <lb/>
            or what ought to be asked of any one.</p>
          <p>Do you then confess, Cicero, that Octavius has this power, <lb/>
            and are you nevertheless a friend to him? or, if you have <lb/>
            any regard for me, do you wish me to appear at Rome, when <lb/>
            I must first be recommended to that boy that I may have the <lb/>
            liberty of being there? And for what have you to thank him, <lb/>
            if you think be must be entreated to consent aDd allow us to <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            live in safety? Is this to be regarded as a favour, that he <lb/>
            prefers to be the person himself from whom such things are <lb/>
            to be petitioned, rather than Antony ? Does any one address <lb/>
            entreaties to a person who is the chastiser of the domineering <lb/>
            power of another, and not rather his successor in it, that men <lb/>
            who have done great services to the republic may be per- <lb/>
            mitted to live in it in safety? But that imbecility and <lb/>
            despair (the fault of which is not to be imputed to you in a <lb/>
            greater degree than to every one else) both impelled Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar to covet kingly power, and after his death persuaded <lb/>
            Antony to endeavour to occupy the place of him who had <lb/>
            been slain; and now, too, it has elevated that boy to such <lb/>
            a degree, that you have thought that the safety of such men <lb/>
            as we are must be obtained of him by entreaties; and have <lb/>
            considered that we shall only be safe through the mercy <lb/>
            of one who is hardly yet a man, and by no other means. <lb/>
            But if we had recollected that we were Romans, these vilest <lb/>
            of men would not be more bold in their desires to grasp <lb/>
            dominion, than we should be in our determination to stop <lb/>
            their course; nor would Antony have been more encouraged <lb/>
            by the height of power attained by Cæsar, than deterred by <lb/>
            his fate.</p>
          <p>How can you, a man of consular rank, and the avenger of <lb/>
            such atrocious crimes (though, while they are checked, I still <lb/>
            fear that our ruin has only been postponed by you for a short <lb/>
            time), how can you, I say, contemplate what you yourself <lb/>
            have done, and at the same time approve those other things, <lb/>
            or at least bear them with so lowly and acquiescent a spirit as <lb/>
            to wear the appearance of one who does approve of them?</p>
          <p>What private ill-feeling had you towards Antony? None, <lb/>
            for any other reason but that he assumed such authority, <lb/>
            requiring that men's safety should be begged of him; that <lb/>
            we, from whom he himself had received liberty, should enjoy <lb/>
            only a precarious safety; and that his will as to the common- <lb/>
            wealth should be absolute. You then thought it time to <lb/>
            seek for arms, by which he might be prevented from lording <lb/>
            it over us: but was it your object that, while he was pre- <lb/>
            vented from so doing, we might address our prayers to some <lb/>
            one else, who would permit himself to be put in his stead; or <lb/>
            that the republic might have its full rights and be mistress <lb/>
            of itself? unless, indeed, our objection was not to slavery <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            itself, but to some particular kind of slavery. But we might <lb/>
            not only have endured our fortune, with Antony for an easy <lb/>
            master, but with advantages also and honours, as sharers in <lb/>
            them with him, to whatever extent we pleased; for what <lb/>
            would he have denied to those whose patience he found to be <lb/>
            the main support of his authority? But none of these con- <lb/>
            siderations were of such importance that we should sell our <lb/>
            good faith and liberty for it. What would not this very boy, <lb/>
            whom the name of Cæsar appears to excite against the de- <lb/>
            stroyers of Cæsar, what would not he think it worth, (if there <lb/>
            were an opportunity for such a bargain,) to have, with our <lb/>
            support, as much power as he certainly is likely to have, <lb/>
            since we are so eager to live, and to retain our fortunes, and <lb/>
            to be called men of consular rank? But then that other <lb/>
            Cæsar will have been slain to no purpose; and why did we <lb/>
            rejoice at his death, if, after it, we were to be slaves no less <lb/>
            than before?</p>
          <p>Let no anxiety be felt, then, by others. But, as for me, <lb/>
            may all the gods and goddesses deprive me of everything, <lb/>
            sooner than of the determination not to allow to the heir of <lb/>
            the man whom I have slain what I did not allow to the man <lb/>
            himself, and what I would not allow even to my own father, <lb/>
            if he were to come to life again; namely, that he should have <lb/>
            more power than the laws and the senate with my permission. <lb/>
            Can you possibly believe that the rest of the citizens will be <lb/>
            free under him, without whose permission there is no room <lb/>
            for us in the city? How, moreover, is it possible for you to <lb/>
            obtain what you ask? for you ask him to permit us to be <lb/>
            safe. Do we appear to you, then, certain of receiving safety <lb/>
            from him when we have received life? And how can we <lb/>
            receive it, if we first throw away our dignity and our freedom? <lb/>
            Do you think that to live at Rome is to be safe ? It is cir- <lb/>
            cumstances, and not place, which must procure me safety. <lb/>
            I was not safe while Cæsar was alive, unless indeed it was <lb/>
            after I had resolved upon that deed. Nor can I be an exile <lb/>
            anywhere as long as I hate to be a slave, and to endure in- <lb/>
            sults worse than all other evils. Is not this to fall back into <lb/>
            the same darkness, when we request of him who has taken to <lb/>
            himself the name of a tyrant, (while in Grecian states even <lb/>
            the children of tyrants, after the parents are put down, arc <lb/>
            subjected to the same fate,) that the mortal enemies and <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            suppressors of absolute power may be allowed to live in <lb/>
            safety ? Can I wish to see this state in such a condition, or <lb/>
            even think it a state at all, if it is not able to receive freedom <lb/>
            when put into its hands, and even forced upon it; and when <lb/>
            it is more afraid of the name of the king who has been re- <lb/>
            moved, in the person of a boy, than confident in itself, even <lb/>
            after it has seen that very man who had the greatest power <lb/>
            of all cut off by the public spirit of a few individuals? Here- <lb/>
            after, do not recommend me to your Cæsar; no, nor even <lb/>
            yourself, if you will listen to me. You value the number of <lb/>
            years, which your time of life renders it probable that you <lb/>
            may enjoy, at a very high rate, if, for the sake of them, you <lb/>
            will supplicate that boy.</p>
          <p>In the next place, with regard to the admirable line of <lb/>
            conduct which you have adopted, and still pursue, towards <lb/>
            Antony, take care lest, instead of being praised as the part of <lb/>
            great magnanimity, it should be imputed to fear. For if you <lb/>
            like Octavius, as one from whom we must beg our safety, you <lb/>
            will appear not to have objected to a master, but only to have <lb/>
            been desirous of a more friendly one. That you praise him <lb/>
            for what he has hitherto done, I commend you; for his <lb/>
            conduct deserves to be praised; provided only that he under- <lb/>
            took that course of action in opposition to the power of an- <lb/>
            other, and not for the sake of establishing his own. But when <lb/>
            you judge that it is not only lawful for him to have such <lb/>
            power, but also that it should be given him by you, so that <lb/>
            he must be entreated not to prohibit us from living in safety, <lb/>
            you then grant too high a reward to his merits ; for you are <lb/>
            bestowing on him that very thing which the republic appeared <lb/>
            to possess in consequence of his conduct.</p>
          <p>Nor does it occur to you, that if Octavius deserves any <lb/>
            honours for waging war against Antony, the Roman people <lb/>
            could then never bestow on those who eradicated that evil, <lb/>
            and of whom these are the relics, anything with which their <lb/>
            merit could be compensated, even if it were to heap upon <lb/>
            them all honours and rewards at once. But see how much <lb/>
            more lively men's fears are than their recollections, because <lb/>
            Antony is alive and in arms ; but with respect to Cæsar, all <lb/>
            that was possible, or ought to have been done, has been done; <lb/>
            nor can it now be recalled and undone. But is Octavius a <lb/>
            person of <unclear>uch</unclear> importance, that the Roman people ought to <note type="footnote"> Ka </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            wait to see what decision he will form respecting us? And <lb/>
            are W3 of so little consequence, that it peems proper to entreat <lb/>
            a single individual for our safety?</p>
          <p>I, however, (to return to that point,) am of such a disposi- <lb/>
            tion, that I not only would not address supplications to any <lb/>
            one, but would repress those who require supplications to be <lb/>
            made to them; or else I will withdraw from those who are <lb/>
            slaves, and fancy that Rome is in any place wherever I am <lb/>
            permitted to be free. And I will pity you, in whom neither <lb/>
            age, nor honours, nor the example of other men's virtue, can <lb/>
            diminish the fond desire of life. For my part, I shall seem <lb/>
            to myself to be happy, if I can but perpetually and constantly <lb/>
            cherish the persuasion that due gratitude has been shown for <lb/>
            my affection for my country. For what is more desirable <lb/>
            than for a man, enjoying the recollection of glorious actions <lb/>
            and the possession of liberty, to look down upon human <lb/>
            affairs? At all events, I will not yield to those who yield; <lb/>
            nor will I be conquered by those who wish themselves to be <lb/>
            conquered; and I will make every possible effort and <lb/>
            endeavour, and never cease to attempt to free our city from <lb/>
            slavery. If that fortune which ought to follow my endeavours <lb/>
            shall attend them, we shall all rejoice; if not, at least I myself <lb/>
            shall rejoice. For in what acts or meditations can my life be <lb/>
            better spent, than in such as have for their object the deliver- <lb/>
            ance of my fellow-citizens? You, my dear Cicero, I beg and <lb/>
            exhort not to be weary, nor to distrust the event. Ever, in <lb/>
            averting present evils, attend also to those which may come <lb/>
            hereafter, lest they should make a way for themselves, unless <lb/>
            you check them in time. Consider that the bold and free <lb/>
            spirit, such as that with which you saved the state when <lb/>
            consul, and uphold it now when you are of consular rank, is <lb/>
            valueless without consistency and steadiness. I admit, indeed, <lb/>
            that the condition of tried, is harder than that of untried <lb/>
            virtue; for we expect services from it as debts; and if anything <lb/>
            turns out unfortunately, we then reproach the possessors of it <lb/>
            in a hostile spirit, as though we had been deceived by them.</p>
          <p>Although, therefore, it is conduct worthy of great praise <lb/>
            for Cicero to resist Antony, yet, because his character as <lb/>
            consul1 seemed necessarily to promise that he would be of <lb/>
            similar character as a consular,2 no man wonders at it. But <note type="footnote"> 1 In suppressing the conspiracy of Catiline. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 In resisting Antony. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            if the same Cicero should waver in that judgment with regard <lb/>
            to others, which he has used with such firmness and magna- <lb/>
            nimity in repelling Antony, he will not only deprive himself <lb/>
            of all hope of future glory, but will cause even the renown <lb/>
            of his past achievements to be forgotten.</p>
          <p>For nothing is great in itself, except that in which a prin- <lb/>
            ciple of sound judgment is visible. And as it becomes no <lb/>
            one more than yourself, to be attached to the republic, and <lb/>
            to be the defender of its liberties, both from your talents and <lb/>
            yoar actions, and in accordance with the wishes and demands <lb/>
            of all men, Octavius must, consequently, not be solicited to <lb/>
            allow us to live in safety. Rouse yourself rather, that you may <lb/>
            feel convinced that that city, in which you have performed <lb/>
            the greatest deeds, will ever be free and honourable, provided <lb/>
            that the people have proper leaders to resist the counsels of <lb/>
            the unprincipled.</p>

            <title type="sub">Cicero to Brutus, greeting.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER I had repeatedly exhorted you by letter to come as <lb/>
            soon as possible to the succour of the republic, and to bring <lb/>
            your army into Italy, and did not suppose that your own <lb/>
            friends had any scruples about the propriety of the measure, <lb/>
            I. was requested by that most prudent and anxious lady, your <lb/>
            mother,1 whose every care is bent upon you and devoted to <lb/>
            you, to pay her a visit on the twenty-fifth of July, which I, <lb/>
            as I was bound to do, did without hesitation. When I <lb/>
            arrived, Casca and Labeo and Scaptius were with her. But <lb/>
            she immediately mentioned the business on which she sent <lb/>
            for me, and asked me what my opinion was: whether we <lb/>
            ought to send for you, and consider such a step to be for your <lb/>
            advantage, or whether it would be better for you to delay <lb/>
            and remain where you were. I gave such an answer as I <note type="footnote"> 1 Servilia, the mother of Brutus, who is referred to in this letter, <lb/>
            had intrigued with Cæsar; so that scandal had even called Brutua <lb/>
            Cæsar's son. Brutus appears to have had a great opinion of her at ilities, <lb/>
            and to have been greatly guided by her in the transactions which fol- <lb/>
            lowed upon Cæsar's death. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            tho ught most suited to your dignity and reputation; saying <lb/>
            that you should, at the earliest possible moment, bring your <lb/>
            aid to the tottering and almost falling republic. For what <lb/>
            misfortune, do you think, is not to be expected in a war in <lb/>
            which the victorious armies declined to pursue a fleeing <lb/>
            enemy ;1 in which a general, in the enjoyment of complete <lb/>
            safety, of the most ample honours and the most abundant <lb/>
            fortune, blessed with a wife and children, near relations of <lb/>
            your own,2 declares war against the republic ? and during <lb/>
            which, (need I add?) amid the great unanimity of senate and <lb/>
            people, there is still such a vast amount of evil remaining, <lb/>
            within the walls ? But, at the time that I was writing this, <lb/>
            I was afflicted with the utmost grief, because, when the re- <lb/>
            public had accepted me as a surety,3 as it were, for this young <lb/>
            man, this almost boy, I scarcely thought that I should be <lb/>
            able to perform what I had undertaken. And an engagement <lb/>
            for another person's principles and sentiments, especially in <lb/>
            affairs of preeminent importance, is a graver obligation, and <lb/>
            one more difficult to endure, than an engagement for money. <lb/>
            For money cau be paid, and the loss of property may be <lb/>
            borne; but how are you to discharge that for which you have <lb/>
            engaged to the state, unless he on whose behalf you made <lb/>
            the engagement is willing to allow it to be discharged ? Yet <lb/>
            I shall be able, as I hope, to hold this youth to his engage- <lb/>
            ments, in spite of many that offer resistance to me. For <lb/>
            there seems to be in him a good natural disposition; but his <lb/>
            age is ductile, and many are ready to lead him astray, who, <lb/>
            by holding out to him the splendour of false honour, think <lb/>
            that the perspicacity of his judgment may be dazzled.</p>
          <p>To my other troubles, therefore, is added the labour also <lb/>
            of using every contrivance to keep the young man to his <lb/>
            duty, that I may not incur the imputation of rashness. <lb/>
            And yet what rashness is it? For I have bound him for <lb/>
            whom I have become surety, rather than myself Nor is it <lb/>
            possible that the republic should repent that I have become <lb/>
            surety for him, since in his conduct he has grown more <note type="footnote"> 1 This alludes, observes Middleton, to Octavius, who, with Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus, forbore to pursue Antony after the battle at Mutina. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This refers to Lepidus, whose wife was the sister of Brutus. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 When Cicero speaks of being surety for Octavius, he refers to the <lb/>

            steady, not only from his natural disposition, but in conse- <lb/>
            quence also of my promise.</p>
          <p>However, if I am not mistaken, the greatest difficulty in <lb/>
            the republic is the want of pecuniary resources; for the re- <lb/>
            spectable classes stop their ears more and more daily against <lb/>
            the call for tribute;1 because that which was collected by the <lb/>
            tax of one per cent.,2 where the rich were iniquitously rated, <lb/>
            has all been spent in rewards to the legions.</p>
          <p>Boundless expenses also threaten us, both for those armies <lb/>
            with which we are now defended, and also for yours; as to <lb/>
            Cassius, he seems likely to come sufficiently provided. But <lb/>
            I wish to discuss these and many other matters in conversa- <lb/>
            tion with you; and I trust to do so very soon.</p>
          <p>With respect to your sister's sons, my dear Brutus, I did <lb/>
            not wait for you to write to me. Doubtless the times them- <lb/>
            selves (for this war is sure to be protracted) reserve the whole <lb/>
            affair for you.3 But, from the very first, when I could form <lb/>
            no conjecture with respect to the duration of the war, I <lb/>
            pleaded the cause of the boys in the senate with such earnest- <lb/>
            ness as I suppose you have already understood from their <lb/>
            mother's letters. Nor shall there ever be any matter in <lb/>
            which, even at the peril of my life, I will not both do and <lb/>
            say what I think that you wish, and what I conceive to be <lb/>
            for your advantage. Farewell. The 27th of July. <note type="footnote"> 1 This tribute seems to have been a sort of capitation tax, propor- <lb/>

          <p>HAD permission been allowed me by your legions, which <lb/>
            are most hostile to my name and to the Roman people, to <lb/>
            come into the senate and discuss the affairs of the republic <lb/>
            before that assembly, I should have done so; and that not <lb/>
            so much from inclination as from necessity; for no remedies <lb/>
            which are applied to wounds cause such severe pain as those <lb/>
            which tend to effect a complete cure. But since the senate <lb/>
            is surrounded with armed men, it cannot honestly come to <lb/>
            any decision but that it is afraid: (there are the standards of <lb/>
            armies in the capitol; soldiers are strolling about the city; 2 a <lb/>
            camp is pitched in the Campus Martius ; and all Italy is <lb/>
            occupied in every quarter by legions raised to protect our <lb/>
            liberties, but brought hither to enslave us, and by the cavalry <lb/>
            of foreign nations:) I will for the present yield to you the <lb/>
            forum, and the senate-house, and the most sacred temples of <lb/>
            the immortal gods, in which (liberty, that revived for a time, <lb/>
            being now again put down) the senate is consulted about <lb/>
            nothing, fears much, and agrees to everything.</p>
          <p>In a short time, if the times should require such a step, I <lb/>
            will also depart from the city, which, having been saved by <lb/>
            me, in order that it might be free, I shall not endure to see <lb/>
            in slavery. I shall be willing even to depart from life, which, <lb/>
            although it is full of anxiety, yet, as long as it is likely to be <lb/>
            of service to the state, consoles me with favourable hopes of <lb/>
            a fair reputation with posterity; but should those hopes be <lb/>
            taken away, I shall die without hesitation, and I shall depart <lb/>
            in such a manner, that good fortune shall appear to have been <lb/>
            wanting to my judgment, rather than courage to myself.</p>

            of service in my absence: if indeed my personal safety is <lb/>
            either useful to the commonwealth, or at the least connected <lb/>
            with the public safety. For, by the faith of the immortal <lb/>
            gods, (unless haply I appeal to those in vain whose ears and <lb/>
            minds are alienated from us,) and by tho fortune of the <lb/>
            Roman people, (which although it is now unfavourable to us, <lb/>
            was at one time, and, as I trust, will again be propitious,) <lb/>
            who is there so devoid of humanity, who so bitterly hostile <lb/>
            to the name of this city, and to the homes of the citizens, as <lb/>
            to be able either to conceal his grief, or to feel none, at such <lb/>
            events as these ? Or who, if he cannot by any means remedy <lb/>
            the public miseries, would not withdraw from his own share <lb/>
            in the danger by death?</p>
          <p>For, that I may begin at the beginning, and proceed to the <lb/>
            end, and compare the last events with the first, what day, as <lb/>
            it has arrived, has not been more miserable than the preced- <lb/>
            ing one? And what successive hour has not been more full <lb/>
            of calamities to the Roman people than that which was before <lb/>
            it? Mark Antony, a man of the greatest courage, (would <lb/>
            that he had also been a man of wise counsels!) after Caius <lb/>
            Cæsar had been removed (bravely, indeed, but far from for- <lb/>
            tunately) from the dominion which he was exercising over <lb/>
            the republic, had become eager to obtain a more king-like <lb/>
            authority than a free city could possibly endure. He squan- <lb/>
            dered the public money; he drained the treasury; he dimi- <lb/>
            nished the revenues; he lavished the freedom of the city in <lb/>
            every direction, in professed compliance with Cæsar's will; <lb/>
            he exercised a dictatorship; he imposed laws; he prevented <lb/>
            a dictator from being appointed by law; he himself in the <lb/>
            senate opposed the decrees of the senate; he desired to en- <lb/>
            gross all the provinces to himself. From a man, indeed, by <lb/>
            whom Macedonia was despised as a province, though Cæsar, <lb/>
            when victorious, had taken it for himself, what could we hope <lb/>
            or expect?</p>
          <p>You stood forward as the assertor of our freedom, a most <lb/>
            excellent assert or according to your conduct at that time; <lb/>
            (would that neither our own opinion, nor your assurances of <lb/>
            good-faith, had deceived us!) and collecting all the veteran? <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            into one body, and drawing off two of the legions, from <lb/>
            menacing the ruin of their country, to contribute to ita <lb/>
            safety, you suddenly, by your own power, raised up the repub- <lb/>
            lic when in great distress and almost overthrown. What at <lb/>
            that time did not the senate bestow upon you before you <lb/>
            solicited it, more abundantly than you even desired, and with <lb/>
            more frequency than you had ventured to hope? It gave <lb/>
            you the forces, in order that it might have a defender armed <lb/>
            with authority, not that it might arm an adversary with <lb/>
            military power against itself. It gave you the title of <lb/>
            Imperator, after the army of the enemy1 had been routed, <lb/>
            assigning you honour, and not intending that that army, <lb/>
            fleeing and routed, should confer such a title on you by its <lb/>
            utter defeat. It voted you a statue in the forum, a place <lb/>
            in the senate, the highest honours in the state, before you <lb/>
            arrived at the legal age for them. If there is anything else <lb/>
            which can be bestowed on you, let it add that; but what is <lb/>
            there beyond this that you can wish to receive?</p>
          <p>If, however, everything has been bestowed on you without <lb/>
            any regard to your age, or to precedent, or even to the fact <lb/>
            that you are a mortal man, why do you so cruelly, if un- <lb/>
            grateful, so wickedly, if forgetful of the benefits heaped upon <lb/>
            you, thus seek to cripple the power of the senate ? Whither <lb/>
            have we sent you ? from whom are you returning? Against <lb/>
            whom is it that we have armed you? Against whom is it <lb/>
            that you are thinking of waging war From whom are you <lb/>
            leading away your army? Against whom are you marshalling <lb/>
            your troops? Why is any enemy left? Why is a citizen re- <lb/>
            garded as an enemy? Why, in the middle of your march, <lb/>
            is your camp moved further from that of the enemy, and <lb/>
            nearer to the city?</p>
          <p>Alas me! never really wise, though at one time vainly <lb/>
            thought to be that which I was not, how greatly, 0 Roman <lb/>
            people, has your opinion of me deceived you! Alas for my <lb/>
            unfortunate and rash old age! Alas for my grey hairs, dis- <lb/>
            honoured at the end of a life deprived of judgment! It was <lb/>
            I that incited the conscript fathers to the ruin of their <lb/>
            country; it was I that deceived the republic. It was I my- <lb/>
            relf that persuaded the senate to lay violent hands on its own <note type="footnote"> 1 The army of Antony, defeated at the battle of Mutina. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            existence, when I called you a Junonian1 youth, and the <lb/>
            golden offspring of your mother. But the fates of your <lb/>
            native land pointed you out as its future Paris, one who <lb/>
            should lay waste the city with conflagration, Italy with war; - <lb/>
            one who should pitch his camp in the temples of the immor- <lb/>
            tal gods, and hold the senate in his camp.</p>
          <p>Alas! for the miserable change in the affairs of the com- <lb/>
            monwealth, so rapid and sudden, so different from all former <lb/>
            circumstances! What writer will ever exist of such genius, <lb/>
            as to be able so to give an account of these events that they <lb/>
            shall appear to be facts and not fictions? What reader will <lb/>
            ever exist of so credulous a disposition, as not to think those <lb/>
            things akin to fable which will then be handed down in our <lb/>
            records with the greatest truth? For reflect that Antony <lb/>
            was pronounced a public enemy; that the consul elect, the <lb/>
            very father of the republic, was besieged by him; that you <lb/>
            went forth to deliver the consul and to crush the enemy; that <lb/>
            the enemy was routed by you, and the consul delivered from <lb/>
            his state of siege; then, that a short time afterwards that <lb/>
            very enemy who had been routed was sent for by you, and <lb/>
            united as a coheir with you to seize the goods of the Roman <lb/>
            people, as if the republic had been dead; that the consul <lb/>
            elect was again blockaded in a place where he defended him- <lb/>
            self, not with walls, but with rivers and mountains:- Who <lb/>
            will attempt to relate such events as these? Who will dare <lb/>
            to believe them ? It may indeed be permitted to a man to <lb/>
            have erred once with impunity; and a frank confession may <lb/>
            be an excuse for an offender; for I will speak the truth; I <lb/>
            would rather, 0 Antony, that we had not driven you away <lb/>
            when you were our master, than that we should receive this <lb/>
            youth in that character! Not that any slavery is desirable, <lb/>
            but because the fortune of the slave is more or less dis- <lb/>
            honourable according to the dignity of his master; and of <lb/>
            two evils, while we have to avoid the greater, we must choose <lb/>
            the less.</p>
          <p>Antony, however, condescended to obtain by entreaty the <lb/>
            things which he wished to appropriate; you, Octavius, extort <lb/>
            them by force. He applied for a province legitimately, as a <note type="footnote"> 1 Either because Mars, the god of war, was the son of Juno; or <lb/>

            consul; you coveted one, though invested with no office. lie <lb/>
            erected tribunals, and passed laws, to ensure the safety of the <lb/>
            wicked; you do so to procure the destruction of the most <lb/>
            virtuous. He protected the capital from bloodshed and from <lb/>
            conflagration at the hands of slaves; you wish to destroy <lb/>
            everything, and bury it under blood and flame. If he acted <lb/>
            as a king, who assigned provinces to Cassius and the Bruti, <lb/>
            and those other protectors of our name, what will he do who <lb/>
            seeks to rob them of life? If he who drove them out of the <lb/>
            city was a tyrant, what shall we call him who does not leave <lb/>
            them even a place to live in exile?</p>
          <p>If, therefore, there is any sense at all in those buried re- <lb/>
            mains of our ancestors; if all sense and feeling is not con- <lb/>
            sumed in the same fire with the body; what, if they should <lb/>
            ask what the Roman people are now doing,-what, I say, will <lb/>
            any one of us reply who next takes his departure to those <lb/>
            eternal mansions? Or what account will those ancient heroes <lb/>
            of our race, the African!, the Fabii, the Paulli, and the <lb/>
            Scipios, receive of their posterity? What will they fear <lb/>
            concerning their country, which they themselves decorated <lb/>
            with spoils and triumphs? Will any one venture to tell them <lb/>
            that there is a certain young man, about eighteen years old, <lb/>
            whose grandfather was a banker, whose father was a mere <lb/>
            hack bail, each of them subsisting on precarious sources of <lb/>
            livelihood; the one continuing such practices till his old age, <lb/>
            so that he cannot deny it; the other beginning them in his <lb/>
            boyhood, so that it is impossible for him not to confess it: <lb/>
            that this youth is plundering and ravaging the republic; a <lb/>
            youth to whom no valour, no provinces reduced in war and <lb/>
            annexed to the empire, no dignity on the part of his ances- <lb/>
            tors, had attached the assistance of the powerful, but whose <lb/>
            beauty, by infamous practices, had gained him money, and <lb/>
            caused, in his person, a respectable name to be polluted with <lb/>
            licentiousness; that he had collected the veteran gladiators <lb/>
            of Julius, worn out with wounds and age, the needy relics of <lb/>
            the school of Cæsar, to take up arms again, surrounded with <lb/>
            whom he might throw everything into confusion, show pity <lb/>
            for no one, and live for himself alone; a youth who obtained <lb/>
            possession of the republic as if it were a dowry settled on <lb/>
            him at his marriage, or bequeathed to him by will?</p>
          <p>The two Decii will hear that those citizens are now slavey <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            to secure whose dominion over their enemies they devoted <lb/>
            themselves to death as the only means of victory. Caius <lb/>
            Marius will hear that we are under the orders of a licentious <lb/>
            master; he who would not keep even a private soldier of loose <lb/>
            character in his army. Brutus will hear that that people, <lb/>
            whom he himself in the first instance, and whom his posterity <lb/>
            in a subsequent age, emancipated from kingly power, is now <lb/>
            surrendered to slavery as the price of shameless debauchery. <lb/>
            If this intelligence is conveyed to them by no one else, it <lb/>
            shall certaiuly be soon conveyed to them by me; for if, <lb/>
            while alive, I shall be unable to escape those evils; I have <lb/>
            determined to flee from them by quitting life at the same <lb/>
            time.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>These Dialogues were written, or at least published, by Cicero in the <lb/>
            year B.C. 55, when he was about fifty-two years old, in the second <lb/>
            consulship of Pompey and Crassus. He composed them at the re- <lb/>
            quest of his brother Quintus, in order that he might set forth in <lb/>
            better form, at a more advanced period of life, and after his long <lb/>
            experience, those opinions on oratory which he had somewhat hastily <lb/>
            and crudely advanced in his early years in his books on Invention. <lb/>
            The Dialogues are supposed to have been held B.C. 91, when there <lb/>
            were great contentions at Rome respecting the proposal of the <lb/>
            tribune Marcus Livius Drusus to allow the senators, in common with <lb/>
            the equites, to be judges on criminal trials.</p>
          <p>The persons present at the dialogue related in the first book are Lucius <lb/>
            Licinius Crassus, Marcus Antonius, his friend, the two most eminent <lb/>
            orators of their day; Quintus Mucius Scævola, the father-in-law of <lb/>
            Crassus, who was celebrated for his knowledge of the civil law, and <lb/>
            from whom Cicero himself received instruction in his youth; and two <lb/>
            young men, Caius Amelius Cotta, and Publius Sulpicius Rufus, youths <lb/>
            of much ability and promise, who were anxious to distinguish them- <lb/>
            selves in oratory, and for whose instruction the precepts and obser- <lb/>
            vations conveyed in the Dialogues are supposed to have been delivered. <lb/>
            The scene of the conversations is the Tusculan villa of Crassus, to <lb/>
            which he had retired from the tumults at Rome, and where he was <lb/>
            joined by the rest of the party.</p>
          <p>The object of Cicero, in these books, was to set before his reader all <lb/>
            that was important in the rhetorical treatises of Aristotle, Isocrates, <lb/>
            and other ancient writers on oratory, divested of technicalities, and <lb/>
            presented in a pleasing form.</p>
          <p>Crassus and Antonius, in the first book, discourse on all the qualifica- <lb/>
            tions of a perfect orator, Crassus being the exponent of the senti- <lb/>
            cants of Cicero himself, and maintaining that a complete orator <lb/>
            must be acquainted with the whole circle of art and science. <lb/>
            Antonius expresses his opinion that far less learning is required in <lb/>
            the orator than Crassus supposes, and that, as universal knowledge <pb n="143"/>
             <note type="margin">C I.] </note> <lb/>
            is unattainable, it will be well for him not to attempt to acquire too <lb/>
            much, as he will thus only distract his thoughts, and render himself <lb/>
            less capable of attaining excellence in speaking, than if, contenting <lb/>
            himself with moderate acquirements, he devoted his attention chiefly <lb/>
            to the improvement of his natural talents and qualifications for <lb/>
            oratory.</p>
          <p>Cicero bestowed great consideration on the work, and had it long in <lb/>
            hand. Ep. ad Att. iv. 12. See also Ad Att. iv. 16; xiii. 19; Ad <lb/>
            Fain. i. 9.</p>
          <p>I. As I frequently contemplate and call to mind the times <lb/>
            of old, those in general seem to me, brother Quintus, to have <lb/>
            been supremely happy, who, while they were distinguished <lb/>
            with honours and the glory of their actions in the best days <lb/>
            of the republic, were enabled to pursue such a course of life, <lb/>
            that they could continue either in employment without <lb/>
            danger, or in retirement with dignity. To myself, also, there <lb/>
            was a time when I thought that a season for relaxation, and <lb/>
            for turning my thoughts again to the noble studies once <lb/>
            pursued by both of us, would be fairly allowable, and be <lb/>
            conceded by almost every one; if the infinite labour of <lb/>
            forensic business and the occupations of ambition should be <lb/>
            brought to a stand, either by the completion of my course of <lb/>
            honours,2 or by the decline of age. Such expectations, with <lb/>
            regard to my studies and designs, not only the severe cala- <lb/>
            mities resulting from public occurrences, but a variety of <lb/>
            our own private troubles,3 have disappointed. For in that <lb/>
            period,4 which seemed likely to offer most quiet and tran- <lb/>
            quillity, the greatest pressures of trouble and the most <lb/>
            turbulent storms arose. Nor to our wishes and earnest <lb/>
            desires has the enjoyment of leisure been granted, to culti- <lb/>
            vate and revive between ourselves those studies to which we <lb/>
            have from early youth been addicted. For at our first <lb/>

          <p>II. Here the recollection of an old tradition must be <lb/>
            revived in my mind, a recollection not indeed sufficiently <lb/>
            distinct, but adapted, I think, so far to reply to what you <lb/>
            ask, that you may understand what opinions the most famous <lb/>
            and eloquent men entertained respecting the whole art of <lb/>
            oratory. For you wish, as you have often said to me, (since <lb/>
            what went abroad rough and incomplete2 from our own note- <lb/>
            books, when we were boys or young men, is scarcely worthy <lb/>
            of my present standing in life, and that experience which I <lb/>
            have gained from so many and such important causes as <lb/>
            I have pleaded,) that something more polished and complete <lb/>
            should be offered by me on the same subjects; and you are <lb/>
            at times inclined to dissent from me in our disputations on <lb/>
            this matter; inasmuch as I consider eloquence to be the <lb/>
            offspring of the accomplishments of the most learned men ;3 <lb/>
            but you think it must be regarded as independent of ele- <lb/>
            gant learning, and attributable to a peculiar kind of talent <lb/>
            and practice.</p>
          <p>Often, indeed, as I review in thought the greatest of man- <lb/>
            kind, and those endowed with the highest abilities, it has <lb/>
            appeared to me worthy of inquiry what was the cause that <lb/>
            a greater number of persons have been admirable in every <lb/>
            other pursuit than in speaking. For which way soever you <lb/>
            direct your view in thought and contemplation, you will see <note type="footnote"> 1 Alluding to the conspiracy of Catiline. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The two books De Inventions Rhetoricd. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Prudentissimorum.

            numbers excellent in every species, not only of the humble, <lb/>
            but even of the highest arts. Who, indeed, is there, that, if <lb/>
            he would measure the qualifications of illustrious men, either <lb/>
            by the usefulness or magnitude of their actions, would not <lb/>
            prefer a general to an orator? Yet who doubts that we can <lb/>
            produce, from this city alone, almost innumerable excellent <lb/>
            commanders, while we can number scarcely a few eminent in <lb/>
            speaking? There have been many also in our own memory, <lb/>
            and more in that of our fathers, and even of our forefathers, <lb/>
            who had abilities to rule and govern affairs of state by their <lb/>
            counsel and wisdom; while for a long period no tolerable <lb/>
            orators were found, or scarcely one in every age. But lest <lb/>
            any one should think that the art of speaking may more <lb/>
            justly be compared with other pursuits, which depend upon <lb/>
            abstruse studies, and a varied field of learning, than with the <lb/>
            merits of a general, or the wisdom of a prudent senator, let <lb/>
            him turn his thoughts to those particular sciences themselves, <lb/>
            and contemplate who and how many have flourished in them, <lb/>
            as he will thus be best enabled to judge how great a scarcity <lb/>
            of orators there is and has ever been.</p>
          <p>III. It does not escape your observation that what the <lb/>
            Greeks call PHILOSOPHY, is esteemed by the most learned <lb/>
            men, the originator, as it were, and parent of all the arts <lb/>
            which merit praise; philosophy, I say, in which it is difficult <lb/>
            to enumerate how many distinguished men there have been, <lb/>
            and of how great knowledge, variety, and comprehensiveness <lb/>
            in their studies, men who have not confined their labours to <lb/>
            one province separately, but have embraced whatever they <lb/>
            could master either by scientific investigations, or by pro- <lb/>
            cesses of reasoning. Who is ignorant in how great obscurity <lb/>
            of matter, in how abstruse, manifold, and subtle an art they <lb/>
            who are called mathematicians are engaged? Yet in that <lb/>
            pursuit so many men have arrived at excellence, that not one <lb/>
            seems to have applied himself to the science in earnest <lb/>
            without attaining in it whatever he desired. Who has ever <lb/>
            devoted himself wholly to music; who has ever given himself <lb/>
            up to the learning which they profess who are called gramma- <lb/>
            rians, without compassing, in knowledge and understanding, <lb/>
            the whole substance and matter of those sciences, though <lb/>
            almost boundless? Of all those who have engaged in the most <lb/>
            liberal pursuits and departments of such sciences, I think I <unclear/><lb/>
            D<pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            may truly say that a smaller number of eminent poets have <lb/>
            arisen than of men distinguished in any other branch of litera- <lb/>
            ture; and in the whole multitude of the learned, among whom <lb/>
            there rarely appears one of the highest excellence, there will <lb/>
            be found, if you will but make a careful review of our own <lb/>
            list and that of the Greeks, far fewer good orators than good <lb/>
            poets. This ought to seem the more wonderful, as attain- <lb/>
            ments in other sciences are drawn from recluse and hidden <lb/>
            springs; but the whole art of speaking lies before us, and is <lb/>
            concerned with common usage and the custom and language <lb/>
            of all men; eo that while in other things that is most excel- <lb/>
            lent which is most remote from the knowledge and under- <lb/>
            standing of the illiterate, it is in speaking even the greatest <lb/>
            of faults to vary from the ordinary kind of language, and the <lb/>
            practice sanctioned by universal reason.</p>
          <p>IV. Yet it cannot be said with truth, either that more are <lb/>
            devoted to the other arts, or that they are excited by greater <lb/>
            pleasure, more abundant hope, or more ample rewards; for to <lb/>
            say nothing of Greece, which was always desirous to hold <lb/>
            the first place in eloquence, and Athens, that inventress <lb/>
            of all literature, in which the utmost power of oratory was <lb/>
            both discovered and brought to perfection, in this very city <lb/>
            of ours, assuredly, no studies were ever pursued with more <lb/>
            earnestness than those tending to the acquisition of elo- <lb/>
            quence. For when our empire over all nations was esta- <lb/>
            blished, and after a period of peace had secured tranquillity, <lb/>
            there was scarcely a youth ambitious of praise who did not <lb/>
            think that he must strive, with all his endeavours, to attain <lb/>
            the art of speaking. For a time, indeed, as being ignorant <lb/>
            of all method, and as thinking there was no course of ex- <lb/>
            ercise for them, or any precepts of art, they attained what <lb/>
            they could by the single force of genius and thought. But <lb/>
            afterwards, having heard the Greek orators, and gained an <lb/>
            acquaintance with Greek literature, and procured instruc- <lb/>
            tors, our countrymen were inflamed with an incredible <lb/>
            passion for eloquence. The magnitude, the variety, the mul- <lb/>
            titude of all kind of causes, excited them to such a degree, <lb/>
            that to that learning which each had acquired by his indi- <lb/>
            vidual study, frequent practice, which was superior to the <lb/>
            precepts of all masters, was at once added. There were then, <lb/>
            as there are also now, the highest inducements offered for the <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin">C. V.] </note> <lb/>
            cultivation of this study, in regard to public favour, wealth, <lb/>
            and dignity. The abilities of our countrymen (as we may <lb/>
            judge from many particulars,) far excelled those of the men <lb/>
            of every other nation. For which reasons, who would not <lb/>
            justly wonder that in the records of all ages, times, and states, <lb/>
            so small a number of orators should be found ?</p>
          <p>But the art of eloquence is something greater, and col- <lb/>
            lected from more sciences and studies, than people imagine. <lb/>
            V. For who can suppose that, amid the greatest multitude of <lb/>
            students, the utmost abundance of masters, the most emi- <lb/>
            nent geniuses among men, the infinite variety of causes, <lb/>
            the most ample rewards offered to eloquence, there is any <lb/>
            other reason to be found for the small number of orators <lb/>
            than the incredible magnitude and difficulty of the art? A <lb/>
            knowledge of a vast number of things is necessary, without <lb/>
            which volubility of words is empty and ridiculous ; speech <lb/>
            itself is to be formed, not merely by choice, but by careful <lb/>
            construction of words ; and all the emotions of the mind, <lb/>
            which nature has given to man, must be intimately known ; <lb/>
            for all the force and art of speaking must be employed in <lb/>
            allaying or exciting the feelings of those who listen. To this <lb/>
            must be added a certain portion of grace and wit, learning <lb/>
            worthy of a well-bred man, and quickness and brevity in <lb/>
            replying as well as attacking, accompanied with a refined <lb/>
            decorum and urbanity. Besides, the whole of antiquity and <lb/>
            a multitude of examples is to be kept in the memory; nor is <lb/>
            the knowledge of laws in general, or of the civil law in par- <lb/>
            ticular, to be neglected. And why need I add any remarks <lb/>
            on delivery itself, which is to be ordered by action of <lb/>
            body, by gesture, by look, and by modulation and varia- <lb/>
            tion of the voice, the great power of which, alone and in <lb/>
            itself, the comparatively trivial art of actors and the stage <lb/>
            proves, on which though all bestow their utmost labour to <lb/>
            form their look, voice, and gesture, who knows not how fev <lb/>
            there are, and have ever been, to whom we can attend with. <lb/>
            patience ? What can I say of that repository for all things, <lb/>
            the memory, which, unless it be made the keeper of the <lb/>
            matter and words that are the fruits of thought and inven- <lb/>
            tion, all the talents of the orator, we see, though they bo <lb/>
            of the highest degree of excellence, will be of no avail ? Let <lb/>
            as then cease to wonder what is the cause of the scarcity o <note type="footnote"> D.2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            good speakers, since eloquence results from all th ose quali- <lb/>
            fications, in each of which singly it is a great merit to labour <lb/>
            successfully; and let us rather exhort our children, and others <lb/>
            whose glory and honour is dear to us, to contemplate in their <lb/>
            minds the full magnitude of the object, and not to trust that <lb/>
            they can reach the height at which they aim, by the aid of the <lb/>
            precepts, masters, and exercises, that they are all now follow- <lb/>
            ing, but to understand that they must adopt others of a <lb/>
            different character.</p>
          <p>VI. In my opinion, indeed, no man can be an orator <lb/>
            possessed of every praiseworthy accomplishment, unless he <lb/>
            has attained the knowledge of everything important, and of <lb/>
            all liberal arts, for his language must be ornate and copious <lb/>
            from knowledge, since, unless there be beneath the surface <lb/>
            matter understood and felt by the speaker, oratory becomes <lb/>
            an empty and almost puerile flow of words. Yet I will <lb/>
            not lay so great a burden upon orators, especially our own, <lb/>
            amid so many occupations of public and private life, as <lb/>
            to think it allowable for them to be ignorant of nothing; <lb/>
            although the qualifications of an orator, and his very pro- <lb/>
            fession of speaking well, seem to undertake and promise that <lb/>
            he can discourse gracefully and copiously on whatever sub- <lb/>
            ject is proposed to him. But because this, I doubt not, will <lb/>
            appear to most people an immense and infinite undertaking, <lb/>
            and because I see that the Greeks, men amply endowed not <lb/>
            only with genius and learning, but also with leisure and appli- <lb/>
            cation, have made a kind of partition of the arts, and have <lb/>
            not singly laboured in the whole circle of oratory, but have <lb/>
            separated from the other parts of rhetoric that department <lb/>
            of eloquence which is used in the forum on trials or in deli- <lb/>
            berations, and have left this species only to the orator; I <lb/>
            shall not embrace in these books more than has been attri- <lb/>
            buted to this kind of speaking! by the almost unanimous <lb/>
            consent of the greatest men, after much examination and <lb/>
            discussion of the subject; and I shall repeat, not a series of <lb/>
            precepts drawn from the infancy of our old and boyish learn- <lb/>
            ing, but matters which I have heard were formerly argued <lb/>
            in a discussion among some of our countrymen who were <lb/>
            of the highest eloquence, and of the first rank in every kind <note type="footnote"> 1 Deliberative and judicial oratory ; omitting the epideictic or demon- <lb/>
            strative kind. </note> <pb n="149"/>
             <note type="margin">C. VII. </note> <lb/>
            of dignity. Not that I contemn the instructions which the <lb/>
            Greek rhetoricians and teachers have left as, but, as they are <lb/>
            already public, and within the reach of all, and can neither <lb/>
            be set forth more elegantly, nor explained more clearly by <lb/>
            my interpretation, you will, I think, excuse me,.my brother, <lb/>
            if I prefer to the Greeks the authority of those to whom the <lb/>
            utmost merit in eloquence has been allowed by our own <lb/>
            countrymen.</p>
          <p>VII. At the time, then, when the consul Philippus was vehe- <lb/>
            mently inveighing against, the cause of the nobility, and the <lb/>
            tribuneship of Drusus, undertaken to support the authority <lb/>
            of the senate, seemed to be shaken and weakened, I was told, <lb/>
            I remember, that Lucius Crassus, as if for the purpose of <lb/>
            collecting his thoughts, betook himself, during the days of the <lb/>
            Roman games, to his Tusculan country-seat, whither also <lb/>
            Quintus Mucius, who had been his father-in-law, is said to have <lb/>
            come at the same time, as well as Marcus Antonius, a sharer <lb/>
            in all the political proceedings of Crassus, and united in the <lb/>
            closest friendship with him. There went out with Crassus him- <lb/>
            self two young men besides, great friends of Drusus, youths <lb/>
            of whom our ancestors then entertained sanguine hopes that <lb/>
            they would maintain the dignity of their order; Caius <lb/>
            Cotta, who was then a candidate for the tribuneship of the <lb/>
            people, and Publius Sulpicius, who was thought likely to <lb/>
            stand for that office in due course. These, on the first day, <lb/>
            conferred much together until very late in the evening, <lb/>
            concerning the condition of those times, and the whole com- <lb/>
            monwealth, for which purpose they had met. Cotta re- <lb/>
            peated to me many things then prophetically lamented and <lb/>
            noticed by the three of consular dignity in that conversation 1 <lb/>
            so that no misfortune afterwards happened to the state which <lb/>
            they had not perceived to be hanging over it so long before; <lb/>
            and he said that, when this conversation was finished, there <lb/>
            was such politeness shown by Crassus, that after they had <lb/>
            bathed and sat down to table, all the seriousness of the former <lb/>
            discourse was banished; and there appeared so much plea <lb/>
            gantry in him, and so much agreeableness in his humour <lb/>
            that though the early part of the day might seem to have <lb/>
            been passed by them in the senate-house, the banquet showed <lb/>
            all the delights of the Tusculan villa.</p>
          <p>But on the next day, when the older part of the company <pb n="150"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I</note> <lb/>
            had taken sufficient repose, and were come to their walk, <lb/>
            he told me that Scævola, after taking two or three turns, <lb/>
            said, " Why should not we, Crassus, imitate Socrates in the <lb/>
            Phædrus of Plato ? 1 for this plane-tree of yours has put me <lb/>
            in mind of it, which diffuses its spreading boughs to over- <lb/>
            shade this place, not less widely than that did whose covert <lb/>
            Socrates sought, and which seems to me to have grown not <lb/>
            so much from the rivulet which is described, as from the <lb/>
            language of Plato : and what Socrates, with the hardest of <lb/>
            feet, used to do, that is, to throw himself on the grass, while <lb/>
            he delivered those sentiments which philosophers say were <lb/>
            uttered divinely, may surely, with more justice, be allowed to <lb/>
            my feet." Then Crassus rejoined, "Nay, we will yet further <lb/>
            consult your convenience;" and called for cushions; when <lb/>
            they all, said Cotta, sat down on the seats that were under <lb/>
            the plane-tree.</p>
          <p>VIII. There, (as Cotta used to relate,) in order that the <lb/>
            minds of them all might have some relaxation from their <lb/>
            former discourse, Crassus introduced a conversation on the <lb/>
            study of oratory. After he had commenced in this manner, <lb/>
            That indeed Sulpicius and Cotta did not seem to need his <lb/>
            exhortations, but rather both to deserve his praise, as they <lb/>
            had already attained such powers as not only to excel their <lb/>
            equals in age, but to be admitted to a comparison with their <lb/>
            seniors; " Nor does anything seem to me," he added, "more <lb/>
            noble than to be able to fix the attention of assemblies of <lb/>
            men by speaking, to fascinate their minds, to direct their <lb/>
            passions to whatever object the orator pleases, and to dissuade <lb/>
            them from whatsoever he desires. This particular art has <lb/>
            constantly flourished above all others in every free state, and <lb/>
            especially in those which have enjoyed peace and tranquillity, <lb/>
            and has over exercised great power. For what is so admirable <lb/>
            as that, out of an infinite multitude of men, there should <lb/>
            arise a single individual, who can alone, or with only a few <lb/>
            others, exert effectually that power which nature has granted <lb/>
            to all ? Or what is so pleasant to be heard and understood as <note type="footnote"> 1 P. 229. Compare Ruhnken ad Lex. Timæi, v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμφιλαφές</foreign>,and <lb/>

            may either be protected yourself, or defy the malicious, or <lb/>
            avenge yourself when provoked? Or consider, (that you <lb/>
            may not always contemplate the forum, the benches, the <lb/>
            rostra, and the senate,) what can be more delightful in leisure, <lb/>
            or more suited to social intercourse, than elegant conversa- <lb/>
            tion, betraying no want of intelligence on any subject ? For <lb/>
            it is by this one gift that we are most distinguished from <lb/>
            brute animals, that we converse together, and can express our <lb/>
            thoughts by speech. Who therefore would not justly make <lb/>
            this an object of admiration, and think it worthy of his utmost <lb/>
            exertions, to surpass mankind themselves in that single ex- <lb/>
            cellence by which they claim their superiority over brutes! <lb/>
            But, that we may notice the most important point of all, <lb/>
            what other power could either have assembled mankind, <lb/>
            when dispersed, into one place, or have brought them from <lb/>
            wild and savage life to the present humane and civilized <lb/>
            state of society; or, when cities were established, have <lb/>
            described for them laws, judicial institutions, and rights? <lb/>
            And that I may not mention more examples, which are almost <lb/>
            without number, I will conclude the subject in one short <lb/>
            sentence : for I consider, that by the judgment and wisdom <lb/>
            of the perfect orator, not only his own honour, but that of <lb/>
            many other individuals, and the welfare of the whole state, <lb/>
            are principally upheld. Go on, therefore, as you are doing, <lb/>
            young men, and apply earnestly to the study in which you <lb/>
            are engaged, that you may be an honour to yourselves, an <lb/>
            advantage to your friends, and a benefit to the republic."</p>
          <p>IX. Scævola then observed with courtesy, as was always <lb/>
            his manner, " I agree with Crassus as to other points (that <lb/>
            I may not detract from the art or glory of Lælius, my <lb/>
            father-in-law, or of my son-in-law here),1 but I am afraid, <note type="footnote"> I Crassus. </note> <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I</note> <lb/>
            Crassus, that I cannot grant you these two points; one, that <lb/>
            states were, as you said, originally established, and have often <lb/>
            been preserved, by orators; the other, that, setting aside the <lb/>
            forum, the assemblies of the people, the courts of judicature, <lb/>
            and the senate-house, the orator is, as you pronounced, accom- <lb/>
            plished in every subject of conversation and learning. For <lb/>
            who will concede to you, either that mankind, dispersed <lb/>
            originally in mountains and woods, enclosed themselves in <lb/>
            towns and walls, not so much from being convinced by the <lb/>
            counsels of the wise, as from being charmed by the speeches <lb/>
            of the eloquent ? Or that other advantages, arising either <lb/>
            from the establishment or preservation of states, were settled, <lb/>
            not by wise and brave men, but by fluent and elegant <lb/>
            speakers? Does Romulus seem to you to have assembled <lb/>
            the shepherds, and those that flocked to him from all parts, <lb/>
            or to have formed marriages with the Sabines, or to have <lb/>
            repelled the power of the neighbouring people, by eloquence, <lb/>
            and not by counsel and eminent wisdom ? Is there any trace <lb/>
            of eloquence apparent in Numa Pompilius, in Servius Tullius, <lb/>
            or in the rest of our kings, from whom we have many excel- <lb/>
            lent regulations for maintaining our government? After the <lb/>
            kings were expelled (though we see that their expulsion was <lb/>
            effected by the mind of Lucius Brutus, and not by his tongue), <lb/>
            we not perceive that all the subsequent transactions are full <lb/>
            of wise counsel, but destitute of all mixture of eloquence? <lb/>
            But if I should be inclined to adduce examples from our <lb/>
            own and other states, I could cite more instances of mischief <lb/>
            than of benefit done to public affairs by men of eminent <lb/>
            eloquence; but, to omit others, I think, Crassus, that the <lb/>
            most eloquent men I ever heard, except you two,1 were the <lb/>
            Sempronii, Tiberius and Caius, whose father, a prudent and <lb/>
            grave man, but by no means eloquent, on several other occa- <lb/>
            sions, but especially when censor, was of the utmost service <lb/>
            to the republic; and he, not by any faultless flow of speech, <lb/>
            but by a word and a nod, transferred the freedmen into the <lb/>
            city tribes; 2 and, if he had not done so, we should now have <note type="footnote"> 1 Crassus and Antonius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Livy, xlv. 15, says that the freedmen were previously dispersed <lb/>
            among all the four city tribes, and that Gracchus included them all in <lb/>

            influence as possible in voti ng. </note> <pb n="153"/>

            no republic, which we still maintain with difficulty; but his <lb/>
            BOllS, who were eloquent, and qualified for speaking by all the <lb/>
            helps of nature and of learning, having found the state in <lb/>
            a most flourishing condition, both through the counsels of <lb/>
            their father, and the arms of their ancestors, brought their <lb/>
            country, by means of their oratory, that most excellent ruler <lb/>
            of states as you call it, to the verge of ruin.</p>
          <p>X. " Were our ancient laws, and the customs of our an- <lb/>
            cestors; were the auspices, over which you, Crassus, and <lb/>
            I preside with great security to the republic; were the reli- <lb/>
            gious rites and ceremonies; were the civil laws, the know- <lb/>
            ledge of which has long prevailed in our family, (and without <lb/>
            any praise for eloquence,) either invented, or understood, or <lb/>
            in any way ordered by the tribe of orators? I can remember <lb/>
            that Servius Galba, a man of godlike power in speaking, as <lb/>
            well as Marcus AEmilius Porcina, and Cneius Carbo himself, <lb/>
            whom you defeated when you were but a youth,l was igno- <lb/>
            rant of the laws, at a loss in the practices of our ancestors, <lb/>
            and unlearned in civil jurisprudence; and, except you, Crassus, <lb/>
            who, rather from your own inclination to study, than because <lb/>
            it was any peculiar business of an orator, have learned the <lb/>
            civil law from us, as I am sometimes ashamed to say, this <lb/>
            generation of ours is ignorant of law.</p>
          <p>" But what you assumed, as by a law of your own, in <lb/>
            the last part of your speech, that an orator is able to speak <lb/>
            fluently on any subject, I would not, if I were not here in <lb/>
            your own domain, tolerate for a moment, but would head <lb/>
            a party who should either oppose you by an interdict,2 or <lb/>
            summon you to contend with them at law, for having so <lb/>
            unceremoniously invaded the possessions of others. In the <lb/>
            first place, all the Pythagoreans, and the followers of Demo- <lb/>
            critus, would institute a suit against you, with the rest of the <lb/>

            are elegant and powerful speakers, with whom you could not <lb/>
            contend on equal terms.1 Whole troops of other philosophers <lb/>
            would assail you besides, even down from Socrates their <lb/>
            origin and head, and would convince you that you had <lb/>
            learned nothing about good and evil in life, nothing about <lb/>
            the passions of the mind, nothing about the moral conduct of <lb/>
            mankind, nothing about the proper course of life; they would <lb/>
            show you that you have made no due inquiry after know- <lb/>
            ledge, and that you know nothing; and, when they had made <lb/>
            an attack upon you altogether, then every sect would bring <lb/>
            its separate action against you. The Academy would press <lb/>
            you, and, whatever you asserted, force you to deny it. Our <lb/>
            friends the Stoics would hold you entangled in the snares of <lb/>
            their disputations and questions. The Peripatetics would prove <lb/>
            that those very aids and ornaments to speaking, which you <lb/>
            consider the peculiar property of the orators, must be sought <lb/>
            from themselves; and they would show you that Aristotle <lb/>
            and Theophrastus have written not only better, but also far <lb/>
            more copiously, on these subjects, than all the masters of the <lb/>
            art of speaking. I say nothing of the mathematicians, the <lb/>
            grammarians, the musicians, with whose sciences this art of <lb/>
            speaking of yours is not connected by the least affinity. I <lb/>
            think, therefore, Crassus, that such great and numerous pro- <lb/>
            fessions ought not to be made. What you can effect is suf- <lb/>
            ficiently great; namely, that in judicial matters the cause <lb/>
            which you plead shall seem the better and more probable; <lb/>
            that in public assemblies, and in delivering opinions, your <lb/>
            oratory shall have the most power to persuade; that, finally, <lb/>
            you shall seem to the wise to speak with eloquence, and even to <lb/>
            the simple to speak with truth. If you can do more than this, <lb/>
            it will appear to me that it is not the orator, but Crassus <lb/>
            himself that effects it by the force of talents peculiar to <lb/>
            himself, and not common to other orators."</p>

            men, when I came tj Athens as quæstor from Macedonia,' <lb/>
            and when the Academy was in a flourishing state, as it was <lb/>
            represented in those days, for Charmadas, and Clitomachus, <lb/>
            and Æschin es were in possession of it. There was also Me- <lb/>
            trodorus, who, with the others, had been a diligent hearer of <lb/>
            the famous Carneades himself, a man beyond all others, as <lb/>
            they told me, a most spirited and copious speaker. Mnesar- <lb/>
            chus, too, was in great esteem, a hearer of your friend <lb/>
            Panætius, and Diodorus, a scholar of Critolaus the Peri- <lb/>
            patetic; and there were many other famous men besides, <lb/>
            highly distinguished in philosophy, by all of whom, with one <lb/>
            voice as it were, I observed that the orator was repelled from <lb/>
            the government of states, excluded from all learning and <lb/>
            knowledge of great affairs, and degraded and thrust down <lb/>
            into the courts of justice and petty assemblies, as into a <lb/>
            workshop. But I neither assented to those men, nor to the <lb/>
            originator of these disputations, and by far the most eloquent <lb/>
            of them all, the eminently grave and oratorical Plato; whose <lb/>
            Gorgias I then diligently read over at Athens with Char- <lb/>
            madas ; from which book I conceived the highest admiration <lb/>
            of Plato, as he seemed to me to prove himself an eminent <lb/>
            orator, even in ridiculing orators. A controversy indeed <lb/>
            on the word ORATOR has long disturbed the minute Grecians, <lb/>
            who are fonder of argument than of truth. For if any one <lb/>
            pronounces him to be an orator who can speak fluently only <lb/>
            on law in general, or on judicial questions, or before the <lb/>
            people, or in the senate, he must yet necessarily grant and <lb/>
            allow him a variety of talents; for he cannot treat even of <lb/>
            these matters with sufficient skill and accuracy without great <lb/>
            attention to all public affairs, nor without a knowledge of <lb/>
            laws, customs, and equity, nor without understanding the <lb/>
            nature and manners of mankind; and to him who knows these <lb/>
            things, without which no one can maintain even the most <lb/>
            minute points in judicial pleadings, how much is wanting <lb/>
            of the knowledge even of the most important affairs? But if <lb/>
            you allow nothing to belong to the orator but to speak aptly, <lb/>
            ornately, and copiously, how can he even attain these qualities <lb/>
            without that knowledge which you do not allow him ? for <lb/>
            there can be no true merit in speaking, unless what is said is <note type="footnote">1 Crassus was quæstor in Asia, A.U.C. 645, and, on his return, at the <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. I </note> <lb/>
            thoroughly understood by him who says it. If, therefore, the <lb/>
            natural philosopher Democritus spoke with elegance, as he is <lb/>
            reported to have spoken, and as it appears to me that he did <lb/>
            speak, the matter on which he spoke belonged to the philosopher, <lb/>
            but the graceful array of words is to be ascribed to the orator. <lb/>
            And if Plato spoke divinely upon subjects most remote from <lb/>
            civil controversies, as I grant that he did; if also Aristotle, <lb/>
            and Theophrastus, and Carneades, were eloquent, and spoke <lb/>
            with sweetness and grace on those matters which they dis- <lb/>
            cussed; let the subjects on which they spoke belong to other <lb/>
            studies, but their speech itself, surely, is the peculiar offspring <lb/>
            of that art of which we are now discoursing and inquiring. <lb/>
            For we see that some have reasoned on the same subjects <lb/>
            jejunely and drily, as Chrysippus, whom they celebrate as the <lb/>
            acutest of philosophers; nor is he on this account to be <lb/>
            thought to have been deficient in philosophy, because he did <lb/>
            not gain the talent of speaking from an art which is foreign <lb/>
            to philosophy.</p>
          <p>XII. " Where then lies the difference ? Or by what <lb/>
            term will you discriminate the fertility and copiousness of <lb/>
            speech in those whom I have named, from the barrenness <lb/>
            of those who use not this variety and elegance of phrase ? <lb/>
            One thing there will certainly be, which those who speak well <lb/>
            will exhibit as their own; a graceful and elegant style, dis- <lb/>
            tinguished by a peculiar artifice and polish. But this kind <lb/>
            of diction, if there be not matter beneath it clear and <lb/>
            intelligible to the speaker, must either amount to nothing, or <lb/>
            be received with ridicule by all who hear it. For what savours <lb/>
            so much of madness, as the empty sound of words, even the <lb/>
            choicest and most elegant, when there is no sense or knowledge <lb/>
            contained in them 1 Whatever be the subject of a speech, <lb/>
            therefore, in whatever art or branch of science, the orator, if <lb/>
            he has made himself master of it, as of his client's cause, <lb/>
            will speak on it better and more elegantly than even the <lb/>
            very originator and author of it can.1 If indeed any <lb/>
            one shall say that there are certain trains of thought and <lb/>
            reasoning properly belonging to orators, and a knowledge of <lb/>
            certain things circumscribed within the limits of the forum, <lb/>
            I will confess that our common speech is employed about <lb/>
            these matters chiefly ; but yet there are many things, in <note type="footnote"> 1 See Quintilian, ii. 21. </note> <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            these very topics, which those masters of rhetoric, as they are <lb/>
            called, neither teach nor understand. For who is ignorant <lb/>
            that the highest power of an orator consists in exciting trio <lb/>
            minds of men to anger, or to hatred, or to grief, or in recall- <lb/>
            ing them from these more violent emotions to gentleness and <lb/>
            compassion ? which power will never be able to effect its ob- <lb/>
            ject by eloquence, unless in him who has obtained a thorough <lb/>
            insight into the nature of mankind, and all the passions of <lb/>
            humanity, and those causes by which our minds are either <lb/>
            impelled or restrained. But all these are thought to belong <lb/>
            to the philosophers, nor will the orator, at least with my con- <lb/>
            sent, ever deny that such is the case; but when he has <lb/>
            conceded to them the knowledge of things, since they are <lb/>
            willing to exhaust their labours on that alone, he will assume <lb/>
            to himself the treatment of oratory, which without that <lb/>
            knowledge is nothing. For the proper concern of an orator, <lb/>
            as I have already often said, is language of power and <lb/>
            elegance accommodated to the feelings and understandings of <lb/>
            mankind.</p>
          <p>XIII. “ On these matters I confess that Aristotle and Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus have written.1 But consider, Scævola, whether this <lb/>
            is not wholly in my favour. For I do not borrow from them <lb/>
            what the orator possesses in common with them ; but they <lb/>
            allow that what they say on these subjects belongs to oratory. <lb/>
            Their other treatises, accordingly, they distinguish by the <lb/>
            name of the science on which each is written ; their treatises <lb/>
            on oratory they entitle and designate as books of rhetoric. <lb/>
            For when, in their discussions, (as often happens,) such topics <lb/>
            present themselves as require them to speak of the immortal <lb/>
            gods, of piety, of concord, of friendship, of the common <lb/>
            rights of their fellow-citizens, or those of all mankind, of the <lb/>
            law of nations, of equity, of temperance, of greatness of <lb/>
            mind, of every kind of virtue, all the academies and schools <lb/>
            of philosophy, I imagine, will cry out that all these subjects <lb/>
            are their property, and that no particle of them belongs to <lb/>
            the orator. But when I have given them liberty to reason <lb/>
            on all these subjects in corners to amuse their leisure, I shall <lb/>

            Servius Galba, and your father-in-law Lælius, who are al- <lb/>

            often in those causes which all acknowledge properly to <lb/>
            belong to orators, there is something to be drawn forth and <lb/>
            adopted, not from the routine of the Forum, which is the <lb/>
            only knowledge that you grant to the orator, but from some <lb/>
            of the more obscure sciences. I ask whether a speech can be <lb/>
            made for or against a general, without an acquaintance with <lb/>
            military affairs, or often without a knowledge of certain <lb/>
            inland and maritime countries ? whether a speech can be <lb/>
            made to the people about passing or rejecting laws, or in the <lb/>
            senate on any kind of public transactions, without the greatest <lb/>
            knowledge and judgment in political matters? whether a <lb/>
            speech can be adapted to excite or calm the thoughts and <note type="footnote"> 1 De jure civili generatim in ordines aetatesque descripto. Instead cf <lb/>

            which Ellendt condemns, and retains civium; observing that Cicero <lb/>
            means jura civium publica singulis ordinibus et ætatibus assignata. " By <lb/>

            passions (which alone is a great business of the orator,, <lb/>
            without a most diligent examination of all those doctrines <lb/>
            which are set forth on the nature and manners of men by the <lb/>
            philosophers? I do not know whether I may not be less <lb/>
            successful in maintaining what I am going to say; but I <lb/>
            shall not hesitate to speak that which I think. Physics, and <lb/>
            mathematics, and those other things which you just now <lb/>
            decided to belong to other sciences, belong to the peculiar <lb/>
            knowledge of those who profess them; but if any one would <lb/>
            illustrate those arts by eloquence, he must have recourse to <lb/>
            the power of oratory. Nor, if, as is said, Philo,l the famous <lb/>
            architect, who built an arsenal for the Athenians, gave that <lb/>
            people an eloquent account of his work, is it to be imagined <lb/>
            that his eloquence proceeded from the art of the architect, <lb/>
            but from that of the orator. Or, if our friend Marcus Antonius <lb/>
            had had to speak for Hermodorus 2 on the subject of dock- <lb/>
            building, he would have spoken, when he had learned the <lb/>
            case from Hermodorus, with elegance and copiousness, drawn <lb/>
            from an art quite unconnected with dock-building. And <lb/>
            Asclepiades,3 whom we knew as a physician and a friend, did <lb/>
            not, when he excelled others of his profession in eloquence, <lb/>
            employ, in his graceful elocution, the art of physic, but that <lb/>
            of oratory. What Socrates used to say, that all men are <lb/>
            sufficiently eloquent in that which they understand, is very <lb/>
            plausible, but not true. It would have been nearer truth to <lb/>
            say, that no man can be eloquent on a subject that he does <lb/>
            not understand; and that, if he understands a subject ever <lb/>
            so well, but is ignorant how to form and polish his speech, <lb/>
            he cannot express himself eloquently even about what he does <lb/>
            understand.</p>

            action. But if the phrase which I have used, ‘on whatever <lb/>
            subject,' is thought by any one too comprehensive, let him <lb/>
            retrench and curtail as much of it as he pleases; but this <lb/>
            I will maintain, that though the orator be ignorant of what <lb/>
            belongs to other arts and pursuits, and understands only <lb/>
            what concerns the discussions and practice of the Forum, yet <lb/>
            if he has to speak on those arts, he will, when he has learned <lb/>
            what pertains to any of them from persons who understand <lb/>
            them, discourse upon them much better than the very persons <lb/>
            of whom those arts form the peculiar province. Thus, if our <lb/>
            friend Sulpicius have to speak on military affairs, he will <lb/>
            inquire about them of my kinsman Caius Marius,1 and when he <lb/>
            has received information, will speak upon them in such a <lb/>
            manner, that he shall seem to Marius to understand them <lb/>
            better than himself. Or if he has to speak on the civil law, <lb/>
            he will consult with you, and will excel you, though eminently <lb/>
            wise and learned in it, in speaking on those very points which <lb/>
            he shall have learned from yourself. Or if any subject pre- <lb/>
            sents itself, requiring him to speak on the nature and vices of <lb/>
            men, on desire, on moderation, on continence, on grief, on <lb/>
            death, perhaps, if he thinks proper, (though the orator ought <lb/>
            to have a knowledge of these things,) he will consult with <lb/>
            Sextus Pompeius, 2 a man learned in philosophy. But this he <lb/>
            will certainly accomplish, that, of whatever matter he gains <lb/>
            a knowledge, or from whomsoever, he will speak upon it <lb/>
            much more elegantly than the very person from whom he <lb/>
            gained the knowledge. But, since philosophy is distinguished <lb/>
            into three parts, inquiries into the obscurities of physics, the <lb/>
            subtilties of logic, and the knowledge of life and manners, let <lb/>
            us, if Sulpicius will listen to me, leave the two former, and <lb/>
            consult our ease; but unless we have a knowledge of the <lb/>

            The part of philosophy, therefore, regarding life and manners, <lb/>

            country, has written well on rural affairs, with the aid of <lb/>
            poetical talent, and not from understanding husbandry, what <lb/>
            reason is there why an orator should not speak most elo- <lb/>
            quently on those matters of which he shall have gained <lb/>
            a knowledge for a certain purpose and occasion? For the <lb/>
            poet is nearly allied to the orator; being somewhat more <lb/>
            restricted in numbers, but less restrained in the choice of <lb/>
            words, yet in many kinds of embellishment his rival and <lb/>
            almost equal; in one respect, assuredly, nearly the same, <lb/>
            that he circumscribes or bounds his jurisdiction by no limits, <lb/>

            made good what you asserted against me, so as to grant me <lb/>

            wrest from me those very things again I know not how, and <lb/>
            to transfer them to the orator as his property.1 When <lb/>
            I went as prætor to Rhodes, and communicated to Apol- <lb/>

            but your remarks were of such a kind as not to express con- <lb/>
            tempt for any arts or sciences, but to admit that they are all <lb/>
            attendants and handmaids of the orator; and if ever any one <lb/>
            should comprehend them all, and the same person should add <lb/>

            be such a one, or indeed has ever been, or can possibly be, <lb/>
            you alone would be the person; who, not only in my judg- <lb/>
            ment, but in that of all men, have hardly left to other <lb/>

            ther you do not attribute to him more than possibility and <lb/>
            truth itself will allow." Here Crassus rejoined: " Remember <lb/>
            that I have not been speaking of my own talents, but of <lb/>
            those of the true orator. For what have I either learned or <lb/>
            had a possibility of knowing, who entered upon pleading <lb/>
            before I had any instruction; whom the pressure of business <lb/>
            overtasked amidst the occupations of the forum, of canvassing, <lb/>
            of public affairs, and the management of the causes of friends, <lb/>
            before I could form any true notion of the importance of <lb/>
            such great employments ? But if there seem to you to be so <lb/>
            much in me, to whom, though capacity, as you think, may <lb/>
            not greatly have been wanting, yet to whom learning, leisure, <lb/>
            and that keen application to study which is so necessary, <lb/>
            have certainly been wanting, what do you think would be the <lb/>
            case if those acquirements, which I have not gained, should <lb/>
            be united to some greater genius than mine ? How able, how <lb/>
            great an orator, do you think, would he prove?”</p>
          <p>XVIII. Antonius then observed : " You prove to me, <lb/>
            Crassus, what you advance; nor do I doubt that he will <lb/>
            have a far greater fund of eloquence who shall have learned <lb/>
            the reason and nature of everything and of all sciences. But, <lb/>
            in the first place, this is difficult to be achieved, especially <lb/>
            in such a life as ours and such occupations; and next, it <lb/>
            is to be feared that we may, by such studies, be drawn away <lb/>
            from our exercise and practice of speaking before the people <lb/>
            and in the forum. The eloquence of those men whom you <lb/>
            mentioned a little before, seems to me to be of a quite dif- <lb/>
            ferent sort, though they speak with grace and dignity, as well <lb/>
            on the nature of things as on human life. Theirs is a neat <lb/>
            and florid kind of language, but more adapted for parade <lb/>
            and exercise in the schools, than for these tumults of the <lb/>

            chanics with glib and well-practised tongues, but that no <lb/>
            one could be an orator but a man of true wisdom; and that <lb/>
            eloquence itself, as it consisted in the art of speaking well, <lb/>
            was a kind of virtue,1 and that he who possessed one virtue <lb/>
            possessed all, and that virtues were in themselves equal and <lb/>
            alike; and thus he who was eloquent possessed all virtues, <lb/>
            and was a man of true wisdom. But their phraseology was in- <lb/>
            tricate and dry, and quite unsuited to my taste. Charmadas <lb/>
            indeed spoke much more diffusely on those topics; not that <lb/>
            he delivered his own opinion (for it is the hereditary custom <lb/>
            of every one in the Academy to take the part of opponents <lb/>
            to all in their disputations), but what he chiefly signified was, <lb/>
            that those who were called rhetoricians, and laid down rules <lb/>
            for the art of speaking, understood nothing; and that no ' <lb/>
            man could attain any command of eloquence who had not <lb/>
            mastered the doctrines of the philosophers.</p>
          <p>XIX. " Certain men of eloquence at Athens, versed in <lb/>
            public affairs and judicial pleadings, disputed on the other <lb/>
            side; among whom was Menedemus, lately my guest at Rome; <lb/>
            but when he had observed that there is a sort of wisdom <lb/>
            which is employed in inquiring into the methods of settling <lb/>
            and managing governments, he, though a ready speaker, was <lb/>
            promptly attacked by the other, a man of abundant learning, <lb/>
            and of an almost incredible variety and copiousness of argu- <lb/>
            ment; who maintained that every portion of such wisdom <lb/>
            must be derived from philosophy, and that whatever was <lb/>
            established in a state concerning the immortal gods, the dis- <lb/>
            cipline of youth, justice, patience, temperance, moderation in <lb/>
            everything, and other matters, without which states would <note type="footnote"> 1 The Stoics called eloquence rae cf their virtues See Q uintilian, <lb/>

            either not subsist at all, or be corrupt in morals, was nowhere <lb/>
            to be found in the petty treatises of the rhetoricians. For it <lb/>
            those teachers of rhetoric included in their art such a mul- <lb/>
            titude of the most important subjects, why, he asked, were <lb/>
            their books crammed with rules about proems and perorations, <lb/>
            and such trifles (for so he called them), while about the <lb/>
            modelling of states, the composition of laws, about equity, <lb/>
            justice, integrity, about mastering the appetites, and forming <lb/>
            the morals of mankind, not one single syllable was to be <lb/>
            found in their pages ? Their precepts he ridiculed in such <lb/>
            a manner, as to show that the teachers were not only desti- <lb/>
            tute of the knowledge which they arrogated to themselves, <lb/>
            but that they did not even know the proper art and method <lb/>
            of speaking; for he thought that the principal business of an <lb/>
            orator was, that he might appear to those to whom he spoke <lb/>
            to be such as he would wish to appear (that this was to be <lb/>
            attained by a life of good reputation, on which those teachers <lb/>
            of rhetoric had laid down nothing in their precepts); and <lb/>
            that the minds of the audience should be affected in such <lb/>
            a manner as the orator would have them to be affected, an <lb/>
            object, also, which could by no means be attained, unless the <lb/>
            speaker uuderstood by what methods, by what arguments, <lb/>
            and by what sort of language the minds of men are moved <lb/>
            in any particular direction; but that these matters were <lb/>
            involved and concealed in the profoundest doctrines of phi- <lb/>
            losophy, which these rhetoricians had not touched even with <lb/>
            the extremity of their lips. These assertions Menedemus <lb/>
            endeavoured to refute, but rather by authorities than by <lb/>
            arguments; for, repeating from memory many noble passage? <lb/>
            from the orations of Demosthenes, he showed that that <lb/>
            orator, while he swayed the minds of judges or of the people <lb/>
            by his eloquence, was not ignorant by what means he attained <lb/>
            his end, which Charmadas denied that any one could know <lb/>
            without philosophy.</p>
          <p>XX. " To this Charmadas replied, that he did not deny that <lb/>
            Demosthenes was possessed of consummate ability and the <lb/>
            utmost energy of eloquence; but whether he had these <lb/>
            powers from natural genius, or because he was, as was <lb/>
            acknowledged, a diligent hearer of Plato, it was not what <lb/>
            Demosthenes could do, but what the rhetoricians taught, <lb/>
            that was the subject of inquiry. Sometimes too he was <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            carried so far by the drift of his discourse, as to maintain <lb/>
            that there was no art at all in speaking; and having shown <lb/>
            by various arguments that we are so formed by nature as to <lb/>
            be able to flatter, and to insinuate ourselves, as suppliants, <lb/>
            into the favour of those from whom we wish to obtain any- <lb/>
            thing, as well as to terrify our enemies by menaces, to relate <lb/>
            matters of fact, to confirm what we assert, to refute what is <lb/>
            said against us, and, finally, to use entreaty or lamentation; <lb/>
            particulars in which the whole faculties of the orator are <lb/>
            employed; and that practice and exercise sharpened the <lb/>
            understanding, and produced fluency of speech, he rested his <lb/>
            cause, in conclusion, on a multitude of examples that he <lb/>
            adduced; for first, as if stating an indisputable fact,1 he <lb/>
            affirmed that no writer on the art of rhetoric was ever even <lb/>
            moderately eloquent, going back as far as I know not what <lb/>
            Corax and Tisias,2 who, he said, appeared to be the in- <lb/>
            ventors and first authors of rhetorical science; and then <lb/>
            named a vast number of the most eloquent men who had <lb/>
            neither learned, nor cared to understand the rules of art, <lb/>
            and amongst whom, (whether in jest, or because he thought, <lb/>
            or had heard something to that effect,) he instanced me as <lb/>
            one who had received none of their instructions, and yet, as <lb/>
            he said, had some abilities as a speaker; of which two <lb/>
            observations I readily granted the truth of one, that I had <lb/>
            never been instructed, but thought that in the other he was <lb/>
            either joking with me, or was under some mistake. But he <lb/>
            denied there was any art, except such as lay in things that <lb/>
            were known and thoroughly understood, things tending to <lb/>
            the same object, and never misleading; but that everything <lb/>
            treated by the orators was doubtful and uncertain; as it was <lb/>
            uttered by those who did not fully understand it, and was <lb/>
            heard by them to whom knowledge was not meant to be <lb/>
            communicated, but merely false, or at least obscure notions, <note type="footnote"> 1 Quasi deditd opera. As if Charmadas himself had collected all the <lb/>

            what he now asserted; or, as if the writers on the art of rhetoric them- <lb/>
            selves had purposely abstained from attempting to be eloquent. But <lb/>
            Charmadas was very much in the wrong; for Gorgias, Isocratcs, Prota- <lb/>

            intended to live in their minds only for a short time. In <lb/>
            short, he seemed bent on convincing me that there was no <lb/>
            art of speaking, and that no one could speak skilfully, or so <lb/>
            as fully to illustrate a subject, but one who had attained that <lb/>
            knowledge which is delivered by the most learned of the <lb/>
            philosophers. On which occasions Charmadas used to say., <lb/>
            with a passionate admiration of your genius, Crassus, that <lb/>
            I appeared to him very easy in listening, and you most <lb/>
            pertinacious in disputation.</p>
          <p>XXI. " Then it was that I, swayed by this opinion, re- <lb/>
            marked in a little treatise1 which got abroad, and into <lb/>
            people's hands, without my knowledge and against my will, <lb/>
            that I had known many good speakers, but never yet any one <lb/>
            that was truly eloquent; for I accounted him a good speaker, <lb/>
            who could express his thoughts with accuracy and perspi- <lb/>
            cuity, according to the ordinary judgment of mankind, before <lb/>
            an audience of moderate capacity; but I considered him alone <lb/>
            eloquent, who could in a more admirable and noble manner <lb/>
            amplify and adorn whatever subjects he chose, and who em- <lb/>
            braced in thought and memory all the principles of everything <lb/>
            relating to oratory. This, though it may be difficult to us, <lb/>
            who, before we begin to speak in public, are overwhelmed by <lb/>
            canvassings for office and by the business of the forum, is <lb/>
            yet within the range of possibility and the powers of nature. <lb/>
            For I, as far as I can divine by conjecture, and as far as I can <lb/>
            estimate the abilities of our countrymen, do not despair that <lb/>
            there may arise at some time or other a person, who, when, <lb/>
            with a keener devotion to study than we feel, or have ever <lb/>
            felt, with more leisure, with better and more mature talent <lb/>
            for learning, and with superior labour and industry, he shall <lb/>
            have given himself up to hearing, reading, and writing, may <lb/>
            become such an orator as we desire to see,-one who may <lb/>
            justly be called not only a good speaker, but truly eloquent; <lb/>
            and such a character, in my opinion, is our friend Crassus, or <lb/>
            some one, if such ever was, of equal genius, who, having <lb/>
            heard, read, and written more than Crassus, shall be able to <lb/>
            make some little addition to it."</p>
          <p>Here Sulpicius observed: “ That has happened by acci- <lb/>
            dent, Crassus, which neither Cotta nor I expected, but which <lb/>
            we both earnestly desired,—I mean, that you should in- <note type="footnote"> 1 See 3. 47 -Cicero speaks of it as exilis, poor and dry, Brut. 44; Orat. 5. </note> <pb n="168"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note><lb/>
            sensibly glide into a discourse of this kind. For, as we were <lb/>
            coming hither, we thought it would be a pleasure, if, while <lb/>
            you were talking on other matters, we might gather some- <lb/>
            thing worthy to be remembered from your conversation; but <lb/>
            that you should go into a deep and full discussion on this <lb/>
            very study, or art, or faculty, and penetrate into the heart of <lb/>
            it, was what we could scarcely venture to hope. For I, who, <lb/>
            from my early youth, have felt a strong affection for you <lb/>
            both, and even a love for Crassus, having never left his com- <lb/>
            pany, could never yet elicit a word from him on the method <lb/>
            and art of speaking, though I not only solicited him myself, <lb/>
            but endeavoured to move him by the agency of Drusus; on <lb/>
            which subject you, Antonius, (I speak but the truth,) never <lb/>
            failed to answer my requests and interrogatories, and have <lb/>
            very often told me what you used to notice in speaking. And <lb/>
            since each of you has opened a way to these subjects of our <lb/>
            research, and since Crassus was the first to commence this <lb/>
            discourse, do us the favour to acquaint us fully and exactly <lb/>
            what you think about the various kinds of eloquence. If we, <lb/>
            obtain this indulgence from you, I shall feel the greatest <lb/>
            obligation to this school of yours, Crassus, and to your Tus- <lb/>
            culan villa, and shall prefer your suburban place of study to <lb/>
            the famous Academy and Lyceum."</p>
          <p>XXII. " Nay rather, Sulpicius," rejoined Crassus, " let us <lb/>
            ask Antonius, who is both capable of doing what you desire, <lb/>
            and, as I hear you say, has been accustomed to do so. As to <lb/>
            myself, I acknowledge that I have ever avoided all such kind <lb/>
            of discourse, and have often declined to comply with your <lb/>
            requests and solicitations, as you just now observed. This <lb/>
            I did, not from pride or want of politeness, nor because I <lb/>
            was unwilling to aid your just and commendable aspirations, <lb/>
            especially as I knew you to be eminently and above others <lb/>
            formed and qualified by nature to become a speaker, but, in <lb/>
            truth, from being unaccustomed to such kind of discussions, <lb/>
            and from being ignorant of those principles which are laid <lb/>
            down as institutes of the art." " Then," said Cotta, " since <lb/>
            we have got over what we thought the greatest difficulty, <lb/>
            to induce you, Crassus, to speak at all upon these subjects, <lb/>
            for the rest, it will be our own fault if we let you go before <lb/>
            you have explained all that we have to ask." " I believe <lb/>
            I must answer," says Crassus, " as is usually written in the <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            formulæ for entering on inheritances,1 concerning such points <lb/>
            AS I KNOW AND SHALL BE ABLE." " And which of us," rejoined <lb/>
            Cotta, “ can be so presuming as to desire to know or to be <lb/>
            able to do anything that you do not know or cannot do?” <lb/>
            " Well, then," returned Crassus, " on condition that I may <lb/>
            say that I cannot do what I cannot do, and that I may own <lb/>
            that I do not know what I do not know, you may put ques- <lb/>
            tions to me at your pleasure." " We shall, then, first ask of <lb/>
            you," said Suipicius, " what you think of what Antonius has <lb/>
            advanced; whether you think that there is any art in speak- <lb/>
            ing?” “ What !” exclaimed Crassus, "do you put a trifling <lb/>
            question to me, as to some idle and talkative, though perhaps <lb/>
            studious and learned Greek, on which I may speak accord- <lb/>
            ing to my humour? When do you imagine that I have ever <lb/>
            regarded or thought upon such matters, or have not always <lb/>
            rather ridiculed the impudence of those men who, seated <lb/>
            in the schools, would demand if any one, in a numerous <lb/>
            assembly of persons, wished to ask any question, and desire <lb/>
            him to speak? This Gorgias the Leontine is said to have <lb/>
            first done, who was thought to undertake and promise some- <lb/>
            thing vast, in pronouncing himself prepared to speak on all <lb/>
            subjects on which any one should be inclined to hear him. <lb/>
            But afterwards those men made it a common practice, and <lb/>
            continue it to this day; so that there is no topic of such <lb/>
            importance, or so unexpected, or so new, on which they do <lb/>
            not profess that they will say all that can be said. But if I <lb/>
            had thought that you, Cotta, or you, Sulpicius, were desirous <lb/>
            to hear such matters, I would have brought hither some <lb/>
            Greek to amuse you with their manner of disputation; for <lb/>
            there is with M. Piso,2 (a youth already addicted to this intel- <lb/>
            lectual exercise, and one of superior talents, and of great affec- <lb/>
            tion for me,) the peripatetic Staseas, a man with whom I am <lb/>
            well acquainted, and who, as I perceive is agreed amongst the <lb/>
            learned, is of the first eminence in his profession." <note type="footnote"> 1 Cretionibus. An heir was allowed a certain time to determine, <lb/>

          <p>XXIII. "Why do you speak to me,” says Scævola, "of <lb/>
            this Staseas, this peripatetic? You must comply with the <lb/>
            wishes of these young gentlemen, Crassus, who do not want <lb/>
            the common, profitless talk of any Greek, or any empty <lb/>
            declamation of the schools, but desire to know the opinions <lb/>
            of a man in whose footsteps they long to tread,-one who is <lb/>
            the wisest and most eloquent of all men, who is not dis- <lb/>
            tinguished by petty books of precepts, but is the first, both <lb/>
            in judgment and oratory, in causes of the greatest conse- <lb/>
            quence, and in this seat of empire and glory. For my part, <lb/>
            as I always thought you a god in eloquence, so I have never <lb/>
            attributed to you greater praises for oratory than for polite- <lb/>
            ness; which you ought to show on this occasion especially, <lb/>
            and not to decline a discussion on which two young men of <lb/>
            such excellent ability invite you to enter." “I am certainly," <lb/>
            replied Crassus, " desirous to oblige them, nor shall I think it <lb/>
            any trouble to speak briefly, as is my manner, what I think <lb/>
            upon any point of the subject. And to their first question, <lb/>
            (because I do not think it right for me to neglect your admo- <lb/>
            nition, Scævola,) I answer, that I think there is either no art of <lb/>
            speaking at all, or but very little; but that all the disputation <lb/>
            about it amongst the learned arises from a difference of opinion <lb/>
            about the word. For if art is to be defined according to what <lb/>
            Antonius just now asserted,1 as lying in things thoroughly <lb/>
            understood and fully known, such as are abstracted from the <lb/>
            caprice of opinion and comprehended in the limits of science, <lb/>
            there seems to me to be no art at all in oratory; since all <lb/>
            the species of our forensic diction are various, and suited to <lb/>
            the common understanding of the people. Yet if those things <lb/>
            which have been observed in the practice and method of <lb/>
            speaking, have been noted and chronicled by ingenious and <lb/>
            skilful men, have been set forth in words, illustrated in their <lb/>
            several kinds, and distributed into parts, (as I think may <lb/>
            possibly be done,) I do not understand why speaking may not <lb/>
            be deemed an art, if not according to the exact definition of <lb/>
            Antonius, at least according to common opinion. But whether <lb/>
            it be an art, or merely the resemblance of an art, it is not, <lb/>
            indeed, to be neglected; yet we must understand that there <lb/>
            are other things of more consequence for the attainment of <lb/>
            eloquence.” <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Cap. xx. </note> <pb n="171"/>

          <p><note type="margin">C.XXV.] </note></p>
          <p>XXIV. Antonius then observed, that he was very strongly <lb/>
            of opinion with Crassus; for he neither adopted such a defini- <lb/>
            tion of art as those preferred who attributed all the powers of <lb/>
            eloquence to art, nor did he repudiate it entirely, as most of <lb/>
            the philosophers had done. " But I imagine, Crassus," added <lb/>
            he, " that you will gratify these two young men, if you will <lb/>
            specify those particulars which you think may be more con- <lb/>
            ducive to oratory than art itself." " I will indeed mention <lb/>
            them," said he, " since I have engaged to do so, but must beg <lb/>
            you not to publish my trifling remarks; though I will keep <lb/>
            myself under such restraint as not to seem to speak like <lb/>
            a master, or artist, but like one of the number of private <lb/>
            citizens, moderately versed in the practice of the forum, and <lb/>
            not altogether ignorant; not to have offered anything from <lb/>
            myself, but to have accidentally fallen in with the course of <lb/>
            your conversation. Indeed, when I was a candidate for office, <lb/>
            I used, at the time of canvassing, to send away Scsevola from <lb/>
            me, telling him I wanted to be foolish, that is, to solicit with <lb/>
            flattery, a thing that cannot be done to any purpose unless it <lb/>
            be done foolishly; and that he was the only man in the world <lb/>
            in whose presence I should least like to play the fool; and <lb/>
            yet fortune has appointed him to be a witness and spectator <lb/>
            of my folly.1 For what is more foolish than to speak about <lb/>
            speaking, when speaking itself is never otherwise than foolish, <lb/>
            except it is absolutely necessary ?” “ Proceed, however, Cras- <lb/>
            sus," said Scævola; "for I will take uponmyself the blame <lb/>
            which you fear."</p>
          <p>XXV. “I am, then, of opinion," said Crassus, " that nature <lb/>
            and genius in the first place contribute most aid to speaking; <lb/>
            and that to those writers on the art, to whom Antonius just <lb/>
            now alluded, it was not skill and method in speaking, but <lb/>
            natural talent that was wanting; for there ought to be cer- <lb/>
            tain lively powers in the mind 2 and understanding, which <lb/>
            may be acute to invent, fertile to explain and adorn, and <lb/>
            strong and retentive to remember; and if any one imagines <lb/>
            that these powers may be acquired by art, (which is false, for <note type="footnote"> 1 See Val. Max. iT. 5. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Animi atque ingenii celeres quidam motus. This sense of motus, as <lb/>
            Ellendt observes, is borrowed from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις</foreign>, by which the <lb/>
            philosophers intimated an active power, as, without motion, all things <lb/>
            would remain unchanged, and nothing be generated. See Matth. ad <lb/>

            it is very well if they can be animated and excited by art; <lb/>
            but they certainly cannot by art be ingrafted or instilled, <lb/>
            since they are all the gifts of nature,) what will he say of <lb/>
            those qualities which are certainly born with the man him- <lb/>
            self, volubility of tongue, tone of voice, strength of lungs, <lb/>
            and a peculiar conformation and aspect of the whole coun- <lb/>
            tenance and body ? I do not say, that art cannot improve in <lb/>
            these particulars, (for am not ignorant that what is good <lb/>
            may be made better by education, and what is not very <lb/>
            good may be in some degree polished and amended;) but <lb/>
            there are some persons so hesitating in their speech, so inhar- <lb/>
            monious in their tone of voice, or so unwieldy and rude <lb/>
            in the air and movements of their bodies, that, whatever <lb/>
            power they possess either from genius or art, they can never <lb/>
            be reckoned in the number of accomplished speakers; while <lb/>
            there are others so happily qualified in these respects, so <lb/>
            eminently adorned with the gifts of nature, that they seem <lb/>
            not to have been born like other men, but moulded by some <lb/>
            divinity. It is, indeed, a great task and enterprise for a <lb/>
            person to undertake and profess, that while every one else is <lb/>
            silent, he alone must be heard on the most important sub- <lb/>
            jects, and in a large assembly of men; for there is scarcely <lb/>
            any one present who is not sharper and quicker to discover <lb/>
            defects in the speaker than merits; and thus whatever offends <lb/>
            the hearer effaces the recollection of what is worthy of praise. <lb/>
            I do not make these observations for the purpose of altogether <lb/>
            deterring young men from the study of oratory, even if they <lb/>
            be deficient in some natural endowments. For who does not <lb/>
            perceive that to C. Cælius, my contemporary, a new man, the <lb/>
            mere mediocrity in speaking, which he was enabled to attain, <lb/>
            was a great honour ? Who does not know that Q. Varius, <lb/>
            your equal in age, a clumsy, uncouth man, has obtained <lb/>
            his great popularity by the cultivation of such faculties as <lb/>
            he has ?</p>
          <p>XXVI. " But as our inquiry regards the COMPLETE ORATOR, <lb/>
            we must imagine, in our discussion, an orator from whom <lb/>
            every kind of fault is abstracted, and who is adorned with <lb/>
            every kind of merit. For if the multitude of suits, if the <lb/>
            variety of causes, if the rabble and barbarism of the forum, <lb/>
            Afford room for even the most wretched speakers, we must <lb/>
            not, for that reason, take our eyes from the object of out <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            inquiry. In those arts, in which it is not indispensable <lb/>
            usefulness that is sought, but liberal amusement for the <lb/>
            mind, how nicely, how almost fastidiously, do we judge! For <lb/>
            there are no suits or controversies which can force men, <lb/>
            though they may tolerate indifferent orators in the forum, <lb/>
            to endure also bad actors upon the stage. The orator there- <lb/>
            fore must take the most studious precaution not merely to <lb/>
            satisfy those whom he necessarily must satisfy, but to seem <lb/>
            worthy of admiration to those who are at liberty to judge <lb/>
            disinterestedly. If you would know what I myself think, <lb/>
            I will express to you, my intimate friends, what I have <lb/>
            hitherto never mentioned, and thought that I never should <lb/>
            mention. To me, those who speak best, and speak with the <lb/>
            utmost ease and grace, appear, if they do not commence <lb/>
            their speeches with some timidity, and show some confusion <lb/>
            in the exordium, to have almost lost the sense of shame, <lb/>
            though it is impossible that such should not be the case;1 <lb/>
            for the better qualified a man is to speak, the more he fears <lb/>
            the difficulties of speaking, the uncertain success of a speech, <lb/>
            and the expectation of the audience. But he who can pro- <lb/>
            duce and deliver nothing worthy of his subject, nothing <lb/>
            worthy of the name of an orator, nothing worthy the attention <lb/>
            of his audience, seems to me, though he be ever so confused- <lb/>
            while he is speaking, to be downright shameless; for we ought <lb/>
            to avoid a character for shamelessness, not by testifying <lb/>
            shame, but by not doing that which does not become us. <lb/>
            But the speaker who has no shame (as I see to be the case <lb/>
            with many) I regard as deserving, not only of rebuke, but of <lb/>
            personal castigation. Indeed, what I often observe in you I <lb/>
            rery frequently experience in myself, that I turn pale in the <lb/>
            outset of my speech, and feel a tremor through my whole <lb/>
            thoughts, as it were, and limbs. When I was a young man, <lb/>
            I was on one occasion so timid in commencing an accusation, <lb/>
            that I owed to Q. Maximus2 the greatest of obligations for <lb/>
            immediately dismissing the assembly, as soon as he saw me <lb/>
            absolutely disheartened and incapacitated through fear." <lb/>
            Here they all signified assent, looked significantly at one <note type="footnote">1 Tametsi id accidere non potato " Quamvis id fieri non possit, ut<unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            another, and began, to talk together ; for there was a won- <lb/>
            derful modesty in Crassus, which however was not only no <lb/>
            disadvantage to his oratory, but even an assistance to it, by <lb/>
            giving it the recommendation of probity,</p>
          <p>XXVII. Antonius soon after said, " I have often observed, <lb/>
            as you mention, Crassus, that both you and other most <lb/>
            accomplished orators, although in my opinion none was ever <lb/>
            equal to you, have felt some agitation in entering upon their <lb/>
            speeches. When I inquired into the reason of this, and <lb/>
            considered why a speaker, the more ability he possessed, felt <lb/>
            the greater fear in speaking, I found that there were two <lb/>
            causes of such timidity: one, that those whom experience <lb/>
            and nature had formed for speaking, well knew that the <lb/>
            event of a speech did not always satisfy expectation <lb/>
            even in the greatest orators; and thus, as often as they <lb/>
            spoke, they feared, not without reason, that what sometimes <lb/>
            happened might happen then; the other (of which I am <lb/>
            often in the habit of complaining) is, that men, tried and <lb/>
            approved in other arts, if they ever do anything with. less <lb/>
            success than usual, are thought either to have wanted in- <lb/>
            clination for it, or to have failed in performing what they <lb/>
            knew how to perform from ill health. ‘ Roscius,' they say, <lb/>
            ‘would not act to-day,' or, ‘ he was indisposed.' But if any <lb/>
            deficiency is seen in the orator, it is thought to proceed from <lb/>
            want of sense; and want of sense admits of no excuse, because <lb/>
            nobody is supposed to have wanted sense because he ‘was in- <lb/>
            disposed,' or because ‘such was his inclination.' Thus we <lb/>
            undergo a severer judgment in oratory, and judgment is <lb/>
            pronounced upon us as often as we speak; if an actor is <lb/>
            once mistaken in an attitude, he is not immediately con- <lb/>
            sidered to be ignorant of attitude in general; but if any <lb/>
            fault is found in a speaker, there prevails for ever, or at least <lb/>
            for a very long time, a notion of his stupidity.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " But in what you observed, as to there being <lb/>
            many things in which, unless the orator has a full supply of <lb/>
            them from nature, he cannot be much assisted by a master <lb/>
            I agree with you entirely; and, in regard to that point, I <lb/>
            have always expressed the highest approbation of that emi- <lb/>
            nent teacher, Apollonius of Alabanda, who, though he taught <note type="footnote"> 1 A town of Caria. The Apollonius mentioned above, c. 17, was <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="a. XXVIII. I"/><note type="margin">C. XXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            for pay, would not saffer such as he judged could never oecome <lb/>
            orators, to lose their labour with him; and he sent them <lb/>
            away with exhortations and encouragements to each of <lb/>
            them to pursue that peculiar art for which he thought him <lb/>
            naturally qualified. To the acquirement of other arts it is <lb/>
            sufficient for a person to resemble a man, and to be able to <lb/>
            comprehend in his mind, and retain in his memory, what is <lb/>
            instilled, or, if he is very dull, inculcated into him; no volu- <lb/>
            bility of tongue is requisite, no quickness of utterance; none <lb/>
            of those things which we cannot form for ourselves, aspect, <lb/>
            countenance, look, voice. But in an orator, the acuteness of <lb/>
            the logicians, the wisdom of the philosophers, the language <lb/>
            almost of poetry, the memory of lawyers, the voice of tra- <lb/>
            gedians, the gesture almost of the best actors, is required. <lb/>
            Nothing therefore is more rarely found among mankind than <lb/>
            a consummate orator; for qualifications which professors of <lb/>
            other arts are commended for acquiring in a moderate degree, <lb/>
            each in his respective pursuit, will not be praised in the <lb/>
            orator, unless they are all combined in him in the highest <lb/>
            possible excellence."</p>
          <p>" Yet observe," said Crassus, "how much more diligence <lb/>
            is used in one of the light and trivial arts than in this, which <lb/>
            is acknowledged to be of the greatest importance; for I often <lb/>
            near Roscius say, that' he could never yet find a scholar that <lb/>
            he was thoroughly satisfied with; not that some of them <lb/>
            were not worthy of approbation, but because, if they had <lb/>
            any fault, he himself could not endure it.' Nothing indeed <lb/>
            is so much noticed, or makes an impression of such lasting <lb/>
            continuance on the memory, as that in which you give any <lb/>
            sort of offence. To judge therefore of the accomplishments <lb/>
            of the orator by comparison with this stage-player, do you <lb/>
            not observe how everything is done by him unexceptionably; <lb/>
            everything with the utmost grace; everything in such a way <lb/>
            as is becoming, and as moves and delights all? He has <lb/>
            accordingly long attained such distinction, that in whatever <lb/>
            pursuit a man excels, he is called a Roscius in his art. For <lb/>
            my own part, while I desire this finish and perfection in an <lb/>
            orator, of which I fall so far short myself, I act audaciously; <lb/>
            for I wish indulgence to be granted to myself, while I grant <lb/>
            none to others; for I think that he who has not abilities, <lb/>
            who is faulty in action, who, in short, wants a graceful <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            manner, should be sent off, as Apollonius advised, to that for <lb/>
            which he has a capacity."</p>
          <p>XXIX. “ Would you then," said Sulpicius, " desire me, or <lb/>
            our friend Cotta, to learn the civil law, or the military art?1 <lb/>
            for who can ever possibly arrive at that perfection of yours, <lb/>
            that high excellence in every accomplishment?" "It was," <lb/>
            replied Crassus, " because I knew that there was in both of <lb/>
            you excellent and noble talents for oratory, that I have <lb/>
            expressed myself fully on these matters; nor have I adapted <lb/>
            my remarks more to deter those who had not abilities, than <lb/>
            to encourage you who had; and though I perceive in you <lb/>
            both consummate capacity and industry, yet I may say that <lb/>
            the advantage of personal appearance, on which I have <lb/>
            perhaps said more than the Greeks are wont to say, are in <lb/>
            you, Sulpicius, even godlike. For any person better qualified <lb/>
            for this profession by gracefulness of motion, by his very <lb/>
            carriage and figure, or by the fulness and sweetness of his <lb/>
            voice, I think that I have never heard speak; endowments <lb/>
            which those, to whom they are granted by nature in an <lb/>
            inferior degree, may yet succeed in managing, in such <lb/>
            measure as they possess them, with judgment and skill, and <lb/>
            in such a manner as not to be unbecoming; for that is what <lb/>
            is chiefly to be avoided, and concerning which it is most dif- <lb/>
            ficult to give any rules for instruction, not only for me, who <lb/>
            talk of these matters like a private citizen, but even for <lb/>
            Roscius himself, whom I often hear say, 'that the most <lb/>
            essential part of art is to be becoming,’ which yet is the only <lb/>
            thing that cannot be taught by art. But, if it is agreeable, <lb/>
            let us change the subject of conversation, and talk like our- <lb/>
            selves a little, not like rhetoricians."</p>
          <p>" By no means," said Cotta, “for we must now intreat you <lb/>
            (since you retain us in this study, and do not dismiss us to <lb/>
            any other pursuit) to tell us something of your own abilities, <lb/>
            whatever they are, in speaking; for we are not inordinately <lb/>
            ambitious; we are satisfied with that mediocrity of eloquence <lb/>
            of yours; and what we inquire of you is (that we may not <lb/>
            attain more than that humble degree of oratory at which you <lb/>
            have arrived) 2 what you think, since you say that the endow- <note type="footnote"> 1 The young Roman nobles were accustomed to pursue one of three <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. XXXI.] </note> <lb/>
            ments to be derived from nature are not very deficient in us, <lb/>
            we ought to endeavour to acquire in addition."</p>
          <p>XXX. Crassus, smiling, replied, " What do you think is <lb/>
            wanting to you, Cotta, but a passionate inclination, and a <lb/>
            sort of ardour like that of love, without which no man will <lb/>
            ever attain anything great in life, and especially such dis- <lb/>
            tinction as you desired Yet I do not see that you need any <lb/>
            encouragement to this pursuit; indeed, as you press rather <lb/>
            hard even upon me, I consider that you burn with an extra- <lb/>
            ordinarily fervent affection for it. But I am aware that <lb/>
            a desire to reach any point avails nothing, unless you know <lb/>
            what will lead and bring you to the mark at which you aim. <lb/>
            Since therefore you lay but a light burden upon me, and do <lb/>
            not question me about the whole art of the orator, but about <lb/>
            my own ability, little as it is, I will set before you a course, <lb/>
            not very obscure, or very difficult, or grand, or imposing, the <lb/>
            course of my own practice, which I was accustomed to pursue <lb/>
            when I had opportunity, in my youth, to apply to such <lb/>
            studies."</p>
          <p>" 0 day much wished for by us, Cotta!" exclaimed Sul- <lb/>
            picius; " for what I could never obtain, either by entreaty, or <lb/>
            stratagem, or scrutiny, (so that I was unable, not only to see <lb/>
            what Crassus did, with a view to meditation or composition, <lb/>
            but even to gain a notion of it from his secretary and reader, <lb/>
            Diphilus,) I hope we have now secured, and that we shall <lb/>
            learn from himself all that we have long desired to know."</p>
          <p>XXXI. "I conceive, however," proceeded Crassiis, "that <lb/>
            when you have heard me, you will not so much admire <lb/>
            what I have said, as think that, when you desired to hear, <lb/>
            there was no good reason for your desire; for I shall .say <lb/>
            nothing abstruse, nothing to answer your expectation, nothing <lb/>
            either previously unheard by you, or new to any one. In the <lb/>
            first place, I will not deny that, as becomes a man well born <lb/>
            and liberally educated, I learned those trite and common <lb/>
            precepts of teachers in general; first, that it is the business <lb/>
            of an orator to speak in a manner adapted to persuade; next, <lb/>
            that every speech is either upon a question concerning a <lb/>
            matter in general, without specification of persons or times, or <lb/>
            concerning a matter referring to certain persons and times. <lb/>
            But that, in either case, whatever falls under controversy, <lb/>
            the question with regard to it is usually, whether such a <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note><lb/>
            thing has been done, or, if it has been done, of what nature <lb/>
            it is, or by what name it should be called; or, as some add, <lb/>
            whether it seems to have been done rightly or not. That <lb/>
            controversies arise also on the interpretation of writing, in <lb/>
            which anything has been expressed ambiguously, or contra- <lb/>
            dictorily, or so that what is written is at variance with the <lb/>
            writer's evident intention; and that there are certain lines of <lb/>
            argument adapted to all these cases. But that of such sub- <lb/>
            jects as are distinct from general questions, part come under <lb/>
            the head of judicial proceedings, part under that of delibe- <lb/>
            rations; and that there is a third kind which is employed in <lb/>
            praising or censuring particular persons. That there are <lb/>
            also certain common places on which we may insist in judicial <lb/>
            proceedings, in which equity is the object; others, which we <lb/>
            may adopt in deliberations, all which are to be directed to <lb/>
            the advantage of those to whom we give counsel; others in <lb/>
            panegyric, in which all must be referred to the dignity of the <lb/>
            persons commended. That since all the business and art of <lb/>
            an orator is divided into five parts,1 he ought first to find <lb/>
            out what he should say; next, to dispose and arrange his <lb/>
            matter, not only in a certain order, but with a sort of power <lb/>
            and judgment; then to clothe and deck his thoughts with <lb/>
            language; then to secure them in his memory; and lastly, <lb/>
            to deliver them with dignity and grace. I had learned and <lb/>
            understood also, that before we enter upon the main subject, <lb/>
            the minds of the audience should be conciliated by an exor- <lb/>
            dium; next, that the case should be clearly stated; then, <lb/>
            that the point in controversy should be established; then, <lb/>
            that what we maintain should be supported by proof, and <lb/>
            that whatever was said on the other side should be refuted; <lb/>
            and that, in the conclusion of our speech, whatever was in our <lb/>
            favour should be amplified and enforced, and whatever made <lb/>
            for our adversaries should be weakened and invalidated.</p>
          <p>XXXII. "I had heard also what is taught about the <lb/>
            costume of a speech; in regard to which it is first directed <lb/>
            that we should speak correctly and in pure Latin; next, <lb/>
            intelligibly and with perspicuity; then gracefully; then <lb/>
            suitably to the dignity of the subject, and as it were becom- <lb/>
            iugly; and I had made myself acquainted with the rules <note type="footnote"> 1 Invention, disposition, embellishment. memory, and delivery. See <lb/>
            U. 19. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="179"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            relating to every particular. Moreover, I had seen art applied <lb/>
            to those things which are properly endowments of nature; <lb/>
            for I had gone over some precepts concerning action, and <lb/>
            some concerning artificial memory, which were short indeed, <lb/>
            but requiring much exercise; matters on which almost all <lb/>
            the learning of those artificial orators is employed; and if I <lb/>
            should say that it is of no assistance, I should say what is nG. <lb/>
            true; for it conveys some hints to admonish the orator, as <lb/>
            it were, to what he should refer each part of his speech, <lb/>
            and to what points he may direct his view, so as not to <lb/>
            wander from the object which he has proposed to himself. <lb/>
            But I consider that with regard to all precepts the case is <lb/>
            this, not that orators by adhering to them have obtained dis- <lb/>
            tinction in eloquence; but that certain persons have noticed <lb/>
            what men of eloquence practised of their own accord, and <lb/>
            formed rules accordingly;1 so that eloquence has not sprung <lb/>
            from art, but art from eloquence; not that, as I said before, <lb/>
            I entirely reject art, for it is, though not essentially necessary <lb/>
            to oratory, yet proper for a man of liberal education to learn. <lb/>
            And by you, my young friends, some preliminary exercise <lb/>
            must be undergone; though indeed you are already on the <lb/>
            course; but those2 who are to enter upon a race, and those <lb/>
            who are preparing for what is to be done in the forum, as <lb/>
            their field of battle, may alike previously learn, and try their <lb/>
            powers, by practising in sport." "That sort of exercise," <lb/>
            said Sulpicius, “is just what we wanted to understand; but <lb/>
            we desire to hear more at large what you have briefly and <lb/>
            cursorily delivered concerning art; though such matters are <lb/>
            not strange even to us. Of that subject, however, we shall <lb/>
            inquire hereafter; at present we wish to know your sen- <lb/>
            timents on exercise."</p>
          <p>XXXIII. "I like that method," replied Crassus, "which <lb/>
            you are accustomed to practise, namely, to lay down a case <lb/>
            similar to those which are brought on in the forum, and to <note type="footnote"> 1 Atque id egisse. Most critics have supposed these words in some <lb/>
            way faulty. Gesner conjectured, atque digessisse; Lambinus, atque in <lb/>
            artem redegisse ; Ernesti, ad artemque redegisse. Ellendt supposes that <lb/>
            id egisse may mean ei rei operam dedisse. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sed iis, qui ingrediuntur. Orellius and Ellendt retain this reading, <lb/>
            though Emesti had long before observed that there is no verb on which <lb/>
            iis can be considered as dependent, and that we must read ii or hi as <lb/>
            a nominative to the following possunt. </note> <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            speak upon it, as nearly as possible, as if it were a real case.] <lb/>
            But in such efforts the generality of students exercise only <lb/>
            their voice (aud not even that skilfully), and try their <lb/>
            strength of lungs, and volubility of tongue, and please them- <lb/>
            selves with a torrent of their own words; in which exercise <lb/>
            what they have heard deceives them, that men by speaking <lb/>
            succeed in becoming speakers. For it is truly said also, That <lb/>
            men by speaking badly make sure of becoming bad speakers. <lb/>
            In those exercises, therefore, although it be useful even fre- <lb/>
            quently to speak on the sudden, yet it is mere advantageous, <lb/>
            after taking time to consider, to speak with greater prepara- <lb/>
            tion and accuracy. But the chief point of all is that which <lb/>
            (to say the truth) we hardly ever practise (for it requires great <lb/>
            labour, which most of us avoid); I mean, to write as much as <lb/>
            possible. Writing is said to be the best and most excellent <lb/>
            modeller and teacher of oratory; and not without reason; for <lb/>
            if what is meditated and considered easily surpasses sudden <lb/>
            and extemporary speech, a constant and diligent habit of <lb/>
            writing will surely be of more effect than meditation and <lb/>
            consideration itself; since all the arguments relating to the <lb/>
            subject on which we write, whether they are suggested by <lb/>
            art, or by a certain power of genius and understanding, will <lb/>
            present themselves, and occur to us, while we examine and <lb/>
            contemplate it in the full light of our intellect; and all the <lb/>
            thoughts and words, which are the most expressive of their <lb/>
            kind, must of necessity come under and submit to the keen- <lb/>
            ness of our judgment while writing; and a fair arrangement <lb/>
            and collocation of the words is effected by writing, in a <lb/>
            certain rhythm and measure, not poetical, but oratorical. <lb/>
            Such are the qualities which bring applause and admiration to <lb/>
            good orators; nor will any man ever attain them, unless after <lb/>
            long and great practice in writing, however resolutely he may <lb/>
            have exercised himself in extemporary speeches; and he who <lb/>
            comes to speak after practice in writing brings this advantage <lb/>
            with him, that though he speak at the call of the moment, <lb/>
            yet what he says will bear a resemblance to something written; <lb/>
            and if ever, when he comes to speak, he brings anything with <lb/>
            him in writing, the rest of his speech, when he departs from <lb/>
            what is written, will flow on in a similar strain. As, when <note type="footnote"> 1 Quam maximè ad veritatem accommodatè, " with as much adapta- <lb/>
            tion as possible to truth." </note> <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            a boat has once been impelled forward, though the rowers <lb/>
            suspend their efforts, the vessel herself still keeps her motion <lb/>
            and course during the intermission of the impulse and force <lb/>
            of the oars; so, in a continued stream of oratory, when <lb/>
            written matter fails, the rest of the speech maintains a similar <lb/>
            flow, being impelled by the resemblance and force acquired <lb/>
            from what was written.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. “ But in my daily exercises I used, when a youth, <lb/>
            to adopt chiefly that method which I knew that Caius Carbo, <lb/>
            my adversary,1 generally practised; which was, that, having <lb/>
            selected some nervous piece of poetry, or read over such <lb/>
            a portion of a speech as I could retain in my memory, I used <lb/>
            to declaim upon what I had been reading in other words, <lb/>
            chosen with all the judgment that I possessed. But at length <lb/>
            I perceived that in that method there was this inconvenience, <lb/>
            that Ennius, if I exercised myself on his verses, or Gracchus, <lb/>
            if I laid one of his orations before me, had forestalled such <lb/>
            words as were peculiarly appropriate to the subject, and such <lb/>
            as were the most elegant and altogether the best; so that, if <lb/>
            I used the same words, it profited nothing; if others, it was <lb/>
            even prejudicial to me, as I habituated myself to use such <lb/>
            as were less eligible. Afterwards I thought proper, and <lb/>
            continued the practice at a rather more advanced age,2 to <lb/>
            translate the orations of the best Greek orators;3 by fixing <lb/>
            upon which I gained this advantage, that while I rendered <lb/>
            into Latin what I had read in Greek, I not only used the <lb/>
            best words, and yet such as were of common occurrence, but <lb/>
            also formed some words by imitation, which would be new to <lb/>
            our countrymen, taking care, however, that they were unob- <lb/>
            jectionable.</p>
          <p>"As to the exertion and exercise of the voice, of the breath, <lb/>
            of the whole body, and of the tongue itself, they do not so <lb/>
            much require art as labour; but in those matters we ought to <lb/>
            be particularly careful whom we imitate and whom we would <lb/>
            wish to resemble. Not only orators are to be observed by <lb/>
            us, but even actors, lest by vicious habits we contract any <lb/>
            awkwardness or ungracefulness. The memory is also to be <note type="footnote"> 1 See c. x. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Adolescens. When he imitated the practice of Carbo, be was, ha <unclear/> <lb/>

            exercised, by learning accurately by heart as many of our own <lb/>
            writings, and those of others, as we can. In exercising the <lb/>
            memory, too, I shall not object if you accustom yourself to <lb/>
            adopt that plan of referring to places and figures which is <lb/>
            taught in treatises on the art.1 Your language must then be <lb/>
            brought forth from this domestic and retired exercise, into <lb/>
            the midst of the field, into the dust and clamour, into the <lb/>
            camp and military array of the forum; you must acquire <lb/>
            practice in everything; you must try the strength of your <lb/>
            understanding; and your retired lucubrations must be ex- <lb/>
            posed to the light of reality. The poets must also be studied; <lb/>
            an acquaintance must be formed with history; the writers <lb/>
            and teachers in all the liberal arts and sciences must be read, <lb/>
            and turned over, and must, for the sake of exercise, be praised, <lb/>
            interpreted, corrected, censured, refuted; you must dispute <lb/>
            on both sides of every question; and whatever may seem <lb/>
            maintainable on any point, must be brought forward and <lb/>
            illustrated. The civil law must be thoroughly studied; laws <lb/>
            in general must be understood; all antiquity must be known; <lb/>
            the usages of the senate, the nature of our government, the <lb/>
            rights of our allies, our treaties and convention?, and. what- <lb/>
            ever concerns the interests of the state, must be learned. <lb/>
            A certain intellectual grace must also be extracted from every <lb/>
            kind of refinement, with which, as with salt, every oration <lb/>
            must be seasoned. I have poured forth to you all I had to <lb/>
            say, and perhaps any citizen whom you had laid hold of in <lb/>
            any company whatever, would have replied to your inquiries <lb/>
            on these subjects equally well."</p>
          <p>XXXV. When Crassus had uttered these words a silence <lb/>
            ensued. But though enough seemed to have been said in the <lb/>
            opinion of the company present, in reference to what had <lb/>
            been proposed, yet they thought that he had concluded his <lb/>
            speech more abruptly than they could have wished. Scævola <lb/>
            then said, "What is the matter, Cotta why are you silent ? <lb/>
            Does nothing more occur to you which you would wish to <lb/>
            ask Crassus "Nay," rejoined he, "that is the very thing <lb/>
            of which I am thinking; for the rapidity of his words was <lb/>
            such, and his oration was winged with such speed, that <lb/>
            though I perceived its force and energy I could scarcely see <note type="footnote"> 1 This is sufficiently explained in book ii. c. 87. See also Qvint <lb/>
            XI. 2. </note> <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXV.] </note> <lb/>
            its track and course; and, as if I had come into some rich <lb/>
            and well-furnished house, where the furniturel was not un- <lb/>
            packed, nor the plate set out, nor the pictures and statues <lb/>
            placed in view, but a multitude of all these magnificent <lb/>
            things laid up and heaped together; so just now, in the <lb/>
            speech of Crassus, I saw his opulence and the riches of his <lb/>
            genius, through veils and curtains as it were; but when I <lb/>
            desired to take a nearer view, there was scarcely opportunity <lb/>
            for taking a glance at them; I can therefore neither say that <lb/>
            I am wholly ignorant of what he possesses, nor that I have <lb/>
            plainly ascertained and beheld it." " Then," said Scævola, <lb/>
            " why do you not act in the same way as you would do, if <lb/>
            you had really come into a house or villa full of rich fur- <lb/>
            niture ? If everything was put by as you describe, and you <lb/>
            had a great curiosity to see it, you would not hesitate to ask <lb/>
            the master to order it to be brought out, especially if he was <lb/>
            your friend; in like manner you will now surely ask Crassus <lb/>
            to bring forth into the light that profusion of splendid objects <lb/>
            which are his property, (and of which, piled together in one <lb/>
            place, we have caught a glimpse, as it were through a lattice,5 <lb/>
            as we passed by,) and set everything in its proper situation." <lb/>
            "I rather ask you, Scævola,” says Cotta, "to do that for me; <lb/>
            (for modesty forbids Sulpicius and myself to ask of one of <lb/>
            the most eminent of mankind, who has ever held in contempt <lb/>
            this kind of disputation, such things as he perhaps regards <lb/>
            only as rudiments for children;) but do you oblige us in this, <lb/>
            Scævola, and prevail on Crassus to unfold and enlarge upon <lb/>
            those matters which he has crowded together, and crammed <lb/>
            into so small a space in his speech." " Indeed," said Scævola, <lb/>
            "I desired that before, more upon your account than my <lb/>
            own; nor did I feel so much longing for this discussion from <lb/>
            Crassus, as I experience pleasure from his orations in pleading <lb/>
            But now, Crassus, I ask you also on my own account, that since <lb/>
            we have so much more leisure than has been allowed us for <lb/>
            long time, you would not think it troublesome to complete <lb/>
            the edifice which you have commenced; for I see a finer <note type="footnote">1 Veste. Under this word is included tapestry, coverings of couches, <lb/>

            gined, and one of which I strongly approve."</p>
          <p>XXXVI. " I cannot sufficiently wonder," says Crassus, <lb/>
            "that even you, Scævola, should require of me that which <lb/>
            I do not understand like those who teach it, and which is of <lb/>
            such a nature, that if I understood it ever so well, it would <lb/>
            be unworthy of your wisdom and attention." "Say you <lb/>
            so?" replied Scævola. "If you think it scarcely worthy 01 <lb/>
            my age to listen to those ordinary precepts, commonly known <lb/>
            everywhere, can we possibly neglect those other matters which <lb/>
            you said must be known by the orator, respecting the dispo- <lb/>
            sitions and manners of mankind, the means by which the <lb/>
            minds of men are excited or calmed, history, antiquity, the <lb/>
            administration of the republic, and finally of our own civil <lb/>
            law itself? For I knew that all this science, this abundance <lb/>
            of knowledge, was within the compass of your understanding, <lb/>

            Cneius Octavius, a mail of consular dignity, in a speech of equal <lb/>

            be released from the ignominious charge of having been un- <lb/>

            blundering grievously through ignorance of the civil law. One of them <lb/>
            was Hypsæus, the other Cneius Octavius, who had been consul B.c. 128. <lb/>

            story,) not only unworthy of the name of orators, but un- <lb/>
            worthy even to appear to plead in the forum." "Yet," <lb/>
            rejoined Crassus, "those advocates neither wanted eloquence, <lb/>
            nor method, nor abundance of words, but a knowledge of the <lb/>
            civil law: for in this case one, in bringing his suit, sought to <lb/>
            recover more damages than the law of the Twelve Tables <lb/>
            allowed, and, if he had gained those damages, would have <lb/>
            lost his cause: the other thought it unjust that he himself <lb/>
            should be proceeded against for more than was allowed in <lb/>
            that sort of action, and did not understand that his adversary, <lb/>

            Octavius defended the guardian. The judge of this controversy was <lb/>
            Marcus Crassus, then city prætor, B.C. 105. He that was condemned on <lb/>
            such a trial, was decreed to pay damages to his ward to the amount of <lb/>
            what his affairs had suffered through his means, and, in addition, by <lb/>
            the law of the Twelve Tables, was to pay something by way of fine. But <lb/>
            if the ward, or his advocate, sought to recover more from the defendant <lb/>
            than was due, he lost his cause. Hypsæus proceeded in this manner, <lb/>
            and therefore ought to have been nonsuited. Octavius, an unskilful <lb/>
            defender of his client, should have rejoiced at this, for if he had made <lb/>
            the objection and proved it, he would have obtained his cause; but <lb/>
            he refused to permit Hypsæus to proceed for more than was due, <lb/>

            plaintiff this point, that he demanded his money before it was due, <lb/>
            (which if he had proved, the plaintiff would have lost his cause,) only <lb/>
            prayed the benefit of the exception, which forbade an action to be <lb/>
            brought for money before the day of payment, and so only put off the <lb/>
            cause for that time. This he did not perceive to be a clause inserted <lb/>
            for the advantage of the plaintiff, that he might know when to bring <lb/>
            his suit. Thus the plaintiff, when the money became due, was at <lb/>
            liberty to bring a new action, a3 if this matter had never come to trial, <lb/>
            which action he could never hare brought, if the first had been deter- <lb/>

            that if there was no son at all who could come out of tute- <lb/>
            lage, Manius Curius should be his heir. Did either of us, in <lb/>
            that cause, fail to exert ourselves in citing authorities, and <lb/>
            precedents, and forms of wills, that is, to dispute on the pro- <lb/>
            foundest points of civil law?1</p>
          <p>XL. " I forbear to mention many examples of causes of the <lb/>
            greatest consequence, which are indeed without number. It <lb/>
            may often happen that even capital cases may turn upon <lb/>
            a point of law; for, as an example, Publius Rutilius, the son <lb/>
            of Marcus, when tribune of the people, ordered Caius Man- <lb/>
            cinus, a most noble and excellent man, and of consular <lb/>
            dignity, to be put out of the senate; on the occasion when <lb/>
            the chief herald had given him up to the Numantines, <lb/>
            according to a decree of the senate, passed on account of the <lb/>
            odium which he had incurred by his treaty with that people, <lb/>
            and they would not receive him,2 and he had then returned <lb/>
            home, and had not hesitated to take his place in the senate; <lb/>
            the tribune, I say, ordered him to be put out of the house, <lb/>
            maintaining that he was not a citizen; because it was a re- <lb/>
            ceived tradition, That he whom his own father, or the people, <lb/>
            had sold, or the chief herald had given up, had no postlimi- <lb/>
            nium3 or right of return. What more important cause or <lb/>
            argument can we find, among all the variety of civil transac- <lb/>
            tions, than one concerning the rank, the citizenship, the <lb/>
            liberty, the condition of a man of consular dignity, especially <lb/>
            as the case depended, not on any charge which he might <lb/>
            deny, but on the interpretation of the civil law? In a like <lb/>
            case, but concerning a person of inferior degree, it was in- <lb/>
            quired among our ancestors, whether, if a person belonging <note type="footnote"> 1 This celebrated cause is so clearly stated by Cicero as to requ in <lb/>

            home, he returned by the right of postliminium, and lost the <lb/>
            citizenship of this city. May not a dispute arise on a point <lb/>
            of civil law respecting liberty, than which no cause can be 01 <lb/>
            more importance, when the question is, for example, whether <lb/>
            he who is enrolled as a citizen, by his master's consent, is free <lb/>
            at once, or when the lustrum is completed? As to the case <lb/>
            also, that happened in the memory of our fathers, when the <lb/>
            father of a family, who had come from Spain to Rome, and <lb/>
            ad left a wife pregnant in that province, and married another <lb/>
            at Rome, without sending any notice of divorce to the former, <lb/>
            and died intestate, after a son had been born of each wife, <lb/>
            did a small matter come into controversy, when the question <lb/>
            was concerning the rights of two citizens, I mean concerning <lb/>
            the boy who was born of the latter wife and his mother, who, <lb/>
            if it were adjudged that a divorce was effected from a former <lb/>
            wife by a certain set of words, and not by a second marriage, <lb/>
            would be deemed a concubine? For a man, then, who is <lb/>
            ignorant of these and other similar laws of his own country, <lb/>
            to wander about the forum with a great crowd at his heels, <lb/>
            erect and haughty, looking hither and thither with a gay and <lb/>
            assured face and air, offering and tendering protection to his <lb/>
            clients, assistance to his friends, and the light of his genius <lb/>
            and counsel to almost all his fellow-citizens, is it not to be <lb/>
            bought in the highest degree scandalous?</p>
          <p>XLI. " Since I have spoken of the audacity, let me also <lb/>
            censure the indolence and inertness of mankind. For if the <lb/>
            study of the law were illimitable and arduous, yet the great- <lb/>
            ness of the advantage ought to impel men to undergo the <lb/>
            labour of learning it; but, 0 ye immortal gods, I would not say <lb/>
            this in the hearing of Scævola, unless he himself were accus- <lb/>
            tomed to say it, namely, that the attainment of no science seems <lb/>
            to him more easy. It is, indeed, for certain reasons, thought <lb/>
            otherwise by most people, first, because those of old, who <lb/>
            were at the head of this science, would not, for the sake of <lb/>
            securing and extending their own influence, allow their art <lb/>
            to be made public; in the next place, when it was published, <lb/>
            the forms of actions at law being first set forth by Cneius <lb/>
            Flavius, there were none who could compose a general system <lb/>
            of those matters arranged under regular heads. For nothing <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XLII.] </note> <lb/>
            can Le reduced into a science, unless he who understands the <lb/>
            matters of which he would form a science, has previously <lb/>
            gained such knowledge as to enable him to constitute a <lb/>
            science out of subjects in which there has never yet been <lb/>
            any science. I perceive that, from desire to express this <lb/>
            briefly, I have expressed it rather obscurely; but I will <lb/>
            make an effort to explain myself, if possible, with more <lb/>
            perspicuity.</p>
          <p>XLII. " All things which arc now comprised in sciences, <lb/>
            were formerly unconnected, and in a state, as it were, of dis- <lb/>
            persion; as in music, numbers, sounds, and measures; in <lb/>
            geometry, lines, figures, spaces, magnitudes; in astronomy, <lb/>
            the revolution of the heavens, the rising, setting, and other <lb/>
            motions of the stars; in grammar, the study of the poets, <lb/>
            the knowledge of history, the interpretation of words, the <lb/>
            peculiar tone of pronunciation; and finally, in this very art <lb/>
            of oratory, invention, embellishment, arrangement, memory, <lb/>
            delivery, seemed of old not to be fully understood by any, and <lb/>
            to be wholly unconnected. A certain extrinsic art was therefore <lb/>
            applied, adopted from another department of knowledge,1 <lb/>
            which the philosophers wholly claim to themselves, an art <lb/>
            which might serve to cement things previously separate and <lb/>
            uncombined, and unite them in a kind of system.</p>
          <p>" Let then the end proposed in civil law be the preserva- <lb/>
            tion of legitimate and practical equity in the affairs and <lb/>
            causes of the citizens. The general heads of it are then to <lb/>
            be noted, and reduced to a certain number, as few as may be. <lb/>
            A general head is that which comprehends two or more par- <lb/>
            ticulars, similar to one another by having something in <lb/>
            common, but differing in species. Particulars are included <lb/>
            under the general heads from which they spring. All names, <lb/>
            which are given either to general heads, or particulars, must <lb/>
            be limited by definitions, showing what exact meaning they <lb/>
            have. A definition is a short and concise specification of <lb/>
            whatever properly belongs to the thing which we would <lb/>
            define. I should add examples on these points, were I not <lb/>
            sensible to whom my discourse is addressed. I will now <lb/>
            comprise what I proposed in a short space. For if I should <lb/>
            have leisure to do what I have long meditated, or if any <lb/>
            other person should undertake the task while I am occupied <note type="footnote"> 1 From philosophy </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            or accomplish it after my death, (I mean, to digest, first of all, <lb/>
            the whole civil law under general heads, which are very few; <lb/>
            next, to branch out those general heads, as it were, into <lb/>
            members; then to explain the peculiar nature of each by <lb/>
            a definition;) you will have a complete system of civil law, <lb/>
            large and full indeed, but neither difficult nor obscure. In <lb/>
            the meantime, while what is unconnected is being combined, <lb/>
            a person may, even by gathering here aud there, and col- <lb/>
            leoting from all parts, be furnished with a competent know- <lb/>
            ledge of the civil law.</p>
          <p>XLIII. " Do you not observe that Caius Aculeo,1 a Roman <lb/>
            knight, a man of the most acute genius in the world, but of <lb/>
            little learning in other sciences, who now lives, and has always <lb/>
            lived with me, understands the civil law so well, that none <lb/>
            even of the most skilful, if you except my friend Scævola <lb/>
            here, can be preferred to him? Everything in it, indeed, is <lb/>
            set plainly before our eyes, connected with our daily habits, <lb/>
            with our intercourse among men, and with the forum, and is <lb/>
            not contained in a vast quantity of writing, or many large <lb/>
            volumes; for the elements that were at first published by <lb/>
            several writers are the same; and the same things, with the <lb/>
            change of a few words, have been repeatedly written by the <lb/>
            same authors. Added to this, that the civil law may be <lb/>
            more readily learned and understood, there is (what most <lb/>
            people little imagine) a wonderful pleasure and delight in <lb/>
            acquiring a knowledge of it. For, whether any person is <lb/>
            attracted by the study of antiquity,2 there is, in every part <lb/>
            of the civil law, in the pontifical books, and in the Twelve <note type="footnote"> 1 This Aculeo married Cicero's aunt by the mother's side, as he tells <lb/>
            us in the beginning of the second book of this treatise, c. 1, and his <lb/>

            all bred up together with them, in a method approved by L. Crassus, <lb/>

            not only the original sense of words is thence understood. <lb/>
            but certain kinds of law proceedings illustrate the customs <lb/>
            and lives of our ancestors; or if he has a view to the science <lb/>
            of government (which Scævola judges not to belong to the <lb/>
            orator, but to science of another sort), he will find it all com- <lb/>
            prised in the Twelve Tables, every advantage of civil govern- <lb/>
            ment, and every part of it being there described; or if <lb/>
            authoritative and vaunting philosophy delight him, (I will <lb/>
            speak very boldly,) he will find there the sources of all the <lb/>
            philosophers' disputations, which lie in civil laws and enact- <lb/>
            ments; for from these we perceive that virtue is above all <lb/>
            things desirable, since honest, just, and conscientious industry <lb/>
            is ennobled with honours, rewards, and distinctions; but the <lb/>
            vices and frauds of mankind are punished by fines, ignominy, <lb/>
            imprisonment, stripes, banishment, and death; and we are <lb/>
            taught, not by disputations endless and full of discord, but <lb/>
            by the authority and mandate of the laws, to hold our appe- <lb/>
            tites in subjection, to restrain all our passions, to defend our <lb/>
            own property, and to keep our thoughts, eyes, and hands, <lb/>
            from that of others.</p>
          <p>XLIV. " Though all the world exclaim against me, I will <lb/>
            say what I think: that single little book of the Twelve Tables, <lb/>
            if any one look to the fountains and sources of laws, seems <lb/>
            to me, assuredly, to surpass the libraries of all the philo- <lb/>
            sophers, both in weight of authority, and in plenitude of <lb/>
            utility. And if our country has our love, as it ought to <lb/>
            have in the highest degree,—our country, I say, of which the <lb/>
            force and natural attraction is so strong, that one of the <lb/>
            wisest of mankind preferred his Ithaca, fixed, like a little <lb/>
            nest, among the roughest of rocks, to immortality itself,— <lb/>
            with what affection ought we to be warmed towards such <lb/>
            a country as ours, which, preeminently above all other <lb/>
            countries, is the seat of virtue, empire, and dignity? Its <lb/>
            spirit, customs, and discipline ought to be our first objects of <lb/>
            study, both because our country is the parent of us all, and <lb/>
            because as much wisdom must be thought to have been em- <lb/>
            ployed in framing such laws, as in establishing so vast and <lb/>
            powerful an empire. You will receive also this pleasure and <lb/>
            delight from the study of the law, that you will then most <lb/>
            steadily comprehend how far our ancestors excelled other <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            nations in wisdom, if you compare our laws with those of <lb/>
            their Lycurgus, Draco, and Solon. It is indeed incredible <lb/>
            how undigested and almost ridiculous is all civil law, except <lb/>
            our own; on which subject I am accustomed to say much in <lb/>
            my daily conversation, when I am praising the wisdom of <lb/>
            our countrymen above that of all other men, and especially <lb/>
            of the Greeks. For these reasons have I declared, Scævola, <lb/>
            that the knowledge of the civil law is indispensable to those <lb/>
            who would become accomplished orators.</p>

            popularity, and dignity, such knowledge, even of itself, brings. <lb/>

            reward, offer themselves as assistants to the pleaders on trials. <lb/>

            character, such as that Ælius Sextus,2 who, for his knowledge- <lb/>
            in the civil law, was called by our great poet, <lb/>
            ‘A man of thought and prudence, nobly wise,' <lb/>
            and many besides, who, after arriving at distinction by means <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from Quintilian and Juvenal, that this was a Roman <lb/>

            advocates, though they studied nothing but oratory, and were in <lb/>
            general ignorant of the law, yet did not make use of any of these low <lb/>
            people called Pragmatici, as the Greeks did at that time, but upon <lb/>
            any doubts on the law, applied themselves to men of the greatest repu- <lb/>

            there was not the same encouragement for these great men to study <lb/>
            that science; the orators, therefore, fell of necessity into the Grecian <lb/>

            this collection, wherein were many new forms adapted to the cases and <lb/>
            circumstances which had happened since the time of Flavius, went under <lb/>
            the title of Jus Ælianum, from this iElius here praised by Ennius. B </note> <pb n="197"/>

            of their ability, attained such influence, that in answering <lb/>
            questions on points of law,1 they found their authority of <lb/>
            more weight than even their ability. For ennobling and <lb/>
            dignifying old age, indeed, what can be a more honourable <lb/>
            resource than the interpretation of the law? For myself, I <lb/>
            have, even from my youth, been securing this resource, not <lb/>
            merely with a view to benefit in pleadings in the forum, but <lb/>
            also for an honour and ornament to the decline of life; so <lb/>
            that, when my strength begins to fail me (for which the time <lb/>
            is even now almost approaching), I may, by that means, pre- <lb/>
            serve my house from solitude. For what is more noble than <lb/>
            for an old man, who has held the highest honours and offices <lb/>
            of the state, to be able justly to say for himself, that which <lb/>
            the Pythian Apollo says in Ennius, that be is the person <lb/>
            from whom, if not nations and kings, yet all his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, solicit advice, <lb/>
            ‘Uncertain how to act; whom, by my aid,, <lb/>
            I send away undoubting, full of counsel, <lb/>
            No more with rashness things perplex'd to sway;' <lb/>
            for without doubt the house of an eminent lawyer is tho <lb/>
            oracle of the whole city. Of this fact the gate and vestibule of <lb/>
            our friend Quintus Mucius is a proof, which, even in his very <lb/>
            infirm state of health, and advanced age, is daily frequented <lb/>
            by a vast crowd of citizens, and by persons of the highest <lb/>
            rank and splendour.</p>

            in causes and trials relative to private affairs, his language is <lb/>
            often to be borrowed from the civil law, and therefore, as we <lb/>
            said before, the knowledge of the civil law is necessary to the <lb/>
            orator; so in regard to causes affecting public matters, before <lb/>

            the history of these and of past times, the authority of public <lb/>

            be at the command of orators occupied with affairs of govern- <lb/>
            ment, as the very groundwork of their speeches.1 For we <lb/>
            are not contemplating, in this discourse, the character of an <lb/>
            every-day pleader, bawler, or barrator, but that of a man, <lb/>
            who, in the first place, may be, as it were, the high-priest of <lb/>
            this profession, for which, though nature herself has given <lb/>
            rich endowments to man, yet it was thought to be a god that <lb/>
            gave it, so that the very thing which is the distinguishing <lb/>
            property of man, might not seem to have been acquired by <lb/>
            ourselves, but bestowed upon us by some divinity; who, in <lb/>
            the next place, can move with safety even amid the weapons <lb/>
            of his adversaries, distinguished not so much by a herald's <lb/>
            caduceus,2 as by his title of orator; who, likewise, is able, by <lb/>
            means of his eloquence, to expose guilt and deceit to the <lb/>
            hatred of his countrymen, and to restrain them by penalties; <lb/>
            who can also, with the shield of his genius, protect inno- <lb/>
            cence from punishment; who can rouse a spiritless and de- <lb/>
            sponding people to glory, or reclaim them from infatuation, <lb/>
            or inflame their rage against the guilty, or mitigate it, if <lb/>
            incited against the virtuous; who, finally, whatever feeling in <lb/>
            the minds of men his object and cause require, can either <lb/>
            excite or calm it by his eloquence. If any one supposes <lb/>

            who have written on the art of speaking, or can be set <lb/>

            understands neither my inability, nor the magnitude of the <lb/>

            that I should become your guide (which would be an endless <lb/>
            and unnecessary labour), but so that I might point out to you <lb/>
            the way, and, as the practice is, might hold out my finger <lb/>
            towards the spring."1</p>
          <p>XLVII. " To me," remarked Scævola, " enough appears to <lb/>
            have been said by you, and more than enough, to stimulate <lb/>
            the efforts of these young men, if they are but studiously <lb/>
            inclined; for as they say that the illustrious Socrates used to <lb/>
            observe that his object was attained if any one was by his <lb/>
            exhortations sufficiently incited to desire to know and under- <lb/>
            stand virtue; (since to those who were persuaded to desire <lb/>
            nothing so much as to become good men, what remained to <lb/>
            be learned was easy;) so I consider that if you wish to pene- <lb/>
            trate into those subjects which Crassus has set before you in <lb/>
            his remarks, you will, with the greatest ease, arrive at your <lb/>
            object, after this course and gate has been opened to you." <lb/>
            " To us," said Sulpicius, " these instructions are exceedingly <lb/>
            pleasant and delightful; but there are a few things more <lb/>
            which we still desire to hear, especially those which were <lb/>
            touched upon so briefly by you, Crassus, in reference to ora- <lb/>
            tory as an art, when you confessed that you did not despise <lb/>
            them, but had learned them. If you will speak somewhat more <lb/>
            at length on those points, you will satisfy all the eagerness of <lb/>
            our long desire. For we have now heard to what objects we <lb/>
            must direct our efforts, a point which is of great importance; <lb/>
            but we long to be instructed in the ways and means of <lb/>
            pursuing those objects."</p>
          <p>" Then," said Crassus, " (since I, to detain you at my house <lb/>
            with less difficulty, have rather complied with your desires, <lb/>
            than my own habit or inclination,) what if we ask Antonius <lb/>
            to tell us something of what he still keeps in: reserve, and has <lb/>
            not yet made known to us, (on which subjects he complained, <lb/>
            a while ago, that a book has already dropped from his pen,) <lb/>
            and to reveal to us his mysteries in the art of speaking?" <lb/>
            " As you please," said Sulpicius, " for, if Antonius speaks, we <lb/>
            shall still learn what you think." " I request of you then, <lb/>
            Antonius," said Crassus, " since this task is put upon menof <note type="footnote"> 1 Ut fieri 8olet. Ernesti conjectures ut dici solet. Ellendt thinks the <lb/>

          <p>XLVIII. " I see plainly, and understand indeed," replied <lb/>
            Antonius, "that I am caught, not only because those things <lb/>
            are required from me in which I am ignorant and unprac- <lb/>
            tised, but because these young men do not permit me to <lb/>
            avoid, on the present occasion, what I always carefully avoid <lb/>
            in my public pleadings, namely, not to speak after you, <lb/>
            Crassus. But I will enter upon what you desire the more <lb/>
            boldly, as I hope the same thing will happen to me in this <lb/>
            discussion as usually happens to me at the bar, that no <lb/>
            flowers of rhetoric will be expected from me. For I am not <lb/>
            going to speak about art, which I never learned, but about <lb/>
            my own practice; and those very particulars which I have <lb/>
            entered in my common-place book are of this kind,1 not ex- <lb/>
            pressed with anything like learning, but just as they are <lb/>
            treated in business and pleadings; and if they do not meet <lb/>
            with approbation from men of your extensive knowledge, you <lb/>
            must blame your own unreasonableness, in requiring from me <lb/>
            what I do not know; and you must praise my complaisance, <lb/>
            since I make no difficulty in answering your questions, being <lb/>
            induced, not by my own judgment, but your earnest desire." <lb/>
            " Go on, Antonius," rejoined Crassus, "for there is no <lb/>
            danger that you will say anything otherwise than so discreetly <lb/>
            that no one here will repent of having prompted you to <lb/>
            speak."</p>
          <p>" I will go on, then," said Antonius, " and will do what I <lb/>
            think ought to be done in all discussions at the commence- <lb/>
            ment; I mean, that the subject, whatever it may be, on <lb/>
            which the discussion is held, should be defined; so that the <lb/>
            discourse may not be forced to wander and stray from its <lb/>
            course, from the disputants not having the same notion of the <lb/>
            matter under debate. If, for instance, it were inquired, 'What <lb/>
            is the art of a general?' I should think that we ought to settle, <lb/>
            at the outset, what a general is; and when he was defined to <lb/>
            be a commander for conducting a war, we might then proceed <lb/>
            to speak of troops, of encampments, of marching in battla <lb/>
            array, of engagements, of besieging towns, of provisions, of <note type="footnote"> 1 Not recorded with any elegance, but in the plain style in which <lb/>

            laying and avoiding ambuscades, and other matters relative <lb/>
            to the management of a war; and those who had the capacity <lb/>
            and knowledge to direct such affairs I should call generals; <lb/>
            and should adduce the examples of the African! and Maximi. <lb/>
            and speak of Epaminondas, and Hannibal, and men of such <lb/>
            character. But if we should inquire what sort of character <lb/>
            he is, who should contribute his experience, and knowledge, <lb/>
            and zeal to the management of the state, I should give this <lb/>
            sort of definition, that he who understands by what means the <lb/>
            interests of the republic are secured and promoted, and employs <lb/>
            those means, is worthy to be esteemed a director in affairs of <lb/>
            government, and a leader in public councils; and I should <lb/>
            mention Publius Lentulus, that chief of the senate,1 and <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus the father, and Quintus Metellus, and <lb/>
            Publius Africanus, and Caius Lælius, and others without <lb/>
            number, as well of our own city as of foreign states. But <lb/>
            if it should be asked, ' Who truly deserved the name of a <lb/>
            lawyer?' I should say that he deserves it who is learned in <lb/>
            the laws, and that general usage2 which private persons observe <lb/>
            in their intercourse in the community, who can give an answer <lb/>
            on any point, can plead, and can take precautions for the <lb/>
            interests of his client; and I should name Sextus Ælius, <lb/>
            Manius Manilius, Publius Mucius, as distinguished in those <lb/>
            respects. XLIX. In like manner, to notice sciences of a less <lb/>
            important character, if a musician, if a grammarian, if a poet <lb/>
            were the subject of consideration, I could state that which <lb/>
            each of them possesses, and than which nothing more is to <lb/>
            be expected from each. Even of the philosopher himself, who <lb/>
            alone, from his abilities and wisdom, professes almost every- <lb/>
            thing, there is a sort of definition, signifying, that he who studies <lb/>
            to learn the powers, nature, and causes of all things, divine and <lb/>
            human, and to understand and explain the whole science of <lb/>
            living virtuously, may justly deserve this appellation.</p>
          <p>" The orator, however, since it is about him that we <lb/>
            are considering, I do not conceive to be exactly the same cha- <lb/>
            racter that Crassus makes him, who seemed to me to in- <lb/>
            clude all knowledge of all matters and sciences, under the <lb/>
            single profession and name of an orator; but I regard him <note type="footnote"> 1 Principem illum. Nempe renatas. He was consul with Cneius <lb/>
            Domitius, A.U.C. 592. Ellendt. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The unwritten law. </note> <pb n="202"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            as one who can use words agreeable to hear, and thoughts <lb/>
            adapted to prove, not only in causes that are pleaded in the <lb/>
            forum, but in causes in general. Him I call an orator, and <lb/>
            would have him besides accomplished in delivery and action, <lb/>
            and with a certain degree of wit. But our friend Crassus <lb/>
            seemed to me to define the faculty of an orator, not by the <lb/>
            proper limits of his art, but by the almost immense limits of <lb/>
            his own genius; for, by his definition, he delivered the helm <lb/>
            of civil government into the hands of his orator; a point, <lb/>
            which it appeared very strange to me, Scævola, that you <lb/>
            should grant him; when the senate has often given its assent <lb/>
            on affairs of the utmost consequence to yourself, though you <lb/>
            have spoken briefly and without ornament. And M. Scaurus, <lb/>
            who I hear is in the country, at his villa not far off, a man <lb/>
            eminently skilled in affairs of government, if he should hear <lb/>
            that the authority which his gravity and counsels bear with <lb/>
            them, is claimed by you, Crassus, as you say that it is the <lb/>
            property of the orator, he would, I believe, come hither <lb/>
            without delay, and frighten us out of our talk by his very <lb/>
            countenance and aspect; who, though he is no contemptible <lb/>
            speaker, yet depends more upon his judgment in affairs of <lb/>
            consequence, than upon his ability in speaking; and, if any <lb/>
            one has abilities in both these ways, he who is of authority <lb/>
            in the public councils, and a good senator, is not on those <lb/>
            accounts an orator; and if he that is an eloquent and powerful <lb/>
            speaker be also eminent in civil administration, he did not <lb/>
            acquire his political knowledge1 through oratory. Those <lb/>
            talents differ very much in their nature, and are quite sepa- <lb/>
            rate and distinct from each other; nor did Marcus Cato, <lb/>
            Publius Africanus, Quintus Metellus, Caius Lælius, who were <lb/>
            all eloquent, give lustre to their own orations, and to the <lb/>
            dignity of the republic, by the same art and method.</p>
          <p>L. "It is not enjoined, let me observe, by the nature of <lb/>
            things, or by any law or custom, that one man must not <lb/>
            know more than one art; and therefore, though Pericles was <lb/>
            the best orator in Athens, and was also for many years <lb/>
            director of the public counsels in that city, the talent for <note type="footnote"> 1 Aliquam scientiam. For aliquam Manutius conjectured illam, which <lb/>

            both those characters must not be thought to belong to the. <lb/>
            same art because it existed in the same man; nor if Publius <lb/>
            Crassus was both an orator and a lawyer, is the knowledge <lb/>
            of the civil law for that reason included in the power of <lb/>
            speaking. For if every man who, while excelling in any art or <lb/>
            science, has acquired another art or science in addition, shall <lb/>
            represent that his additional knowledge is a part of that in <lb/>
            which he previously excelled,1 we may, by such a mode of <lb/>
            argument, pretend that to play well at tennis or counters,2 <lb/>
            is a part of the knowledge of civil law, because Publius Mucius <lb/>
            was skilled in both; and, by parity of reasoning, those whom <lb/>
            the Greeks call c<foreign xml:lang="grc">φυσικοί</foreign>, ' natural philosophers,' may be re- <lb/>
            garded as poets, because Empedocles the natural philosopher <lb/>
            wrote an excellent poem. But not even the philosophers <lb/>
            themselves, who would have everything, as their own right, to <lb/>
            be theirs, and in their possession, have the confidence to say <lb/>
            that geometry or music is a part of philosophy, because all <lb/>
            acknowledge Plato to have been eminently excellent in those <lb/>
            sciences. And if it be still your pleasure to attribute all <lb/>
            sciences to the orator, it will be better for us, rather, to <lb/>
            express ourselves to this effect, that since eloquence must not <lb/>
            be bald and unadorned, but marked and distinguished by <lb/>
            a certain pleasing variety of manifold qualities, it is necessary <lb/>
            for a good orator to have heard and seen much, to have gone <lb/>
            over many subjects in thought and reflection, and many also <lb/>
            in reading; though not so as to have taken possession of <lb/>
            them as his own property, but to have tasted of them as- <lb/>
            .things belonging to others. For I confess that the orator <lb/>
            should be a knowing man, not quite a tiro or novice in any <lb/>
            subject, not utterly ignorant or inexperienced in any business <lb/>
            of life.</p>

            because he was ignorant what anger was, whether ' a heat of <lb/>

            when he wished to stir up and inflame other passions in the <lb/>

            realities of life, say that such emotions ought to be but very <lb/>
            moderate and gentle. But the orator, by his eloquence, <lb/>
            represents all those things which, in the common affairs of <lb/>
            "life, are considered evil and troublesome, and to be avoided, <lb/>
            as heavier and more grievous than they really are; and at the <lb/>

            such subjects were to be illustrated in writing, imagined in <lb/>

          <p>LIII. " Accordingly, when I regarded these words of yours <lb/>
            as the divinest eloquence, Publius Rutilius Rufus,2 a man <lb/>
            of learning, and devoted to philosophy, observed that what <lb/>
            you had said was not only injudicious, but base and dis- <lb/>
            honourable. The same Rutilius used severely to censure <lb/>
            Servius Galba, whom he said he very well remembered, be-: <lb/>
            cause, when Lucius Scribonius brought an accusation against <lb/>
            him, and Marcus Cato, a bitter and implacable enemy to <lb/>
            Galba, had spoken with rancour and vehemence against him <lb/>
            before the assembled people of Rome, (in a speech which he <lb/>
            published in his Origines,3) Rutilius, I say, censured Galba, <lb/>
            for holding up, almost upon his shoulders, Quintus, the <lb/>
            orphan son of Caius Sulpicius Gallus, his near relation, that <lb/>
            he might, through the memory of his most illustrious father, <lb/>
            draw tears from the people, and for recommending two little <lb/>
            sons of his own to the guardianship of the public, and saying <lb/>
            that he himself (as if he was making his will in the ranks <lb/>
            before a battle,4 without balance or writing tables,5) appointed <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Paradox of Cicero on the words Omnes sapientes liberi, <lb/>

            the people of Rome protectors of their orphan condition. As <lb/>
            Galba, therefore, laboured under the ill-opinion and dislike <lb/>
            of the people, Rutilius said that he owed his deliverance to <lb/>
            such tragic tricks as these; and I see it is also recorded in <lb/>
            Cato's book, that if he had not employed children and tears, <lb/>
            he would have suffered. Such proceedings Rutilius severely <lb/>
            condemned, and said banishment, or even death, was more <lb/>
            eligible than such meanness. Nor did he merely say this, but. <lb/>
            thought and acted accordingly; for being a man, as you <lb/>
            know, of exemplary integrity, a man to whom no person in <lb/>
            the city was superior in honesty and sincerity, he not only <lb/>
            refused to supplicate his judges, but would not allow his <lb/>
            cause to be pleaded with more ornament or freedom of lan- <lb/>
            guage than the simple plainness of truth carried with it.' <lb/>
            Small was the part of it he assigned to Cotta here, his sister's <lb/>
            son, and a youth of great eloquence; and Quintus Mucius <lb/>
            also took some share in his defence, speaking in his usual <lb/>
            manner, without ostentation, but simply and with perspi- <lb/>
            cuity. But if you, Crassus, had then spoken,—you, who just <lb/>
            now said that the orator must seek assistance from those dis- <lb/>
            putations in which the philosophers indulge, to supply himself <lb/>
            with matter for his speeches,-if you had been at liberty to <lb/>
            speak for Publius Rutilius, not after the manner of philo- <lb/>
            sophers, but in your own way, although his accusers had <lb/>
            been, as they really were, abandoned and mischievous citizens, <lb/>
            and worthy of the severest punishment, yet the force of your <lb/>
            eloquence would have rooted all their unwarrantable cruelty <lb/>
            from the bottom of their hearts. But, as it was, a man of <lb/>
            such a character was lost, because his cause was pleaded in <lb/>
            such a manner as if the whole affair had been transacted in <lb/>
            the imaginary commonwealth of Plato. Not a single indi- <lb/>
            vidual uttered a groan; not one of the advocates gave vent <lb/>
            to an exclamation; no one showed any appearance of grief; <lb/>
            no one complained; no one supplicated, no one implored the <lb/>
            mercy of the public. In short, no one even stamped a foot <lb/>
            on the trial, for fear, I suppose, of renouncing the doctrine of <lb/>
            the Stoics.</p>

            illustrious Socrates of old, who, as he was a man of the <lb/>
            greatest wisdom and had lived in the utmost integrity, spoke <lb/>
            for himself, when on trial for his life, in such a manner as <lb/>
            not to seem a suppliant or prisoner, but the lord and master <lb/>
            of his judges. Even when Lysias. a most eloquent orator, <lb/>
            brought him a written speech, which, if he pleased, he might <lb/>
            learn by heart, and repeat at his trial, he willingly read it <lb/>
            over, and said it was written in a manner very well suited to <lb/>
            the occasion; but, said he, if you had brought me Sicyonian <lb/>
            shoes,1 I should not wear them, though they might be easy <lb/>
            and suit my feet, because they would be effeminate; so that <lb/>
            speech seems to me to be eloquent and becoming an orator, <lb/>
            but not fearless and manly. In consequence, he also was <lb/>
            condemned, not only by the first votes, by which the judges. <lb/>
            only decided whether they should acquit or condemn, but . <lb/>
            also by those which, in conformity with the laws, they were <lb/>
            obliged to give afterwards. For at Athens, if the accused <lb/>
            person was found guilty, and if his crime was not capital, <lb/>
            there was a sort of estimation of punishment; and when sen- <lb/>
            tence was to be finally given by the judges, the criminal was <lb/>
            asked what degree of punishment he acknowledged himself, <lb/>
            at most, to deserve; and when this question was put to <lb/>
            Socrates, he answered, that he deserved to be distinguished <lb/>
            with the noblest honours and rewards, and to be daily main- <lb/>
            tained at the public expense in the Prytaneum; an honour <lb/>
            which, amongst the Greeks, is accounted the very highest. <lb/>
            By which answer his judges were so exasperated, that they <lb/>
            condemned the most innocent of men to death. But had he <lb/>
            been acquitted, (which, indeed, though it is of no concern to <lb/>
            us, yet I could wish to have been the case, because of the <lb/>
            greatness of his genius,) how could we have patience with <lb/>
            those philosophers who now, though Socrates was condemned <lb/>
            for no other crime but want of skill in speaking, maintain <lb/>
            that the precepts of oratory should be learned from them- <lb/>
            selves, who are disciples of Socrates ? With these men I have <lb/>
            no dispute as to which of the two sciences is superior, or <lb/>
            carries more truth in it; I only say that the one is distinct <lb/>
            from the other, and that oratory may exist in the highest <lb/>
            perfection without philosophy. <note type="footnote"> 1 Shoes made at Sicyon, and worn only by the effeminate and luxu <lb/>

          <p>LV. " In bestowing such warm approbation on the civil law, <lb/>
            Crassus, I see what was your motive; when you were speak- <lb/>
            ing, I did not see it.1 In the first place, you were willing to <lb/>
            oblige Scævola, whom we ought all to esteem most deservedly <lb/>
            for his singularly excellent disposition; and seeing his science <lb/>
            undowried and unadorned, you have enriched it with your <lb/>
            eloquence as with a portion, and decorated it with a pro- <lb/>
            fusion of ornaments. In the next, as you had spent much <lb/>
            pains and labour in the acquisition of it, (since you had in <lb/>
            your own house one 2 who encouraged and instructed you in <lb/>
            that study,) you were afraid that you might lose the fruit of <lb/>
            your industry, if you did not magnify the science by your <lb/>
            eloquence. But I have no controversy with the science; let <lb/>
            it be of as much consequence as you represent it; for without <lb/>
            doubt it is of great and extensive concern, having relation to <lb/>
            multitudes of people, and has always been held in the highest <lb/>
            honour; and our most eminent citizens have ever been, and <lb/>
            are still, at the head of the profession of it; but take care, <lb/>
            Crassus, lest, while you strive to adorn the knowledge of <lb/>
            the civil law with new and foreign ornaments, you spoil <lb/>
            and denude her of what is granted and accorded to her as <lb/>
            her own. For if you were to say, that he who is a lawyer is <lb/>
            also an orator, and that he who is an orator is also a lawyer, <lb/>
            you would make two excellent branches of knowledge, each <lb/>
            equal to the other, and sharers of the same dignity; but now <lb/>
            you allow that a man may be a lawyer without the eloquence <lb/>
            which we are considering, and that there have been many <lb/>
            such; and you deny that a man can be an orator who has not <lb/>
            acquired a knowledge of law. Thus the lawyer is, of himself, <lb/>
            nothing with you but a sort of wary and acute legalist, an <lb/>
            instructor in actions,3 a repeater of forms, a catcher at sylla- <lb/>
            bles ; but because the orator has frequent occasion for the aid <lb/>
            of the law in his pleadings, you have of necessity joined legal <lb/>
            knowledge to eloquence as a handmaid and attendant. <note type="footnote"> 1 Turn, quum dicebas, non videbam. Many copies omit the negative <lb/>

          <p>LVI. " But as to your wonder at the effrontery of those <lb/>
            advocates who, though they were ignorant of small things, <lb/>
            profess great ones, or who ventured, in the management of <lb/>
            causes, to treat of the most important points in the civil law, <lb/>
            though they neither understood nor had ever learned them, the <lb/>
            defence on both charges is- easy and ready. For it is not at <lb/>
            all surprising that he who is ignorant in what form of words <lb/>
            a contract of marriage is made, should be able to defend the <lb/>
            cause of a woman who has formed such a contract; nor, <lb/>
            though the same skill in steering is requisite for a small <lb/>
            as for a large vessel, is he therefore, who is ignorant of <lb/>
            the form of words by which an estate is to be divided, in- <lb/>
            capable of pleading a cause relative to the division of an <lb/>
            estate.1 For though you appealed to causes of great conse- <lb/>
            quence, pleaded before the Centumviri, that turned upon <lb/>
            points of law, what cause was there amongst them all, which <lb/>
            could not have been ably pleaded by an eloquent man un- <lb/>
            acquainted with law? in all which causes, as in the cause of <lb/>
            Manius Curius, which was lately pleaded by you, 2 and that of <lb/>
            Caius Hostilius Mancinus,3 and that of the boy who was born <lb/>
            of a second wife, without any notice of divorce having been <lb/>
            sent to the first,4 there was the greatest disagreement among <lb/>
            the most skilful lawyers on points of law. I ask, then, how in <lb/>
            these causes a knowledge of the law could have aided the orator, <lb/>
            when that lawyer must have had the superiority, who was <lb/>
            supported, not by his own, but a foreign art, not by know- <note type="footnote">1 Herctum cieri—herciscundœ families. Co-heirs, when an estate de- <lb/>

            inheritance, and settle all the accounts which related to it. Just. Inst. <lb/>
            iii. 28. 4. The word herctum, says Festus, signifies whole or undivided, <lb/>
            and do, to divide; so, familiam herctam ciere was to divide the inherit- <lb/>
            ance of the family, which two words, herctum ciere, were afterwards <lb/>
            contracted into herciscere: hence this law-term used here, familiam <lb/>

            ledge of the law, but by eloquence? I have often heard that, <lb/>
            when Publius Crassus was a candidate for the ædileship, and <lb/>
            Servius Galba, though older than he, and even of consular <lb/>
            dignity, attended upon him to promote his interest, (having <lb/>
            betrothed Crassus's daughter to his son Caius,) there came a <lb/>
            countryman to Crassus to consult him on some matter of <lb/>
            law; and when he had taken Crassus aside, and laid the affair <lb/>
            before him, and received from him such an answer as was <lb/>
            rather right than suited to his wishes, Galba, seeing him look <lb/>
            dejected, called him by his name, and asked him on what <lb/>
            matter he had consulted Crassus; when, having heard his <lb/>
            case, and seeing the man in' great trouble, 1 I perceive,' said <lb/>
            he, ' that Crassus gave you an answer while his mind was <lb/>
            anxious, and pre-occupied with other affairs.' He then took <lb/>
            Crassus by the hand, and said, f Hark you, how came it into <lb/>
            your head to give this man such an answer ?' Crassus, who <lb/>
            was a man of great legal knowledge, confidently repeated that <lb/>
            the matter was exactly as he had stated in his answer, and <lb/>
            that there could be no doubt. But 'Galba, referring to a <lb/>
            variety and multiplicity of matters, adduced abundance of <lb/>
            similar cases, and used many arguments for equity against <lb/>
            the strict letter of law; while Crassus, as he could not main- <lb/>
            tain his ground in the debate, (for, though he was numbered <lb/>
            among the eloquent, he was. by no means equal to Galba,) had <lb/>
            recourse to authorities, and showed what he had asserted in <lb/>
            the books of his brother Publius Mucius,l and in the com- <lb/>
            mentaries of Sextus Ælius; though he allowed, at the same <lb/>
            time, that Galba's arguments had appeared to him plausible, <lb/>
            and almost true.</p>

            can be no doubt of the law relative to them, do not usually <lb/>
            come to be tried at all. Does any one claim an inheritance <lb/>
            under a will, which the father of a family made before he had <lb/>
            a son born? Nobody; because it is clear that by the birth <lb/>
            of a son the will is cancelled.2 Upon such points of law, <lb/>
            therefore, there are no questions to be tried. The orator, <lb/>
            accordingly, may be ignorant of all this part of the law <note type="footnote"> 1 The Crassus here mentioned was Publius Crassus Dives, brother of <lb/>

            relative to controversies,1 which is without doubt the far <lb/>
            greater part ; but on those points which are disputed, even <lb/>
            among the most skilful lawyers, it will not be difficult for <lb/>
            the orator to find some writer of authority on that side, <lb/>
            whichsoever it be, that he is to defend, from whom, when he <lb/>
            has received his javelins ready for throwing, he will hurl them <lb/>
            with the arm and strength of an orator. Unless we are to <lb/>
            suppose, indeed, (I would wish to make the observation with- <lb/>
            out offending this excellent man Scævola,) that you, Crassus, <lb/>
            defended the cause of Manius Curius out of the writings and <lb/>
            rules of your father-in-law. Did you not, on the contrary, <lb/>
            undertake the defence of equity, the support of wills, and <lb/>
            the intention of the dead ? Indeed, in my opinion, (for I was <lb/>
            frequently present and heard you,) you won the far greater <lb/>
            number of votes by your wit, humour, and happy raillery, <lb/>
            when you joked upon the extraordinary acuteness, and ex- <lb/>
            pressed admiration of the genius, of Scævola, who had <lb/>
            discovered that a man must be born before he can die; and <lb/>
            when you adduced many cases, both from the laws and decrees <lb/>
            of the senate, as well as from common life and intercourse, <lb/>
            not only acutely, but facetiously and sarcastically, in which, <lb/>
            if we attended to the letter, and not the spirit, nothing <lb/>
            would result. The trial, therefore, was attended with abun- <lb/>
            dance of mirth and pleasantry; but of what service your <lb/>
            knowledge of the civil law was to you upon it, I do not <lb/>
            understand; your great power in speaking, united with the <lb/>
            utmost humour and grace, certainly was of great service. <lb/>
            Even Mucius himself, the defender of the father's right, whc <lb/>
            fought as it were for his own patrimony, what argument did <lb/>
            he advance in the cause, when he spoke against you, that <lb/>
            appeared to be drawn from the civil law? What particular law <lb/>
            did he recite? What did he explain in his speech that was <lb/>
            unintelligible to the unlearned? The whole of his oration was <lb/>
            employed upon one point; that is, in maintaining that what <lb/>
            was written ought to be valid. But every boy is exercised <lb/>

            defended the will, you would have argued in such a manner, <lb/>
            that the entire validity of all wills whatsoever would have <lb/>
            seemed to depend upon that single trial; or, if you had pleaded <lb/>
            the cause of the soldier, you would have raised his father, <lb/>
            with your usual eloquence, from the dead; you would have <lb/>
            placed him before the eyes of the audience; he would have em- <lb/>
            braced his son, and with tears have recommended him to the <lb/>

            rewards are appointed for virtue, and punishments for vice; <lb/>

            one of us go over our farms, or inspect our country affairs, <lb/>
            for the sake of profit or delight at least?3 No man lives <lb/>

            ought to be adorned with variety of matter; but the things <lb/>
            which are absolutely necessary to an orator are numerous, <lb/>
            important, and difficult, so that if would not distract his indus- <lb/>

            deportment? Yet nobody would advise youths that are <lb/>
            studying oratory to labour in forming their attitudes like <lb/>
            players. What is so necessary to an orator as the voice? <lb/>
            Yet, by my recommendation, no student in eloquence will <lb/>
            be a, slave to his voice like the Greeks and tragedians,3 who <lb/>
            pass whole years in sedentary declamation, and daily, before <lb/>
            they venture upon delivery, raise their voice by degrees as <lb/>
            they sit, and, when they have finished pleading, sit down <lb/>
            again, and lower and recover it, as it were, through a scale, <lb/>
            from the highest to the deepest tone. If we should do this, <lb/>

            from learned men or from books. Those eminent Greek <lb/>
            orators, therefore, as they are unskilled in the law themselves, <lb/>
            have, in their causes, men acquainted with the law to assist <lb/>
            them, who are, as you before observed, called pragmatici. <lb/>
            In this respect our countrymen act far better, as they would <lb/>
            have the laws and judicial decisions supported by the autho- <lb/>
            rity of men of the highest rank. But the Greeks would not <lb/>
            have neglected, if they had thought it necessary, to instruct <lb/>
            the orator in the civil law, instead of allowing him a prag- <lb/>
            maticus for an assistant.</p>
          <p>LX. " As to your remark, that age is preserved from soli- <lb/>
            tude by the science of the civil law, we may perhaps also say <lb/>
            that it is preserved from solitude by a large fortune. But <lb/>
            we are inquiring, not what is advantageous to ourselves, but <lb/>
            what is necessary for the orator. Although (since we take.- <lb/>
            so many points of comparison with the orator from one sort <lb/>
            of artist) Roscius, whom we mentioned before, is accustomed <lb/>
            to say, that, as age advances upon him, he will make the. <lb/>
            measures of the flute-player slower, and the notes softer.. <lb/>
            But if he who is restricted to a certain modulation of <lb/>
            numbers and feet, meditates, notwithstanding, something for <lb/>
            his ease in the decline of life, how much more easily can we;. <lb/>
            I will not say lower our tones, but alter them entirely? For <lb/>
            it is no secret to you, Crassus, how many and how various <note type="footnote"> 1 Pœanem aut munionem. The word munionem is corrupt. Many <lb/>

            are the modes of speaking; a variety which I know not <lb/>
            whether you yourself have not been the first to exhibit to <lb/>
            us, since you have for some time spokon more softly and <lb/>
            gently than you used to do; nor is this mildness in your <lb/>
            eloquence, which carries so high authority with it, less ap- <lb/>
            proved than your former vast energy and exertion; and there <lb/>
            have been many orators, as we hear of Scipio and Lælius, <lb/>
            who always spoke in a tone only a little raised above that <lb/>
            of ordinary conversation, but never exerted their lungs or <lb/>
            throats like Servius Galba. But if you shall ever be unable <lb/>
            or unwilling to speak in this manner, are you afraid that <lb/>
            your house, the house of such a man and such a citizen,. <lb/>
            will, if it be not frequented by the litigious, be deserted by <lb/>
            the rest of mankind ? For my part, I am so far from having <lb/>
            any similar feeling with regard to my own house, that I not <lb/>
            only do not think that comfort for my old age is to be ex- <lb/>
            pected from a multitude of clients, but look for that solitude <lb/>
            which you dread, as for a safe harbour; for I esteem repose. <lb/>
            to be the most agreeable solace in the last stage of life.</p>
          <p>" Those other branches of knowledge (though they certainly <lb/>
            assist the orator)—I mean general history, and jurisprudence,, <lb/>
            and the course of things in old times, and variety of prece- <lb/>
            dents—I will, if ever I have occasion for them, borrow fron <lb/>
            my friend Longinus,l an excellent man, and one of the <lb/>
            greatest erudition in such matters. Nor will I dissuade <lb/>
            these youths from reading everything, hearing everything,. <lb/>
            and acquainting themselves with every liberal study, and all <lb/>
            polite learning, as you just now recommended; but, upon <lb/>
            my word, they do not seem likely to have too much time, if, <lb/>
            they are inclined to pursue and practise all that you, Crassus,. <lb/>
            have dictated; for you seemed to me to impose upon thein <lb/>
            youth obligations almost too severe, (though almost necessary <lb/>
            I admit, for the attainment of their desires,) since extemporary <lb/>
            exercises upon stated cases, and accurate and studied medi- <lb/>
            tations, and practice in writing, which you truly called the. <lb/>
            modeller and finisher of the art of speaking, are tasks of <lb/>

          <p>LXI. " But what you added was appalling, and indeed will <lb/>
            have, I fear, a greater tendency to deter than to encourage. <lb/>
            You would have every one of us a Roscius in our profession; <lb/>
            ;and you said that what was excellent did not so much attract <lb/>
            approbation, as what was faulty produced settled disgust; <lb/>
            but I do not think that want of perfection is so disparagingly <lb/>
            regarded in us as in the players; and I observe, accordingly, <lb/>
            that we are often heard with the utmost attention, even when <lb/>
            we are hoarse, for the interest of the subject itself and of the <lb/>
            cause detains the audience; while Æsopus, if he has the <lb/>
            least hoarseness, is hissed; for at those from whom nothing <lb/>
            is expected but to please the ear, offence is taken whenever <lb/>
            the least diminution of that pleasure occurs. But in elo- <lb/>
            quence there are many qualities that captivate; and, if they <lb/>
            are not all of the highest excellence, and yet most of them <lb/>
            are praiseworthy, those that are of the highest excellence <lb/>
            must necessarily excite admiration.</p>
          <p>" To return therefore to our first consideration, let the <lb/>
            orator be, as Crassus described him, one who can speak in a <lb/>
            manner adapted to persuade; and let him strictly devote <lb/>
            himself to those things which are of common practice in <lb/>
            civil communities, and in the forum, and, laying aside all <lb/>
            -other studies, however high and noble they may be, let him <lb/>
            apply himself day and night, if I may say so, to this one <lb/>
            pursuit, and imitate him to whom doubtless the highest <lb/>
            excellence in oratory is conceded, Demosthenes the Athenian, <lb/>
            in whom there is said to have been so much ardour and per- <lb/>
            -severance, that he overcame, first of all, the impediments of <lb/>
            nature by pains and diligence; and, though his voice was so <lb/>
            inarticulate that he was unable to pronounce the first letter <lb/>
            of the very art which he was so eager to acquire, he accom- <lb/>
            plished so much by practice that no one is thought to have <lb/>
            -spoken more distinctly; and though his breath was short, he <lb/>
            effected such improvement by holding it in while he spoke, <lb/>
            that in one -sequence of words (as his writings show) two <lb/>
            risings and two fallings of his voice were includcd ; 1 and he <note type="footnote">1 In one period or sentence he twice raised and twice lowered his <lb/>
            voice : he raised it in the former members of the period, and lowered <lb/>
            it in the latter; and this he did in one breath. Proust. This seems </note> <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXII.] </note> <lb/>
            also (as is related), after putting pebbles into his mouth, used <lb/>
            to pronounce several verses at the highest pitch of his voice: <lb/>
            without taking breath, not standing in one place, but walking <lb/>
            forward, and mounting a steep ascent. With such encou- <lb/>
            ragements as these, I sincerely agree with you,r Crassus, <lb/>
            that youths should be incited to study and industry; other, <lb/>
            accomplishments which you have collected from various and <lb/>
            distinct arts and sciences, though you have mastered them <lb/>
            all yourself, I regard as unconnected with the proper business <lb/>
            and duty of an orator." -</p>
          <p>LXII. When Antonius had concluded these observations, <lb/>
            Sulpicius and Cotta appeared to be in doubt whose discourse <lb/>
            of the two seemed to approach nearer to the truth. Crassus <lb/>
            then said, “You make our orator a mere mechanic, Antonius, <lb/>
            but I am not certain whether you are not really of another <lb/>
            opinion, and whether you are not practising upon us your <lb/>
            wonderful skill in refutation, in which no one was ever your <lb/>
            superior; a talent of which the exercise belongs properly to <lb/>
            orators, but has now become common among philosophers, <lb/>
            especially those who are accustomed to speak fully and <lb/>
            fluently on both sides of any question proposed. But I did <lb/>
            not think, especially in the hearing of these young men, that <lb/>
            merely such an orator was to be described by me; as would <lb/>
            pass his whole life in courts of justice, and would carry; <lb/>
            thither nothing more than the necessity of his causes re-, <lb/>
            quired; but I contemplated something greater, when I ex- <lb/>
            pressed my opinion that the orator, especially in such. a. <lb/>
            republic as ours, ought to be deficient in nothing that could <lb/>
            adorn his profession. But you, since you have circumscribed <lb/>
            the whole business of an orator within such narrow limits, will <lb/>
            explain to us with the less difficulty what you have settled <lb/>
            as to oratorical1 duties and rules; I think, however, that <lb/>
            this may be done to-morrow, for we have talked enough for <lb/>
            to-day. And Scævola, since he has appointed to go to his own <lb/>
            Tusculan seat,2 will now repose a little till the heat is abated; <note type="footnote"> not quite correct. Cicero appears to mean, that of the two members <lb/>

            then said, "Indeed, I could wish that I had not made an <lb/>
            appointment with Lælius to go to that part of the Tusculan <lb/>
            territory to-day. I would willingly hear Antonius;" and, as <lb/>
            he rose from his seat, he smiled and added, " for he did not <lb/>
            offend me so much when he pulled our civil law to pieces, as. <lb/>
            he amused me when he professed himself ignorant of it."</p>

          <p>IN this book Antonius gives instructions respecting invention in ora- <lb/>

            a part of invention, Caius Julius Caesar, who was called the most face-, <lb/>

          <p>I. THERE was, if you remember, brother Quintus, a strong <lb/>
            persuasion in us when we were boys, that Lucius Crassus had <lb/>
            acquired no more learning than he had been enabled to gain <lb/>
            from instruction in his youth, and that Marcus Antonius was <lb/>
            entirely destitute and ignorant of all erudition whatsoever; <lb/>
            and there were many who, though they did not believe that <lb/>
            such was really the case, yet, that they might more easily <lb/>
            deter us from the pursuit of learning, when we were inflamed <note type="footnote"> defends himself by the example of their " god Plato," as he calls him, <lb/>
            in his book De Republicâ ; where the scene being laid in the house of <lb/>
            an old gentleman, Cephalus, the old man, after bearing a part in the <lb/>
            first conversation, excuses himself, saying, that he must go to prayers, <lb/>
            and returns no more, Plato not thinking it suitable to his age to be de- <lb/>

            therefore, he says that he had used the same caution in the case of <lb/>
            Scævola; since it was not to be supposed that a person of his dignity, <lb/>
            extreme age, and infirm health, would spend several successive days in <lb/>
            another man's house: that the first day's dialogue related to his parti- <lb/>

            with a desire of attaining it, took a pleasure in reporting <lb/>
            what I have said of those orators; so that, if men of no <lb/>
            learning had acquired the greatest wisdom, and an incredible <lb/>
            degree of eloquence, all our industry might seem vain, and <lb/>
            the earnest perseverance of our father, one of the best and <lb/>
            most sensible of men, in educating us, might appear to be <lb/>
            folly. These reasoners we, as boys, used at that time to <lb/>
            refute with the aid of witnesses whom we had at home, our <lb/>
            father, Caius Aculeo our relative, and Lucius Cicero our uncle; <lb/>
            for our father, Aculeo (who married our mother's sister, and <lb/>
            whom Crassus esteemed the most of all his friends), and our <lb/>
            own uncle (who went with Antonius into Cilicia, and quitted <lb/>
            it at the same time with him), often told us many particulars <lb/>
            about Crassus, relative to his studies and learning; and as <lb/>
            we, with our cousins, Aculeo's sons, learned what Crassus <lb/>
            approved, and were instructed by the masters whom he <lb/>
            engaged, we had also frequent opportunities of observing <lb/>
            (since, though boys,1 we could understand this) that he spoke <lb/>
            Greek so well that he might have been thought not to know <lb/>
            any other language, and he put such questions to our masters, <lb/>
            and discoursed upon such subjects in his conversation with <lb/>
            them, that nothing appeared to be new or strange to him. <lb/>
            But with regard to Antonius, although we had frequently <lb/>
            heard from our uncle, a person of the greatest learning, how <lb/>
            he had devoted himself, both at Athens and at Rhodes, to the <lb/>
            conversation of the most learned men; yet I myself also, <lb/>
            when quite a youth, often asked him many questions on the <lb/>
            subject, as far as the bashfulness of my early years would <lb/>
            permit. What I am writing will certainly not be new to you, <lb/>
            (for at that very time you heard it from me,) namely, that <lb/>
            from many and various conversations, be appeared to me <lb/>
            neither ignorant nor unaccomplished in anything in those <lb/>
            branches of knowledge of which I could form any opinion. <lb/>
            But there was such peculiarity in each, that Crassus desired <lb/>
            not so much to be thought unlearned as to hold learning in <lb/>
            contempt, and to prefer, on every subject, the understanding <lb/>
            of our countrymen to that of the Greeks; while Antonius <lb/>
            thought that his oratory would be better received by the <lb/>
            Roman people, if he were believed to have had no learning at <note type="footnote">1 The words cùm essemus ejusmodi in this parenthesis, which alJ <lb/>
            commentators regard as corrupt. are <unclear>aft</unclear> untranslated. </note> <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            all; and thus the one imagined that he should have more <lb/>
            authority if he appeared to despise the Greeks, and the other <lb/>
            if he seemed to know nothing of them.</p>
          <p>But what their object was, is certainly nothing to our <lb/>
            present purpose. It is pertinent, however, to the treatise <lb/>
            which I have commenced, and to this portion of it, to remark <lb/>
            that no man could ever excel and reach eminence in eloquence, <lb/>
            without learning, not only the art of oratory, but every branch <lb/>
            of useful knowledge. II. For almost all other arts can sup- <lb/>
            port themselves independently, and by their own resources; <lb/>
            but to speak well, that is, to speak with learning, and skill, <lb/>
            and elegance, has no definite province within the limits of <lb/>
            which it is enclosed and restricted. Everything that can pos- <lb/>
            sibly fall under discussion among mankind, must be effectively <lb/>
            treated by him who professes that he can practise this art, or <lb/>
            he must relinquish all title to eloquence. For my own part, <lb/>
            therefore, though I confess that both in our own country and <lb/>
            in Greece itself, which always held this art in the highest <lb/>
            estimation, there have arisen many men of extraordinary <lb/>
            powers, and of the highest excellence in speaking,1 without <lb/>
            this absolute knowledge of everything; yet I affirm that such <lb/>
            a degree of eloquence as was in Crassus and Antonius, could <lb/>
            not exist without a knowledge of all subjects that contribute <lb/>
            to form that wisdom and that force of oratory which were seen <lb/>
            in them. On this account, I had the greater satisfaction in <lb/>
            committing to writing that dialogue which they formerly held <lb/>
            on these subjects; both that the notion which had always <lb/>
            prevailed, that the one had no great learning, and that the <lb/>
            other was wholly unlearned, might be eradicated, and that I <lb/>
            might preserve, in the records of literature, the opinions which <lb/>
            I thought divinely delivered by those consummate orators <lb/>
            concerning eloquence, if I could by any means learn and fully <lb/>
            register them; and also, indeed, that I might, as far as I <lb/>
            should be able, rescue their fame, now upon the decline, from <lb/>
            silence and oblivion. If they could have been known from <lb/>
            writings of their own, I should, perhaps, have thought it less <note type="footnote"> 1 Multos et ingeniis et magnd laude dicendi. This passage, as Ellendt <lb/>
            observes, is manifestly corrupt. He proposes ingeniis magnos et laude <lb/>

            necessary for me to be thus elaborate; but as one left but <lb/>
            little in writing, (at least, there is little extant,) and that he <lb/>
            wrote in his youth,1 the other almost nothing, I thought it <lb/>
            due from me to men of such genius, while we still retain <lb/>
            a lively remembrance of them, to render their fame, if I could, <lb/>
            imperishable. I enter upon this undertaking with the greater <lb/>
            hopes of effecting my object,2 because I am not writing of <lb/>
            the eloquence of Servius Galba or Caius Carbo, concerning <lb/>
            which I should be at liberty to invent whatever I pleased, as <lb/>
            no one now living could confute me; but I publish an account <lb/>
            to be read by those who have frequently heard the men them- <lb/>
            selves of whom I am speaking, that I may commend those <lb/>
            two illustrious men to such as have never seen either of <lb/>
            them, from the recollection, as a testimony, of those to whom <lb/>
            both those orators, were known, and who. are now alive and <lb/>
            present among us.</p>
          <p>III. Nor do I now aim at instructing you, dearest and best <lb/>
            of brothers, by means of rhetorical treatises, which you re- <lb/>
            gard as unpolished; (for what can be more refined or grace- <lb/>
            ful than your own language ?) but though, whether it be, as <lb/>
            you use to say, from judgment,. or, as Isocrates, the father <lb/>
            of eloquence, has written of himself, from a sort of bashful- <lb/>
            ness and, ingenuous timidity, that you have shrunk from <lb/>
            speaking in public, or whether, as you sometimes jocosely <lb/>
            remark, you thought, one orator sufficient, not only for one <lb/>
            family, but almost for a whole community, I yet think that <lb/>
            these books will not appear to you of that kind which may <lb/>
            deservedly be ridiculed on account of the deficiency in elegant <lb/>
            learning in those who have discussed the art of speaking; for <lb/>
            nothing seems to me to be wanting in the conversation of <lb/>
            Crassus and Antonius, that any one could imagine possible to <lb/>
            be known or understood by men of the greatest genius, the <lb/>
            keenest application, the most consummate learning, and the <lb/>
            utmost experience; as you will very easily be able to judge, <lb/>
            who have been pleased to acquire the knowledge and theory <lb/>
            of oratory through your own exertions, and to observe the <lb/>
            practice of it in mine. But that we may the sooner accom- <lb/>

            ordinary one, let us leave our exordium, and proceed to the <lb/>
            conversation and arguments of the characters whom I have <lb/>
            offered to your notice.</p>
          <p>The next day, then, after the former conversation had <lb/>
            taken place, about the second hour,1 while Crassus was yet in <lb/>
            bed, and Sulpicius sitting by him, and Antonius walking with <lb/>
            Cotta in the portico, on a sudden Quintus Catulus 2 the elder, <lb/>
            with his brother Caius Julius,3 arrived there; and when <lb/>
            Crassus heard of their coming, he arose in some haste, and <lb/>
            they were all in a state of wonder, suspecting that the occa- <lb/>
            sion of their arrival was of more than common importance. <lb/>
            The parties having greeted each other with most friendly <lb/>
            salutations, as their intimacy required, "What has brought <lb/>
            you hither at last?” said Crassus; "is it anything new?” <lb/>
            " Nothing, indeed," said Catulus; " for you know it is the <lb/>
            time of the public games. But (you may think us, if you <lb/>
            please," added he, " either foolish or impertinent) when Caesar <lb/>
            came yesterday in the evening to my Tusculan villa, from his <lb/>
            own, he told me that he had met Scævola going from hence; <lb/>
            from whom he said that he had heard a wonderful account, <lb/>
            namely, that you, whom I could never entice into such con- <lb/>
            versation, though I endeavoured to prevail on you in every <lb/>
            way, had held long dissertations with Antonius on eloquence, <lb/>
            and had disputed, as in the schools, almost in the manner of <lb/>
            the Greeks; and my brother, therefore, entreated me, not <lb/>
            being of myself, indeed, averse to hear you, but, at the same <lb/>
            time, afraid we might make a troublesome visit to you, to <lb/>
            come hither with him; for he said that Scævola had told <lb/>
            him that a great part of the discourse was postponed till <lb/>
            to-day. If you think we have acted too forwardly, you will <lb/>
            lay the blame upon Cæsar, if too familiarly, upon both of <lb/>
            us; for we are rejoiced to have come, if we do not give you <note type="footnote"> 1 The second hour of the morning, answering to our eight o'clock. </note><note type="footnote"> s The same that was consul with Cams Marius, when they obtained, <lb/>

            trouble by our visit.” IV. Crassus replied, “ Whatever object <lb/>
            had brought you hither, I should rejoice to see at my house <lb/>
            men for whom I ha a so much affection and friendship; but <lb/>
            yet, (to say the truth,) I had rather it had been any other <lb/>
            object than that which you mention. For I, (to speak as I <lb/>
            think,) was never less satisfied with myself than yesterday; <lb/>
            though this happened more through my own good nature <lb/>
            than any other fault of mine; for, while I complied with the <lb/>
            request of these youths, I forgot that I was an old man, <lb/>
            and did that which I had never done even when young; <lb/>
            I spoke on subjects that depended on a certain degree of <lb/>
            learning. But it has happened very fortunately for me, that as <lb/>
            my part is finished, you have come to hear Antonius." “ For <lb/>
            my part, Crassus," returned Cæsar, " I am indeed desirous <lb/>
            to hear you in that kind of fuller and continuous discussion, <lb/>
            yet so that, if I cannot have that happiness, I can be contented <lb/>
            with your ordinary conversation. I will therefore endeavour <lb/>
            that neither my friend Sulpicius, nor Cotta, may seem to <lb/>
            have more influence with you than myself; and will certainly <lb/>
            entreat you to show some of your good nature even to <lb/>
            Catulus and me. But if you are not so inclined, I will not <lb/>
            press you, nor cause you, while you are afraid of appearing <lb/>
            impertinent yourself, to think me impertinent." " Indeed, <lb/>
            Cæsar,” replied Crassus, " I have always thought of all Latin <lb/>
            words there was the greatest significance in that which you <lb/>
            have just used; for he whom we call impertinent, seems to me <lb/>
            to bear an appellation derived from not being pertinent; and <lb/>
            that appellation, according to our mode of speaking, is of <lb/>
            very extensive meaning; for whoever either does not discern <lb/>
            what occasion requires, or talks too much, or is ostentatious <lb/>
            of himself, or is forgetful either of the dignity or convenience <lb/>
            of those in whose presence he is, or is in any respect awkward <lb/>
            or presuming, is called impertinent. With this fault that <lb/>
            most learned nation of the Greeks abounds; and, conse- <lb/>
            quently, because the Greeks do not feel the influence of this <lb/>
            evil, they have not even found a name for the foible; for <lb/>
            though you make the most diligent inquiry, you will not find <lb/>
            out how the Greeks designate an impertinent person. But <lb/>
            of all their other impertinences, which are innumerable, I do <lb/>
            not know whether there be any greater than their custom of <lb/>
            raising the most subtile disputations on the most difficult or <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            unnecessary points, in whatever place, and before whatever <lb/>
            persons they think proper. This we were compelled to do by <lb/>
            these youths yesterday, though against our will, and though <lb/>
            we at first declined."</p>
          <p>V. " The Greeks, however, Crassus," rejoined Catulus, “ who <lb/>
            were eminent and illustrious in their respective states, as you <lb/>
            are, and as we all desire to be, in our own republic, bore no <lb/>
            resemblance to those Greeks who force themselves on our <lb/>
            ears; yet they did not in their leisure avoid this kind of dis- <lb/>
            course and disputation. And if they seem' to you, as they <lb/>
            ought to seem, impertinent, who have no regard to times, <lb/>
            places, or persons, does this place, I pray, seem ill adapted <lb/>
            to our purpose, in which the very portico where we are <lb/>
            walking, and this field of exercise, and the seats in so many <lb/>
            directions, revive in some degree the remembrance of the <lb/>
            Greek gymuasia and disputations? Or is the time unsea- <lb/>
            sonable, during so much leisure as is seldom afforded us, and <lb/>
            is now afforded at a season when it is most desirable 1 Or are <lb/>
            the company unsuited to this kind of discussion, when we <lb/>
            are all of such a character as to think that life is nothing <lb/>
            without these studies'?" "I contemplate all these things," <lb/>
            said Crassus, " in a quite different light; for I think that even <lb/>
            the Greeks themselves originally contrived their palæstræ, and <lb/>
            seats, and porticoes, for exercise and amusement, not for dis- <lb/>
            putation; since their gymnasia were invented many genera- <lb/>
            tions before the philosophers began to prate in them; and at <lb/>
            this very day, when the philosophers occupy all the gymnasia, <lb/>
            their audience would still rather hear the discus than a phi- <lb/>
            losopher ; and as soon as it begins to sound, they all desert <lb/>
            the philosopher in the middle of his discourse, though dis- <lb/>
            cussing matters of the utmost weight and consequence, to <lb/>
            anoint themselves for exercise; thus preferring the lightest <lb/>
            amusement to what the philosophers represent to be' of the <lb/>
            utmost utility. As to the leisure which you say we have, <lb/>
            I agree with you; but the enjoyment of leisure is not exertion <lb/>
            of mind, but relaxation. VI. I have often heard from my <lb/>
            father-in-law, in conversation, that his father-in-law Lælius <lb/>
            was almost always accustomed to go into the country with <lb/>
            Scipic, and that they used to grow incredibly boyish again <lb/>
            when they had escaped out of town, as if from a prison, into <lb/>
            the open fields. I scarcely dare to say it of such eminent <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin">C. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            persons, yet Scævola is in the habit of relating that they used <lb/>
            to gather shells and pebbles at Caieta and Laurentum, and to <lb/>
            descend to every sort of pastime and amusement. For such <lb/>
            is the case, that as we see birds form and build nests for the <lb/>
            sake of procreation and their own convenience, and, when <lb/>
            they have completed any part, fly abroad in freedom, dis- <lb/>
            engaged from their toils, in order to alleviate their anxiety; <lb/>
            so our minds, wearied with legal business and the labours of <lb/>
            the city, exult and long to flutter about, as it were, relieved <lb/>
            from care and solicitude. In what I said to Scævola, there- <lb/>
            fore, in pleading for Curius, I said only what I thought. <lb/>
            ‘ For if,' said I, ‘ Scævola, no will shall be properly made but <lb/>
            what is of your writing, all of us citizens will come to you <lb/>
            with our tablets, and you alone shall write all our wills ; but <lb/>
            then,' continued I,' when will you attend to public business ? <lb/>
            when to that of your friends ? when to your own ? when, in <lb/>
            a word, will you do nothing ?’ adding, ‘ for he does not seem <lb/>
            to me to be a free man, who does not sometimes do nothing;' <lb/>
            of which opinion, Catulus, I still continue; and, when I come <lb/>
            hither, the mere privilege of doing nothing, and of being <lb/>
            fairly idle, delights me. As to the third remark which you <lb/>
            added, that you are of such a disposition as to think life <lb/>
            insipid without these studies, that observation not only does <lb/>
            not encourage me to any discussion, but even deters me from <lb/>
            it. For as Caius Lucilius, a man of great learning and wit, <lb/>
            used to say, that what he wrote he would neither wish to have <lb/>
            read by the most illiterate persons, nor by those of the greatest <lb/>
            learning, since the one sort understood nothing, and the <lb/>
            other perhaps more than himself; to which purpose he also <lb/>
            wrote, I do not care to be read by Persius (for he was, as <lb/>
            we know, about the most learned of all our countrymen); <lb/>
            but I wish to be read by Lœlius Decimus (whom we also <lb/>
            knew, a man of worth and of some learning, but nothing to <lb/>
            Persius); so I, if I am now to discuss these studies of <lb/>
            ours, should not wish to do so before peasants, but much <lb/>
            less before you; for I had rather that my talk should not <lb/>
            be understood than be censured." <note type="footnote">1 In the speech which he made on behalf of Curius, on the occasion <lb/>

          <p>VII. " Indeed, Catulus," rejoined Cæsar, " I think I have <lb/>
            already gained some profit1 by coming hither; for these <lb/>
            reasons for declining a discussion have been to me a very <lb/>
            agreeable discussion. But why do we delay Antonius, whose <lb/>
            part is, I hear, to give a dissertation upon eloquence in <lb/>
            general, and for whom Cotta and Sulpicius have been some <lb/>
            time waiting?” "But I," interposed Crassus, "will neither <lb/>
            allow Antonius to speak a word, nor will I utter a syllable <lb/>
            myself, unless I first obtain one favour from you." " What <lb/>
            is it?" said Catulus. "That you spend the day here." Then, <lb/>
            while Catulus hesitated, because he had promised to go to his <lb/>
            brother's house, " I," said Julius, " will answer for both. We <lb/>
            will do so; and you would detain me even in case you were <lb/>
            not to say a single word." Here Catulus smiled, and said, <lb/>
            " My hesitation then is brought to an end; for I had left no <lb/>
            orders at home, and he, at whose house I was to have been, has <lb/>
            thus readily engaged us to you, without waiting for my assent."</p>
          <p>They then all turned their eyes upon Antonius, who cried <lb/>
            out, " Be attentive, I say, be attentive, for you shall hear <lb/>
            a man from the schools, a man from the professor's chair, <lb/>
            deeply versed in Greek learning ;2 and I shall on this account <lb/>
            speak with the greater confidence, that Catulus is added to <lb/>
            the audience, to whom not only we of the Latin tongue, but <lb/>
            even the Greeks themselves, are went to allow refinement <lb/>
            and elegance in the Greek language. But since the whole <lb/>
            process of speaking, whether it be an art or a business, can <lb/>
            be of no avail without the addition of assurance, I will <lb/>
            teach you, my scholars, that which I have not learned myself, <lb/>
            what I think of every kind of speaking." When they all <lb/>
            laughed, “ It is a matter that seems to me," proceeded he, <lb/>
            " to depend very greatly on talent, but only moderately on <lb/>
            art; for art lies in things which are known; but all the <lb/>
            pleading of an orator depends not on knowledge, but on <lb/>
            opinion; for we both address ourselves to those who are <lb/>
            ignorant, and speak of what we do not know ourselves; and <lb/>
            consequently our hearers think and judge differently at dif. <lb/>
            ferent times concerning the same subjects, and we often take <lb/>
            contrary sides, not only so that Crassus sometimes speaks <lb/>
            against me, or I against Crassus, when one of us must of <note type="footnote"> 1 Navâsse operam; that is, bene collocâsse. Ernesti. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ironically spoken. </note> <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin">C. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            necessity advance what is false; but even that each of us, at <lb/>
            different times, maintains different opinions on the same <lb/>
            question; when more than one of those opinions cannot pos- <lb/>
            sibly be right. I will speak, therefore, as on a subject which <lb/>
            is of a character to defend falsehood, which rarely arrives at <lb/>
            knowledge,1 and which is ready to take advantage of the <lb/>
            opinions and even errors of mankind, if you think that there <lb/>
            is still reason why you should listen to me."</p>
          <p>VIII. “ We think, indeed, that there is very great reason," <lb/>
            said Catulus, " and the more so, as you seem resolved to use <lb/>
            no ostentation; for you have commenced, not boastfully, but <lb/>
            rather, as you think, with truth, than with any fanciful <lb/>
            notion of the dignity of your subject." " As I have acknow- <lb/>
            ledged then," continued Antonius, " that it is not one of the <lb/>
            greatest of arts, so I allow, at the same time, that certain <lb/>
            artful directions may be given for moving the feelings and <lb/>
            gaining the favour of mankind. If any one thinks proper <lb/>
            to say that the knowledge how to do this is a great art, I <lb/>
            shall not contradict him; for as many speakers speak upon <lb/>
            causes in the forum without due consideration or method, <lb/>
            while others, from study, or a certain degree of practice, do <lb/>
            their business with more address, there is no doubt, that if <lb/>
            any one sets himself to observe what is the cause why some <lb/>
            speak better than others, he may discover that cause; and, <lb/>
            consequently, he who shall extend such observation over the <lb/>
            whole field of eloquence, will find in it, if not an art abso- <lb/>
            lutely, yet something resembling an art. And I could wish, <lb/>
            that as I seem to see matters as they occur in the forum, <lb/>
            and in pleadings, so I could now set them before you just as <lb/>
            they are conducted!</p>
          <p>" But I must consider my own powers. I now assert only <lb/>
            that of which I am convinced, that although oratory is not <lb/>
            an art, no excellence is superior to that of a consummate <lb/>
            orator. For to say nothing of the advantages of eloquence, <lb/>
            which has the highest influence in every well-ordered and <lb/>
            free state, there is such delight attendant on the very power <lb/>
            of eloquent speaking, that nothing more pleasing can be re- <lb/>
            ceived into the ears or understanding of man. What music <note type="footnote">1 Quoe ad scientiam non sæpe perveniat. Ellendt encloses these words <lb/>

            can be found more sweet than the pronunciation of a well- <lb/>

            structure of prose ? What actor has ever given greater plea- <lb/>

            nearer to perfection than a speech replete with every variety <lb/>
            of matter? for there is no subject susceptible of being treated <lb/>
            with elegance and effect, that may not fall under the province <lb/>
            of the orator. IX. It is his, in giving counsel on important <lb/>
            affairs, to deliver his opinion with clearness and dignity; it <lb/>
            is his to rouse a people when they are languid, and to calm <lb/>
            them when immoderately excited. By the same power of <lb/>
            language, the wickedness of mankind is brought to destruction, <lb/>
            and virtue to security. Who can exhort to virtue more <lb/>
            ardently than the orator? Who reclaim from vice with <lb/>
            greater energy? Who can reprove the bad with more aspe- <lb/>
            rity, or praise the good with better grace? Who can break <lb/>
            the force of unlawful desire by more effective reprehension? <lb/>
            Who can alleviate grief with more soothing consolation? <lb/>
            By what other voice, too, than that of the orator, is history, <lb/>
            the evidence of time, the light of truth, the life of memory, <lb/>
            the directress of life, the herald of antiquity, committed to <lb/>
            immortality? For if there be any other art, which professes <lb/>
            skill in inventing or selecting words; if any one, besides the. <lb/>
            orator, is said to form a discourse, and to vary and adorn it <lb/>
            with certain distinctions, as it were, of words and thoughts; <lb/>
            or if any method of argument, or expression of thought, or <lb/>
            distribution and arrangement of matter, is taught, except by <lb/>
            this one art, let us confess that either that, of which this art <lb/>
            makes profession, is foreign to it, or possessed in common <lb/>
            with some other art. But if such method and teaching be <lb/>
            confined to this alone, it is not, though professors of other <lb/>
            arts may have spoken well, the less on that account the pro- <lb/>
            perty of this art; but as an orator can speak best of all men <lb/>
            on subjects that belong to other arts, if he makes himself <lb/>
            acquainted with them, (as Crassus observed yesterday,) so the- <lb/>
            professors of other arts speak more eloquently on their own <lb/>
            subjects, if they have acquired any instruction from this art; <lb/>
            for if any person versed in agriculture has spoken or written <pb n="231"/>

            with eloquence on rural affairs, or a physician, as many have <lb/>
            done, on diseases, or a painter upon painting, his eloquence is <lb/>
            not on that account to be considered as belonging to any of. <lb/>
            those arts; although in eloquence, indeed, such is the force of <lb/>
            human genius, many men of every class and profession1 <lb/>
            attain some proficiency even without instruction; but though <lb/>
            you may judge what is peculiar to each art, when you have <lb/>
            observed what they severally teach, yet nothing can be more <lb/>
            certain than that all other arts can discharge their duties <lb/>
            without eloquence, but that an orator cannot even acquire <lb/>
            his name without it; so that other men, if they are eloquent, <lb/>
            borrow something from him; while he, if he is not supplied <lb/>
            from his own stores, cannot obtain the power of speaking <lb/>
            from any other art."</p>
          <p>X. Catulus then said, " Although, Antonius, the course of <lb/>
            your remarks ought by no means to be retarded by inter- <lb/>
            ruption, yet you will bear with me and grant me pardon; <lb/>
            for I cannot help crying out, as he in the Trinummus2 says, <lb/>
            so ably do you seem to me to have described the powers of <lb/>
            the orator, and so copiously to have extolled them, as the <lb/>
            eloquent man, indeed, must necessarily do; he must extol <lb/>
            eloquence best of all men; for to praise it he has to employ <lb/>
            the very eloquence which he praises. But proceed, for I <lb/>
            agree with you, that to speak eloquently is all your own; <lb/>
            and that, if any one does so on any other art, he employs an <lb/>
            accomplishment borrowed from something else, not peculiar <lb/>
            to him, or his own." " The night," added Crassus, " has made <lb/>
            you polite to us, Antonius, and humanized you; for in yes- <lb/>
            terday's address to us,3 you described the orator as a man <lb/>
            that can do only one thing, like a waterman or a porter, as <lb/>
            Cæcilius4 says; a fellow void of all learning and politeness." <lb/>
            "Why yesterday," rejoined Antonius, "I had made it my <lb/>
            object, if I refuted you, to take your scholars from you;5 <lb/>
            but now, as Catulus and Cæsar make part of the audience, <lb/>

            declare what I myself think. It follows then, that, as the <lb/>
            orator of whom we speak is to be placed in the forum, and <lb/>
            in the view of the public, we must consider what employ- <lb/>
            ment we are to give him, and to what duties we should wish <lb/>
            him to be appointed. For Crassus1 yesterday, when you, <lb/>
            Catulus and Cæsar, were not present, made, in a few words, <lb/>
            the same statement, in regard to the division of the art, that <lb/>
            most of the Greeks have made; not expressing what he <lb/>
            himself thought, but what was said by them; that there are <lb/>
            two principal sorts of questions about which eloquence is <lb/>
            employed; one indefinite, the other definite. He seemed to <lb/>
            me to call that indefinite in which the subject of inquiry is <lb/>
            general, as, Whether eloquence is desirable; whether honours <lb/>
            should be sought; and that definite in which there is an <lb/>
            inquiry with respect to particular persons, or any settled and <lb/>
            defined point; of which sort are the questions agitated in <lb/>
            the forum, and in the causes and disputes of private citizens. <lb/>
            These appear to me to consist either in judicial pleadings, or <lb/>
            in giving counsel; for that third kind, which was noticed by <lb/>
            Crassus, and which, I hear, Aristotle2 himself, who has fully <lb/>
            illustrated these subjects, added, is, though it be useful, less <lb/>
            necessary." "What kind do you mean?" said Catulus; "is it <lb/>
            panegyric? for I observe that that is introduced as a third kind."</p>
          <p>XI. "It is so," says Antonius; "and as to this kind of <lb/>
            oratory, I know that I myself, and all who were present, <lb/>
            were extremely delighted when your mother Popilias was <lb/>
            honoured with a panegyric by you; the first woman, I think, <lb/>
            to whom such honour was ever paid in this city. But it <lb/>
            does not seem to me that all subjects on which we speak are <lb/>
            to be included in art, and made subject to rules; for from <lb/>
            those fountains, whence all the ornaments of speech are <lb/>
            drawn, we may also take the ornaments of panegyric, without <lb/>
            requiring elementary instructions; for who is ignorant, <lb/>
            though no one teach him, what qualities are to be com- <lb/>
            mended in any person? For if we but look to those things <lb/>
            which Crassus has mentioned, in the beginning of the speech <lb/>
            which he delivered when censor in opposition to his col- <lb/>

            excelled; but that in whatever men could procure for them- <lb/>
            selves, he could not suffer himself to be excelled, he who would <lb/>
            pronounce the panegyric of any person, will understand that <lb/>
            he must expatiate on the blessings of fortune; and these are <lb/>
            advantages of birth, wealth, relationship, friends, resources, <lb/>
            health, beauty, strength, talent, and such other qualities as <lb/>
            are either personal, or dependent on circumstances; and, if <lb/>
            he possessed these, he must show that he made a proper use <lb/>
            of them; if. not, that he managed wisely without them; if <lb/>
            he lost them, that he bore the loss with resignation; he must <lb/>
            then state what he whom he praises did or suffered with <lb/>
            wisdom, or with liberality, or with fortitude, or with justice, <lb/>
            or with honour, or with piety, or with gratitude, or with <lb/>
            humanity, or, in a word, under the influence of any virtue. <lb/>
            These particulars, and whatever others are of similar kind, <lb/>
            he will easily observe who is inclined to praise any person; <lb/>
            and he who is inclined to blame him the contrary." “ Why <lb/>
            then do you hesitate," said Catulus, " to make' this a third <lb/>
            kind, since it is so in the nature of things? for if it is more <lb/>
            easy than others, it is not, on that account, to be excluded <lb/>
            from the number." " Because I am unwilling," replied <lb/>
            Antonius, " to treat of all that falls under the province of <lb/>
            an orator, as if nothing, however small it may be, could be <lb/>
            uttered without regard to stated rules. Evidence, for in- <lb/>
            stance, is often to be given, and sometimes with great exact- <lb/>
            ness, as I was obliged to give mine against Sextus Titius, a <lb/>
            seditious and turbulent member of the commonwealth ; when, <lb/>
            in delivering my evidence, I explained all the proceedings <lb/>
            of my consulate, in which I, on behalf of the commonwealth, <lb/>
            opposed him as tribune of the people, and exposed all that I <lb/>
            thought he had done contrary to the interest of the state; <lb/>
            I was detained long, I listened to much, I answered many <lb/>
            objections; but would you therefore wish, when you give <lb/>
            precepts on eloquence, to add any instructions on giving <lb/>
            evidence as a portion of the art of oratory 1"</p>
          <p>XII. "There is, indeed," said Catulus, "no necessity." "Or <lb/>

            chief, or to such a commander, or from the senate to any <lb/>
            king or people, does it appear to you that because, on such <lb/>
            subjects, we must use a more accurate sort of language than <lb/>
            ordinary, this kind of speaking should be counted as a <lb/>
            department of eloquence, and he furnished with peculiar <lb/>
            precepts ?” " By no means,” replied Catulus ; " for an <lb/>
            eloquent man, in speaking on subjects of that sort, will not <lb/>
            be at a loss for that talent which he has acquired by <lb/>
            practice on other matters and topics." " Those other kinds <lb/>
            of subjects, therefore," continued Antonius, " which often <lb/>
            require to be treated with eloquence, and which, as I said <lb/>
            just now, (when I was praising eloquence,) belong to the <lb/>
            orator, have neither any place in the division of the parts <lb/>
            of oratory, nor fall under any peculiar kind of rules, and yet <lb/>
            must be handled as eloquently as arguments in pleadings; <lb/>
            such are reproof, exhortation, consolation, all which demand <lb/>
            the finest graces of language; yet these matters need no <lb/>
            rules from art." "I am decidedly of that opinion," said <lb/>
            Catulus. " Well, then, to proceed," said Antonius, "what <lb/>
            sort of orator, or how great a master of language, do you think <lb/>
            it requires to write history ?" " If to write it as the <lb/>
            Greeks have written, a man of the highest powers," said <lb/>
            Catulus; " if as our own countrymen, there is no need of an <lb/>
            orator; it is sufficient for the writer to tell truth." " But," <lb/>
            rejoined Antonius, " that you may not despise those of our <lb/>
            own country, the Greeks themselves too wrote at first just <lb/>
            like our Cato, and Pictor, and Piso. For history was nothing <lb/>
            else but a compilation of annals; and accordingly, for the <lb/>
            sake of preserving the memory of public events, the pontifex <lb/>
            maximus used to commit to writing the occurrences of every <lb/>
            year, from the earliest period of Roman affairs to the time <lb/>
            of the pontifex Publius Mucius, and had them engrossed on <lb/>
            white tablets, which he set forth as a register in his own <lb/>
            house, so that all the people had liberty to inspect it; and <lb/>
            these records are yet called the Great Annals. This mode of <lb/>
            writing many have adopted, and, without any ornaments of <lb/>
            style, have left behind them simple chronicles of times, per- <lb/>
            sons, places, and events. Such, therefore, as were Pherecydes, <lb/>
            Hellanicus, Acusilas,1 and many others among the Greeks, <note type="footnote"> 1 Of these, Acusilas or Acusilaus, a native of Argos, was the moat <lb/>
            ancient, according to Suidas. Ellendt. The others are better known. </note> <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            are Cato, and Pictor, and Piso with us, who neither under- <lb/>
            stand how composition is to be adorned (for ornaments of <lb/>
            style have been but recently introduced among us), and, pro- <lb/>
            vided what they related can be understood, think brevity of <lb/>
            expression the only merit. Antipater,1 an excellent man, <lb/>
            the friend of Crassus, raised himself a little, and gave history <lb/>
            a higher tone ; the others were not embellishers of facts, but <lb/>
            mere narrators."</p>
          <p>XIII. "It is," rejoined Catulus, "as you say; but Anti- <lb/>
            pater himself neither diversified his narrative by variety of <lb/>
            thoughts, nor polished his style by an apt arrangement of <lb/>
            words, or a smooth and equal flow of language, but rough- <lb/>
            hewed it as he could, being a man of no learning, and not <lb/>
            extremely well qualified for an orator; yet he excelled, as <lb/>
            you say, his predecessors." " It is far from being wonderful,” <lb/>
            said Antonius, " if history has not yet made a figure in our <lb/>
            language ; for none of our countrymen study eloquence, un- <lb/>
            less that it may be displayed in causes and in the forum; <lb/>
            whereas among the Greeks, the most eloquent men, wholly <lb/>
            unconnected with public pleading, applied themselves as well <lb/>
            to other honourable studies as to writing history; for of <lb/>
            Herodotus himself, who first embellished this kind of writing, <lb/>
            we hear that he was never engaged in pleading; yet his <lb/>
            eloquence is so great as to delight me extremely, as far as I <lb/>
            can understand Greek writing. After him, in my opinion,. <lb/>
            Thucydides has certainly surpassed all historians in the art of <lb/>
            composition; for he is so abundant in matter, that he almost <lb/>
            equals the number of his words by the number of his thoughts; <lb/>
            and he is so happy and judicious in his expressions,2 that you <lb/>
            are at a loss to decide whether his facts are set off by his <lb/>
            style, or his style by his thoughts; and of him too we do not <lb/>
            hear, though he was engaged in public affairs, that he was of <lb/>
            the number of those who pleaded causes, and he is said <lb/>

            history, and, as I think, principally imitated Thucydides <lb/>
            But afterwards, two men of great genius, Theopompus and <lb/>
            Ephorus, coming from what we may call the noblest school of <lb/>
            rhetoric, applied themselves to history by the persuasion of <lb/>
            their master Isocrates, and never attended to pleading at all. <lb/>
            XIV. At last historians arose also among the philosophers; <lb/>
            first Xenophon, the follower of Socrates, and afterwards Calli- <lb/>
            sthenes, the pupil of Aristotle and companion of Alexander. <lb/>
            The latter wrote in an almost rhetorical manner; the former <lb/>
            used a milder strain of language, which has not the anima- <lb/>
            tion of oratory, but, though perhaps less energetic, is, as it <lb/>
            seems to me, much more pleasing. Timæus, the last of all <lb/>
            these, but, as far as I can judge, by far the most learned, <lb/>
            and abounding most with richness of matter and variety of <lb/>
            thought, and not unpolished in style, brought a large store of <lb/>
            eloquence to this kind of writing, but no experience in plead- <lb/>
            ing causes."</p>
          <p>WhenAntonius had spoken thus, "What is this, Catulus ?*’ <lb/>
            said Caesar. " Where are they who say that Antonius is igno- <lb/>
            rant of Greek ? how many historians has he named! and how <lb/>
            learnedly and judiciously has he spoken of each !” " On my <lb/>
            word," said Catulus, " while I wonder at this, I cease to won- <lb/>
            der at what I regarded with much greater wonder before, <lb/>
            namely, that he, being unacquainted with these matters, <lb/>
            should have such power as a speaker." " But, Catulus," said <lb/>
            Antonius," my custom is to read these books, and some others, <lb/>
            when I have leisure, not to hunt for anything that may <lb/>
            improve me in speaking, but for my own amusement. What <lb/>
            profit is there from it then ? I own that there is not much; <lb/>
            yet there is some: for as, when I walk in the sun, though <lb/>
            I may walk for another purpose, yet it naturally happens that <lb/>
            I gain a deeper colour; so when I have read those books <lb/>
            attentively at Misenum,2 (for at Rome I have scarcely oppor- <lb/>
            tunity to do so,) I can perceive that my language acquires <lb/>
            a complexion,' as it were, from my intercourse with them. <note type="footnote"> 1 He is called Pusillus Thucydides by Cicero, Ep. ad Q.

            <note type="margin">C. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            But, that you may not take what I say in too wide a sense, <lb/>
            I only understand such of the Greek writings as their authors <lb/>
            wished to be understood by the generality of people. If I ever <lb/>
            fall in with the philosophers, deluded by the titles to their <lb/>
            books, as they generally profess to be written on well-known <lb/>
            and plain subjects, as virtue, justice, probity, pleasure, I do not <lb/>
            understand a single word of them; so restricted are they to <lb/>
            close and exact disputations. The poets, as speaking in a <lb/>
            different language, I never attempt to touch at all; but amuse <lb/>
            myself, as I said, with those who have written history, or their <lb/>
            own speeches,1 or who have adopted such a style that they <lb/>
            seem to wish to be familiar to us who are not of the deepest <lb/>
            erudition. XV. But I return to my subject. Do you see <lb/>
            how far the study of history is the business of the orator? <lb/>
            I know not whether it is not his most important business, <lb/>
            for flow and variety of diction; yet I do not find it any- <lb/>
            where treated separately under the rules of the rhetoricians. <lb/>
            Indeed, all rules respecting it are obvious to common view; <lb/>
            for who is ignorant that it is the first law in writing history, <lb/>
            that the historian must not dare to tell any falsehood, and <lb/>
            the next, that he must be bold enough to tell the whole <lb/>
            truth? Also, that there must be no suspicion of partiality <lb/>
            in his writings, or of personal animosity? These fundamental <lb/>
            rules are doubtless universally known. The superstructure <lb/>
            depends on facts and style. The course of facts requires atten- <lb/>
            tion to order of time, and descriptions of countries; and since, <lb/>
            in great affairs, and such as are worthy of remembrance, first <lb/>
            the designs, then the actions, and afterwards the results, are <lb/>
            expected, it demands also that it should be shown, in regard <lb/>
            to the designs, what the writer approves, and that it should <lb/>
            be told, in regard to the actions, not only what was done or <lb/>
            said, but in what manner; and when the result is stated, that <lb/>
            all the causes contributing to it should be set forth, whether <lb/>
            arising from accident, wisdom, or temerity; and of the cha- <lb/>
            racters concerned, not only their acts, but, at least of those <note type="footnote"> that Cicero, when he wrote this, was thinking of a passage in Plato's <lb/>
            Letters, Ep. vii. p. 718, F. Greenwood. Orellius very judiciously in- <lb/>

            reading cantu, which, though Ellendt retains and attempts to defend it, <lb/>
            cannot be made to give any satisfactory sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero means orators. The speeches which historians have written <lb/>

            eminent in reputation and dignity, the life and marners of <lb/>
            each. The sort of language and character of style to be ob- <lb/>
            served must be regular and continuous, flowing with a kind <lb/>
            of equable smoothness, without the roughness of judicial <lb/>
            pleadings, and the sharp-pointed sentences used at the bar. <lb/>
            Concerning all these numerous and important points, there <lb/>
            are no rules, do you observe, to be found in the treatises of <lb/>
            the rhetoricians.</p>
          <p>" In the same silence have lain many other duties of the <lb/>
            orator; exhortation, consolation, precept, admonition, all of <lb/>
            which are subjects for the highest eloquence, and yet have <lb/>
            no place in those treatises on the art which are in circulation. <lb/>
            Under this head, too, there is an infinite field of matter; for <lb/>
            (as Crassus observed) most writers assign to the orator two <lb/>
            kinds of subjects on which he may speak; the one concerning <lb/>
            stated and defined questions, such as are treated in judicial <lb/>
            pleadings or political debates, to which he that will may add <lb/>
            panegyrics; the other, what all authors term, (though none <lb/>
            give any explanation,) questions unlimited in their kind, with- <lb/>
            out reference to time or person. When they speak of this sort <lb/>
            of subjects, they do not appear to know the nature and extent <lb/>
            of it; for if it is the business of an orator to be able to speak <lb/>
            on whatever subject is proposed without limitation, he will <lb/>
            have to speak on the magnitude of the sun, and on the shape <lb/>
            of the earth; nor will be able, when he has undertaken <lb/>
            such a task, to refuse to speak on mathematical and musical <lb/>
            subjects. In short, for him who professes it to be his business <lb/>
            to speak not only on those questions which are confined to <lb/>
            certain times and persons, (that is, on all judicial questions,) <lb/>
            but also on such as are unlimited in their kinds, there can be <lb/>
            no subject for oratory to which he can take exception.</p>
          <p>XVI. " But if we are disposed to assign to the orator that <lb/>
            sort of questions, also, which are undefined, unsettled, and of <lb/>
            extreme latitude, so as to suppose that he must speak of <lb/>
            good and evil, of things to be desired or avoided, honourable <lb/>
            or dishonourable, profitable or unprofitable; of virtue, justice, <lb/>
            temperance, prudence, magnanimity, liberality, piety, friend- <lb/>
            ship, fidelity, duty, and of other virtues and their opposite <lb/>
            vices, as well as on state affairs, on government, on military <lb/>
            matters, on civil polity, on morality; let us take upon us that <lb/>
            sort of subjects also, but so that it be circumscribed by mo- <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            derate limits. I think, indeed, that all matters relative <lb/>
            . to intercourse between fellow-citizens, and the transactions of <lb/>
            mankind in general, every thing that concerns habits of life, <lb/>
            administration of public affairs, civil society, the common <lb/>
            sense of mankind, the law of nature, and moral duties, falls <lb/>
            within the province of an orator, if not to such an extent <lb/>
            that he may answer on every subject separately, like the <lb/>
            philosophers, yet so at least that he may interweave them <lb/>
            judiciously into his pleadings; and may speak upon such <lb/>
            topics as those who established laws, statutes, and common- <lb/>
            wealths, have spoken upon them, with simplicity and perspi- <lb/>
            cuity, without any strict order of discussion, or jejune conten- <lb/>
            tion about words. That it may not seem wonderful that no <lb/>
            rules on so many topics of such importance are here laid <lb/>
            down by me, I give this as my reason : As, in other arts, <lb/>
            when the most difficult parts of each have been taught, other <lb/>
            particulars, as being easier, or similar, are not necessary to <lb/>
            be taught: for example, in painting, he who has learned to <lb/>
            paint the figure of a man, can paint one of any shape or <lb/>
            age without special instruction; and as there is no danger <lb/>
            that he who excels in painting a lion or a bull, will be unable <lb/>
            to succeed in painting other quadrupeds; (for there is indeed <lb/>
            no art whatever, in which everything capable of being effected <lb/>
            by it is taught by the master; but they who have learned <lb/>
            the general principles regarding the chief and fixed points, <lb/>
            accomplish the rest of themselves without any trouble;) so I <lb/>
            conceive that in oratory, whether it be an art, or an attain- <lb/>
            ment from practice only, he who has acquired such ability, that <lb/>
            he can, at his pleasure, influence the understandings of those <lb/>
            who listen to him with some power of deciding, on questions <lb/>
            concerning public matters, or his own private affairs, or con- <lb/>
            cerning those for or against whom he speaks, will, on every <lb/>
            other kind of oratorical subject, be no more at a loss what to <lb/>
            say than the famous Polycletus, when he formed his Hercules, <lb/>
            was at a loss how to execute the lion's skin, or the hydra, al- <lb/>
            though he had never been taught to form them separately."</p>
          <p>XVII. Catulus then observed, “ You seem to me, Anto- <lb/>
            nius, to have set clearly before us what he who designs to be <lb/>
            an orator ought to learn, and what he may assume from <lb/>
            that which he has learned without particular instruction; <lb/>
            for you have reduced his whole business to two kinds of <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            causes only, and have left particulars, which are innumerable, <lb/>
            to practice and comparison. But take care lest the hydra <lb/>
            and lion's skin be included in those two kinds, and the <lb/>
            Hercules, and other greater works be left among the matters <lb/>
            which you omit. For it does not seem to me to be less diffi- <lb/>
            cult to speak on the nature of things in general, than on the <lb/>
            causes of particular persons, and it seems even much more <lb/>
            difficult to discourse on the nature of the gods, than on mat- <lb/>
            ters that are litigated amongst men." " It is not so," replied <lb/>
            Antonius, "for to you, Catulus, I will speak, not so much <lb/>
            like a person of learning, as, what is more, one of experience. <lb/>
            To speak on all other subjects is, believe me, mere play to <lb/>
            a man who does not want parts or practice, and is not desti- <lb/>
            tute of common literature or polite instruction; but, in con- <lb/>
            tested causes, the business is of great difficulty; I know not <lb/>
            whether it be not the greatest by far of all human efforts, <lb/>
            where the abilities of the orator are, by the unlearned, esti- <lb/>
            mated according to the result and success; where an adver- <lb/>
            sary presents himself armed at all points, who is to be at <lb/>
            once attacked and repelled; where he, who is to decide the <lb/>
            question, is averse, or offended, or even friendly to your <lb/>
            adversary, and hostile to yourself; when he is either to bo <lb/>
            instructed or undeceived, restrained or incited, or managed <lb/>
            in every way, by force of argument, according to the cause <lb/>
            and occasion ; when his benevolence is often to be turned to <lb/>
            hostility, and his hostility to benevolence; when he is to be <lb/>
            moved, as by some machinery, to severity or to indulgence, to <lb/>
            sorrow or to merriment,—you must exert your whole power <lb/>
            of thought, and your whole force of language; with which <lb/>
            must be joined a delivery varied, energetic, full of life, full of <lb/>
            spirit, full of feeling, full of nature. If any one, in such efforts <lb/>
            as these, shall have mastered the art to such a degree, that, <lb/>
            like Phidias, he can make a statue of Minerva, he will, like <lb/>
            that great artist, find no difficulty in learning how to execute <lb/>
            the smaller figures upon the shield."</p>
          <p>XVIII. " The greater and more wonderful you repre- <lb/>
            sent such performances," said Catulus, " the greater longing <lb/>
            possesses me to know by what methods or precepts such <lb/>
            power in oratory may be acquired; not that it any longer <lb/>
            concerns me personally, (for my age does not stand in need of <lb/>
            it, and we use d to pursue a different plan of speaking, as we <pb n="241"/>
             <note type="margin">C. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            never extorted decisions from the judges by force of elo. <lb/>
            quence, but rather received them from their hands, after <lb/>
            conciliating their goodwill only so far as they themselves <lb/>
            would permit,) yet I wish to learn your thoughts, not for any <lb/>
            advantage to myself, as I say, but from a desire for know- <lb/>
            ledge. Nor have I occasion for any Greek master to repeat <lb/>
            his hackneyed precepts, when he himself never saw the forum, <lb/>
            or was present at a trial; presumption similar to what is <lb/>
            told of Phormio the peripatetic; for when Hannibal, driven <lb/>
            from Carthage, came to Ephesus as an exile to seek the pro- <lb/>
            tection of Antiochus, and, as his name was held in great <lb/>
            honour among all men, was invited by those who entertained <lb/>
            him to hear the philosopher whom I mentioned, if he were <lb/>
            inclined; and when he had signified that he was not unwilling, <lb/>
            that copious speaker is said to have harangued some hours <lb/>
            upon the duties of a general, and the whole military art; <lb/>
            and when the rest of the audience, who were extremely <lb/>
            delighted, inquired of Hannibal what he thought of the phi- <lb/>
            losopher, the Carthaginian is reported to have answered, not <lb/>
            in very good Greek, but with very good sense, that 'he had seen <lb/>
            many doting old men, but had never seen any one deeper in <lb/>
            his dotage than Phormio.' Nor did he say so, indeed, without <lb/>
            reason; for what could have been a greater proof of arro- <lb/>
            gance, or impertinent loquacity, than for a Greek, who had <lb/>
            never seen an enemy or a camp, or had the least concern <lb/>
            in any public employment, to deliver instructions on the <lb/>
            military art to Hannibal, who had contended so many years <lb/>
            for empire with the Romans, the conquerors of all nations ? <lb/>
            In this manner all those seem to me to act, who give rules on <lb/>
            the art of speaking; for they teach others that of which they <lb/>
            have no experience themselves. But they are perhaps less in <lb/>
            error in this respect, that they do not attempt to instruct you, <lb/>
            Catulus, as he did Hannibal, but boys only, or youths."</p>
          <p>XIX. "You are wrong, Catulus," said Antonius, "for I <lb/>
            myself have met with many Phormios. Who, indeed, is <lb/>
            there among, those Greeks that seems to think any of us un- <lb/>
            derstand anything 1 To me, however, they are not so very <lb/>
            troublesome; I easily bear with and endure them all; for <lb/>
            they either produce something which diverts me, or make <lb/>
            me repent less of not having learned from them. I dismiss <lb/>
            them less contumelionsly than Hannibal dismissed the philo- <pb n="242"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            sopher, and on that account, perhaps, have more trouble with <lb/>
            them; but certainly all their teaching, as far as I can judge, <lb/>
            is extremely ridiculous. For they divide the whole matter <lb/>
            of oratory into two parts; the controversy about the cause. <lb/>
            and about the question. The cause they call the matter <lb/>
            relating to the dispute or litigation affecting the persons con- <lb/>
            cerned ;1 the question, a matter of infinite doubt. Respecting <lb/>
            the cause they give some precepts; on the other part of <lb/>
            pleading they are wonderfully silent. They then make five- <lb/>
            parts, as it were, of oratory; to invent what you are to say, to- <lb/>
            arrange what you have invented, to clothe it in proper <lb/>
            language, then to commit it to memory, and at last to deliver <lb/>
            it with due action and elocution; a task, surely, requiring no <lb/>
            very abstruse study. For who would not understand without <lb/>
            assistance, that nobody can make a speech unless he has <lb/>
            settled what to say, and in what words, and in what order, <lb/>
            and remembers it ? Not that I find any fault with these <lb/>
            rules, but I say that they are obvious to all; as are likewise <lb/>
            those four, five, six, or even seven partitions, (since they are <lb/>
            differently divided by different teachers,) into which every <lb/>
            oration is by them distributed ; for they bid us adopt such <lb/>
            an exordium as to make the hearer favourable to us, and <lb/>
            willing to be informed and attentive; then to state our case <lb/>
            in such a manner, that the detail may be probable, clear, and <lb/>
            concise; next, to divide or propound the question; to confirm <lb/>
            what makes for us by arguments and reasoning, and refute <lb/>
            what makes for the adversary; after this some place the <lb/>
            conclusion of the speech, and peroration as it were; others <lb/>
            direct you, before you come to the peroration, to make a <lb/>
            digression by way of embellishment or amplification, then to <lb/>
            sum up and conclude. Nor do I altogether condemn these <lb/>
            divisions; for they are made with some nicety, though with- <lb/>
            out sufficient judgment, as must of necessity be the case <lb/>
            with men who had no experience in real pleading. For the <lb/>
            precepts which they confine to the exordium and statement <lb/>
            of facts are to be observed through the whole speech; since <lb/>
            I can more easily make a judge favourable to me in the pro- <lb/>
            gress of my speech, than when no part of the cause has been <note type="footnote"> .1 Reorum. This reading is very properly adopted by Orellius and <lb/>

            heard; and desirous of information, not when I promise that <lb/>
            I will prove something, but when I actually prove and <lb/>
            explain; and I can best make him attentive, not by the first <lb/>
            statement, but by working on his mind through the whole <lb/>
            course of the pleading. As to their direction that the state- <lb/>
            ment of facts should be probable, and clear, and concise, they <lb/>
            direct rightly; but in supposing that these qualities be- <lb/>
            long more peculiarly to the statement of facts than to the <lb/>
            whole of the speech, they seem to me to be greatly in error; <lb/>
            and their whole mistake lies assuredly in this, that they think <lb/>
            oratory an art or science, not unlike other sciences, such as <lb/>
            Crassus said yesterday might be formed from the civil law <lb/>
            itself; so that the general heads of the subject must first <lb/>
            be enumerated, when it is a fault if any head be omitted; <lb/>
            next, the particulars under each general head, when it is <lb/>
            a fault if any particular be either deficient or redundant; <lb/>
            then the definitions of all the terms, in which there ought to <lb/>
            be nothing either wanting or superfluous.</p>
          <p>XX. " But if the more learned can attain this exactness in <lb/>
            the civil law, as well as in other studies of a small or moderate <lb/>
            extent, the same cannot, I think, be done in an affair of this <lb/>
            compass and magnitude. If, however, any are of opinion <lb/>
            that it can be done, they must be introduced to those who <lb/>
            profess to teach these things as a science; they will find <lb/>
            everything ready set forth and complete; for there are books <lb/>
            without number on these subjects, neither concealed nor <lb/>
            obscure. But let them consider what they mean to do; <lb/>
            whether they will take up arms for sport or for real warfare; <lb/>
            for with us a regular engagement and field of battle require <lb/>
            one thing, the parade and school of exercise another. Yet <lb/>
            preparatory exercise in arms is of some use both to the gladi- <lb/>
            ator and the soldier; but it is a bold and ready mind, acute <lb/>
            and quick at expedients, that renders men invincible, and <lb/>
            certainly not less effectively if art be united with it.</p>
          <p>"I will now, therefore, form an orator for you, if I can; com- <lb/>
            mencing so as to ascertain, first of all, what he is able to do. <lb/>
            Let him have a tincture of learning; let him have heard and <lb/>
            read something; let him have received those very instruc <lb/>
            tions in rhetoric to which I have alluded. I will try what <lb/>
            becomes him; what he can accomplish with his voice, his <lb/>
            lungs, his breath, and his tongue. If I conceive that he may <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            reach the level of eminent speakers, I will not only exhort <lb/>
            him to persevere in labour, but, if he seem to me to be a <lb/>
            good man,1 will entreat him; so much honour to the whole <lb/>
            community do I think that there is in an excellent orator, <lb/>
            who is at the same time a good man. But if he shall <lb/>
            appear likely, after he has done his utmost in every way, to <lb/>
            be numbered only among tolerable speakers, I will allow him <lb/>
            to act as he pleases, and not be very troublesome to him. <lb/>
            But if he shall be altogether unfit for the profession, and <lb/>
            wanting in sense, I will advise him to make no attempts, or <lb/>
            to turn himself to some other pursuit. For neither is he, <lb/>
            who can do excellently, to be left destitute of encouragement <lb/>
            from us, nor is he, who can do some little, to be deterred; <lb/>
            because one seems to me to be the part of a sort of divinity; the <lb/>
            other, either to refrain from what you cannot do extremely <lb/>
            well, or to do what you can perform not contemptibly, is the <lb/>
            part of a reasonable human being ; but the conduct of the <lb/>
            third character, to declaim, in spite of decency and natural <lb/>
            deficiency, is that of a man who, as you said, Catulus, of a <lb/>
            certain harauguer, collects as many witnesses as possible of his <lb/>
            folly by a proclamation from himself. Of him then, who <lb/>
            shall prove such as to merit our exhortation and encourage- <lb/>
            ment, let me so speak as to communicate to him only what <lb/>
            experience has taught myself, that, under my guidance, he <lb/>
            may arrive at that point which I have reached without any <lb/>
            guide ; for I can give him no better instructions.</p>
          <p>XXI. "To commence, then, Catulus, by taking an example <lb/>
            from our friend Sulpicius here; I first heard him, when he was <lb/>
            but a youth, in a cause of small importance; he was possessed <lb/>
            of a voice, figure, deportment, and other qualifications suited <lb/>
            for the profession which we are considering. His mode of <lb/>
            speaking was quick and hurried, which was owing to his <lb/>
            genius; his style animated and somewhat too redundant, <lb/>
            which was owing to his youth. I was very far from enter- <note type="footnote"> 1 Cato defined an orator vir bonus dicendi peritus. Cicero in this <lb/>
            passage, under the character of Antonius, and in his own person, De <lb/>
            Inv. i. 3, 4, signifies that though he thinks a good character of great <lb/>
            importance in an orator, he does not deny that much eloquence may at <lb/>
            times be found in a man of bad character. Cato and Cicero spoke each <lb/>
            according to the character of his own age. Quintilian, xii. 1, goes back <lb/>
            to the opinion of Cato. Aristotle had previously required good morals <lb/>
            in an orator, Rhet. i. 2, A ii 1, 5. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="245"/>

            taming a slight opinion of him, since I like fertility to show <lb/>
            itself in a young man; for, as in vines, those branches which <lb/>
            have spread too luxuriantly are more easily pruned than new <lb/>
            shoots are produced by culture if the stem is defective ; so I <lb/>
            would wish there to be that in a youth from which I may <lb/>
            take something away. The sap cannot be enduring in that <lb/>
            which attains maturity too soon. I immediately saw his <lb/>
            ability; nor did I lose any time, but exhorted him to consider <lb/>
            the forum as his school for improving himself, and to choose <lb/>
            whom he pleased for a master; if he would take my advice, <lb/>
            Lucius Crassus. To this advice he eagerly listened, and assured <lb/>
            me that he would act accordingly; and added also, as a compli- <lb/>
            ment, that I too should be a master to him. Scarce a year <lb/>
            had passed from the time of this conversation and recom- <lb/>
            mendation of mine, when he accused Caius Norbanus, and I <lb/>
            defended him. It is incredible what a difference there appeared <lb/>
            to me between him as he was then and as he had been a year <lb/>
            before; nature herself led him irresistibly into the magnificent <lb/>
            and noble style of Crassus; but he could never have arrived <lb/>
            at a satisfactory degree of excellence in it, if he had not <lb/>
            directed his efforts, by study and imitation, in the same <lb/>
            course in which nature led him, so as intently to contemplate <lb/>
            Crassus with his whole mind and faculties.</p>
          <p>XXII. " Let this, then, be the first of my precepts, to <lb/>
            point out to the student whom he should imitate, and in such <lb/>
            a manner that he may most carefully copy the chief excellen- <lb/>
            cies of him whom he takes for his model. Let practice then <lb/>
            follow, by which he may represent in his imitation the exact <lb/>
            resemblance of him whom he chose as his pattern; not as <lb/>
            I have known many imitators do, who endeavour to acquire <lb/>
            by imitation what is easy, or what is remarkable, or almost <lb/>
            faulty; for nothing is easier than to imitate any person's <lb/>
            dress, or attitude, or carriage; or if there is anything offensive <lb/>
            in a character, it is no very difficult matter to adopt it, and be <lb/>
            offensive in the same way; in like manner as that Fusius, who <lb/>
            even now, though he has lost his voice, rants on public topics, <lb/>
            could never attain that nervous style of speaking which Caius <lb/>
            Fimbria had, though he succeeds in imitating his distortion of <lb/>
            features and broad pronunciation; but he neither knew how to <lb/>
            choose a pattern whom he would chiefly resemble, and in him <note type="footnote"> 1 See c. 47. </note> <pb n="246"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            that he did choose, he preferred copying the blemishes. But he <lb/>
            who shall act as he ought, must first of all be very careful in <lb/>
            making this choice, and must use the utmost diligence to <lb/>
            attain the chief excellencies of him whom he has approved.</p>
          <p>" What, let me ask, do you conceive to be the reason why <lb/>
            almost every age has produced a peculiar style of speaking ? <lb/>
            a matter on which we cannot so easily form a judgment in <lb/>
            regard to the orators of our own country, (because they <lb/>
            have, to say the truth, left but few writings from which such <lb/>
            judgment might be formed,) as those of the Greeks, from <lb/>
            whose writings it may be understood what was the character <lb/>
            and tendency of eloquence in each particular age. The most <lb/>
            ancient, of whom there are any works extant, are Pericles1 <lb/>
            and Alcibiades,2 and, in the same age, Thucydides, writers <lb/>
            perspicacious, pointed, concise, abounding more in thoughts <lb/>
            than in words. It could not possibly have happened that <lb/>
            they should all have the same character, unless they had pro- <lb/>
            posed to themselves some one example for imitation. These <lb/>
            were followed in order of time by Critias, Theramenes, and <lb/>
            Lysias. There are extant many writings of Lysias, some of <lb/>
            Critias;3 of Theramenes4 we only hear. They all still re- <lb/>
            tained the vigorous style of Pericles, but had somewhat more <lb/>
            exuberance. Then behold Isocrates arose, from whose school,5 <note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero, Brut. c. 7, says that some compositions were in circulation <lb/>
            under the name of Pericles; and Quintilian, iii. 1, 12, looking to that <lb/>
            observation of Cicero, tacitly assents to those who denied the genuine- <lb/>
            ness of those compositions. See also Quint, x. 2, 22; 10, 49. Ellendt. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That Alcibiades left nothing in writing, though he had great repu- <lb/>

            although they were dissimilar in abilities one to another, <lb/>
            yet were all engaged in imitating the same kind of natural <lb/>
            excellence ; and as long as the imitation of their manner <lb/>
            lasted, so long did that character and system of eloquence <lb/>
            prevail. Afterwards, when these were dead, and all recollec- <lb/>
            tion of them grew gradually obscure, and at last vanished, <lb/>
            more lax and remiss modes of speaking prevailed. Subse- <lb/>

            polished of all that class, in my opinion, and others of like <lb/>
            talents, arose; and if we choose to pursue the list down to <lb/>
            the present times, we shall understand, that, as at this day <lb/>
            .all Asia imitates the famous Menecles of Alabanda, and his <lb/>
            brother Hierocles, to both of whom we have listened, so there <lb/>

            let him endeavour to acquire it by frequent and laborious <lb/>
            exercise, and especially by composition; and if our friend <lb/>

            precept for him shall be, That whatever causes he undertakes <lb/>
            to plead, he must acquire a minute and thorough knowledge <lb/>
            of them. This is not a precept laid down in the schools; for <lb/>
            easy causes are given to boys. ‘ The law forbids a stranger <lb/>
            to ascend the wall; he ascends it; he beats back the enemy; <lb/>
            he is accused.' It is no trouble to understand such a cause <lb/>
            as this. They are right, therefore, in giving no precepts about <lb/>
            learning the cause ;for such is generally the form of causes in <lb/>
            the schools. But in the forum, wills, evidence, contracts, <lb/>
            covenants, stipulations, relationship by blood, by affinity, <lb/>
            decrees, opinions of lawyers, and eveu the lives and characters <lb/>
            of those concerned in the cause, are all to be investigated; <lb/>
            and by negligence in these particulars we see many causes <lb/>
            lost, especially those relative to private concerns, as they are <lb/>
            often of greater intricacy. Thus some, while they would <lb/>
            have their business thought very extensive, that they may <lb/>
            seem to fly about the whole forum, and to go from one cause <lb/>
            to another, speak upon causes which they have not mastered, <lb/>
            whence they incur much censure; censure for negligence, if <lb/>
            they voluntarily undertake the business, or for perfidiousness, <lb/>
            if they undertake it under any engagement ;1 but such censure <lb/>
            is assuredly of worse consequence than they imagine, since <lb/>
            nobody can possibly speak on a subject which he does not <lb/>
            understand, otherwise than to his own disgrace; and thus, <lb/>
            while they despise the imputation of ignorance, which is in <lb/>
            reality the greater fault, they incur that of stupidity also, <lb/>
            which they more anxiously avoid.</p>
          <p>" It is my custom to use my endeavour, that every one of <lb/>
            my clients may give me instructions in his own affairs him- <lb/>
            self, and that nobody else be present, so that he may speak <lb/>
            with the greater freedom.2 I am accustomed also to plead to <lb/>
            him the cause of his adversary, in order to engage him to <lb/>
            plead his own, and state boldly what he thinks of his own <lb/>
            case. When he is gone, I conceive myself in three characters, <note type="footnote"> 1 Magna offensio vel negligentiæ, susceptis rebus, vel perfidies, receptis. <lb/>

            ever circumstance is such as to promise more support or as- <lb/>
            sistance than obstruction, I resolve to speak upon it; where. <lb/>
            ever I find more harm than good, I set aside and totally <lb/>
            reject that part entirely; and thus I gain this advantage, <lb/>
            that I consider at one time what I shall say, and say it at <lb/>
            another; two things which most speakers, relying upon <lb/>
            their genius, do at one and the same time; but certainly <lb/>
            those very persons would speak considerably better, if they <lb/>
            would but resolve to take one time for premeditation, and <lb/>
            another for speaking.</p>
          <p>" When I have acquired a thorough understanding of the <lb/>
            business and the cause, it immediately becomes my con- <lb/>
            sideration what ground there may be for doubt. For of all <lb/>
            points that are disputed among mankind, whether the case is <lb/>
            of a criminal nature, as concerning an act of violence; or <lb/>
            -controversial, as concerning an inheritance; or deliberative, <lb/>
            as on going to war; or personal, as in panegyric; or argu- <lb/>
            mentative, as on modes of life; there is nothing in which <lb/>
            the inquiry is not either what has been done, or is being <lb/>
            done, or will be done, or of what nature a thing is, or how it <lb/>
            -should be designated.</p>
          <p>XXV. " Our causes, such at least as concern criminal <lb/>
            matters, are generally defended by the plea of not guilty; for <lb/>
            in charges of extortion of money, which are the most im- <lb/>
            portant, the facts are almost all to be denied; and in those of <lb/>
            bribery to procure offices, it is seldom in our power to distin- <lb/>
            guish munificence and liberality from corruption and criminal <lb/>
            largess. In accusations of stabbing, or poisoning, or embezzle- <lb/>
            ment of the public money, we necessarily deny the charge. <lb/>
            On trials, therefore, the first kind of causes is that which <lb/>
            arises from dispute as to the fact. In deliberations, the dis- <lb/>
            cussion generally springs from a question as to what is to be <lb/>
            -done, rarely about anything present or already done. But <lb/>
            oftentimes the question is not whether a thing is a fact or not, <lb/>
            but of what nature it is; as when the consul, Caius Carbo, in <lb/>
            my hearing, defended the cause of Opimius before the people, <lb/>
            he denied no circumstance of the death of Caius Gracchus, but <lb/>
            maintained that it was a lawful act for the good of his country; <lb/>
            or, as when Publius Africanus replied to the same Carbo, <lb/>
            (then tribune of the people, engaging in political affairs with <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"><unclear>C</unclear>. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            very different views,1 and asking a question about the death of <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus,) 'that he seemed to have been lawfully put <lb/>
            to-death.' But every thing may be asserted to have been done <lb/>
            lawfully, which is of such a kind that it may be said that it <lb/>
            ought to have been done, or was properly or necessarily done, <lb/>
            or done unawares, or by accident. Then the question, 'what <lb/>
            a thing should be called,' arises when there is a dispute by <lb/>
            what term an act should be designated; as was the great <lb/>
            point of dispute between myself and our friend Sulpicius in <lb/>
            Norbanus's cause; for though I admitted most of the charges <lb/>
            made by him on the other side, I still denied that treason <lb/>
            had been committed by Norbanus; on the signification of <lb/>
            which word, by the Apuleian law,2 the whole cause depended. <lb/>
            And in this species of causes some lay it down as a rule, that <lb/>
            both parties should define clearly and briefly the term that <lb/>
            gives rise to the question. This seems to me extremely <lb/>
            puerile ; for it is quite a different thing from defining words, <lb/>
            when any dispute arises among the learned about matters <lb/>
            relating to science; as when it is inquired, what is an art, <lb/>
            what is a law, what is a state? On which occasions reason and <lb/>
            learning direct, that the whole force of the thing which you <lb/>
            define should be expressed in such a manner that there be <lb/>
            nothing omitted or superfluous; but this neither Sulpicius did <lb/>
            in that cause, nor did I attempt to do it; for each of us, to the <lb/>
            best of our abilities, enlarged with the utmost copiousness of <lb/>
            language upon what it was to commit treason. Since, in the <lb/>
            first place, a definition, if one word is objectionable, or may be <lb/>
            added or taken away, is often wrested out of our hands; and <lb/>
            in the next, the very practice itself savours of school learning <lb/>
            and almost puerile exercise; and besides, it cannot penetrate <lb/>
            into the mind and understanding of the judge, for it glides <lb/>
            off before it has made any impression.</p>
          <p>XXVI. " But in that kind of causes in which it is disputed <lb/>
            of what nature any thing is, the contest often arises from <lb/>
            the interpretation of writing; when there can be no contro- <lb/>
            versy but about something that is doubtful. For even the <lb/>
            case, in which the written letter differs from the intention, <note type="footnote"> 1 Because he was then attached to the party of the Gracchi. Prom!. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A law of Lucius Apuleius Satuminus, tribune of the people, A.U.C. <lb/>

            of it is at all known. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="252"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            involves a speeds of doubt, which is cleared up when the <lb/>
            words which are wanting are supplied; and such addition <lb/>
            being made, it is maintained that the intention of the writ- <lb/>
            ing was clear; and if any doubt arises from contradictory <lb/>
            writings, it is not a new kind of controversy that arises, <lb/>
            but a cause of the former sort is doubled ;1 and this can <lb/>
            either never be determined, or must be so determined, <lb/>
            that by supplying the omitted words, the writing which <lb/>
            we defend, whichsoever of the two it is, may be rendered <lb/>
            complete. Thus, of those causes which arise from a contro- <lb/>
            versy about a writing, when anything is expressed ambi- <lb/>
            guously, there exists but one kind. But as there are many <lb/>
            sorts of ambiguities, (which they who are called logicians <lb/>
            seem to me to understand better than other men; while <lb/>
            those of our profession, who ought to know them full as well, <lb/>
            seem to be ignorant of them,) so that is the most frequent <lb/>
            in occurrence, either in discourse or writing, when a question <lb/>
            arises from a word or words being left out. They make <lb/>
            another mistake when they distinguish this kind of causes, <lb/>
            which consist in the interpretation of writing, from those in <lb/>
            which it is disputed of what nature a thing is; for there is <lb/>
            nowhere so much dispute respecting the exact nature of a <lb/>
            thing as in regard to writing, which is totally separated from <lb/>
            controversy concerning fact. There are in all, therefore, three <lb/>
            sorts of matters, which may possibly fall under doubt and <lb/>
            discussion; what is now done, what has been done, or what <lb/>
            is to be done; what the nature of a thing is, or how it <lb/>
            should be designated; for as to the question which some <lb/>
            Greeks add, whether a thing be rightly done, it is wholly <lb/>
            included in the inquiry, what the nature of the thing is.</p>
          <p>XXVII. " But to return to my own method. When, after <lb/>
            hearing and understanding the nature of a cause, I proceed <lb/>
            to examine the subject matter of it, I settle nothing until I <lb/>
            have ascertained to what point my whole speech, bearing <lb/>
            immediately on the question and case, must be directed. I <lb/>
            then very diligently consider two other points; the one, how <lb/>
            to recommend myself, or those for whom I plead ; the other, <lb/>
            how to sway the minds of those before whom I speak to that <note type="footnote"> 1 Superioris generis causa duplicator. Ellendt explains these words <lb/>
            thus : "in the same cause, the allegations of the two parties are judged <lb/>
            as two separate questions of the same kind." </note> <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXVII.] </note> <lb/>
            which I desire. Thus the whole business of speaking rests <lb/>
            upon three things for success in persuasion; that we prove <lb/>
            what we maintain to be true; that we conciliate those who <lb/>
            hear; that we produce in their minds whatever feeling our <lb/>
            cause may require. For the purpose of proof, two kinds of <lb/>
            matter present themselves to the orator; one, consisting of <lb/>
            such things as are not invented by him, but, as appertaining <lb/>
            to the cause, are judiciously treated by him, as deeds, testi- <lb/>
            monies, covenants, contracts, examinations, laws, acts of the <lb/>
            senate, precedents, decrees, opinions of lawyers, and whatever <lb/>
            else is not found out by the orator, but brought under his <lb/>
            notice by the cause and by his clients; the other, consist- <lb/>
            ing entirely in the orator's own reasoning and arguments: <lb/>
            so that, as to the former head, he has only to handle the <lb/>
            arguments with which he is furnished; as to the latter, to <lb/>
            invent arguments likewise. Those who profess to teach elo- <lb/>
            quence, after dividing causes into several kinds, suggest <lb/>
            a number of arguments for each kind; which method, though <lb/>
            it may be better adapted to the instruction of youth, in order <lb/>
            that when a case is proposed to them they may have some- <lb/>
            thing to which they may refer, and from whence they may <lb/>
            draw forth arguments ready prepared; yet it shows a slow- <lb/>
            ness of mind to pursue the rivulets, instead of seeking for <lb/>
            the fountain-head; and it becomes our age and experience <lb/>
            to derive what we want to know from the source, and to ascer- <lb/>
            tain the spring from which everything proceeds.</p>
          <p>" But that first kind of matters which are brought before <lb/>
            the orator, ought to be the constant subject of our contem- <lb/>
            plation for general practice in affairs of that nature. For in <lb/>
            support of deeds and against them, for and against evidence, <lb/>
            for and against examinations by torture, and in other sub- <lb/>
            jects of that sort, we usually speak either of each kind in <lb/>
            general and abstractedly, or as confined to particular occa- <lb/>
            sions, persons, and causes ; and such common-places (I speak <lb/>
            to you, Cotta and Sulpicius) you ought to keep ready and <lb/>
            prepared with much study and meditation. It would occupy <lb/>
            too much time at present to show by what means we should <lb/>
            confirm or invalidate testimony, deeds, and examinations. <lb/>
            These matters are all to be attained with a moderate share <lb/>
            of capacity, though with very great practice; and they <lb/>
            require art and instruction only so far, as they should be <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            illustrated with certain embellishments of language. So also <lb/>
            those which are of the other kind, and which proceed wholly <lb/>
            from the orator, are not difficult of invention, but require <lb/>
            perspicuous and correct exposition. As these two things, <lb/>
            therefore, are the objects of our inquiry in causes, first, what <lb/>
            we shall say, and next, how we shall say it; the former; <lb/>
            which seems to be wholly concerned with art, though it does <lb/>
            indeed require some art, is yet an affair of but ordinary un- <lb/>
            derstanding, namely, to see what ought to be said; the latter <lb/>
            is the department in which the divine power and excellence <lb/>
            of the orator is seen; I mean in delivering what is to be <lb/>
            said with elegance, copiousness, and variety of language.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " The former part,1 then, since you have once <lb/>
            declared it to be your pleasure, I will not refuse to finish off <lb/>
            and complete, (how far I shall succeed you will best judge,) <lb/>
            and shall show from what topics a speech must be furnished <lb/>
            in order to effect these three objects which alone have power <lb/>
            to persuade; namely, that the minds of the audience be con- <lb/>
            ciliated, informed, and moved, for these are the three; but <lb/>
            how they should be illustrated, there is one present who can <lb/>
            instruct us all; one who first introduced this excellence into <lb/>
            our practice, who principally improved it, who alone has <lb/>
            brought it to perfection. For I think, Catulus, (and I will <lb/>
            say this without any dread of a suspicion of flattery,) that <lb/>
            there is no orator, at all more eminent than ordinary, either <lb/>
            Grecian, or Roman, that our age has produced, whom I have <lb/>
            not heard often and attentively; and, therefore, if there is <lb/>
            any ability in me, (as I may now presume to hope, since you, <lb/>
            men of such talents, take so much trouble in giving me <lb/>
            audience,) it arises from this, that no orator ever delivered <lb/>
            anything in my hearing, which did not sink deeply into my <lb/>
            memory; and I, such as I am, and as far as I have capacity <lb/>
            to form a judgment, having heard all orators, without any <lb/>
            hesitation decide and pronounce this, That none of them all <lb/>
            bad so many and such excellent accomplishments in speaking <lb/>
            as are in Crassus. On which account, if you also are of the <lb/>
            same opinion, it will not, as I think, be an unjust partition, <lb/>
            if, when I shall have given birth and education and strength <lb/>
            to this orator whom I am forming, as is my design, I deliver <note type="footnote"> 1 Which shows what a speaker ought to say, and what is effective is <lb/>

            him to Crassus to be furnished with apparel and orna- <lb/>
            ments."</p>
          <p>Crassus then said, " Do you rather, Antonius, go on as you <lb/>
            have commenced; for it is not the part of a good or liberal <lb/>
            parent not to clothe and adorn him whom he has engendered <lb/>
            and brought up ; especially as you cannot deny that you are- <lb/>
            wealthy enough. For what grace, what power, what spirit, <lb/>
            what dignity was wanting to that orator, who at the close of <lb/>
            a speech did not hesitate to call forth his accused client, <lb/>
            though of consular rank, and to tear open his garment, and to <lb/>
            expose to the judges the scars on the breast of the old com- <lb/>
            mander ?1 who also, when he defended a seditious madman,2 <lb/>
            Sulpicius here being the accuser, did not hesitate to speak in <lb/>
            favour of sedition itself, and to demonstrate, with the utmost <lb/>
            power of language, that many popular insurrections are just, for <lb/>
            whichnobody could be accountable ? adding that many seditions <lb/>
            had occurred to the benefit of the commonwealth, as when <lb/>
            the kings were expelled, and when the power of the tribunes <lb/>
            was established ; and that the sedition of Norbanus, proceed- <lb/>
            ing from the grief of the citizens, and their hatred to Cæpio, <lb/>
            who had lost the army, could not possibly be restrained, and <lb/>
            was blown up into a flame by a just indignation. Could this, <lb/>
            so hazardous a topic, so unprecedented, so delicate, so new, <lb/>

          <p>XXIX. " For my part," said Catulus, " what I am accus- <lb/>
            tomed most to admire in you both, is, that while you are totally <lb/>
            unlike each other in your manner of speaking, yet each of <lb/>
            you speaks so well, that nothing seems either to have been <lb/>
            denied you by nature, or not to have been bestowed on you <lb/>
            by learning. You, therefore, Crassus, from your obliging <lb/>
            disposition, will neither withhold from us the illustration of <lb/>
            whatever may have been inadvertently or purposely omitted <lb/>
            by Antonius; nor if you, Antonius, do not speak on every <lb/>
            point, we shall think, not that you could not speak on it, but <lb/>
            that you preferred that it should be treated by Crassus." <lb/>
            Here Crassus said, " Do you rather, Antonius, omit those <lb/>
            particulars which you have proposed to treat, and which no <lb/>
            one here needs, namely, from what topics the statements <lb/>
            made in pleadings are to be derived, which, though they <lb/>
            would be treated by you in a new and excellent way, are in <lb/>
            their nature very easy, and commonly set forth in books of <lb/>
            rules; but show us those resources whence you draw that <lb/>
            eloquence which you frequently exert, and always divinely." <lb/>
            "I will indeed show you them," said Antonius; " and that <lb/>
            I may the more easily obtain from you what I require, I will <lb/>
            refuse you nothing that you ask. The supports of my whole <lb/>
            eloquence, and that power of speaking which Crassus just <lb/>
            now extolled to the skies, are, as I observed before, three <lb/>
            processes; the first, that of conciliating my hearers; the second, <lb/>
            that of instructing them; and the third, that of moving them. <lb/>
            The first of these divisions requires mildness of address; the <lb/>
            second penetration; the third energy; for it is impossible but <lb/>
            that he, who is to determine a cause in our favour, must <lb/>
            either lean to our side from propensity of feeling, or be swayed <lb/>
            by the arguments of our defence, or be forced by action upon <lb/>
            his mind. But since that part, in which the opening of the <lb/>
            case itself and the defence lie, seems to comprehend all that <lb/>
            is laid down as doctrine on this head, I shall speak on that <lb/>
            first, and say but few words; for I seem to have but few <lb/>
            observations gained from experience, and imprinted as it were <lb/>
            on my memory.</p>
          <p>XXX. " We shall willingly consent to your judicious pro- <lb/>
            posal, Crassus, to omit those defences for every sort of causes, <pb n="257"/>
             <note type="margin">C. XXX.] </note> <lb/>
            which the masters of rhetoric are accustomed to teach boys; <lb/>
            and to open those sources whence all arguments for every <lb/>
            cause and speech are derived. For neither, as often as we <lb/>
            have occasion to write any word, need the letters of that <lb/>
            word be so often collected in our thoughts; nor, as often as <lb/>
            we are to plead a cause, need we turn to the separate argu. <lb/>
            ments for that cause; but we should have certain common- <lb/>
            places which, like letters for forming a word, immediately <lb/>
            occur to us to aid in stating a cause. But these common- <lb/>
            places can be of advantage only to that orator who is conver- <lb/>
            sant in business, and has that experience which age at length <lb/>
            brings with it; or one who has so much attention and power <lb/>
            of thought as to anticipate age by study and diligence. For <lb/>
            if you bring to me a man of ever so deep erudition, of ever <lb/>
            so acute and subtile an intellect, or ever so ready an elocu- <lb/>
            tion, if he be a stranger to the customs of civil communities, <lb/>
            to the examples, to the institutions, to the manners and <lb/>
            inclinations of his fellow-citizens, the common-places from <lb/>
            which arguments are drawn will be of little benefit to him. <lb/>
            I must have a well-cultivated genius, like a field not once <lb/>
            ploughed only, but again and again, with renewed and re- <lb/>
            peated tillage, that it may produce better and larger crops; <lb/>
            and the cultivation here required is experience, attentive <lb/>
            hearing of other orators, reading, and writing.</p>
          <p>"First, then, let him examine the nature of his cause, which <lb/>
            is never obscure so far as the inquiry ' whether a thing has <lb/>
            been done or not;' or ' of what nature it is;' or ' what name <lb/>
            it should receive;' and when this is ascertained, it imme- <lb/>
            diately occurs, with the aid of natural good sense, and not of <lb/>
            those artifices which teachers of rhetoric inculcate, 'what con- <lb/>
            stitutes the cause,' that is, the point without which there <lb/>
            would be no controversy; then, 'what is the matter for trial,' <lb/>
            which they direct you to ascertain in this manner : Opimius <lb/>
            slew Gracchus: what constitutes the cause? 'That he slew <lb/>
            him for the good of the republic, when he had called the <lb/>
            people to arms, in consequence of a decree of the senate.' <lb/>
            Set this point aside, and there will be no question for trial. <lb/>
            But Decius denies that such a deed could be authorized <lb/>
            contrary to the laws. The point therefore to be tried will <lb/>
            be, ' whether Opimius had authority to do so from the decree <lb/>
            of the senate, for the good of the commonwealth.' 'These <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            matters are indeed clear, and may be settled by common <lb/>
            sense; but it remains to be considered what arguments, re- <lb/>
            lative to the point for trial, ought to be advanced, as well by <lb/>
            the accuser as by him who has undertaken the defence.</p>
          <p>XXXI. " Here we must notice a capital error in those mas- <lb/>
            ters to whom we send our. children ; not that it has much to <lb/>
            do with speaking, but that you may see how stupid and un- <lb/>
            polished a set of men they are who imagine themselves learned, <lb/>
            For, in distinguishing the different kinds of speaking, they <lb/>
            make two species of causes. One they call, 'that in which <lb/>
            the question is about a general proposition, without reference <lb/>
            to persons and times;' the other, 'that which is confined to <lb/>
            certain persons and times;' being ignorant that all contro- <lb/>
            versies must have relation to the force and nature of the <lb/>
            general position; for in that very cause which I mentioned, <lb/>
            the person of Opimius or Decius has nothing to do with the <lb/>
            common arguments of the orator; since the inquiry has un- <lb/>
            restricted reference to the question in general, ' whether he <lb/>
            seems deserving of punishment who has slain a citizen under <lb/>
            a decree of the senate for the preservation of his country, <lb/>
            when such a deed was not permitted by the laws.' There is <lb/>
            indeed no cause in which, the point that falls under dispute <lb/>
            is considered with reference to the parties to the suit, and not <lb/>
            from arguments relating to such questions in general. But <lb/>
            even in those very cases where, the dispute is about a fact, as <lb/>
            ' whether Publius Decius 1 has taken money contrary to law, <lb/>
            the arguments both for, the accusation and for the defence <lb/>
            must have reference to the general question, and the general <lb/>
            nature of the case; as, to show that the defendant is expen- <lb/>
            sive, the arguments must refer to luxury; that he is covetous <lb/>
            of another's property, to avarice; that he is seditious, to <lb/>
            turbulent and ill-designing citizens in general;. that he is <lb/>
            convicted by many proofs, to the general nature of evidence : <lb/>
            and, on the other side, whatever is said for the defendant, must <lb/>
            of necessity be abstracted from the occasion and individual, <lb/>
            and referred to the general notions of things and questions of <lb/>
            the kind. These, perhaps, to a man who cannot readily compre- <lb/>
            hend in his mind all that is in the nature of things, may seem <note type="footnote"> ' I He was accused of having been bribed to bring Opimius to trial <lb/>

            extremely numerous to come under consideration when the <lb/>
            question is about a single fact; but it is the. number of <lb/>
            charges, and not of modes of defence, or topics for them, that <lb/>
            is infinite.1</p>
          <p>XXXII. "But when there is no contest about facts, the <lb/>
            questions on the nature of facts, if you reckon them from <lb/>
            the number of the parties accused, are innumerable and in- <lb/>
            tricate; if from the facts themselves, very few and clear. <lb/>
            For if we consider the case of Mancinus so as referring to Man- <lb/>
            cinus alone, then, whenever a person whom the chief herald <lb/>
            has surrendered to the enemy is not re-admitted into his <lb/>
            country, a new case will arise. But if what gives rise to the <lb/>
            controversy be the general question, 'whether to him whom <lb/>
            the chief herald has surrendered, if he has not been re-admitted <lb/>
            into his country, there seems to be a right of return,' the <lb/>
            name of Mancinus has nothing to do with the mode of speak- <lb/>
            ing upon it, or the arguments for the defence. And if the <lb/>
            merit or demerit of the person give rise to any discussion, it <lb/>
            is wholly beside the question; and the part of the speech re- <lb/>
            ferring to the question must, of necessity, be adapted to such <lb/>
            arguments in general. I do not reasonupon these subjects <lb/>
            for the purpose of confuting learned teachers: although those <lb/>
            merit reproof, who, in their general definition, describe this <lb/>
            sort of causes as relating to persons and times. For, although <lb/>
            times and persons .are incident to them, yet it should be <lb/>
            understood, that-the causes depend not-upon them, .but upon <lb/>
            the general question. But this is not, my business; for we <lb/>
            ought to have no contest with that sort of people; it is suffi- <lb/>
            cient that this only should be known, that they have not <lb/>
            sven attained a point which they might have effected amid <lb/>
            so much leisure, even without any experience in affairs of <lb/>
            the forum; that is, they might have distinguished the gene- <lb/>
            ral natures of cases, and explained them a little more accu- <lb/>
            rately. But this, as I said, is not my business; it is mine, <lb/>
            and much more yours, my friends Cotta and Sulpicius, to <lb/>
            know, that as their artificial rules now stand, the multitude <note type="footnote"> 1 Innumerable accusations may be brought against a person, an <lb/>

            of causes is to be dreaded; for it is infinite, if they are <lb/>
            referred to persons; so many men, so many causes; but, if <lb/>
            they are referred to general questions, they are so limited and <lb/>
            few, that studious orators of good memory and judgment <lb/>
            ought to have them digested in their minds, and, I may almost <lb/>
            say, learned by heart; unless perhaps you imagine that Lucius <lb/>
            Crassus took his notion of that famous cause1 from Manius <lb/>
            Curius personally; and thus brought many arguments to <lb/>
            show why, though no posthumous son was born, yet Curius <lb/>
            ought to be the heir of Coponius. The name of Coponius, or <lb/>
            of Curius, had no influence at all on the array of arguments <lb/>
            advanced, or on the force and nature of the question; the <lb/>
            whole controversy had regard to all affairs and events of that <lb/>
            kind in general, not to particular occasions or names; since <lb/>
            the writing was thus, If a son is born to me, and he die <lb/>
            before, etc., then let him be my heir; and if a son was not <lb/>
            born, the question was whether he ought to be heir who was <lb/>
            appointed heir on the death of the son.</p>
          <p>. XXXIII. " A question regarding unvarying equity, and of <lb/>
            a general nature, requires no names of persons, but merely <lb/>
            skill in speaking, and sources of proper argument. In this <lb/>
            respect even the lawyers themselves are an impediment to <lb/>
            us, and hinder us from learning; for I perceive it to be gene- <lb/>
            rally reported in the books of Cato and of Brutus, what <lb/>
            answers they gave on points of law to any particular man or <lb/>
            woman by name; that we might imagine, I suppose, some <lb/>
            cause for consultation or doubt to have arisen from the per- <lb/>
            sons, not from the thing; so that, since persons are innu- <lb/>
            merable, we might be deterred from the study of the law, <lb/>
            and lay aside all inclination to learn it, at the same time with <lb/>
            all hope of ever attaining a thorough knowledge of it.</p>
          <p>" But Crassus will some day make all these points clear ,to <lb/>
            us, and set them forth arranged under general heads; for <lb/>
            you must know, Catulus, that he promised us yesterday, <lb/>
            that he would reduce the civil law, which is now in a state <lb/>
            of confusion and dispersion, under certain general heads, and <lb/>
            digest it into an easy system." " And indeed," said Catulus, <lb/>
            " that is by no means a difficult undertaking for Crassus, <lb/>
            who has all of law that can be learned, and he will supply <lb/>
            tha': which was wanting in those who taught him; for he will <note type="footnote"> 1 See i. 39. </note> <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            be able to define exactly, and to illustrate eloquently, every <lb/>
            point comprehended in the law." " We shall then," said <lb/>
            Antonius, " learn all these things from Crassus, when he shall <lb/>
            have betaken himself, as he intends, from the tumult of <lb/>
            public business and the benches of the forum, to a quiet <lb/>
            retreat, and to his throne."1 " I have indeed often," observed <lb/>
            Catulus, " heard him say, ' that he was resolved to retire <lb/>
            from pleading and the courts of justice;' but, as I frequently <lb/>
            tell him, it will never be in his power; for neither will he <lb/>
            permit his assistance to be repeatedly implored in vain by <lb/>
            persons of character, nor will the public endure his retire- <lb/>
            ment patiently, as they will think that if they lose the elo- <lb/>
            quence of Lucius Crassus, they will lose one of the principal <lb/>
            ornaments of the city." " Indeed then," remarked Antonius, <lb/>
            " if what Catulus says is true, Crassus, you must still live on <lb/>
            in the same workshop with me, and we must give up that <lb/>
            yawning and sleepy science to the tranquillity of the Scævolæ <lb/>
            and other such happy people." Here Crassus smiled a little, <lb/>
            and said, " Finish weaving, Antonius, the web which you <lb/>
            have begun; yet that yawning science, as you term it, when <lb/>
            I have sheltered myself under it, will vindicate my right to <lb/>
            liberty."</p>
          <p>XXXIV. "This is indeed the end," continued Antonius, <lb/>
            " of that part on which I just now entered; for it is now <lb/>
            understood that all matters which admit of doubt are to be <lb/>
            decided, not with reference to individuals, who are innu-. <lb/>
            merable, or to occasions, which are infinitely various, but to <lb/>
            general considerations, and the nature of things; that general <lb/>
            considerations are not only limited in number, but very few; <lb/>
            that those who are studious of speaking should embrace in <lb/>
            their minds the subjects peculiar to the several departments <lb/>
            of eloquence, arranged under general heads, as well as arrayed <lb/>
            and adorned, I mean with thoughts and illustrations. These <lb/>
            will, by their own force, beget words, which always seem to <lb/>
            me to be elegant enough, if they are such that the subject <lb/>
            seems to have suggested them. And if you ask the truth, (as <lb/>
            far, that is, as it is apparent to me, for I can affirm nothing <lb/>
            more than my own notions and opinions,) we ought to carry this <lb/>
            preparatory stock of general questions and common-places <lb/>
            into the forum with us; and not, when any cause is brought <note type="footnote"> 1 See i. 45; also iii. 33; ii. 55; and Do Legg. L 3. 1 </note> <pb n="262"/>

            before us, begin then to seek for topics from which we may <lb/>
            draw our arguments; topics which, indeed, by all who have <lb/>
            made them the subject of but moderate consideration, may <lb/>
            be thoroughly prepared by means of study and practice; but <lb/>
            the thoughts must still revert to those general heads and <lb/>
            common-places to which I have so often alluded, and from <lb/>
            which all arguments are drawn for every species of oratory. <lb/>
            All that is required, whether it result from art, or observation, <lb/>
            or practice, is but to know those parts of the field in which <lb/>
            you may hunt for, and trace out, what you wish to find; for <lb/>
            when you have embraced in your thoughts the-whole of any <lb/>
            topic, if you are but well practised in the treatment of sub- <lb/>
            jects, nothing will escape you, and every circumstance mate- <lb/>
            rial to the question will occur and suggest itself to you.</p>
          <p>XXXV. " Since, then, in speaking,- three things are re- <lb/>
            quisite for'finding argument; genius, method, (which, if we <lb/>
            please, we may call art,) and diligence, I cannot but assign <lb/>
            the chief place to genius; yet diligence can raise even genius <lb/>
            itself out of dulness; diligence, I say, which, as it avails in <lb/>
            all things, is also of the utmost moment in pleading causes. <lb/>
            Diligence is to be particularly cultivated by us; it is to be <lb/>
            constantly exerted; it is capable of effecting almost every- <lb/>
            thing. That a cause is thoroughly understood; as I said at <lb/>
            first, is owing to diligence; that we listen to our adversary <lb/>
            attentively, and possess ourselves, not only of his thoughts, <lb/>
            but even of his every word; that we observe all the motions <lb/>
            of his countenance, which generally indicate the workings of <lb/>
            the mind, is owing to diligence; [but to do this covertly, that <lb/>
            he may not seem to derive any advantage to himself is the <lb/>
            part of prudence ;]1 that the mind ruminates on those topics <lb/>
            which I shall soon mention, that it insinuates itself tho- <lb/>
            roughly into the cause, that it fixes itself on it with care <lb/>
            and attention, is owing to diligence; that it applies the <lb/>
            memory like a light, to all these matters, as well as the tone <lb/>
            of voice and power of delivery, is owing to diligence. Betwixt <lb/>
            genius and diligence there is very little room left for art; <lb/>
            art only shows you where to look, and where that lies <lb/>
            which you want to find; all the rest depends on care, <lb/>
            attention, consideration, vigilance, assiduity, industry; all <note type="footnote"> 1 The words in brackets are regarded by all the best critics as the <lb/>
            production of some interpolator. </note> <pb n="263"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXVII.] </note> <lb/>
            which I include in that one word which I have so often <lb/>
            repeated, diligence; a single virtue, in which all other <lb/>
            virtues are comprehended. For we see how the philosophers <lb/>
            abound in copiousness of language, who, as I think, (but you, <lb/>
            Catulus, know these matters better,) lay down no precepts of <lb/>
            eloquence, and yet do not, on that account, the less under- <lb/>
            take to speak with fulness and fluency on whatever subject is <lb/>
            proposed to them."</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Catulus then observed, " It is as you say, <lb/>
            Antonius, that most philosophers deliver no precepts of <lb/>
            eloquence, and yet are prepared with something to say on <lb/>
            any subject. But Aristotle, he whom I admire more than any <lb/>
            of them, has set forth certain topics from which every line of <lb/>
            argument may be deduced, not only for the disputations of <lb/>
            philosophy, but even for the reasoning which we use in <lb/>
            pleading causes; from whose notions your discourse, Ante. <lb/>
            nius, has for some time past not varied; whether you, from <lb/>
            a resemblance to that divine genius, hit upon his track, or <lb/>
            whether you have read and made yourself master of his <lb/>
            writings; a supposition indeed which seems to be more pro- <lb/>
            bable than the other, for I see that you have paid more atten- <lb/>
            tion to the Greek writers than we had imagined." " You shall <lb/>
            hear from myself," said he, "Catulus, what is really the case: <lb/>
            I always thought that an orator would be more agreeable to <lb/>
            the Roman people, and better approved, who should give, <lb/>
            above all, as little indication as possible of artifice, and none <lb/>
            at all of having studied Grecian literature. At the same <lb/>
            time, when the Greeks undertook, professed, and executed <lb/>
            such great things, when they offered to teach mankind how <lb/>
            to penetrate the most obscure subjects, to live virtuously and <lb/>
            to speak eloquently, I thought it the part of an irrational <lb/>
            animal rather than a man, not to pay them some degree of <lb/>
            attention, and, if we cannot venture to hear them openly, <lb/>
            for fear of diminishing our authority with our own fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, to catch their words at least by listening privately, <lb/>
            and hearkening at a distance to what they stated; and thus <lb/>
            I have acted, Catulus, and have gained a general notion of <lb/>
            the arguments and subjects of all their writers."</p>
          <p>XXXVII. "Really and truly," said Catulus, "you have <lb/>
            steered your bark to the coasts of philosophy with the utmost <lb/>
            caution, as if you had been approaching some rock of un. <pb n="264"/>
            <note type="margin">[B.II. </note> <lb/>
            lawful desire,1 though this country has never despised philo- <lb/>
            sophy. For Italy was formerly full of Pythagoreans, at the <lb/>
            time when part of this country was called Great Greece:2 <lb/>
            (whence some report that Numa Pompilius, one of our kings, <lb/>
            was a Pythagorean; though he lived many years before the <lb/>
            time of Pythagoras; for which reason he is to be accounted <lb/>
            the greater man, as he had the wisdom and knowledge to <lb/>
            regulate our state, almost two centuries before the Greeks <lb/>
            knew that it had arisen in the world;) and certainly this <lb/>
            country never produced men more renowned for glorious <lb/>
            actions, or of greater gravity and authority, or possessed of <lb/>
            more polite learning than Publius Africanus, Caius Lælius, <lb/>
            and Lucius Furius, who always had about them publicly the <lb/>
            most learned men from Greece. I have often heard them <lb/>
            say, that the Athenians had done what was very pleasing to <lb/>
            them, and to many of the leading men in the city, in sending, <lb/>
            when they despatched ambassadors to the senate about im- <lb/>
            portant concerns of their own, the three most illustrious <lb/>
            philosophers of that age, Carneades, Critolaus, and Diogenes; <lb/>
            who, during their stay at Rome, were frequently heard lec- <lb/>
            turing by them and others. And when you had such authori- <lb/>
            ties as these, Antonius, I wonder why you should, like Zethus <lb/>
            in Pacuvius's play,3 almost declare war against philosophy." <lb/>
            " I have not by any means done so," replied Antonius, " for <lb/>
            I have determined rather to philosophize, like Ennius's <lb/>
            Neoptolemus, a little, since to be absolutely a philosopher is <lb/>
            not agreeable to me. But my opinion, which I think I have <lb/>
            clearly laid down, is this: I do not disapprove of such <lb/>
            studies, if they be but moderately pursued; but I think that <note type="footnote"> 1 That the allusion is to the islands of the Sirens, who tried to allure <lb/>

            Amphion and Zethus, the former fond of philosophy, music, and the <lb/>

            despising science. To this story Horace also alludes, Ep. i. 18. 41: <lb/>
            Gratia sic fratrum geminorum Amphionis atque <lb/>
            Zethi, dissiluit, donee suspecta severo <lb/>

            the reputation of that kind of learning, and all suspicion of <lb/>
            artifice, is prejudicial to the orator with those who have the <lb/>
            decision of affairs; for it diminishes the authority of the <lb/>
            speaker and the credit of his speech."</p>
          <p>. XXXVIII. " But that our conversation may return to <lb/>
            the point from which it digressed, do you observe that of <lb/>
            those three illustrious philosophers, who, as you said, came <lb/>
            to Rome, one was Diogenes, who professed to teach the art of <lb/>
            reasoning well, and distinguishing truth from falsehood, which <lb/>
            he called by the Greek name <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλεκτική</foreign>, or logic? In this <lb/>
            art, if it be an art, there are no directions how truth may be <lb/>
            discovered, but only how it may be judged. For everything <lb/>
            of which we speak we either affirm to be or not to be;1 and <lb/>
            if it be expressed absolutely, the logicians take it in hand to <lb/>
            judge whether it be true or false; or, if it be expressed con- <lb/>
            ditionally, and qualifications are added, they determine whe- <lb/>
            ther such qualifications are rightly added, and whether the <lb/>
            conclusion of each syllogism is true; and at last they torment <lb/>
            themselves with their own subtilties, and, after much dis- <lb/>
            quisition, find out not only what they themselves cannot resolve, <lb/>
            but even arguments, by which what they had before begun <lb/>
            to resolve, or rather had almost made clear, is again involved <lb/>
            in obscurity. Here, then, that Stoic2 can be of no assistance <lb/>
            to me, because he does not teach me how to find out what to <lb/>
            say; he is rather even an impediment to me; for he finds <lb/>
            many difficulties which he says can by no means be cleared, <lb/>
            and unites with them a kind of language that is not clear, <lb/>
            easy, and fluent; but poor, dry, succinct, and concise; and <lb/>
            if any one shall approve such a style, he will approve it with <lb/>
            the acknowledgment that it is not suited to the orator. For <lb/>
            our mode of speaking is to be adapted to the ear of the mul- <lb/>
            titude, to fascinate and excite their minds, and to prove <lb/>
            matters that are not weighed in the scales of the goldsmith, <lb/>
            but in the balance, as it were, of popular opinion; we may <lb/>
            therefore entirely dismiss an art which is too silent about the <lb/>
            invention of arguments, and too full of words in pronouncing <lb/>
            judgment on them. That Critolaus, whom you mention as <note type="footnote">1 In this passage I adopt the correction, or rather restoration, of <lb/>

            having come hither with Diogenes, might, I fancy, have been <lb/>
            of more assistance to our studies, for he was out of the <lb/>
            school of that Aristotle from whose method I seem to you <lb/>
            not greatly to differ. Between this Aristotle, (of whom I <lb/>
            have read, as well that book in which he explains the rhe- <lb/>
            torical systems of all who went before him, as those in <lb/>
            which he gives us some notions of his own on the art,) <lb/>
            between him, I say, and the professed teachers of the art, <lb/>
            there appeared to me to be this difference: that he with the <lb/>
            same acuteness of intellect with which he had penetrated <lb/>
            the qualities and nature of things throughout the universe; <lb/>
            saw into everything that pertained to the art of rhetoric, <lb/>
            which he thought beneath him; but they, who thought this <lb/>
            art alone worthy of cultivation, passed their whole lives in con- <lb/>
            templating this one subject; not with as much ability as he, <lb/>
            but with constant practice in their single pursuit, and greater <lb/>
            devotion to it. As to Carneades, that extraordinary force <lb/>
            and variety of eloquence which he possessed would be ex- <lb/>
            tremely desirable for us; a man who never took up any <lb/>
            argument in his disputations which he did not prove; never <lb/>
            attacked any argument that he did not overthrow. But this <lb/>
            is too arduous an accomplishment to be expected from those <lb/>
            who profess and teach rhetoric.</p>
          <p>I XXXIX. "If it were my desire that a person totally <lb/>
            illiterate should be instructed in the art of speaking, I would <lb/>
            willingly send him to these perpetual workers at the same <lb/>
            employment, who hammer day and night on the same anvil, <lb/>
            and who would put his literary food into his mouth, in the <lb/>
            smallest pieces, minced as fine as possible, as nurses put theirs <lb/>
            into the mouths of children. But if he were one who had <lb/>
            had a liberal education, and some degree of practice, and <lb/>
            seemed to have some acuteness of genius, I would instantly <lb/>
            conduct him, not where a little brook of water was confined <lb/>
            by itself, but to the source whence a whole flood gushed <lb/>
            forth; to an instructor who would show him the seats and <lb/>
            abodes, as it were, of every sort of arguments, and would <lb/>
            illustrate them briefly, and define them in proper terms. <lb/>
            For what point is there in which he can hesitate, who shall <lb/>
            see that whatever is assumed in speaking, either to prove or <lb/>
            to refute, is either derived from the peculiar force and <lb/>
            nature of the subject itself, or borrowed from something <pb n="267"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XL.] </note> <lb/>
            foreign to it? From its own peculiar force: as when it is <lb/>
            inquired, ' what the nature of a whole thing is,' or ' a part of <lb/>
            it,' or 'what name it has,' or whatever belongs to the whole <lb/>
            matter. From what is foreign to it: as when circumstances <lb/>
            which :'are extrinsic, and not inherent in the nature of <lb/>
            the thing, are enumerated in combination. If the inquiry <lb/>
            regard the whole, its whole force is to be explained by a defi- <lb/>
            nition,. thus: 'If the majesty of a state be its greatness and <lb/>
            dignity, he is a traitor to its majesty who delivers up an <lb/>
            army to the enemies of the Roman people, not he who <lb/>
            delivers up him who has violated it into the power of the <lb/>
            Roman people.' But if the question respect only a part, <lb/>
            the matter must be managed by partition in this manner: <lb/>
            'Either the senate should have been obeyed concerning the <lb/>
            safety of the republic, or some other authority should have <lb/>
            been constituted, or he should have acted on his own judg- <lb/>
            ment: to constitute another authority had been haughty; <lb/>
            to act on his own judgment bad been arrogant; he had <lb/>
            therefore to obey the direction of the senate.' If we argue <lb/>
            from a name, we may express ourselves like Carbo: ' If he be <lb/>
            a consul who consults the good of his country, what else has <lb/>
            Opimius done?' But if we argue from what is intimately <lb/>
            connected with the subject, there are many sources of argu- <lb/>
            ments and common-places; for we shall look to adjuncts, to <lb/>
            general views, to particulars falling under general views, to <lb/>
            things similar and dissimilar, contrary, consequential; to such <lb/>
            as agree with the case, and are, as it were, forerunners of it, and <lb/>
            such as are at variance with it; we shall investigate the causes <lb/>
            of circumstances, and whatever has arisen from those causes ; <lb/>
            and shall notice cases that are stronger, or similar, or weaker.</p>
          <p>XL. " From things closely relating to the subject argu- <lb/>
            ments are drawn thus: ' If the utmost praise is to be attri- <lb/>
            buted to filial duty, you ought to be moved when you see <lb/>
            Quintus Metellus mourn so tenderly.' From general consider- <lb/>
            ations, thus: ' If magistrates ought to be under the power of <lb/>
            the Roman people, of what do you accuse Norbanus, whose <lb/>
            tribuneship was subservient to the will of the state?' From <lb/>
            particulars that fall under the general consideration, thus: <lb/>
            ' If all who consult the interest of the public ought to be <lb/>
            dear to us, certainly military commanders should be pecu- <lb/>
            liarly dear, by whose conduct, courage, and exposure to <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            danger, we preserve our own safety and the dignity of the <lb/>
            empire.' From similarity, thus: ' If wild beasts love their <lb/>
            offspring, what affection ought we to feel for our children?' <lb/>
            From dissimilarity, thus: ' If it be the character of barbarians <lb/>
            to live as it were for a short season, our plans ought to have <lb/>
            respect to perpetuity.' In both modes of comparison, from <lb/>
            similarity as well as dissimilarity, examples are taken from <lb/>
            the acts, sayings, and successes of others; and fictitious nar- <lb/>
            ratives may often be introduced. From contraries, argu- <lb/>
            ments are drawn thus: ' If Gracchus acted in a detestable, <lb/>
            Opimius has acted in a glorious, manner.' From subsequent <lb/>
            circumstances, thus: ' If he be slain with a weapon, and you, <lb/>
            his enemy, are found on the very spot with a bloody sword, <lb/>
            and nobody but you is seen there, and no one else had any <lb/>
            reason to commit the act, and you were always of a daring <lb/>
            character, what ground is there on which we can possibly <lb/>
            doubt of your guilt?' From concurrent, antecedent, and <lb/>
            repugnant circumstances, thus, as Crassus argued when he <lb/>
            was quite a young man: 'Although, Carbo, you defended <lb/>
            Opimius, this audience will not on that account esteem you <lb/>
            a good citizen; for it is clear that you dissembled and had <lb/>
            other views, because you often, in your harangues, deplored <lb/>
            the fate of Tiberius Gracchus, because you were an accom- <lb/>
            plice in the death of Publius Africanus, because you proposed <lb/>
            a law of such a nature in your tribuneship, because you have <lb/>
            always dissented from good members of the state.' From the <lb/>
            causes of things, thus: ' If you would abolish avarice, you <lb/>
            must abolish the parent of it, luxury.' From whatever arises <lb/>
            from those causes, thus: ' If we use the money in the treasury <lb/>
            as well for the services of war as the ornaments of peace, let <lb/>
            us take care of the public revenues.' Stronger, weaker, and <lb/>
            parallel instances, we shall compare thus: from a stronger <lb/>
            we shall argue in this way, ' If a good name be preferable to <lb/>
            riches, and money is pursued with so much industry, with <lb/>

            weaker, thus: <lb/>
            " Since merely for a small acquaintance' sake <lb/>
            He takes this woman's death so nearly, what <lb/>
            If he himself had loved ? what would he feel <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. XLI.]</note> " From a parallel case, thus: ' It is natural to the same <lb/>
            character, to be rapacious of the public money, and to be <lb/>
            profuse of it to the public prejudice.' But instances borrowed <lb/>
            from extraneous circumstances are such as are not supported <lb/>
            by their own strength, but somewhat foreign: as, ' This is true; <lb/>
            for Quintus Lutatius has affirmed it:' ' This is false; for an <lb/>
            examination has been made:' ' This must of necessity follow; <lb/>
            for I shall read the writings;' on which head I spoke fully a <lb/>
            little while ago." XLI. I have been as brief in the exempli- <lb/>
            fication of these matters as their nature would permit. For <lb/>
            as, if I wished to make known to any one a quantity of gold, <lb/>
            that was buried in separate heaps, it ought to be sufficient if <lb/>
            I told him the signs and marks of the places, with the know- <lb/>
            ledge of which he might dig for himself, and find what he <lb/>
            wished with very little trouble, and without any mistake; so <lb/>
            I wished to specify such marks, as it were, of arguments, as <lb/>
            would let him who seeks them know where they are;1 what <lb/>
            remains is to be brought out by industry and thought. <lb/>
            What kind of arguments is most suitable to any particular <lb/>
            kind of cause it requires no exquisite skill to prescribe, but <lb/>
            merely moderate capacity to determine. For it is not now <lb/>
            my design to set forth any system of rhetoric, but to com- <lb/>
            municate to men of eminent learning some hints drawn from <lb/>
            my own experience. These common-places, therefore, being <lb/>
            fixed in the mind and memory, and called forth on every <lb/>
            subject proposed to be discussed, there will be nothing that <lb/>
            can escape the orator, not merely in matters litigated in the <lb/>
            forum, but in any department of eloquence whatever. But if <lb/>
            he shall attain such success, as to seem to be what he would <lb/>
            wish to seem, and to affect the minds of those before whom <lb/>
            he pleads in such a manner as to lead or rather force them <lb/>
            in whatever direction he pleases, he will assuredly require <lb/>
            nothing else to render him accomplished in oratory.</p>
          <p>" We now see, that it is by no means sufficient to find out <lb/>
            what to say, unless we can handle it skilfully when we have <lb/>
            found it. This treatment ought to be diversified, that he who <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow Ellendt's text: Sic has ego argumentorum volui notas quæ- <lb/>

            satiated with uniformity. Whatever yc u advance, should be <lb/>
            laid down as a proposition, and you should show why it is so; <lb/>
            and, from the same premises, you should sometimes form a <lb/>
            conclusion, and sometimes leave it to be, formed by the hearer, <lb/>
            and make a transition to something else.. Frequently, how- <lb/>

            made. If you produce a comparison to anything, you should <lb/>
            first confirm what you offer as a comparison; and then apply <lb/>
            to it the point in question. In general, you should shade <lb/>

            clear as to matter, they may seem, blended in your mode of <lb/>
            speaking on them.....</p>
          <p>XLII. " I run over these matters cursorily, as addressing <lb/>
            men of learning, and, being myself but half-learned, that we <lb/>
            may at length arrive at matters of greater consequence. For <lb/>
            there is nothing, Catulus, of more importance in speaking <lb/>
            than that the hearer should be favourable to the speaker, and <lb/>
            be himself so strongly moved that he may be influenced <lb/>
            more by impulse and excitement of mind, than by judgment <lb/>
            or reflection. For mankind make far more determinations <lb/>
            through hatred, or love, or desire, or anger, or grief, or joy, or <lb/>
            hope, or fear, or error, or some other affection of mind, than <lb/>
            from regard to. truth, or any settled maxim, or principle of <lb/>
            right, or judicial form, or adherence to the laws. Unless <lb/>
            anything else, therefore, be agreeable to you, let us proceed <lb/>
            to consider these points."</p>
          <p>r " There seems," observed Catulus, " to be still some little <lb/>
            wanting to those matters which you have discussed, Antonius, <lb/>
            something that requires to be explained before you pro- <lb/>
            ceed to what you propose." "What is it?" asked Antonius. <lb/>
            " What order," replied Catulus, " and arrangement of argu- <lb/>
            ments, has your approbation; for in that department you <lb/>
            always seem a god to me." " You may. see how much of <lb/>
            a god I am in that respect, Catulus," rejoined Antonius; for <lb/>
            I assure you the matter would never have come into my <lb/>
            thoughts if I had not been reminded of it; so that you may <lb/>
            suppose I am generally led by mere practice in speaking, or <lb/>
            rather perhaps by chance, to fix on that arrangement cf <pb n="271"/>
             <note type="margin">C. XLIII.] </note>matter by, which I seem at times to produce some effect. <lb/>
            However, that very point which I, because I had. no thought <lb/>
            of it, passed by as I should by a person unknown to me, is of <lb/>
            such efficacy in oratory, that nothing is more conducive to <lb/>
            victory; but yet you seem to me to have required from me <lb/>
            prematurely an account of the order and disposition of the <lb/>
            orator's material; for if I had placed all his power in argu- <lb/>
            mentation,, and in proving his. case from its own inherent <lb/>
            merits, it might be time to say something on the order and <lb/>
            arrangement of his arguments ; but as three heads were <lb/>
            specified by me, and I have spoken on only one, it will be <lb/>
            proper, after I have attended to the other two, to consider, <lb/>
            last of all, about the general arrangement of a speech.</p>
          <p>XLIII. "It contributes much to success in speaking, that <lb/>
            the morals, principles, conduct, and lives of those who plead <lb/>
            causes, and of those for whom they plead, should be such as <lb/>
            to merit esteem; and that those of their adversaries should be <lb/>
            such as to deserve censure ; and also that the minds of those <lb/>
            before whom the cause is pleaded should be moved as much as <lb/>
            possible to a favourable feeling, as well towards the speaker as <lb/>
            towards him; for whom he speaks. The feelings of the hearers <lb/>
            are conciliated by a person's dignity, by his actions, by, the <lb/>
            character of his life; particulars which can more easily be <lb/>
            adorned by eloquence, if they really exist, than be invented, <lb/>
            if they have no - existence. But the .qualities that attract <lb/>
            favour to the orator are a soft tone of voice, a countenance <lb/>
            expressive of modesty, a mild manner of speaking; so that if <lb/>
            he attacks any pne with severity, he may seem to do so <lb/>
            unwillingly and from compulsion. It is of peculiar advantage <lb/>
            that indications of good nature, of liberality, of gentleness, of <lb/>
            piety, of grateful feelings, free from selfishness and avarice, <lb/>
            should appear in him; and everything that characterizes men <lb/>
            of probity and humility, not acrimonious, nor pertinacious, <lb/>
            nor litigious, nor harsh, very much conciliates benevolence, <lb/>
            and alienates the affections from those in whom such qualities <lb/>
            are not apparent. The contrary qualities to these, therefore, <lb/>
            are to be imputed to your opponents. This mode of address <lb/>
            is extremely excellent in those causes in which the mind of <lb/>
            the judge cannot well be inflamed by ardent and vehement <lb/>
            incitation; for energetic oratory is not always desirable, but <lb/>
            often smooth, submissive, gentle language, which gains much <pb n="272"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            favour for rei, or defendants, a term by which I designate <lb/>
            not only such as are accused, but all persons about whose <lb/>
            affairs there is any litigation; for in that sense people formerly <lb/>
            used the word. To describe the character of your clients in <lb/>
            your speeches, therefore, as just, full of integrity, religious, <lb/>
            unpresuming, and patient of injuries, has an extraordinary <lb/>
            effect; and such a description, either in the commencement, or <lb/>
            in your statement of facts, or in the peroration, has so much <lb/>
            influence, if it is agreeably and judiciously managed, that it <lb/>
            often prevails more than the merits of the cause. Such <lb/>
            influence, indeed, is produced by a certain feeling and art in <lb/>
            speaking, that the speech seems to represent, as it were, the <lb/>
            character of the speaker; for, by adopting a peculiar mode of <lb/>
            thought and expression, united with action that is gentle and <lb/>
            indicative of amiableness, such an effect is produced, that the <lb/>
            speaker seems to be a man of probity, integrity, and virtue.</p>
          <p>XLIV. " To this mode of speaking we may subjoin the <lb/>
            opposite method, which moves the minds of the judges by <lb/>
            very different means, and impels them to hate, or love, or <lb/>
            envy, or benevolence, or fear, or hope, or desire, or abhor- <lb/>
            rence, or joy, or grief, or pity, or severity; or leads them to <lb/>
            whatever feelings resemble and are allied to these and <lb/>
            similar emotions of mind. It is desirable, too, for the orator, <lb/>
            that the judges may voluntarily bring to the hearing of the <lb/>
            cause some feelings in their breasts favourable to the object <lb/>
            of the speaker. For it is easier, as they say, to increase the <lb/>
            speed of him that is already running, than to excite to motion <lb/>
            him that is torpid. But if such shall not be the case, or be <lb/>
            somewhat doubtful, then, as a careful physician, before he <lb/>
            proceeds to administer any medicine to a patient, must not <lb/>
            only understand the disease of him whom he would cure, <lb/>
            but also his habit and constitution of body when in health; so <lb/>
            I, for my part, when I undertake a cause of such doubt and <lb/>
            importance as is likely to excite the feelings of the judges, <lb/>
            employ all my sagacity on the care and consideration of <lb/>
            ascertaining, as skilfully as I can, what their sentiments and <lb/>
            opinions are, what they expect, to which side they incline, <lb/>
            and to what conclusion they are likely to be led, with the <lb/>
            least difficulty, by the force of oratory. If they yield them- <lb/>
            selves up, and, as I said before, voluntarily incline and pre- <lb/>
            ponderate to the side to which I would impel them, T embrace <pb n="273"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XLV.] </note> <lb/>
            what is offered, And turn my sails to that quarter from <lb/>
            whence any breath of wind is perceived to blow. But if the <lb/>
            judge is unbiassed, and free from all passion, it is a work of <lb/>
            greater difficulty; for every feeling must then be moved by the <lb/>
            power of oratory, without any assistance from nature. But <lb/>
            so great are the powers of that which was rightly termed by <lb/>
            a good poet,1 <lb/>
            Incliner of the soul, and queen of all things, <lb/>
            Eloquence, that it can not only make him upright who is <lb/>
            biassed, or bias him who is steadfast, but can, like an able <lb/>
            and resolute commander, lead even him captive who resists <lb/>
            and opposes.</p>
          <p>XLV. "These are the points about which Crassus just <lb/>
            now jocosely questioned me when he said that I treated them <lb/>
            divinely, and praised what I did, as being meritoriously done, <lb/>
            in the causes of Manius Aquilius,2 Caius Norbanus,3 and some <lb/>
            others; but really, Crassus, when such arts are adopted by you <lb/>
            in pleading, I use to feel terrified; such power of mind, such <lb/>
            impetuosity, such passion, is expressed in your eyes, your <lb/>
            countenance, your gesture, and even in your very finger;4 <lb/>
            such a torrent is there of the most emphatic and best chosen <lb/>
            words, such noble thoughts, so just, so new, so free from all <lb/>
            disguise or puerile embellishment, that you seem not only <lb/>
            to me to fire the judge, but to be yourself on fire. Nor is it <lb/>
            possible that the judge should feel concern, or hate, or envy, <lb/>
            or fear in any degree, or that he should be moved to com- <lb/>
            passion and tears, unless all those sensations which the <lb/>
            orator would awaken in the judge shall appear to be deeply <lb/>
            felt and experienced by the orator himself. For if a coun- <lb/>
            terfeit passion were to be assumed, and if there were nothing, <lb/>
            in a speech of that kind, but what was false and simulated, <lb/>
            still greater art would perhaps be necessary. What is the <lb/>
            case with you, however, Crassus, or with others, I do not <lb/>
            know; as to myself, there is no reason why I should say <lb/>
            what is false to men of your great good sense and friendship <note type="footnote"> 1 Pacuvius in his Hermione, as appears from Nonius v.flexanima, <lb/>

            for me,—I never yet, upon my honour, tried to excite sorrow, <lb/>
            or compassion, or envy, or hatred, when speaking before a <lb/>
            court of judicature, but I myself, in rousing the judges, was <lb/>
            affected with the very same sensations that I wished to <lb/>
            produce in them. For it is not easy to cause the judge to be <lb/>
            angry with him with whom you desire him to be angry, if <lb/>
            you yourself appear to take the matter coolly; or to make <lb/>
            him hate him whom you wish him to hate, unless he first <lb/>
            see you burning with hatred; nor will he be moved to pity, <lb/>
            unless you give him plain indications of your own acute <lb/>
            feelings, by your expressions, sentiments, tone of voice, look, <lb/>
            and finally by sympathetic tears; for as no fuel is so com- <lb/>
            bustible as to kindle without the application of fire, so no <lb/>
            disposition of mind is so susceptible -of the impressions of the <lb/>
            orator as to be animated to strong feeling, unless he himself <lb/>
            approach it full of inflammation and ardour.</p>
          <p>XLVI. " And that it may not appear to you extraordinary <lb/>
            and astonishing, that a man should so often be angry, so <lb/>
            often grieve, and be so often excited by every passion of the <lb/>
            mind, especially in other men's concerns, there is such force, <lb/>
            let me assure you, in those thoughts and sentiments which <lb/>
            you apply, handle, and discuss in speaking': that there is no <lb/>
            occasion for simulation or deceit; for the very nature of the <lb/>
            language which is adopted to move the passions of others, <lb/>
            moves the orator himself in a greater degree than any one of <lb/>
            those who listen to him. That we may not be surprised, too, <lb/>
            that this happens in causes, in criminal trials, in the danger <lb/>
            of our friends, and before a multitude in the city and in <lb/>
            the forum, where not only our reputation for ability is <lb/>
            at stake, (for that might be a slight consideration; al- <lb/>
            though, when you have professed to accomplish what few <lb/>
            can do, it is not wholly to be neglected;) but where other <lb/>
            things of greater importance are concerned, fidelity, duty <lb/>
            to our clients, and earnestness in discharging that duty; we <lb/>
            are so much moved by such considerations, that even while <lb/>
            we defend the merest strangers, we cannot regard them as <lb/>
            strangers, if we wish to be thought honest men ourselves. <lb/>
            But, as I said, that this may not appear surprising in us, <lb/>
            what can be more fictitious than poetry, than theatrical <lb/>
            representations, than the argument of a play ? Yet on the <lb/>
            stage I myself have often observed the eyes of the actor <pb n="275"/>

            Or enter Salamis without your brother ? <lb/>
            And dreaded not your father's countenance ?</p>
          <p>He never uttered the word 'countenance' but Telamon seemed <lb/>

            weep and bewail, as he exclaimed, <lb/>

            You have afflicted, and bereaved, and killed; <lb/>

            ing of real grief, can you suppose that Pacuvius, when he <lb/>
            wrote them, was in a cool and tranquil state of mind ? Such <lb/>
            could not be the case; for I have often heard that no man <lb/>
            can be a good poet (as they say is left recorded in the writings <lb/>
            of both Democritus and Plato) without ardour of imagina- <lb/>
            .tion, and the excitement of something similar to frenzy.</p>

            peroration of that cause, without a strong feeling. For when <lb/>
            I saw him whom I remembered to have been consul, and, as <lb/>

            Capitol with the pomp of an ovation, afflicted, dejected, sor- <lb/>
            rowful, reduced to the last extremity of danger, I no sooner <lb/>
            attempted to excite compassion in others, than I was myself <lb/>
            moved with compassion. I observed, indeed, that the judges <lb/>
            were wonderfully moved, when I brought forward the sor- <lb/>

            passion, this adjuration of all gods and men, of citizens and <lb/>

            calamity of Cæpio; it also appeared that Marcus Æmilius, <lb/>
            the first man, not only in the senate, but in the city, had <lb/>
            been struck with one of the stones; and nobody could deny <lb/>
            that Lucius Cotta and Titus Didius, when they would have <note type="footnote"> 1 Quintus Servilius Cæpio, in his consulship, says Henrichsen, had <lb/>
            embezzled a large portion of the gold taken at the capture of Toulouse, <lb/>

            battles by the Cimbri, his property was confiscated, and his command <lb/>

            Scævola were consuls, Caius Norbanus, then tribune of the people, <lb/>
            brought Caepio to trial, as it appears, for the embezzlement of the gold <lb/>
            at Toulouse, and for exciting sedition in the city. The senate, to whom <lb/>
            Cæpio, in his consulship, had tried to restore the judicial power, exerted <lb/>
            themselves strongly in his behalf; but Norbanus, after exciting a great <lb/>

          <p>XLVIII. There was also this circumstance in your favour <lb/>
            that you, being merely a youth, were thought to make these <lb/>
            complaints on behalf of the commonwealth with the utmost <lb/>
            propriety; I, a man of censorian rank, was thought hardly in <lb/>
            a condition to appear with any honour in defence of a sedi- <lb/>
            tious citizen, a man who had been unrelenting at the calamity <lb/>
            of a consular person. The judges were citizens of the highest <lb/>
            character; the forum was crowded with respectable people, <lb/>
            so that scarcely even a slight excuse was allowed me, although <lb/>
            I was to speak in defence of one who had been my quæstor. <lb/>
            In these circumstances why need I say that I had recourse <lb/>
            to some degree of art? I will state how I acted, and, if you <lb/>
            please, you may place my defence under some head of art. <lb/>
            I noticed, in connexion, the natures, ill effects, and dangers <lb/>
            of every kind of sedition. I brought down my discourse on <lb/>
            that subject through all the changes of circumstances in our <lb/>
            commonwealth; and I concluded by observing, that though <lb/>
            all seditions had ever been attended with troubles, yet that <lb/>
            some had been supported by justice, and almost by necessity. <lb/>
            I then dwelt on those topics which Crassus just now men- <lb/>
            tioned, that neither could kings have been expelled from this <lb/>
            city, nor tribunes of the people have been created, nor the <lb/>
            consular power have been so often diminished by votes of <lb/>
            the commonalty, nor the right of appeal, that patroness of <lb/>
            the state and guardian of our liberty, have been granted to the <lb/>
            Roman people, without disagreement with the nobility; and <lb/>
            if those seditions had been of advantage to the republic, it <lb/>
            should not immediately, if any commotion had been raised <lb/>
            among the people, be laid to the charge of Caius Norbanus <lb/>
            as a heinous crime or capital misdemeanour; but that, if it had <lb/>
            ever been allowed to the people of Rome to appear justly <lb/>
            provoked (and I showed that it had been often allowed), no <lb/>
            occasion was ever more just than that of which I was speaking. <lb/>
            I then gave another turn to my speech, and directed it to <lb/>
            the condemnation of Cæpio's flight, and lamentation for the <lb/>
            loss of the army. By this diversion I made the grief of those to <lb/>
            flow afresh who were- mourning for their friends, and re-excited <lb/>
            the minds of the Roman knights before whom, as judges, <lb/>
            the cause was being pleaded, to hatred towards Quintus <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            Cæpio, from whom they were alienated cn account of the <lb/>
            right of judicature.1</p>
          <p>XLIX. " But as soon as I perceived that I was in posses- <lb/>
            sion of the favour of the court, and that I had secured <lb/>
            ground for defence, because I had both conciliated the good <lb/>
            feeling of the people, whose rights I had maintained even in <lb/>
            conjunction with sedition, and had brought over the; whole <lb/>
            feeling of the judges to our side of the question, either from <lb/>
            their concern for the calamity of the public, or from grief or <lb/>
            regret for their relations, or from their own individual aver- <lb/>
            sion to Cæpio, I then began to intermix with this vehement <lb/>
            and ardent style of oratory that other species of which I <lb/>
            discoursed before, full of lenity and mildness; saying that <lb/>
            I was contending for my companion in office, who, according <lb/>
            to the custom of our ancestors, ought to stand in relation to <lb/>
            me as one of my children, and for almost my whole reputa- <lb/>
            tion and fortunes; that nothing could possibly happen more <lb/>
            dishonourable to my character, or more bitterly adapted to <lb/>
            give pain to me, than if I, who was reputed to have been <lb/>
            oftentimes the preservation of those who were entire <lb/>
            strangers, to me, but yet .my fellow-citizens, should not be <lb/>
            able to assist an officer of my. own. I requested of the <lb/>
            judges to make this concession to ,my age, to the honours <lb/>
            which I had attained, to the actions which I had performed, <lb/>
            if they saw that I was affected with a just and tender sorrow, <lb/>
            and especially if they were sensible that in other causes I <lb/>
            had asked everything for my friends in peril, but never any- <lb/>
            thing for myself. Thus, in the. whole of that defence and <lb/>
            cause, the part which seemed to depend on art, the speaking <lb/>
            on the Apuleian law, and explaining what it was to commit <lb/>
            treason, I skimmed and touched upon as briefly as possible. <lb/>
            But by the aid of these two parts of eloquence, to one of <lb/>
            which belongs the excitement of the passions, to the, other <lb/>
            recommendation to favour, (parts not at all fully treated in <lb/>
            the rules in books on the art,) <unclear>wεs</unclear> the whole, of that cause <lb/>
            conducted by me; so that, in reviving the popular displea- <lb/>
            sure against Cæpio, I appeared to be a person of the keenest <lb/>
            acrimony; and, in speaking of my behaviour towards my <lb/>
            friends, tobe of the most humane disposition. In this <note type="footnote"> 1 As Cæpio had tried to take it out of the hands of the knights, and <lb/>

            manner, rather by exciting the passions of the judges than <lb/>
            by informing their understandings,, was - your accusation, <lb/>
            Sulpicius, at that time, overthrown by me."</p>
          <p>L. " In good truth, Antonius," interposed Sulpicius, " you <lb/>
            recall these circumstances to my memory with justice; since <lb/>
            I never saw anything slip out of any person's hands, as that <lb/>
            cause then slipped out of mine. For whereas, as you ob- <lb/>
            served, I had given you not a cause to plead, but a flame to <lb/>
            extinguish; what a commencement was it (immortal gods!) <lb/>
            that you made! What timidity was there! What distrust! <lb/>
            What a degree of hesitation and slowness of speech! But as <lb/>
            soon as you had gained that by your exordium, which was <lb/>
            the only thing that the assembly allowed you as an excuse, <lb/>
            namely, that you were pleading for a man intimately con- <lb/>
            nected with you, and your own quæstor, how quickly did you <lb/>
            secure your way to a fair audience! But lo! when I thought <lb/>
            that you had reaped no other benefit than that the hearers <lb/>
            would think they ought to excuse you for defending a <lb/>
            pernicious citizen, on account of the ties of union betwixt <lb/>
            you, you began to proceed gradually and tacitly, while others <lb/>
            had as yet no suspicion of your designs, though I myself felt <lb/>
            some apprehension, to maintain in your defence that what <lb/>
            had happened was not sedition in Norbanus, but resentment <lb/>
            on the part of the Roman people, resentment not excited <lb/>
            unjustly, but deservedly, and in conformity with their duty. <lb/>
            In the next place, what argument did you omit against <lb/>
            Cæpio ?How did you confound all the circumstances of <lb/>
            the case by allusions to hatred, ill-will, and compassion ? <lb/>
            Nor was this the case only in your defence, but even in <lb/>
            regard to Scaurus and my. other witnesses, whose evidence <lb/>
            you did not confute by disproving it, but by having recourse <lb/>
            to the same impetuosity of the people. When those circum- <lb/>
            stances were mentioned by you just now, I,felt no desire for <lb/>
            any rules of instruction; for the very demonstration of your <lb/>
            methods of defence, as stated by yourself, I. regard as no <lb/>
            ordinary instruction." " But if you are so disposed," said <lb/>
            Antonius, " I will tell you what maxims I adopt in speaking, <lb/>
            and what I keep principally in view; for a long life and <lb/>
            experience in important affairs have taught me to discern by <lb/>
            what means the minds of men are to be moved.</p>
          <p>LI. " The first thing I generally consider is, whether the <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II.</note> <lb/>
            cause requires that the minds of the audience should be <lb/>
            excited; for such fiery oratory is not to be exerted on trivial <lb/>
            subjects, nor when the minds of men are so affected that we <lb/>
            can do nothing by eloquence to influence their opinions, lest <lb/>
            we be thought to deserve ridicule or dislike, if we either act <lb/>
            tragedies about trifles or endeavour to pluck up what cannot <lb/>
            be moved. For as the feelings on which we have to work in <lb/>
            the minds of the judges, or whoever they may be before <lb/>
            whom we may plead, are love, hatred, anger, envy, pity, hope, <lb/>
            joy, fear, anxiety, we are sensible that love may be gained if <lb/>
            you seem to advocate what is advantageous to the persons <lb/>
            before whom you are speaking; or if you appear to exert <lb/>
            yourself in behalf of good men, or at least for such as are <lb/>
            good and serviceable to them; for the latter case more en- <lb/>
            gages favour, the former, the defence of virtue, esteem; and <lb/>
            if a hope of future advantage is proposed, it has a greater <lb/>
            effect than the mention of past benefits. You must endea- <lb/>
            vour to show that in the cause which you defend, either <lb/>
            their dignity or advantage is concerned; and you should <lb/>
            signify that he for whom you solicit their love has referred <lb/>
            nothing to his own private benefit, and done nothing at all <lb/>
            for his own sake; for dislike is felt for the selfish gains of <lb/>
            individuals, while favour is shown to their desires to serve <lb/>
            others. But we must take care, while we are on this topic, <lb/>
            not to appear to extol the merit and glory of those whom we <lb/>
            would wish to be esteemed for their good deeds, too highly, <lb/>
            as these qualities are usually the greatest objects of envy. <lb/>
            From these considerations, too, we shall learn how to draw <lb/>
            hatred on our adversaries, and to avert it from ourselves and our <lb/>
            friends. The same means are to be used, also, either to excite <lb/>
            or allay anger; for if you exaggerate every fact that is hurtful <lb/>
            or disadvantageous to the audience, their hatred is excited; <lb/>
            but if anything of the kind is thrown out against men' of <lb/>
            worth, or against characters on whom no one ought to cast any <lb/>
            reflection, or against the public, there is then produced, if not <lb/>
            so violent a degree of hatred, at least an unfavourable feeling, <lb/>
            or displeasure near akin to hatred. Fear is also inculcated <lb/>
            either from people's own dangers or those of the public. Per- <lb/>
            sonal fear affects men more deeply; but that which is common <lb/>
            to all is to be treated by the orator as having similar influence. <note type="footnote"> 1 Since public or common fear must affect individuals. </note> <pb n="281"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">C. LII.] </note> LII. " Similar, or rather the same, is the case with regard <lb/>
            to hope, joy, and anxiety; but I know not whether the feeling <lb/>
            of envy is not by far the most violent of all emotions; nor does <lb/>
            it require less power to suppress than to excite it. Men envy <lb/>
            chiefly their equals or inferiors when they perceive them- <lb/>
            selves left behind, and are mortified that the others have <lb/>
            outstripped them; but there is often a strong unfavourable <lb/>
            feeling towards superiors, which is the stronger if they are <lb/>
            intolerably arrogant, and transgress the fair bounds of com- <lb/>
            mon justice through super-eminence in dignity or fortune. It <lb/>
            such advantages are to be made instruments to kindle dislike,1 <lb/>
            the chief thing to be said is,' that they are not the acquisitions <lb/>
            of virtue, that they have even been gained perhaps by vice <lb/>
            and crime; and that, however honourable or imposing they <lb/>
            may appear, no merit was ever carried so high as the insolence <lb/>
            of mankind and their contumelious disdain.' To allay envy, it <lb/>
            may be observed, ' that such advantages have been gained by <lb/>
            extreme toil and imminent perils; that they have not been <lb/>
            applied to the individual's own private benefit, but that of <lb/>
            others; that he himself, if he appear to have gained any glory, <lb/>
            although it might not be an undue reward for danger, was not <lb/>
            elated with it, but wholly set it aside and undervalued it;' and <lb/>
            such an effect must by all means be produced (since most men <lb/>
            are envious, and it is a most common and prevalent vice, and <lb/>
            envy is felt towards all super-eminent and flourishing fortune), <lb/>
            that the opinion entertained of such characters be lowered, <lb/>
            and that their fortunes, so excellent in people's imaginations-, <lb/>
            may appear mingled with labour and trouble.</p>
          <p>" Pity is excited, if he who hears can be induced to apply <lb/>
            to his own circumstances those unhappy particulars which <lb/>
            are lamented in the case of others, particulars which they <lb/>
            have either suffered or fear to suffer; and while he looks at <lb/>
            another, to glance frequently at himself. Thus, as all the <lb/>
            circumstances incident to human suffering are heard with <lb/>
            concern, if they are pathetically represented, so virtue in <lb/>
            affliction and humiliation is the most sorrowful of all objects <lb/>
            of contemplation; and as that other department of eloquence <lb/>
            which, by its recommendation of goodness, ought to give the <note type="footnote"> 1 Quce si inflammanda sunt. An elegant mode of expression, for <lb/>

            picture of a virtuous man, should be in a gentle and (as <lb/>
            I have often observed) a submissive strain, so this, which is <lb/>
            adopted by the orator to effect a change in the minds of the <lb/>

            tions of an audience, ought to mingle with the ardour with <lb/>
            which we awaken their passions; and something of this ardour <lb/>
            should occasionally communicate a warmth to our gentleness <lb/>
            of language; nor is there any species of eloquence better <lb/>
            tempered than that in which the asperity of contention in <lb/>
            the orator is mitigated by his humanity, or in which the <lb/>
            relaxed tone of lenity is sustained by a becoming gravity and, <lb/>
            energy. But in both modes of speaking, as well that in which <lb/>
            spirit and force are required as that which is brought down to <lb/>
            ordinary life and manners, the beginning should be slow, but <lb/>
            the sequel full and diffuse.1 For you must not spring at <lb/>
            once into the pathetic portion of your speech, as it forms no <lb/>
            part of the question, and men are first desirous to learn the <lb/>
            very point that is to come under their judgment; nor, when <lb/>
            you have entered upon that track, are ypu suddenly to di- <lb/>
            verge from it; for you are not to suppose that as an argument <lb/>
            is understood as soon as it is stated, and a second and a third <lb/>
            are then desired, so you can with the same ease move com- <lb/>
            passion, or envy, or anger, as soon as you make the attempt.2 <lb/>
            Reason itself confirms an argument which fixes itself in the <lb/>
            mind as soon as it is delivered; but that sort of eloquence <lb/>
            does not aim at instructing the judge, but rather at agitating <lb/>
            his mind by excessive emotion, which no one can produce <lb/>
            unless by fulness and variety and even copiousness of lan- <lb/>
            guage, and a proportionate energy of delivery. Those, there- <lb/>
            fore, who speak either with brevity, or in a low submissive <lb/>
            strain, may indeed inform the judge, but can never move <lb/>
            him, an effect on which success altogether depends. <note type="footnote"> 1 Exitus spissi et produce esse debent. " Non abrupt!, sed lenti." <lb/>

             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">C. LIV.]</note>" It is clear, that the ability of arguing on every subject on <lb/>
            both sides of the question is drawn from the same considera- <lb/>
            tions. But we must resist the force of an argument, either <lb/>
            by refuting those things which are assumed, in support of it, <lb/>
            or by showing that the conclusion which our, opponents <lb/>
            would draw cannot be deduced from the premises, or possibly <lb/>
            follow from them; or, if you cannot refute an argument in <lb/>
            this manner, you must bring something against it of .greater <lb/>
            or equal weight. But whatever is delivered with gentleness <lb/>
            to conciliate favour, or with vehemence to excite emotion, is <lb/>
            to be obviated1 by moving contrary feelings, so that benevo- <lb/>
            lence may be eradicated by hatred, and compassion be <lb/>
            dispelled by jealousy.</p>
          <p>LIV. " A jocose manner, too, and strokes of wit, give <lb/>
            pleasure to an audience, and are often of great advantage <lb/>
            to the speaker; qualities which, even if everything else <lb/>
            can be taught by art, are certainly peculiar gifts of nature, <lb/>
            and require no aid from instruction. In that department <lb/>
            you, Caesar, in my opinion, far excel all other men; on <lb/>
            which account you can better bear me testimony, either <lb/>
            that there is no art in wit, or, if there be any, you will <lb/>
            best instruct us in it.", "I indeed," says Cæsar, "think <lb/>
            that a man who is not destitute of polite learning can dis- <lb/>
            course upon any subject more wittily than upon wit itself. <lb/>
            Accordingly, when I met with some Greek books entitled <lb/>
            'On Jests,' I conceived some hope that I might learn something <lb/>
            from them. I found, it is true, many laughable and witty <lb/>
            sayings of the Greeks; for those of Sicily excel in that way, <lb/>
            as well as the Rhodians and Byzantines, but, above all, the <lb/>
            people of Attica. But they who have attempted to deliver <lb/>
            rules and principles on that subject, have shown themselves <lb/>
            so extremely foolish, that nothing else in them has excited <lb/>
            laughter but their folly. This talent, therefore, appears to me <lb/>
            incapable of being communicated by teaching. As there are <lb/>
            two kinds of wit, one running regularly through a whole <lb/>
            speech, the other pointed and concise; the ancients denomi- <lb/>
            nated the former humour,2 the. latter jesting. Each sort <note type="footnote"> 1 Orellius's text has inferenda ; many others, efferenda. There have <lb/>
            been various conjectures offered, as infirmanda, evertenda, elevanda, <lb/>

            has but a light name, and justly;1 for it is altogether but <lb/>
            a light thing to raise a laugh. However, as you observe, <lb/>
            Antonius, I have seen advantageous effects produced in plead- <lb/>
            ings by the aid of wit and humour; but, as in the former <lb/>
            kind, I mean humour that runs through a speech, no aid from <lb/>
            art is required, (for Nature forms and produces men to be <lb/>
            facetious mimics or story-tellers; their look, and voice, and <lb/>
            mode of expression assisting their conceptions;) so likewise <lb/>
            in the other, that of occasional facetiousness, what room <lb/>
            is there for art, when the joke ought to be uttered, and <lb/>
            fixed in the mind of the hearer, before it appears possible to <lb/>
            have been conceived ? For what assistance could my brother <lb/>
            here receive from art, when, being asked by Philippus why he <lb/>
            barked so, he replied, Because the saw a thief ? Or what aid <lb/>
            could Crassus have received in that whole speech which he <lb/>
            delivered before the Centumviri, in opposition to Scævola, or <lb/>
            when he pleaded for Cneius Plancus against the accusation of <lb/>
            Brutus ? For that talent which you, Antonius, attribute to <lb/>
            me, must be allowed to Crassus by the confession of all man- <lb/>
            kind; since hardly any person can be found besides him <lb/>
            eminent in both these kinds of wit, that which runs through <lb/>
            a continued discourse, and that which consists in smartness and <lb/>
            occasional jokes. His whole defence in the cause of Curius, in <lb/>
            opposition to Scævola, was redundant with a certain pleasantry <lb/>
            and humour; but of those sharp short jests it had none; for <lb/>
            he was tender of the dignity of his opponent, and in that <lb/>
            respect maintained his own; though it is extremely difficult for <lb/>
            men of wit and facetiousness to preserve a regard to persons <lb/>
            and times, and to suppress what occurs to them when it may <lb/>
            be expressed with most pungent effect. Accordingly, some , <lb/>
            jesters put a humorous interpretation upon the well-known <lb/>
            words of Ennius; for he said, as they observe, That a wise <lb/>
            man can more easily keep in flame while his mouth is on fire, <lb/>
            than withhold ' bona dicta? good words; and they say that <lb/>
            good words mean witty sayings ; for sayings are called dicta <lb/>
            by an appropriate term.</p>
          <p>LV. " But as Crassus forbore from such jests in his speech <lb/>
            against Scævola, and sported throughout that cause and dis- <lb/>
            cussion with that other species of humour in which there are <note type="footnote"> 1 Quippe; leve enim, &amp;c. Quippe is equivalent to the Greek <unclear>εἰκόιας</unclear> <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. LV.] </note> <lb/>
            no stings of sarcasm; liD in that against Brutus, whom he <lb/>
            hated, and thought deserving of insult, he fought with both <lb/>
            kinds of wit. How many severe things did he say about the <lb/>
            baths which Brutus had lately sold? how many on the loss of <lb/>
            his paternal estate? And they were concise; as when Brutus, <lb/>
            speaking of himself, said thai he sweated without cause. 'No <lb/>
            wonder that you sweat,' said Crassus, 'for you are just turned <lb/>
            but of the baths.' There were innumerable things of this kind <lb/>
            in the speech, but his continuous vein of pleasantry was not <lb/>
            less amusing; for when Brutus had called up two readers, <lb/>
            and had given to one the speech of Crassus upon the colony of <lb/>
            Narbonne, to the other that on the Servilian law, to read, and <lb/>
            had compared together the contradictory sections on public <lb/>
            affairs contained in each, our friend very facetiously gave the <lb/>
            three books of Brutus's father, written on the civil law, to <lb/>
            three different persons to read. Out of the first book was <lb/>
            read this sentence, ' It happened by chance that we were on <lb/>
            my estate at Privernum.' On which clause Crassus made <lb/>
            this observation, 'Brutus, your father testifies that he left you <lb/>
            an estate at Privernum.' Again, out of the second book, ' My <lb/>
            son Marcus and I were at my Alban villa;' when Crassus <lb/>
            remarked, ' This wise man, who was justly ranked among <lb/>
            the wisest in our city, had evidently some foreknowledge of this <lb/>
            spendthrift's character, and was afraid, that when he came to <lb/>
            have nothing, it might be imagined that nothing was left him. <lb/>
            Afterwards out of the third book, with which the author con- <lb/>
            eluded his work, (for that number of books, as I have heard <lb/>
            Scævola say, are the genuine compositions of Brutus,) , It <lb/>
            chanced that my son Marcus and myself were sitting in my <lb/>
            villa near Tibur;' when Crassus exclaimed, ' Where are those <lb/>
            estates now, Brutus, that your father left you, as recorded in his <lb/>
            public commentaries ? But if he had not seen you arrived at the <lb/>
            age of puberty, he would have composed a fourth book, and left <lb/>
            it in writing that he talked with his son in his own baths.' <lb/>
            Who does not acknowledge, now, that Brutus was not less con- <lb/>
            futed by this humour, these comic jests, than by that tragic <lb/>
            tone which the same orator adopted, when by accident, <lb/>
            during the hearing of the same cause, the funeral procession <lb/>
            of the old lady Junia passed by? Ye immortal gods! what <lb/>
            force and energy was that with which he spoke! how uncx- <lb/>
            pected! how sudden! when, casting his eyes that way, with <pb n="286"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II.</note> <lb/>
            his whole gesture directed towards Brutus, with the utmost <lb/>
            gravity and rapidity of expression, he exclaimed, 'Brutus, why <lb/>
            do you sit still ? What would you have that old lady communi- <lb/>
            cate to your father ? What to all those whose statues you see carried <lb/>
            by ? What to your other ancestors ? What to Lucius Brutus, who <lb/>
            freed this people from regal tyranny? What shall she say that <lb/>
            you are doing ? What business, what glory, what virtue shall she <lb/>
            say that you are pursuing ? That you are engaged in increasing <lb/>
            your patrimony ? But that is no characteristic of nobility. Yet <lb/>
            suppose it were; you have none left to increase ; your extrava- <lb/>
            gance has squandered the whole of it. That you are studying the <lb/>
            civil law ? That was your father's pursuit; but she will relate <lb/>
            that when you sold your house, you did not even among the <lb/>
            moveables1 reserve the chair from which your father answered his <lb/>
            clients. That you are applying to the military art ? You who <lb/>
            have never seen a camp. Or to eloquence ? But no portion of <lb/>
            eloquence dwells in you; and such power of voice and tongue <lb/>
            as you have, you have devoted to the infamous trade of a com- <lb/>
            mon informer. Dare you even behold the light ? Or look this <lb/>
            assembly in the face I Dare you present yourself in the forum, <lb/>
            in the city, in the public assembly of the citizens ? Do you not <lb/>
            fear even that dead corpse, and those very images of your an- <lb/>
            cestors, you who have not only left yourself no room for the <lb/>
            imitation of their virtues, but none in which you can place their <lb/>
            statues?'</p>
          <p>LVI. " This is in a tragic and sublime strain of language; <lb/>
            but you all recollect instances without number of facetious- <lb/>
            ness and polite humour in one speech; for never was there <lb/>
            a more vehement dispute on any occasion, or an oration of <lb/>
            greater power delivered before the people, than that of <lb/>
            Crassus lately in his censorship, in opposition to his col- <lb/>
            league, nor one better seasoned with wit and humour. I <lb/>
            agree with you, therefore, Antonius, in both points, that <lb/>
            jesting is often of great advantage in speaking, and that it <lb/>
            cannot be taught by any rules of art. But I am astonished <lb/>
            that you should attribute so much power to me in that way, <lb/>
            and not assign to Crassus the palm of pre-eminence in this as <note type="footnote"> 1 Ne in rutis quidem et cœssis. Ruta were such things as could be <lb/>
            removed from houses and other premises without pulling down or <lb/>

            sutting down of trees. </note> <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LVII.] </note> <lb/>
            in other departments of eloquence." " I should have done <lb/>
            so," said Antonius, " if I had not sometimes envied Crassus <lb/>
            a little in this respect; for to be ever so facetious and witty <lb/>
            is not of itself an extraordinary subject of envy; but, <lb/>
            when you are the most graceful and polite of speakers, to be, <lb/>
            and to be thought, at the same time, the most grave and <lb/>
            dignified of men, a distinction which has been granted to <lb/>
            Crassus alone, seems to me almost unendurable." Crassus <lb/>
            having smiled at this, Antonius said, " But, Julius, while you <lb/>
            denied that art had anything to do with facetiousness, you <lb/>
            brought to our notice something that seemed worthy of pre- <lb/>
            tept; for you said that regard ought to be paid to persons, <lb/>
            times, and circumstances, that jesting might not detract from <lb/>
            dignity; a rule which is particularly observed by Crassus. <lb/>
            But this rule only directs that jokes should be suppressed <lb/>
            when there is no fair occasion for them; what we desire to <lb/>
            know is, how we may use them when there is occasion; as <lb/>
            against an adversary, especially if his folly be open to attack, <lb/>
            or against a foolish, covetous, trifling witness, if the audience <lb/>
            seem disposed to listen patiently. Those sayings are more <lb/>
            likely to be approved which we utter on provocation, than <lb/>
            those which we utter when we begin an attack; for the <lb/>
            quickness of wit, which is shown in answering, is more re- <lb/>
            markable, and to reply is thought allowable, as being natural <lb/>
            to the human temper; since it is presumed that we should <lb/>
            have remained quiet if we had not been attacked; as in that <lb/>
            very speech to which you alluded scarcely anything was said <lb/>
            by our friend Crassus here, anything at least that was at all <lb/>
            humorous, which he did not utter in reply, and on provocation. <lb/>
            For there was so much gravity and authority in Domitius, <lb/>
            that the objections which came from him seemed more likely <lb/>
            to be enfeebled by jests than broken by arguments."</p>
          <p>LVII. Sulpicius soon after said, "Shall we, then, suffer <lb/>
            Cæsar, who, though he allows wit to Crassus, is yet himself <lb/>
            far more intent on acquiring a character for it, to exempt <note type="footnote"> 1 Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus, in his tribuneship, A.U.C. 651, was <lb/>

            what is the nature of it, and from whence derived; espe- <lb/>
            cially as he owns that there is so much efficacy and advantage <lb/>
            in wit and jesting?" "What if I agree with Antonius," re- <lb/>
            joined Cæsar, "in thinking that art has no concern with wit?" <lb/>
            As Sulpicius made no remark, " As if," said Crassus, " art <lb/>
            could at all assist in acquiring those talents of which An- <lb/>
            tonius has been so long speaking. There is a certain obser- <lb/>
            vation to be paid, as he remarked, to those particulars which <lb/>
            are most effective in oratory; but if such observation could <lb/>
            , make men eloquent, who would not be so? For who could <lb/>
            not learn these particulars, if not with ease, at least in some <lb/>
            way ? But I think that of such precepts, the use and advan- <lb/>
            tage is, not that we may be directed by art to find out what <lb/>
            we are to say, but that we may either feel certain as to what <lb/>
            we attain by natural parts, by study, or by exercise, that <lb/>
            it is right, or understand that it is wrong, having been in- <lb/>
            structed to what rule the several particulars are to be referred. <lb/>
            I, therefore, also join in the petition to you, Cæsar, that you <lb/>
            would, if it is agreeable to you, tell us what you think on <lb/>
            jocoseness in general, lest, by accident, any part of eloquence, <lb/>
            since that is your object, should appear to have been passed <lb/>
            over in so learned an assembly, and such a studied con- <lb/>
            versation." "Well, then, Crassus," replied Cæsar, "since <lb/>
            you require payment from a guest, I will, by refusing it, <lb/>
            furnish you with a pretext for refusing to entertain us again; <lb/>
            though I am often astonished at the impudence of those who <lb/>
            act upon the stage while Roscius is a spectator of their <lb/>
            attitudes; for who can make the least motion without Roscius <lb/>
            seeing his imperfections? So I shall now have to speak first <lb/>
            on wit in the hearing of Crassus, and to teach like a swine,1 <lb/>
            as they say, that orator of whom Catulus said, when he <lb/>

            deserve to be fed on ambrosia. But let us hear you, Caesar, <lb/>

            labour and the length of what I have said, I shall repose <lb/>
            during the discourse of Cæsar as in some opportune place of <lb/>
            entertainment." LVIII. " But," said Cæsar, " you will not <lb/>
            pronounce my entertainment very liberal; for as soon as you <lb/>
            have tasted a little I shall thrust you out, and turn you into <lb/>
            the road again. However, not to detain you any longer, I <lb/>
            will deliver my sentiments very briefly on this department <lb/>
            of eloquence in general.</p>
          <p>" Concerning laughter, there are five things which are sub- <lb/>
            jects of consideration: one, "What it is;' another, 'Whence <lb/>
            it originates;' a third, '.Whether it becomes the orator to <lb/>
            wish to excite laughter;' a fourth, 'To what degree;' a fifth, <lb/>
            ' What are the several kinds of the ridiculous?' As to the <lb/>
            first, ' What laughter itself is,' by what means it is excited, <lb/>
            where it lies, how it arises, and bursts forth so suddenly that <lb/>
            we are unable, though we desire, to restrain it, and how it <lb/>
            affects at once the sides, the face, the veins, the countenance, <lb/>
            the eyes, let Democritus consider; for all this has nothing to <lb/>
            do with my remarks, and if it had to do with them, I should <lb/>
            not be ashamed to say that I am ignorant of that which not <lb/>
            even they understand who profess to explain it. But the seat <lb/>
            and as it were province of what is laughed at, (for that is <lb/>
            the next point of inquiry,) lies in a certain offensiveness <lb/>
            and deformity; for those sayings are laughed at solely or <lb/>
            chiefly which point out and designate something offensive in <lb/>
            an inoffensive manner. But, to come to the third point, it <lb/>
            certainly becomes the orator to excite laughter; either because <lb/>
            mirth itself attracts favour to him by whom it is raised; or <lb/>
            because all admire wit, which is often comprised in a single <lb/>
            word, especially in him who replies, and sometimes in him <lb/>
            who attacks; or because it overthrows the adversary, or <lb/>
            hampers him, or makes light of him, or discourages, or refutes <lb/>
            him; or because it proves the orator himself to be a man of <lb/>
            taste, or learning, or polish; but chiefly because it mitigates <lb/>
            and relaxes gravity and severity, and often, by a joke or a <lb/>
            laugh, breaks the force of offensive remarks, which cannot <lb/>
            easily be overthrown by arguments. But to what degree the <lb/>
            laughable should be carried by the orator requires very dill- <lb/>
            gent consideration; a point which we placed as the fourth <lb/>
            subject of inquiry; for neither great vice, such as is united <note type="footnote"> u </note> <pb n="290"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>

            laughter; since people will have those guilty of enormous <lb/>
            crimes attacked with more forcible weapons than ridicule; <lb/>
            and do not like the miserable to be derided, unless perhaps <lb/>
            when they are insolent; and you must be considerate, too, <lb/>

            those who are. personally beloved.</p>
          <p>LIX. "Such is the caution that must be principally observed <lb/>
            in joking. Those subjects accordingly are most readily jested <lb/>
            upon which are neither provocative of violent aversion, nor of <lb/>
            extreme compassion. All matter for ridicule is therefore <lb/>
            found to lie in such defects as are to be observed in the <lb/>
            characters of men not in universal esteem, nor in calamitous <lb/>
            circumstances, and who do not appear deserving to be dragged <lb/>
            to punishment for their crimes; such topics nicely managed <lb/>
            create laughter. In deformity, also, and bodily defects, is <lb/>
            found fair enough matter for ridicule; but we have to ask <lb/>
            the same question here as is asked on other points, ' How far <lb/>
            the ridicule maybe carried?' In this respect it is not only <lb/>
            directed that the orator should say nothing impertinently, <lb/>
            but also that, even if he can say anything very ridiculously, <lb/>
            he should avoid both errors, lest his jokes become either buf- <lb/>
            foonery or mimicry; qualities of which we shall better under- <lb/>
            stand the nature when we come to consider the different <lb/>
            species of the ridiculous.</p>
          <p>"There are two sorts of jokes, one of which is excited by <lb/>
            things, the other by words. By things, whenever any matter <lb/>
            is told in the way of a story; as you, Crassus, formerly <lb/>
            stated in a speech against Memmius,l That he had eaten <lb/>
            a piece of Largius's arm, because he had had a quarrel with <lb/>
            him at Tarracina about a courtezan; it was a witty story, but <lb/>
            wholly of your own invention. You added this particular, <lb/>
            that throughout Tarracina these letters were inscribed on <lb/>
            every wall, MM, LLL; and that when you inquired what they <lb/>
            meant, an old man of the town replied, Mordacious Memmius <lb/>
            Lacerates Largius's Limb.2 You perceive clearly how face- <note type="footnote"> I The same that is mentioned by Sallust, as having accused Calpurnius <lb/>

            tious this mode of joking may be, how elegant, how suitable' <lb/>
            to an orator; whether you have any true story to tell, (which. <lb/>
            however must be interspersed with fictitious circumstances,) <lb/>
            or whether you merely invent. The excellence of such jesting- <lb/>
            is, that you can describe things as occurring in such a way, <lb/>
            that the manners, the language, and every look of the person <lb/>
            of whom you speak, may be represented, so that the occur- <lb/>
            rence may seem to the audience to pass and take place at the <lb/>
            very time when you address them. Another kind of jest <lb/>
            taken from things, is that which is derived from a depraved <lb/>
            sort of imitation, or mimicry; as when Crassus also exclaimed, <lb/>
            By your nobility, by your family, what else was there at which <lb/>
            the assembly could laugh but that mimicry of look and tone?" <lb/>
            But when he said, by your statues, and added something of <lb/>
            gesture by extending his arm, we all laughed immoderately.1 <lb/>
            Of this species is Roscius's imitation of an old man; when, <lb/>
            he says, <lb/>
            For you, my Antipho, I plant these trees,2 <lb/>
            it is old age itself that seems to speak while I listen to him- <lb/>
            But all this department of ridicule is of such a nature that it <lb/>
            must be attempted with the greatest caution. For if the <lb/>
            imitation is too extravagant, it becomes, like indecency, the <lb/>
            part of players in pantomime and farce; the orator should be <lb/>
            moderate in imitation, that the audience may conceive more <lb/>
            than they can see represented by him; he ought also to give - <lb/>
            proof of ingenuousness and modesty, by avoiding everything <lb/>
            offensive or unbecoming in word or act.</p>
          <p>LX. " These, therefore, are the two kinds of the ridiculous <lb/>
            which is drawn from things; and they suit well with con- <lb/>
            tinuous pieces of humour, in which the manners of mankind <lb/>
            are so described and expressed, that, either by means of some <lb/>
            narrative, their character is exactly understood, or, by throw- <lb/>
            ing in a little mimicry, they may be convicted of some- <lb/>
            impropriety remarkable enough for ridicule. But in words,. <lb/>
            the ridiculous is that which is excited by the point of a par- <note type="footnote"> eaten or bitten Largius'a arm, appears, from what Cicero says, to have- <lb/>

            ticular expression or thought: but as, in the former kind, <lb/>
            both in narration and imitation, all resemblance to the <lb/>
            players of pantomime should be avoided, so, in this, all <lb/>
            scurrilous buffoonery is to be studiously shunned by the <lb/>
            orator. How, then, shall we distinguish from Crassus, from <lb/>
            Catulus, and from others, your acquaintance Granius, or my <lb/>
            friend Vargula ? No proper distinction really occurs to me; <lb/>
            for they are both witty ; no man has more of verbal wit- <lb/>
            ticism than Granius. The first point to be observed, how- <lb/>
            ever, is, I think, that we should not fancy ourselves obliged <lb/>
            to utter a jest whenever one may be uttered. A very little <lb/>
            witness was produced. May I question him ? says Philippus. <lb/>
            The judge who presided,1 being in a hurry, replied, .es, <lb/>
            if he is short. You shall have no fault to find, said Philippus, <lb/>
            for I shall question him very short. This was ridiculous <lb/>
            enough; but Lucius Aurifex was sitting as judge in the <lb/>
            cause, who was shorter than the witness himself; so that all <lb/>
            the laughter was turned upon the judge, and hence the joke <lb/>
            appeared scurrilous. Those good things, therefore, which hit <lb/>
            those whom you do not mean to hit, however witty they are, <lb/>
            are yet in their nature scurrilous; as when Appius, who <lb/>
            would be thought witty,-and indeed is so, but sometimes <lb/>
            slides into this fault of scurrility,-said to Caius Sextius, an <lb/>
            acquaintance of mine, who is blind of an eye, I will sup with <lb/>
            you to-night, for I see that there is a vacancy for one. This <lb/>
            was a scurrilous joke, both because he attacked Sextius <lb/>
            without provocation, and said what was equally applicable <lb/>
            to all one-eyed persons. Such jokes, as they are thought <lb/>
            premeditated, excite less laughter; but the reply of Sextius <lb/>
            was excellent and extempore: Wash your hands,2 said he, <lb/>
            and come to supper. A regard, therefore, to proper times, <lb/>
            moderation and forbearance in jesting, and a limitation in <lb/>
            the number of jokes, will distinguish the orator from the <lb/>
            buffoon; and the circumstance, besides, that we joke with an <lb/>
            object, not that we may appear to be jesters, but that we may <lb/>
            gain some advantage, while they joke all day without any <note type="footnote"> 1 Quæsitor. The magistrate who presided at a quæstio capitalis, <lb/>

            purpose whatever. For what did Vargula gain by saying, <lb/>
            when Aulus Sempronius, then a candidate for office, and his <lb/>
            brother Marcus, saluted him, Boy, drive away the flies? ? His <lb/>
            aim was to raise a laugh, which is, in my opinion, a very poor <lb/>
            effect of wit. The proper season, then, for jesting, we must <lb/>
            determine by our own prudence and judgment; in the exer- <lb/>
            cise of which I wish that we had some body of rules to direct <lb/>
            us; but nature is the sovereign guide.</p>
          <p>LXI. " Let us now consider briefly the sorts of jests that <lb/>
            chiefly excite laughter. Let this, then, be our first division, <lb/>
            that whatever is expressed wittily, consists sometimes in <lb/>
            a thought, sometimes in the mere language, but that men <lb/>
            are most delighted with a joke when the laugh is raised by <lb/>
            the thought and the language in conjunction. But remember <lb/>
            this, that whatever topics I shall touch upon, from which <lb/>
            ridicule may be drawn, from almost the same topics serious <lb/>
            thoughts may be derived: there is only this difference, that <lb/>
            seriousness is used on dignified subjects with gravity, joking <lb/>
            on such as are in some degree unbecoming, and as it were <lb/>
            grotesque; for instance, we may with the very same words <lb/>
            commend a thrifty servant, and jest upon one that is ex- <lb/>
            travagant. That old saying of Nero about a thieving servant <lb/>
            is humorous enough, That he was the only one from whom <lb/>
            nothing in the house was sealed or locked up; a thing which <lb/>
            is not only said of a good servant, but in the very same <lb/>
            words. From the same sources spring all kinds of sayings. <lb/>
            What his mother said to Spurius Carvilius, who halted griev- <lb/>
            ously from a wound received in the public service, and was <lb/>
            on that account ashamed to go out of doors, Go, my Spurius, <lb/>
            that as often as you take a step you may be reminded of your <lb/>
            merits, was a noble and serious thought; but what Glaucia <lb/>
            said to Calvinus, when he limped, Where is the old proverb— <lb/>
            Does he claudicate ? no; but he clodicates,2 is ridiculous; and <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably taken from the apophthegms of Cato, and probably, also, <lb/>

            by a literal translation. I have been forced to coin two English words <lb/>
            from the Latin to convey some idea of it. Had Clodius lived in this <lb/>

            jest from which serious and grave reflections may not be <lb/>
            drawn. It is also to be observed that everything which is <lb/>
            ridiculous is not witty; for what can be so ridiculous as a <lb/>
            buffoon ?4 But it is by his face, his appearance, his look, his <lb/>

            ludicrous, namely mimicry; but it is allowable only in us to <lb/>
            attempt it cautiously, if ever we do attempt it, and but for a <lb/>
            moment, otherwise it is far from becoming to a man of edu- <lb/>
            cation. A third is distortion of features, utterly unworthy <lb/>
            of us. A fourth is indecency in language, a disgrace not only <lb/>
            to the forum, but to any company of well-bred people. So <lb/>
            many things, then, being deducted from this part of oratory, <lb/>
            the kinds of jesting which remain are (as I distinguished <lb/>
            them before) such as consist in thought or in expression. <lb/>
            That which, in whatever terms you express it, is still wit, <lb/>
            consists in the thought; that which by a change of words <lb/>
            loses its spirit, has no wit but what depends on expression.</p>
          <p>" Plays on ambiguous words are extremely ingenious, but <lb/>
            depend wholly on the expression, not on the matter. They <lb/>
            seldom, however, excite much laughter, but are rather com- <lb/>
            mended as jests of elegance and scholarship; as that about <lb/>
            Titius, whom, being a great tennis-player, and at the same <lb/>
            time suspected of having broken the sacred images by night, <lb/>
            Terentius Vespa excused, when his companions inquired for <lb/>
            him, as he did not come to the Campus Martius, by saying <lb/>
            that he had broken an arm. Or as that of Africanus, which <lb/>
            is in Lucilius, <lb/>
            Quid ? Decius, nuculam an confixum vis facere ? inquit.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 This verse of Lucilius would be unintelligible to us, even if we <lb/>
            were certain that the reading of it is sound. Heusinger thinks that <lb/>
            Lucilius referred to the game played with nuts, which the author of <lb/>
            the elegy entitled "Nux" mentions : Quas puer aut rectus certo dila- <lb/>
            ninat ictu. Others think that canfixum facere signifies merely confi- <lb/>
            gere. Ernesti supposes that a sort of dish, made of pieces of flesh, <lb/>
            fricasee, is meant. Schutz suggests that, if this be the meaning of <lb/>
            confixum, a )me kind of eatable must be intended by nucula. But thia <lb/>
            profits us nothing. EUendt. </note> <pb n="296"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            Or, as your friend Granius, Crassus, said of somebody, Thai <lb/>
            he was not worth the sixth part of an as.1 And if you were <lb/>
            to ask me, I should say that he who is called a jester, excels <lb/>
            chiefly in jokes of this kind; but that other jests excite <lb/>
            laughter in a greater degree. The ambiguous gains great <lb/>
            admiration, as I observed before, from its nature, for it ap- <lb/>
            pears the part of a wit to be able to turn the force of a word <lb/>
            to quite another sense than that in which other people take <lb/>
            it; but it excites surprise rather than laughter, uuless when <lb/>
            it happens to be joined with some other sorts of jesting.</p>
          <p>LXIII. " Some of these sorts of jesting I will now run over: <lb/>
            but you are aware that that is the most common kind of joke, <lb/>
            when we expect one thing and another is said; in which case <lb/>
            our own disappointed expectation makes us laugh. But if <lb/>
            something of the ambiguous is thrown in with it, the wit is <lb/>
            heightened; as in Nævius, a man seems to be moved with <lb/>
            compassion who, seeing another, that was sentenced for debt, <lb/>
            being led away, inquires, For how much is he adjudged ? <lb/>
            He is answered, A thousand sestertii. If he had then added <lb/>
            only, You may take him away, it would have been a species <lb/>
            of joke that takes you by surprise; but as he said, I add <lb/>
            no more; you may take him away, (thus introducing the <lb/>
            ambiguous, another kind of jest,) the repartee, as it seems <lb/>
            to me, is rendered witty in the highest degree. Such equi- <lb/>
            vocation is most happy, when, in any dispute, a word is <lb/>
            caught from your adversary, and thence something severe is <lb/>
            turned upon the very person who gave the provocation, as by <lb/>
            Catulus upon Philippus.2 But as there are several sorts of <lb/>
            ambiguity, with regard to which accurate study is necessary, <lb/>
            we should be attentive and on the watch for words; and thus, <lb/>
            though we may avoid frigid witticisms, (for we must be cau- <lb/>
            tious that a jest be not thought far-fetched,) we shall hit upon <lb/>
            many acute sayings. Another kind is that w'lich consists in <lb/>
            a. slight change in a word, which, when produced by the alte- <lb/>
            ration of a letter, the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρονομασία</foreign>, as Cato called <lb/>
            Nobilior Mobilior; or as, when he had said to a certain <note type="footnote"> 1 Non esse sextantis. A phrase applied either to anything worth more <lb/>
            than a sextans, and therefore perhaps of great value, or to anything <lb/>
            worth less than a sextans, or of no value at all. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See c. 54. </note><note type="footnote"> a Marcus Fulvius Nobilior. Cato had accused him of having taken </note> <pb n="297"/>

            that repartee of the same Cato, If you are both adverse <lb/>
            and averse in your shameless practices. The interpretation <lb/>
            of a name also has wit in it, when you assign a ridiculous <lb/>
            reason why a person is so called; as I lately said of <lb/>
            Nummius, who distributed money2 at elections, that he had <lb/>
            found a name in the Campus Martius as Neoptolemus found <lb/>
            one at Troy.</p>
          <p>LXIV. " All such jokes lie in a single word. Often too <lb/>
            a verse is humorously introduced, either just as it is, or with <lb/>
            some little alteration; or some part of a verse, as Statius <lb/>
            said to Scaurus when in a violent passion: (whence some <lb/>
            say, Crassus, that your law 3 on citizenship had its rise:)</p>
          <p>Hush I Silence I what is all this noise I Have you, <lb/>
            Who neither have a father nor a mother, <lb/>
            Such confidence ? Away with all that pride.</p>
          <p>In the case of Cælius, that joke of yours, Antonius, was <lb/>
            assuredly of advantage to your cause; when, appearing as a <lb/>
            witness, he had admitted that a great deal of money had <lb/>
            gone from him, and as he had a son who was a man of plea- <lb/>
            sure, you, as he was going away, said, <lb/>
            See you the old man, touch'd for thirty minæ ?</p>
          <p>To the same purpose proverbs may be applied; as in the <lb/>
            joke of Scipio, when Asellus was boasting that while he had <lb/>
            served in the army, he had marched through all the pro- <lb/>
            vinces, Drive an ass, &amp;cc.4 Such jokes, as they cannot, if any <note type="footnote"> poets with him into his province, and called him Mobilior, to denote his <lb/>
            levity, which, among the Romans, who were fond of gravity and steadi- <lb/>

            had also built a temple to the Muses. Cic. ib. et Arch. c. 11; Brut. <lb/>

            on the mere expression.</p>
          <p>" There is also a kind of joke, not at all absurd, which lies <lb/>
            in expression, when you seem to understand a thing literally, <lb/>
            and not in its obvious meaning; in which kind it was that <lb/>
            Tutor,1 the old mimic, an exceedingly laughable actor, ex- <lb/>
            -elusively distinguished himself. But I have nothing to do <lb/>
            with actors; I only wished this kind of jesting to be illus- <lb/>
            trated by some notable example. Of this kind was your <lb/>
            answer lately, Crassus, to one who asked you whether he <lb/>
            should be troublesome if he came to you some time before it was <lb/>
            light: and you said, You will not be troublesome: when he <lb/>
            rejoined, You will order yourself to be waked then ? to which <lb/>
            you replied, Surely I said that you would not be troublesome. <lb/>
            Of the same sort was that old joke which they say that Mar- <lb/>
            cus Scipio Maluginensis made, when he had to report from <lb/>
            his century that Acidinus was voted consul, and the officer <lb/>
            cried out, Declare as to Lucius Manlius, he said, I declare <lb/>
            him to be a worthy man, and an excellent member of the com-' <lb/>
            monwealth. The answer of Lucius [Porcius] 2 Nasica to Cato <lb/>
            the censor was humorous enough, when Cato said to him, Are <lb/>
            you truly satisfied that you have taken a wife ? No, indeed, <lb/>
            replied Nasica, I am not truly satisfied.3 Such jests are in- <lb/>
            sipid, or witty only when another answer is expected; for <lb/>
            our surprise (as I before4 observed) naturally amuses us; <lb/>
            and thus, when we are deceived, as it were, in our expectation, <lb/>
            we laugh.</p>
          <p>LXV. " Those jests also lie in words, which spring from <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναιο βοῦν, ἔλαυνε ὄνον</foreign>, " If you cannot drive an ox, drive an ass," (see <lb/>
            Apostol. Provo vii. 53; Zenob. iii. 54;) but that proverb seems inap- <lb/>
            plicable to this passage. Talæus and Lambinus suppose, with more <lb/>
            probability, that something like this must be understood : Agas asellum, <lb/>
            cursum non docebitur. Asellus is again mentioned in c. 66. Ellendt, </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Nothing is recorded of that actor in pantomime. Ellendt. <lb/>

            tentia had two significations: they were used by the censors in putting <lb/>

            common conversation in the sense of " to a person's satisfaction." From <lb/>
            the ambiguity of the phrase proceeds the joke. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 C. 63. </note> <pb n="299"/>

            some allegorical phraseology, or from a metaphorical use of <lb/>
            some one word, or from using words ironically. From alle- <lb/>
            gorical phraseology: as when Rusca, in old times, proposed <lb/>
            the law to fix the ages of candidates for offices, and Marcus <lb/>
            Servilius, who opposed the law, said to him; Tell me, Marcus <lb/>
            Pinarius Rusca, if I speak against you, will you speak ill of <lb/>
            me as you have spoken of others ? As you shall sow, replied <lb/>
            he, so you shall reap. From the use of a single word in a <lb/>
            metaphorical sense: as when the elder Scipio said to the <lb/>
            Corinthians, who offered to put up a statue of him in the <lb/>
            place where those of other commanders were, That he did not <lb/>
            like such comrades. From the ironical use of words : as <lb/>
            when Crassus spoke for Aculeo before Marcus Perperna as <lb/>
            judge, and Lucius Ælius Lama appeared for Gratidianus <lb/>
            against Aculeo, and Lama, who was deformed, as you know, <lb/>
            offered impertinent interruptions, Crassus said, Let us hear <lb/>
            this beautiful youth. When a laugh followed, I could not form <lb/>
            my own shape, said Lamia, but I could form my understand- <lb/>
            ing. Then, said Crassus, let us, hear this able orator; when <lb/>
            a greater laugh than before ensued. Such jests are agreeable <lb/>
            as well in grave as in humorous speeches. For I observed, <lb/>
            a little while ago,1 that the subjects for jest and for gravity <lb/>
            are distinct; but that the same form of expression will serve for <lb/>
            grave remarks, as for jokes. Words antithetically used2 are <lb/>
            a great ornament to language; and the same mode of using <lb/>
            them is often also humorous; thus, when the well-known <lb/>
            Servius Galba carried to Lucius Scribonius the tribune a <lb/>
            list of his own intimates to be appointed as judges, and Libo <lb/>
            said, What, Galba, will you never go out of your own dining- <lb/>
            room ? Yes, replied Galba, when you go out of other men's bed- <lb/>
            chambers. To this kind of joke the saying of Glaucia to <lb/>
            Metellus is not very dissimilar: You have your villa at Tibur, <lb/>
            but your court on mount Palatine.3</p>
          <p>LXVI. " Such kinds of jokes as lie in words I think that <lb/>
            I have now sufficiently discussed; but such as relate to things <note type="footnote"> 1 C.61. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Verba relata contrariè. Which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντίθετα</foreign>, when con- <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            are more numerous, and excite more laughter, as I observed <lb/>
            before.1 Among them is narrative, a matter of exceeding <lb/>
            difficulty; for such things are to be described and set before <lb/>
            the eyes, as may seem to be probable, which is the excellence <lb/>
            of narration, and such also as are grotesque, which is the <lb/>
            peculiar province of the ridiculous; for an example, as the <lb/>
            shortest that I recollect, let that serve which I mentioned <lb/>
            before, the story of Crassus about Memmius.2 To this head <lb/>
            we may assign the narratives given in fables. Allusions are <lb/>
            also drawn from history; as when Sextus Titius3 said he was <lb/>
            a Cassandra, I can name, said Antonius, many of your Ajaces <lb/>
            Oilei.4 Such jests are also derived from similitudes, which <lb/>
            include either comparison or something of bodily representa- <lb/>
            tion. A comparison, as when Gallus, that was once a witness <lb/>
            against Piso, said that a countless sum of money had been <lb/>
            given to Magius5 the governor, and Scaurus tried to confute <lb/>
            him, by alleging the poverty of Magius, You mistake me, <lb/>
            Scaurus, said he, for I do not say that Magius has saved it, <lb/>
            but that, like a man gathering nuts without his clothes, he has <lb/>
            put it into his belly. Or, as when Marcus Cicero the elder, <lb/>
            the father of that excellent man our friend, said, That the men <lb/>
            of our times were like the Syrian slaves ; the more Greek they <lb/>
            knew, the greater knaves they were. Representations also create <lb/>
            much laughter, and these commonly bear upon some defor- <lb/>
            mity, or bodily defect, with a comparison to something still <lb/>
            more deformed: as my own saying on Helvius Mancia, I will <lb/>
            now show, said I, what sort of man you are; when he ex- <lb/>
            claimed, Show us, I pray you; and I pointed with my finger <lb/>
            to a Gaul represented upon the Cimbrian shield of Marius <lb/>
            under the new shops 7 in the forum, with his body distorted, <lb/>
            his tongue lolling out, and his cheeks flabby. A general <lb/>
            laugh ensued; for nothing was ever seen to resemble Mancia <lb/>
            so much. Or as I said to the witness Titus Pinarius, who <lb/>
            twisted his chin about while he was speaking, That he might <note type="footnote"> 1 C. 61. </note><note type="footnote">2 C. 59. </note><note type="footnote">a C. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Antonius impudicos homiliis mores insectatur, cùm Cassandræ ab <lb/>

            speak, if he pleased, if he had done cracking his nut. There <lb/>
            are jokes, too, from things being extenuated or exaggerated <lb/>
            hyperbolically, and to astonish ; as you, Crassus, said in <lb/>
            a speech to the people, that Memmius fancied himself so great <lb/>
            a man, that as he came into the forum he stooped his head <lb/>
            at the arch of Fabius. Of which kind is the saying also, that <lb/>
            Scipio is reported to have uttered at Numantia when he was <lb/>
            angry with Metellus, that If his mother were to produce afifth, <lb/>
            she would bring forth an ass.1 There is also frequently acute- <lb/>
            ness shown, when something obscure and not commonly <lb/>
            known is illustrated by a slight circumstance, and often by <lb/>
            a single word; as when Publius Cornelius, a man, as was <lb/>
            suspected, of a covetous and rapacious disposition, but of great <lb/>
            courage and an able commander, thanked Caius Fabricius <lb/>
            for having, though he was his enemy, made him consul, <lb/>
            especially during a difficult and important war, You have no <lb/>
            reason to thank me, returned Fabricius, if I had rather be <lb/>
            pillaged than sold for a slave. Or, as Africanus said to <lb/>
            Asellus, who objected to him that unfortunate lustration in <lb/>
            his censorship, Do not wonder; for he who restored you to the <lb/>
            rights of a citizen, completed the lustration and sacrificed the <lb/>
            bull. There was a tacit suspicion, that Mummius seemed to <lb/>
            have laid the state under the necessity of expiation by remov- <lb/>
            ing the mark of ignominy from Asellus.</p>

            effect, when you say something different from what you <lb/>
            think; not after the manner to which I alluded before, when <lb/>
            you say the exact reverse of what you mean, as Crassus said <lb/>
            to Lamia, but when through the whole course of a speech <lb/>
            you are seriously jocose, your thoughts being different <lb/>
            from your words; as our friend Scævola said to that Septu- <lb/>
            muleius of Anagnia, (to whom its weight in gold was paid for <lb/>
            the head of Caius Gracchus,) when he petitioned that he would <lb/>
            take him as his lieutenant-general into Asia, What would you <lb/>
            have, foolish man ? there is such a multitude of bad citizens <lb/>
            that, I warrant you, if you stay at Rome, you will in a few <lb/>
            years make a vast fortune. Fannius, in his Annals, says thai <lb/>
            Africanus the younger, he that was named Æmilianus, was <note type="footnote"> 1 Quintus Metellus Macedonicus, as Plutarch relates in his treatise <lb/>

            remarkable for this kind of jests ; and calls him by a Greek <lb/>
            term <foreign xml:lang="grc">εί̓ρων</foreign>, an ironical jester; but, according to what those <lb/>
            say who know these matters better than myself, I conceive <lb/>
            that Socrates, for irony and dissimulation, far excelled all <lb/>
            other men in the wit and genius which he displayed. It is <lb/>
            an elegant kind of humour, satirical with a mixture of gravity, <lb/>
            and adapted to oratory as well as to polite conversation. <lb/>
            Indeed all the kinds of humour of which I have spoken, are <lb/>
            seasonings not more appropriate to law-pleadings in the <lb/>
            forum, than to any other kind of discourse. For that which <lb/>
            is mentioned by Cato, (who has reported many apophthegms, <lb/>
            several of which have been produced by me as examples,) <lb/>
            seems to me a very happy saying, that Caius Publius used to <lb/>
            observe that Publius Mummius was a man for all occasions; <lb/>
            so it certainly is with regard to our present subject, that there <lb/>
            is no time of life in which wit and polite humour may not <lb/>
            very properly be exercised.</p>
          <p>" But I will pursue the remainder of my subject. It is a <lb/>
            kind of joking similar to a sort of dissimulation, when any- <lb/>
            thing disgraceful is designated by an honourable term; as <lb/>
            when Africanus the censor removed from his tribe that cen- <lb/>
            turion who absented himself from the battle in which Paulus <lb/>
            commanded, alleging that he had remained in the camp to <lb/>
            guard it, and inquiring why he had such a mark of ignominy <lb/>
            set upon him, I do not like, replied Africanus, over vigilant <lb/>
            people. It is an excellent joke, too, when you take any part <lb/>
            of another person's words in a different sense from that which <lb/>
            he intended; as Fabius Maximus did with Livius Salinator,1 <lb/>
            when, on Tarentum being lost, Livius had still preserved the <lb/>
            citadel, and had made many successful sallies from it, and <lb/>
            Fabius, some years afterwards, having retaken the town, <lb/>
            Livius begged him to remember that it was owing to him <lb/>
            that Tarentum was retaken. How can I do otherwise than <lb/>
            remember, said Fabius, for I should never have retaken it if <lb/>
            you had not lost it. Such jokes as the following, too, are, <lb/>
            though rather absurd, often cn that very account extremely <note type="footnote"> 1 The same anecdote is noticed by Cicero, Do Senect. c. 4; and Livy <lb/>
            speaks of the occurrence at some length, xxvi. 25. But that the Marcus <lb/>
            Livius there mentioned had not the cognomen of Salinator, but of <lb/>
            Macatus, is shown by P. Wesseling, Obss. ii. 5 ; and there seems little <lb/>
            doubt that Cicero made a mistake here, as in some other places. <lb/>

            amusing, and very apposite, not only to characters in plays, <lb/>
            but also to us orators: <lb/>
            The foolish man <lb/>
            As soon as he had come to wealth, he died. <lb/>
            That woman, what is she to you ? <lb/>
            My wife. Like you, by Hercules ! 1 <lb/>
            As long as he was living at the waters <lb/>
            He never 2 died.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. "This kind of jokes is rather trifling, and, as I <lb/>
            said, fit for actors in farces; but sometimes it finds a proper <lb/>
            place with us, as even one who is not a fool may express <lb/>
            himself like a fool in a humorous way, as Mancia con- <lb/>
            gratulated you, Antonius, when he heard that you were <lb/>
            accused by Marcus Duronius of bribery in your censorship: <lb/>
            At length, said he, you will have an opportunity of attending <lb/>
            to your own business. Such jests excite great laughter, and <lb/>
            in truth all sayings that are uttered by men of sense with <lb/>
            a degree of absurdity and sarcasm, under the pretence of not <lb/>
            understanding what is said to them. A joke of this kind is <lb/>
            not to seem to comprehend what you comprehend very well; <lb/>
            as when Pontidius, being asked, What do you think of him <lb/>
            who is taken in adultery ? replied, That he is slow. , Or such <lb/>
            as was my reply to Metellus, when, at a time of levying <lb/>
            troops, he would not excuse me from serving for the weakness <lb/>
            of my eyes, and said to me, What ! can you see nothing ? Yes <lb/>
            truly, answered I, I can see your villa from the Esquiline- <lb/>
            Gate.3 Or as the repartee of Nasica, who, having called at <lb/>
            the house of the poet Ennius, and the maid-servant having <lb/>
            told him, on his inquiring at the door, that Enuius was not <lb/>
            at home, saw that she had said so by her master's order, and <lb/>
            that he was really within: and when, a few days afterwards, <lb/>
            Ennius called at Nasica's house, and inquired for him at the <note type="footnote"> 1 We may suppose, says Strebæus, the woman to have been deformed, <lb/>
            and some one to have asked the man, " What relation is that woman to <lb/>
            you ? your sister ? "When the man answered, " My wife," the ques- <lb/>
            tioner would exclaim, " And yet, how like you she is I I should have <lb/>
            taken her for your sister;" wittily indicating the deformity of the <lb/>
            man. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The joke, says Schutz, is in tie word never, as if it were possible <lb/>

            Ennius, do I not know your voice ? You are an impudent <lb/>
            fellow, rejoined Nasica; when I inquired for you, I believed <lb/>
            your servant when she told me that you were not at home, <lb/>
            and will not you believe me when I tell you that I am not at <lb/>
            home? It is a very happy stroke, too, when he who has <lb/>
            uttered a sarcasm is jested upon in the same strain in which <lb/>
            he has attacked another: as when Quintus Opimius, a man <lb/>
            of consular dignity, who had the report of having been <lb/>
            licentious in his youth, said to Egilius, a man of wit, who <lb/>
            seemed to be an effeminate person, but was in reality not <lb/>
            so, How do you do, my Egilia 1 when will you pay me a <lb/>
            visit with your distaff and spindle? and Egilius replied, <lb/>
            I certainly dare not; for my mother forbad me to visit women <lb/>
            of bad character.</p>
          <p>LXIX. " There are witty sayings also which carry a con- <lb/>
            cealed suspicion of ridicule; of which sort is that of the <lb/>
            Sicilian, who, when a friend of his made lamentation to him, <lb/>
            saying, that his wife had hanged herself upon a fig-tree, <lb/>
            said, I beseech you give me some shoots of that tree, that I may <lb/>
            plant them. Of the same sort is what Catulus said to a cer- <lb/>
            tain bad orator, who, when he imagined that he had excited <lb/>
            compassion at the close of a speech, asked our friend here, <lb/>
            after he had sat down, whether he appeared to have raised <lb/>
            pity in the audience: Very great pity, replied Crassus, for I <lb/>
            believe there is no one here so hard-hearted but that your speech <lb/>
            seemed pitiable to him. Those jests amuse me extremely, <lb/>
            which are expressed in passion and as it were with morose- <lb/>
            ness; not when they are uttered by a person really morose, <lb/>
            for in that case it is not the wit, but the natural temper that <lb/>
            is laughed at. Of this kind of jest there is a very humorous <lb/>
            example, as it appears to me, in Nævius: <lb/>
            ——— Why mourn you, father ? <lb/>
            Strange that I do not sing ! I am condemn'd. <lb/>
            Contrasted with this there is a patient and cool species of the <lb/>
            humorous: as when Cato received a stroke from a man <lb/>
            carrying a trunk, who afterwards called to him to take care, <lb/>
            he asked him, whether he carried anything else besides the <lb/>
            trunk? There is also a witty mode of exposing folly; as <lb/>
            when the Sicilian to whom Scipio, when prætor, assigned <lb/>
            his host for an advocate in some cause, a man of rank but <pb n="305"/>
             <note type="margin">C. LXX.]</note> <lb/>
            extremely stupid, said, I beseech you, prœtor, give this advocate <lb/>
            to my adversary, and give me none. Explanations of things, <lb/>
            too, are amusing, which are given from conjecture in a sense <lb/>
            far different from that which they are intended to convey, but <lb/>
            with ingenuity and aptness. As when Scaurus accused Rutilius <lb/>
            of bribery, (at the time when he himself was made consul, and <lb/>
            Rutilius suffered a disappointment,) and showed these letters <lb/>
            in Rutilius's books,1 A. F. P. R., and said that they signified, <lb/>
            Actum Fide Publii Rutilii, 'transacted on the faith of Publius <lb/>
            Rutilius;' while Rutilius declared that they meant, Ante <lb/>
            Factum, Post Relatum, 'done before, entered after;' but <lb/>
            Caius Canius, being on the side of Rufus, observed that <lb/>
            neither of those senses was intended by the letters: What <lb/>
            then is the meaning ? inquired Scaurus. Æmilius fecit, plec- <lb/>
            titur Rutilius, replied Canius; ‘Æmilius is guilty, Rutilius is <lb/>
            punished.'</p>
          <p>LXX. "A union of discordant particulars is laughable: <lb/>
            as, What is wanting to him, except fortune and virtue ? A <lb/>
            familiar reproof of a person, as if he were in error, is also <lb/>
            amusing; as when Albucius taunted Granius, because, when <lb/>
            something appeared to be proved by Albucius from Granius's <lb/>
            writing, Granius rejoiced extremely that Scævola 2 was ac- <lb/>
            quitted, and did not understand that judgment was given <lb/>
            against the credit of his own writing. Similar to this is <lb/>
            friendly admonition by way of giving advice: as when Granius <lb/>
            persuaded a bad pleader, who had made himself hoarse with <lb/>
            speaking, to drink a cold mixture of honey and wine as soon <lb/>
            as he got home: I shall ruin my voice, said he, if I do so. It <lb/>
            will be better, said Granius, than to ruin your clients. It is <lb/>
            a happy hit, too, when something is said that is peculiarly <lb/>
            applicable to the character of some particular person; as <lb/>
            when Scaurus had incurred some unpopularity for having <lb/>
            taken possession of the effects of Phrygio Pompeius, a rich <lb/>
            man who died without a will, and was sitting as counsel for <note type="footnote"> 1 Which Scaurus required to be produced on the trial </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Texts vary greatly in this passage. I adhere strictly to that of <lb/>
            Orellius. " It appears," says Pearce, " that Scævola was accused of ex- <lb/>
            tortion, as Cicero says in his Brutus, and in the first book De Finibus, <lb/>
            and that Albucius, to prove the accusation, brought forward some <lb/>
            writing of Granius, who, when judgment was given in favour of Scævola, <lb/>
            did not understand that it was at the same time given against his own <lb/>
            writing." </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>

            Bestia then under impeachment, Caius Memmius the accuser, <lb/>
            as a funeral procession passed by, said, Look, Scaurus, a dead <lb/>
            body is going by, if you can but get possession I But of all jokes <lb/>
            none create greater laughter than something said contrary to <lb/>
            expectation; of which there are examples without number. <lb/>
            Such was the saying of Appius the elder,1 who, when the <lb/>
            matter about the public lands, and the law of Thorius, was <lb/>
            in agitation in the senate, and Lucilius was hard pressed by <lb/>
            those who asserted that the public pastures were grazed by <lb/>
            his cattle, said, They are not the cattle of Lucilius; you mistake; <lb/>
            (he seemed to be going to defend Lucilius;) I look upon them <lb/>
            as free, for they feed where they please. That saying also of the <lb/>
            Scipio who slew Tiberius Gracchus amuses me. When, after <lb/>
            many charges were made against him, Marcus Flaccus pro- <lb/>
            posed Publius Mucius as one of his judges, I except against <lb/>
            him, said he, he is unjust; and when this occasioned a general <lb/>
            murmur, Ah! said he, I do not except against him, Conscript <lb/>
            Fathers, as unjust to me, but to everybody. But nothing could <lb/>
            be more witty than the joke of our friend Crassus. When <lb/>
            Silus, a witness, was injuring the cause of Piso, by something <lb/>
            that he said he had beard against him, It is possible, said he, <lb/>
            Silus, that the person from whom you heard this said it in <lb/>
            anger. Silus assented. It is possible, too, that you did not <lb/>
            rightly understand him. To this also he assented with the <lb/>
            lowest of bows, expressing entire agreement with Crassus. <lb/>
            It is also possible, continued Crassus, that what you say you <lb/>
            have heard you never heard at all. This was so different <lb/>
            from what was expected, that the witness was overwhelmed <lb/>
            by a general laugh. Nævius is full of this kind of humour, <lb/>
            and it is a familiar joke, Wise man, if you are cold you will <lb/>
            shake; and there are many other such sayings.</p>
          <p>LXXI. " You may often also humorously grant to your <lb/>
            adversary what he wishes to detract from you; as Caius <lb/>
            Lælius, when a man of disreputable family told him that he <lb/>
            was unworthy of his ancestors, replied, But, by Hercules, you <lb/>
            are worthy of yours. Jokes, too, are frequently uttered in <lb/>
            a sententious manner; as Marcus Cincius, on the day when <lb/>
            he proposed his law about gifts and presents, and Caius <lb/>
            Cento stood forth and asked him with some scorn, What are <note type="footnote"> 1 He is called the elder, because he had a brother of the same name <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. LXXI.] </note> <lb/>
            you proposing, little Cincius? replied, That you, Caius, may <lb/>
            payfor what you wish to use.1 Things also which are impos- <lb/>
            sible are often wished for with much wit; as Marcus Lepidus, <lb/>
            when he lay down upon the grass, while others were taking <lb/>
            their exercise in the Campus Martius, exclaimed, I wish this <lb/>
            were labour.2 It is an excellent joke also to give inquisi- <lb/>
            tive people who teaze you as it were, a calm answer, of such <lb/>
            a nature as they do not expect; as Lepidus the censor, when <lb/>
            he deprived Antistius of Pyrgi of his horse;3 and his friends <note type="footnote">1 A species of ridicule expressed in a pithy sentence. The example <lb/>
            produced requires that we should explain the Cincian law. This cannot <lb/>
            oe done better than in the words of Dr. Middleton. The business of <lb/>
            pleading, says he, though a profession of all others the most laborious, yet <lb/>
            was not among the Romans mercenary, or undertaken for any pay; for <lb/>
            it was illegal to take money, or to accept even a present for it; but the <lb/>
            richest, the greatest, and the noblest of Rome freely offered their <lb/>
            talents to the service of their citizens, as the common guardians and <lb/>
            protectors of the innocent and distressed. This was an institution as <lb/>
            old as Romulus, who assigned the patronage of the people to the patri- <lb/>
            cians or senators, without fee or reward; but in succeeding ages, when, <lb/>
            through the avarice of the nobles, it had become a custom for all clients <lb/>
            to make annual presents to their patrons, by which the body of the <lb/>
            citizens was made tributary as it were to the senate, M. Cincius, a tri- <lb/>
            bune, published a law prohibiting all senators to take money or gifts on <lb/>
            any account, and especially for pleading causes. This Cincian law was <lb/>
            made in the year of Rome 549; and recommended to the people, as <lb/>
            Cicero tells us, (De Senect. 4,) by Quintus Fabius Maximus, in the ex- <lb/>
            tremity of his age. Caius Cento was one of the orators who opposed <lb/>
            it. Livy, xxxiv. 4, gives us the reason for passing this law, " Quid <lb/>
            legem Cinciam de donis et muneribus, nisi quia vectigalis jam et sti- <lb/>
            pendiaria plebs esse senatui cæperat ? " It is also mentioned by Tacitus, <lb/>
            Annal. xi. 5: " Consurgunt patres legemque Cinciam flagitant, qua <lb/>
            cavetur antiquitus no quis ob causam orandam pecuniam donumve <lb/>
            accipiat." We also find from the same author, (xi. 7,) that this law was <lb/>
            not well observed in Cicero's time: "prompta sibi exempla quantis <lb/>
            mercedibus P. Clodius aut C. Curio concionari soliti sint;" so the <lb/>

            Some other sorts of jests are enumerated by the Greeks, <lb/>
            as execrations, expressions of admiration, threats. But I <lb/>
            think that I have divided these matters into too many <lb/>
            heads already; for such as lie in the force and meaning of <lb/>
            a word, are commonly easy to settle and define; but in <lb/>
            general, as I observed before, they are heard rather with <lb/>
            approbation than laughter. Jokes, however, which lie in the <lb/>
            subject and thought, are, though infinite in their varieties, <lb/>
            reducible under a very few general heads; for it is by deceiving <lb/>
            expectation, by satirising the tempers of others, by playing <lb/>
            humorously on our own, by comparing a thing with some- <lb/>
            thing worse, by dissembling, by uttering apparent absurdities, <lb/>
            and by reproving folly, that laughter is excited; and he who <lb/>
            would be a facetious speaker, must be endowed with a natural <lb/>
            genius for such kinds of wit, as well as with personal qualifi- <lb/>
            cations, so that his very look may adapt itself to every species <lb/>
            of the ridiculous; and the graver and more serious such a <lb/>
            person is, as is the case with you, Crassus, so much more <lb/>
            humorous do the sayings which fall from him generally <lb/>
            appear.</p>
          <p>" But now I think that you, Antonius, who said2 that you <lb/>
            would repose during my discourse, as in some place of refresh- <lb/>
            ment, will, as if you had stopped in the Pomptine Marsh, <lb/>
            neither a pleasant nor a wholesome region, consider that you <lb/>
            have rested long enough, and will proceed to complete the <lb/>
            remainder of your journey." " I will," said Antonius, <lb/>
            "having been very pleasantly entertained by you, and <lb/>
            having also acquired instruction, as well as encouragement, <lb/>
            to indulge in jesting; for I am no longer afraid lest any one <lb/>
            should charge me with levity in that respect, since you have <lb/>
            produced such authorities as the Fabricii, the Africani, <lb/>
            the Maximi, the Catos, and the Lepidi, in its favour. But <lb/>
            you have heard what you desired from me, at least such <lb/>
            points as it was necessary to consider and detail with par- <note type="footnote"> 1 That is. says Proust, was so reported by those who wished to <lb/>

            from what has been already said.</p>
          <p>LXXII.1 "For when I have entered upon a cause, and <lb/>
            traced out all its bearings in my mind, as far as I could <lb/>
            possibly do so; when I have ascertained and contemplated <lb/>
            the proper arguments for the case, and those particulars by <lb/>
            which the feelings of the judges maybe conciliated or excited, <lb/>
            I then consider what strong or weak points the cause con- <lb/>
            tains; for hardly any subject can be called into question and <lb/>
            controversy in pleading, which has not both; but to what <lb/>
            degree is the chief concern. In pleading, my usual method is, <lb/>
            to fix on whatever strong points a cause has, and to illus- <lb/>
            trate and make the most of them, dwelling on them, insisting <lb/>
            on them, clinging to them; but to hold back from the weak <lb/>
            and defective points, in such a way that I may not appear to <lb/>
            shun them, but that their whole force may be dissembled and <lb/>
            overwhelmed 2 by the ornament and amplification of the strong <lb/>
            parts. If the cause turn upon arguments, I maintain chiefly <lb/>
            such as are the strongest, whether they are several or whether <lb/>
            there be but one; but if the cause depend on the conciliation <lb/>
            or excitement of the feelings of the judges, I apply myself <lb/>
            chiefly to that part which is best adapted to move men's <lb/>
            minds. Finally, the principal point for consideration on this <lb/>
            head is, that if my speech can be made more effective by <lb/>
            refuting my adversary, than by supporting my own side of the <lb/>
            question, I employ all my weapons against him; but if my own <lb/>
            ease can be more easily supported, than that on the other side <lb/>
            can be confuted, I endeavour to withdraw the attention of the <lb/>
            judges from the opposite party's defence, and to fix it on my <lb/>
            own. In conclusion, I adopt, on my own responsibility, two <lb/>
            courses which appear to me most easy (since I cannot attempt <lb/>
            what is more difficult): one, that I make, sometimes, no reply <lb/>
            at all to a troublesome or difficult argument or point; (and at <lb/>
            such forbearance perhaps somebody may reasonably laugh; for <lb/>
            who is there that cannot practise it ? but I am now speaking <lb/>
            of my own abilities, not those of others; and I confess that, <lb/>
            if any particular press very hard upon me, I usually retreat <note type="footnote"> 1 Antonius returns to the point from which he had digressed at <lb/>

            from it, but :n such a manner as not only not to appear to flee <lb/>
            with my shield thrown away, but even with it thrown over <lb/>
            my shoulders; adopting, at the same time, a certain pomp <lb/>
            and parado of language, and a mode of flight that resembles <lb/>
            fighting; and keeping upon my guard in such a way, that I <lb/>
            seem to have retired, not to avoid my enemy, but to choose <lb/>
            more advantageous ground;) the other is one which I think <lb/>
            most of all worthy of the orator's precaution and foresight, <lb/>
            and which generally occasions me very great anxiety: I am <lb/>
            accustomed to study not so much to benefit the causes which <lb/>
            I undertake, as not to injure them; not but that an orator <lb/>
            must aim at both objects; but it is however a much greater <lb/>
            disgrace to him to be thought to have damaged a cause, than <lb/>
            not to have profited it.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. " But what are you saying among yourselves on <lb/>
            this subject, Catulus? Do you slight what I say, as indeed it <lb/>
            deserves to be slighted?" " By no means," rejoined Catulus; <lb/>
            " but Cæsar seemed desirous to say something on the point." <lb/>
            " Let him say it, then, with all my heart," continued An- <lb/>
            tonius, "whether he wish to confute, or to question me." <lb/>
            " Indeed, Antonius," said Cæsar, " I have always been the <lb/>
            man to say of you as an orator, that you appeared to me in <lb/>
            your speeches the most guarded of all men, and that it was <lb/>
            your peculiar merit, that nothing was ever spoken by you <lb/>
            that could injure him for whom you spoke. And I well <lb/>
            remember, that, on entering into a conversation with Crassus <lb/>
            here concerning you, in the hearing of a large company, and <lb/>
            Crassus having largely extolled your eloquence, I said, that <lb/>
            amongst your other merits this was even the principal, that <lb/>
            you not only said all that ought to be said, but also never <lb/>
            said anything that ought not to be said ; and I recollect that <lb/>
            he then observed to me, that your other qualities deserved <lb/>
            the highest degree of praise, but that to speak what was not <lb/>
            to the purpose, and to injure one's own client, was the conduct <lb/>
            of an unprincipled and perfidious person; and, consequently, <lb/>
            that he did not appear to him to be a good pleader, who <lb/>
            avoided doing so, though he who did so was certainly dis- <lb/>
            honest. Now, if you please, Antonius, I would wish you to <lb/>
            show why you think it a matter of such importance, to do no <lb/>
            harm to a cause; so much so, that nothing in an orator <lb/>
            appears to you of greater consequence." <pb n="311"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">C. LXXIV.] </note> LXXIV. " I will readily tell you, Cæsar," replied Antonius, <lb/>
            " what I mean; but do you, and all who are here, remember <lb/>
            this, that I am not speaking of the divine power of the com- <lb/>
            plete orator, but of my own humble efforts and practice. The <lb/>
            remark of Crassus is indeed that of an excellent and singular <lb/>
            genius; to whom it appeared something like a prodigy, that <lb/>
            any orator could possibly be found, who could do any mischief <lb/>
            in speaking, and injure him whom he had to defend. For he- <lb/>
            judges from himself; as his force of intellect is such, that he- <lb/>
            thinks no man speaks what makes against himself, unless on <lb/>
            purpose; but I am not alluding to any supereminent and. <lb/>
            illustrious power, but to common and almost universal sense. <lb/>
            Amongst the Greeks, Themistocles the Athenian is reported <lb/>
            to have possessed an incredible compass of understanding and <lb/>
            genius; and a certain person of learning and singular accom- <lb/>
            plishments is said to have gone to him, and offered to teach <lb/>
            him the art of memory, an art then first made public. When he <lb/>
            inquired what that art could do for him, the professor replied, <lb/>
            that it would enable him to remember everything; when- <lb/>
            Themistocles rejoined, that he would oblige him much more <lb/>
            if he could instruct him how to forget, rather than to remem- <lb/>
            ber, what he chose. Do you conceive what force and vigour <lb/>
            of genius, how powerful and extensive a capacity, there was in, <lb/>
            that great man who answered in such a manner that we may <lb/>
            understand that nothing, which had once entered his mind, <lb/>
            could ever slip out of it; and to whom it was much more- <lb/>
            desirable to be enabled to forget what he did not wish to <lb/>
            remember, than to remember whatever he had once heard or <lb/>
            seen. But neither on account of this answer of Themistocles <lb/>
            are we to forbear to cultivate our memory; nor is my pre- <lb/>
            caution and timidity in pleading causes to be slighted on <lb/>
            account of the excellent understanding of Crassus; for neither <lb/>
            the one nor the other of them has given me any additional <lb/>
            ability, but has merely signified his own. There are numbers <lb/>
            of points1 in causes that call for circumspection in every part <note type="footnote"> 1 Antonius mentions seven ways by which the indiscretion of the <lb/>
            orator may be of prejudice to the cause, to illustrate his last observa- <lb/>
            tion :—1. By irritating a witness, who would not have injured his client <lb/>
            without provocation. 2. By not giving way when the arguments press <lb/>
            too hard upon him, he may lose his cause. 3. By extolling those qua- <lb/>
            lities in his client which ought to be extenuated, he may do mischief. <lb/>
            4. By throwing invectives upon those who are entitled to the esteem </note> <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            of your speech, that you may not stumble, that you may not <lb/>
            fall over anything. Oftentimes some witness either does no <lb/>
            mischief, or does less, if he be not provoked; my client <lb/>
            entreats me, the advocates press me, to inveigh against him, <lb/>
            to abuse him, or, finally, to plague him with questions; I am <lb/>
            not moved, I do not comply, I will not gratify them; yet <lb/>
            I gain no commendations; for ignorant people can more easily <lb/>
            blame what you say injudiciously, than praise you for what you <lb/>
            discreetly leave unnoticed. In such a case how much harm <lb/>
            may be done if you offend a witness who is passionate, or one <lb/>
            who is a man of sense, or of influential character? for he has <lb/>
            the will to do you mischief from his passion, the power in his <lb/>
            understanding, and the means in his reputation; nor, if <lb/>
            Crassus never commits this offence, is that a reason that <lb/>
            many are not guilty of it, and often; on which account nothing <lb/>
            ever appears to me more ignominious, than when from any <lb/>
            observation, or reply, or question, of a pleader, such remarks <lb/>
            as this follow: He has ruined-- Whom? his adversary? No <lb/>
            truly, but himself and his client.</p>
          <p>LXXV. " This Crassus thinks can never happen but <lb/>
            through perfidiousness; but I very frequently observe that <lb/>
            persons by no means dishonest do mischief in causes. In <lb/>
            regard to that particular which I mentioned before, that I am <lb/>
            used to retreat, or, to speak more plainly, to flee from those <lb/>
            points which would press hard on my side of the question, <lb/>
            how much harm do others do when they neglect this, saunter <lb/>
            in the enemy's camp, and dismiss their own guards? Do they <lb/>
            occasion but slight detriment to their causes, when they either <lb/>
            strengthen the supports of their adversaries or inflame the <lb/>
            wounds which they cannot heal ? What harm do they <lb/>
            cause when they pay no regard to the characters of those <lb/>
            whom they defend? If they do not mitigate by extenuation <note type="footnote"> and favour of the judges. 5. By upbraiding his adversary with the same <lb/>
            defects that are in some of the judges; of which Philip's derision of a <lb/>
            dwarfish evidence, before Lucius Aurifex, who was still lower in stature, <lb/>
            was an instance mentioned before. 6. He may plead his own cause <lb/>
            rather than that of his client; which blame Cicero seems to have in- <lb/>
            curred in his oration for Publius Sextius, a cause in which he was warmly <lb/>
            and specially interested. Whoever has any inclination to read the <lb/>

            those qualities in them that excite ill-will, but make them <lb/>
            more obnoxous to it by commending and extolling them, how <lb/>
            much mischief is caused by such management? Or what if, <lb/>
            without any precautionary language, you throw bitter and <lb/>
            contumelious invectives upon popular persons, in favour with <lb/>
            the judges, do you not alienate their feelings from you? <lb/>
            Or what if there be vices or bad qualities in one or more of the <lb/>
            judges, and you, in upbraiding your adversaries with such <lb/>
            demerits, are not aware that you are attacking the judges, is <lb/>
            it a small error which you then commit ? Or what if, while <lb/>
            you are speaking for another, you make his cause your own, or, <lb/>
            taking affront, are carried away from the question by passion, <lb/>
            and start aside from the subject, do you occasion no harm? <lb/>
            In this respect I am esteemed too patient and forbearing, not <lb/>
            because I willingly hear myself abused, but because I am un- <lb/>
            willing to lose sight of the cause; as, for instance, when I <lb/>
            reproved you yourself, Sulpicius, for attacking an agent, not <lb/>
            me your adversary.1 From such conduct, however, I acquire <lb/>
            this advantage, that if any one does abuse me, he is thought <lb/>
            to be either ill-tempered or out of his wits. Or if in your <lb/>
            arguments you shall state anything either manifestly false, or <lb/>
            contradictory to what you have said or are going to say, or <lb/>
            foreign in its nature to the practice of trials and of the forum, <lb/>
            do you occasion no damage to your cause? Why need I say <lb/>
            more on this head? My whole care is constantly devoted to <lb/>
            this object, (for I will repeat it frequently,) to effect, if I can, <lb/>
            some good by speaking; but if not, to do at least no harm.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. " I now return therefore to that point, Catulus, <lb/>
            on which you a little while ago accorded me praise; the order <lb/>
            and arrangement of facts and topics of argument. On this <lb/>
            head, two methods may be observed; one, which the nature <lb/>
            of causes dictates; the other, which is suggested by the <lb/>
            orator's judgment and prudence. For, to premise something <lb/>
            before we come to the main point; then to explain the <lb/>
            matter in question; then to support it by strengthening our <lb/>

            sum up, and come to the peroration; is a mode of speaking <lb/>
            that nature herself prescribes. But to determine how we <lb/>

            order to prove, to inform, to persuade, more peculiarly belongs <lb/>

            but some of them are so trifling as to be utterly contemptible; <lb/>
            some, if they are of any assistance at all, are sometimes of <lb/>
            such a nature, that there is some defect inherent in them; <lb/>
            while that which appears to be advantageous, is not of such <lb/>
            import that it need be advanced in conjunction with anything <lb/>
            prejudicial. And as to those arguments which are to the <lb/>
            purpose, and deserving of trust, if they are (as it often <lb/>
            happens) very numerous, I think that such of them as are of <lb/>
            least weight, or as are of the same tendency with others <lb/>
            of greater force, ought to be set aside, and excluded altogether <lb/>
            from our pleading. I myself, indeed, in collecting proofs, <lb/>
            make it a practice rather to weigh than to count them.</p>
          <p>LXXVII. " Since, too, as I have often observed, we bring <lb/>
            over people in general to our opinions by three methods, <lb/>
            by instructing their understandings, conciliating their bene- <lb/>
            volence, or exciting their passions, one only of these three <lb/>
            methods is to be professed by us, so that we may appear to <lb/>
            desire nothing else but to instruct; the other two, like blood <lb/>
            throughout the body, ought to be diffused through the whole <lb/>
            Df our pleading; for both the beginning, and the other parts <lb/>
            Df a speech, on which we will by-and-by say a few words, <lb/>
            ought to have this power in a great degree, so that they may <lb/>
            penetrate the minds of those before whom we plead, in order to <lb/>
            excite them. But in those parts of the speech which, though <lb/>
            they do not convince by argument, yet by solicitation and <lb/>
            excitement produce great effect, though their proper place is <lb/>
            chiefly in the exordium and the peroration, still, to make a <lb/>
            digression from what you have proposed and are discussing, <lb/>
            for the sake of exciting the passions, is often advantageous. <lb/>
            Since, after the statement of the case has been made, an oppor- <lb/>
            tunity often presents itself of making a digression to rouse <lb/>
            the feelings of the audience; or this may be properly done <lb/>
            after the confirmation of our own arguments, or the refutation <lb/>
            of those on the other side, or in either place, or in all, if the <lb/>
            cause has sufficient copiousness and importance; and those <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            causes are the most considerable, and most pregnant with <lb/>
            matter for amplification and embellishment, which afford the <lb/>
            most frequent opportunities for that kind of digression in which <lb/>
            you may descant on those points by which the passions of the <lb/>
            audience are either excited or calmed. In touching on this <lb/>
            matter, I cannot but blame those who place the arguments <lb/>
            to which they trust least in the front; and, in like manner, <lb/>
            I think that they commit an error, who, if ever they employ <lb/>
            several advocates, (a practice which never, had my approba- <lb/>
            tion,) will have him to speak first in whom they confide least, <lb/>
            and rank the others also according to their abilities.1 For <lb/>
            a cause requires that the expectations of the audience should <lb/>
            be met with all possible expedition; and if nothing to satisfy <lb/>
            them be offered in the commencement, much more labour is <lb/>
            necessary in the sequel; for that case is in a bad condition <lb/>
            which does not at the commencement of the pleading at once <lb/>
            appear to be the better. For this reason, as, in regard to <lb/>
            pleaders,2 he who is the most able should speak first, so in <lb/>
            regard to a speech, let the arguments of most weight be put <lb/>
            foremost; yet so that this rule be observed with respect to <lb/>
            both, that some of superior efficiency be reserved for the- <lb/>
            peroration; if any are but of moderate strength, (for to the- <lb/>
            weak no place should be given at all,) they may be thrown <lb/>
            into the main body and into the midst, of the group. All <lb/>
            these things being duly considered, it is then my custom <lb/>
            to think last of that which is to be spoken first, namely, <lb/>
            what exordium I shall adopt. For whenever I have felt <lb/>
            inclined to think of that first, nothing occurs to me but what <lb/>
            is jejune, or nugatory, or vulgar and ordinary.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. " The beginnings of speeches ought always to- <lb/>
            be accurate and judicious, well furnished with thoughts, ani <lb/>
            happy in expression, as well as peculiarly suited to their <lb/>
            respective causes. For our earliest acquaintance with a. <lb/>
            speech as it were, and the first recommendation of it to our <lb/>
            notice, is at the commencement; which ought at once to <lb/>
            propitiate and attract the audience. In regard to this point, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ut in quoque eorum minimum putant esse, ita eum primum volunt <lb/>
            dicere. " As in each of them they think that there is least, so they <lb/>
            wish him to speak first." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ut in oratore. Schutz conjectures in oratoribus, but he had better, <lb/>
            as Ellendt observes, have conjectured ex oratoribus. But the text may <lb/>
            be correct. </note> <pb n="316"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            I cannot but feel astonished, not indeed at such as have <lb/>
            paid no attention to the art, but at a man of singular elo- <lb/>
            quence and erudition, I mean Philippus, who generally rises <lb/>
            to speak with so little preparation, that he knows not what <lb/>
            word he shall utter first; and he says, that when he has <lb/>
            warmed his arm, then it is his custom to begin to fight; but <lb/>
            he does not consider that those from whom he takes this simile <lb/>
            hurl their first lances gently, so as to preserve the utmost <lb/>
            grace in their action, and at the same time to husband their <lb/>
            strength. Nor is there any doubt, but that the beginning <lb/>
            of a speech ought very seldom to be vehement and pug- <lb/>
            nacious; but if even in the combat of gladiators for life, <lb/>
            which is decided by the sword, many passes are made previous <lb/>
            to the actual encounter, which appear to be intended, not for <lb/>
            mischief, but for display, how much more naturally is such <lb/>
            prelude to be expected in a speech, in which an exhibition <lb/>
            of force is not more required than gratification? Besides, <lb/>
            there is nothing in the whole nature of things that is all <lb/>
            produced at once, and that springs entire into being in an <lb/>
            instant; and nature herself has introduced everything that is <lb/>
            done and accomplished most energetically with a moderate <lb/>
            beginning. Nor is the exordium of a speech to be sought <lb/>
            from without, or from anything unconnected with the sub- <lb/>
            ject, but to be derived from the very essence of the cause. <lb/>
            It is, therefore, after the whole cause has been considered <lb/>
            and examined, and after every argument has been excogitated <lb/>
            and prepared, that you must determine what sort of exordium <lb/>
            to adopt; for thus it will easily be settled,1 as it will be <lb/>
            drawn from those points which are most fertile in arguments, <lb/>
            or in those matters on which I said2 you ought often to <lb/>
            make digressions. Thus our exordia will give additional <lb/>
            weight, when they are drawn from the most intimate parts <lb/>
            cf our defence; and it will be shown that they are not only <lb/>
            not common, and cannot be transferred to other causes, but <lb/>
            that they have wholly grown out of the cause under con- <lb/>
            side ration.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. " But every exordium ought either to convey an <lb/>
            intimation of the whole matter in hand, or some introduction <note type="footnote"> 1 Reperientur ... sumentur. These words are plural ir Orellius's text, <lb/>
            but Ellendt and others seem rightly to determine that they should be <lb/>
            singular. </note><note type="footnote">2 C. 77. </note> <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXXIX.] </note> <lb/>
            and support to the cause, or something of ornament and <lb/>
            dignity. But, like vestibules and approaches to houses and <lb/>
            temples, so the introductions that we prefix to causes should <lb/>
            be suited to the importance of the subjects. In small and <lb/>
            unimportant! causes, therefore, it is often more advisable to <lb/>
            commence with the subject-matter itself without any preface. <lb/>
            But, when we are to use an exordium, (as will generally be <lb/>
            the case,) our matter for it may be derived either from the <lb/>
            suitor, from the adversary, from the subject, or from those <lb/>
            before whom we plead. From the suitor (I call all those <lb/>
            suitors whom a suit concerns) we may deduce such par- <lb/>
            ticulars as characterise a worthy, generous, or unfortunate <lb/>
            man, or one deserving of compassion; or such particulars as <lb/>
            avail against a false accusation. From the adversary we may <lb/>
            deduce almost the contrary particulars from the same points. <lb/>
            From the subject, if the matter under consideration be cruel, <lb/>
            or heinous, or beyond expectation, or undeserved, or pitiable, <lb/>
            or savouring of ingratitude or indignity, or unprecedented, <lb/>
            or not admitting restitution or satisfaction. From those <lb/>
            before whom we plead we may draw such considerations, as <lb/>
            to procure their benevolence and good opinion; an object <lb/>
            better attained in the course of pleading than by direct <lb/>
            entreaty. This object indeed is to be kept in view throughout <lb/>
            the whole oration, and especially in the conclusion; but <lb/>
            many exordia, however, are wholly based upon it; for the <lb/>
            Greeks recommend us to make the judge, at the very com- <lb/>
            mencement, attentive and desirous of information; and such <lb/>
            hints are useful, but not more proper for the exordium than <lb/>
            for other parts; but they are indeed easier2 to be observed in <lb/>
            the beginning, because the audience are then most attentive, <lb/>
            when they are in expectation of the whole affair, and they <lb/>
            may also, in the commencement, be more easily informed, as <lb/>
            the particulars stated in the outset are generally of greater <lb/>
            perspicuity than those which are spoken by way of argument, <lb/>
            or refutation, in the body of the pleading. But we shall <lb/>
            derive the greatest abundance and variety of matter for <lb/>
            exordia, either to conciliate or to arouse the judge, from those <note type="footnote">1 Infrequentibus causis. Infrequens causa is a cause at the pleading <lb/>
            of which few auditors are likely to attend. Ernesti. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Faciliora etiam in principii8. Ellendt justly observes that etiam <lb/>
            must be corrupt, and that autem should probably be substituted for it. </note> <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            points in the cause which are adapted to create emotion in <lb/>
            the mind; yet the whole of these ought not to be brought for- <lb/>
            ward in the exordium; the judge should only receive a slight <lb/>
            impulse at the outset, so that the rest of our speech may <lb/>
            come with full force upon him when he is already impressed <lb/>
            in our favour.</p>
          <p>LXXX. " Let the exordium, also, be so connected with the <lb/>
            sequel of the speech, that it may not appear, like a musi- <lb/>
            cian's prelude, to be something attached merely from imagina- <lb/>
            tion, but a coherent member of the whole body; for some <lb/>
            speakers, when they have delivered their premeditated exor- <lb/>
            dium, make such a transition to what is to follow, that they <lb/>
            seem positively unwilling to have an audience. But a pro- <lb/>
            lusion of that kind ought not to be like that of gladiators,1 <lb/>
            who brandish spears before the fight, of which they make no <lb/>
            use in the encounter; but should be such, that speakers may <lb/>
            even use as weapons the thoughts which they advanced in <lb/>
            the .prelude.</p>
          <p>"But as to the directions which they give to consult <lb/>
            brevity in the narration, if that is to be called brevity where <lb/>
            there is no word redundant, the language of Lucius Crassus <lb/>
            is distinguished by brevity; but if that kind of brevity is <lb/>
            intended, when only just so many words are used as are <lb/>
            absolutely necessary, such conciseness is indeed sometimes <lb/>
            proper; but it is often prejudicial, especially in narration; <lb/>
            not only as it produces obscurity, but also because it destroys <lb/>
            that which is the chief excellence of narration, that it be <lb/>
            pleasing and adapted to persuade. For instance the nar- <lb/>
            rative, <lb/>
            For he, as soon as he became of age, &amp;c.2</p>
          <p>how long is it! The manners of the youth himself, the in- <lb/>
            quiries of the servant, the death of Chrysis, the look, figure, <lb/>
            and affliction of the sister, and the other circumstances, are <lb/>
            told with the utmost variety and agreeableness. But if he <lb/>
            had been studious of such brevity as this, <lb/>
            She's carried forth; we go; we reach the place <lb/>
            Of sepulture; she's laid upon the pile, <lb/>
            he might have comprised the whole in ten lines: although <note type="footnote"> 1Samnitium. A kind of gladiators so called, that fought with Sam- <lb/>
            cite arms. They had their origin among the Campanians. Liv. ix. 40 </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Terence, Andr. Act L Sc. 1. </note> <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXXXI.] </note> <lb/>
            ' She's carried forth, we go,' is only so far concise, as to con. <lb/>
            suit, not absolute brevity, but elegance; for if there had <lb/>
            been nothing expressed but she's laid upon the pile,' the <lb/>
            whole matter would have been easily comprehended. But <lb/>
            a narration referring to various characters, and intersected by <lb/>
            dialogue, affords much gratification; and that becomes more <lb/>
            probable which you report to have been done, when you <lb/>
            describe the manner in which it was done; and it is much <lb/>
            more clearly understood if you sometimes pause for that <lb/>
            purpose, and do not hurry over it with affected brevity. <lb/>
            For the narrative parts of a speech, as well as the other parts, <lb/>
            ought to be perspicuous, and we ought to take the more <lb/>
            pains with that part, because it is more difficult not to be <lb/>
            obscure in stating a case, than either in an exordium, in argu- <lb/>
            mentation, in refuting of an accusation, or in a peroration: <lb/>
            and obscurity in this part of a speech is attended with greater <lb/>
            danger than in other parts; both because, if anything be <lb/>
            obscurely expressed in any other part, only that is lost which <lb/>
            is so expressed; but obscurity in the narrative part spreads <lb/>
            darkness over the whole speech; and because, as to other <lb/>
            parts, if you have expressed anything obscurely in one place, <lb/>
            you may explain it more clearly in another; while for the <lb/>
            narrative part of a speech there is but one place. But your <lb/>
            narrative will be clear, if it be given in ordinary language, <lb/>
            with adherence to the order of time and without interruption.</p>
          <p>LXXXI. " But when we ought to introduce a statement of <lb/>
            facts, and when we ought not, requires judicious consideration. <lb/>
            For we ought to make no such statement, either if the matter <lb/>
            is notorious, or if the circumstances are free from doubt, or <lb/>
            if the adversary has related them, unless indeed we wish to <lb/>
            confute his statement; and whenever we do make a statement <lb/>
            of facts, let us not insist too eagerly upon points which may <lb/>
            create suspicion and ill-feeling, and make against us, but let <lb/>
            us extenuate such points as much as possible; lest that should <lb/>
            happen, which, whenever it occurs, Crassus thinks is done <lb/>
            through treachery, not through folly, namely, that we damage <lb/>
            our own cause; for it concerns the fortune of the whole <lb/>
            cause, whether the case is stated with caution, or otherwise, <lb/>
            because the statement of the case is the foundation of all the <lb/>
            rest of the speech.</p>
          <p>" What follows is, that the matter in question be laid <pb n="320"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            down, when we must settle what is the point that comes under <lb/>
            dispute; then the chief grounds of the cause are to be laid <lb/>
            down conjunctively, so as to weaken your adversary's sup- <lb/>
            ports, and to strengthen your own; for there is in causes but <lb/>
            one method for that part of your speech, which is of efficacy <lb/>
            to prove your arguments; and that needs both confirmation <lb/>
            and refutation; but because what is alleged on the other side <lb/>
            cannot be refuted unless you confirm your own statements, <lb/>
            and your own statements cannot be confirmed unless you <lb/>
            refute the allegations on the opposite side, these matters are <lb/>
            in consequence united both by their nature, by their object, <lb/>
            and by their mode of treatment. The whole speech is then <lb/>
            generally brought to a conclusion by some amplification on <lb/>
            the different points, or by exciting or mollifying the judge; <lb/>
            and every particular, not only in the former parts of the <lb/>
            speech, but more especially towards the conclusion, is to be <lb/>
            adapted to excite as much as possible the feelings of the <lb/>
            judges, and to incline them in our favour.</p>
          <p>" Nor does there now appear to be any reason, indeed, why <lb/>
            we should make a distinct head of those precepts which are <lb/>
            given concerning suasory or panegyrical speeches; for most <lb/>
            of them are common to all kinds of oratory; yet, to speak in <lb/>
            favour of any important matter, or against it, seems to me to <lb/>
            belong only to the most dignified character; for it is the part <lb/>
            of a wise man to deliver his opinion on momentous affairs, <lb/>
            and that of a man of integrity and eloquence, to be able to <lb/>
            provide for others by his prudence, to confirm by his autho- <lb/>
            rity, and to persuade by his language.</p>
          <p>. LXXXII. " Speeches are to be made in the senate with less <lb/>
            display; for it is an assembly of wise men;1 and opportunity <lb/>
            is to be left for many others to speak. All suspicion, too, of <lb/>
            ostentation of ability is to be avoided. A speech to the <lb/>
            people, on the other hand, requires all the force, weight,-and. <lb/>
            various colouring of eloquence. For persuading, then, nothing <lb/>
            is more desirable than worth; for he who thinks that expe-. <lb/>
            diency is more desirable, does not consider what the counsellor <lb/>
            chiefly wishes, but what he prefers upon occasion to follow; <lb/>
            and there is no man, especially in so noble a state as this, <lb/>
            who does not think that worth ought chiefly to be regarded; <note type="footnote">1 Sapiens enim est consilium. These <unclear>words</unclear> I regard as a scholium <lb/>

            but expediency commonly prevails, there being a concealed <lb/>
            fear, that even worth cannot be supported if expediency be dis- <lb/>
            regarded. But the difference between the opinions of men lies <lb/>
            either in this question, ' which of two things is of the greater <lb/>
            utility?' or, if that point is agreed, it is disputed whether <lb/>
            honour or expediency ought rather to be consulted.' As <lb/>
            these seem often to oppose each other, he who is an advocate <lb/>
            for expediency, will enumerate the benefits of peace, of plenty, <lb/>
            of power, of riches, of settled revenues, of troops in garrison, <lb/>
            and of other things, the enjoyment of which we estimate by <lb/>
            their utility; and he will specify the disadvantages of a con- <lb/>
            trary state of things. He who exhorts his audience to regard <lb/>
            honour, will collect examples from our ancestors, which may <lb/>
            be imitated with glory, though attended with danger; he will <lb/>
            expatiate on immortal fame among posterity; he will main- <lb/>
            tain that advantage arises from the observance of honour, <lb/>
            and that it is always united with worth. But what is pos- <lb/>
            sible, or impossible; and what is necessary or unnecessary, <lb/>
            are questions of the greatest moment in regard to both; for <lb/>
            all debate is at an end, if it is understood that a thing is <lb/>
            impossible, or if any necessity for it appears; and he who <lb/>
            shows what the case is, when others have overlooked it, <lb/>
            sees furthest of all. But for giving counsel in civil affairs <lb/>
            the chief qualification is a knowledge of the constitution <lb/>
            and, to speak on such matters so as to be approved, an ac- <lb/>
            quaintance with the manners of the people is required; and, <lb/>
            as .these frequently vary, the fashion of speaking must often <lb/>
            be varied.; and, although the power of eloquence is mostly <lb/>
            the- same, yet, as the highest dignity is in the people, as' <lb/>
            the concerns of the republic- are of the utmost importance, <lb/>
            and as the commotions of the multitude are of extraordinary <lb/>
            violence, a more grand and imposing manner of addressing <lb/>
            them seems necessary to be adopted; and the greatest part <lb/>
            of a speech is to be devoted to the excitement of the feelings; <lb/>
            either by exhortation, or the commemoration of some illus- <lb/>
            trious. action, or by moving the people to hope, or to fear, or <lb/>
            to ambition, or desire of glory; and often also to dissuade <lb/>
            them from 'temerity, from rage, from ardent' expectation. <lb/>
            from injustice, from envy, from cruelty.</p>
          <p>LXXXIII. " But it happens that, because a popular as <lb/>
            sembly appears to the orator to be his most enlarged scene of <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            action,l he is naturally excited in it to a more magnificent <lb/>
            species of eloquence; for a multitude has such influence, that, <lb/>
            as the flute-player cannot play without his flutes, so the orator <lb/>
            cannot be eloquent without a numerous audience. And, as <lb/>
            the inclinations of popular assemblies take many and various <lb/>
            turns, an unfavourable expression of feeling from the whole <lb/>
            people must not be incurred; an expression which may be <lb/>
            excited by some- fault in the speech, if anything appears to <lb/>
            have been spoken with harshness, with arrogance, in a base <lb/>
            or mean manner, or with any improper feeling whatever; or <lb/>
            it may proceed from some offence taken, or ill-will conceived, <lb/>
            at some particular individuals, which is either just, or arising <lb/>
            from some calumny or bad report; or it may happen if the <lb/>
            subject be displeasing; or if the multitude be swayed by any <lb/>
            impulse from their own hopes or fears. To these four causes <lb/>
            as many remedies may be applied: the severity of rebuke, if <lb/>
            you have sufficient authority for it; admonition, which is a <lb/>
            milder kind of rebuke; an assurance, that if they will give <lb/>
            you a hearing, they will approve what you say; and entreaty, <lb/>
            which is the most condescending method, but sometimes very <lb/>
            advantageous. But on no occasion is facetiousness and ready <lb/>
            wit 2 of more effect, and any smart saying that is consistent <lb/>
            with dignity and true jocularity; for nothing is so easily <lb/>
            diverted from gloom, and often from rancour, as a multitude, <lb/>
            even by a single expression uttered opportunely, quickly, <lb/>
            smartly, and with good humour.</p>
          <p>LXXXIV. " I have now stated to you generally, to the <lb/>
            best of my abilities, what it is my practice, in both kinds of <lb/>
            causes, to pursue, what to avoid, what to keep in view, and to <lb/>
            what method I ordinarily adhere in my pleadings. Nor is <lb/>
            that third kind, panegyric, which I in the commencement <lb/>
            excluded, as it were, from my rules, attended with any diffi- <lb/>
            culty ; but it was because there are many departments of ora- <lb/>
            tory both of greater importance and power, concerning which <lb/>
            hardly any author has given particular rules, and because we <lb/>
            of this country are not accustomed to deal much in panegyric, <note type="footnote"> 1 Quia maxima quasi orator scena videtur concionis. " Because the <lb/>
            greatest stage, as it were, for an orator, appears [to be that] of a public <lb/>
            assembly." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Celeritas. The same word is used in c. 54: hoc quod in celeritats <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. LXXXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            that I set this topic entirely apart. For the Greek authors <lb/>
            themselves, who are the most worthy of being read, wrote their <lb/>
            panegyrics either for amusement, or to compliment some par- <lb/>
            ticular person, rather than with any desire to promote forensic <lb/>
            eloquence; and books of their composition are extant, in <lb/>
            which Themistocles, Aristides, Agesilaus, Epaminondas, Philip, <lb/>
            Alexander, and others, are the subjects of praise. Our lauda- <lb/>
            tory speeches, which we deliver in the forum; have either the <lb/>
            simple and unadorned brevity of testimony, or are written as <lb/>
            funeral orations, which are by no means suitable for the pomp <lb/>
            of panegyric. But as we must sometimes attempt that de- <lb/>
            partment, and must occasionally write panegyrics, as Caius <lb/>
            Lælius wrote one for Publius Tubero, when he wished to <lb/>
            praise his uncle Africanus, and in order that we ourselves <lb/>
            may be enabled to praise, after the manner of the Greeks, <lb/>
            such persons as we may be inclined to praise, let that subject <lb/>
            also form part of our discourse. It is clear, then, that some <lb/>
            qualities in mankind are desirable, and some praiseworthy. <lb/>
            Firth, beauty, strength, power, riches, and other things which <lb/>
            fortune bestows, either amid external circumstances, or as <lb/>
            personal endowments, carry with them no real praise, which <lb/>
            is thought to be due to virtue alone; but, as virtue itself be- <lb/>
            comes chiefly conspicuous in the use and 'management of <lb/>
            such things, these endowments of nature and of fortune are <lb/>
            also to be considered in panegyrics; in which it is mentioned <lb/>
            as the highest praise for a person not to have been haughty <lb/>
            in power, or insolent in wealth, or to have assumed a pre- <lb/>
            eminence over others from the abundance of the blessings of <lb/>
            fortune; so that his riches and plenty seem to have afforded <lb/>
            means and opportunities, not for the indulgence of pride and <lb/>
            vicious appetites, but for the cultivation of goodness and <lb/>
            moderation. Virtue, too, which is of itself praiseworthy, <lb/>
            and without which nothing can be deserving of praise, is dis- <lb/>
            tinguished, however, into several species, some of which are <lb/>
            more adapted to panegyric than others; for there are some <lb/>
            virtues which are conspicuous in the manners of men, and <lb/>
            consist in some degree in affability and beneficence; and there <lb/>
            are others which depend on some peculiar natural genius, or <lb/>
            superior greatness and strength of mind. Clemency, justice, <lb/>
            benignity. fidelity, fortitude in common dangers, are subjects <lb/>
            agreeable to the audience in panegyric ; for all such virtues <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            are thought beneficial, not so much to the persons who possess <lb/>
            them, as to mankind in general;) while wisdom, and that <lb/>
            greatness of soul by which all human affairs are regarded as <lb/>
            mean and inconsiderable, eminent power of thought, and elo- <lb/>
            quence itself, excite indeed no less admiration, but not equal <lb/>
            delight; for they appear to be an ornament and support <lb/>
            rather to the persons themselves whom we commend, than to <lb/>
            those before whom we commend them; yet, in panegyric, <lb/>
            these two kinds of virtues must be united; for the ears. of <lb/>
            men tolerate the praises not only of those parts of virtue <lb/>
            which are delightful and agreeable, but of those which excite <lb/>
            admiration.</p>
          <p>LXXXV. " Since, also, there are certain offices and duties <lb/>
            belonging to every kind of virtue, and since to each virtue its <lb/>
            peculiar praise is due, it will be necessary to specify, in a <lb/>
            panegyric on justice, what he who is praised performed with <lb/>
            fidelity, or equanimity, or in accordance with any other moral <lb/>
            duty. In other points, too, the praise of actions must be <lb/>
            adapted to the nature, power, and name of the virtue under <lb/>
            which they fall. The praise of thoseacts is heard with <lb/>
            the greatest pleasure, which appear to have been undertaken <lb/>
            by men of spirit, without advantage or reward; but those <lb/>
            which have been also attended with toil and danger to them- <lb/>
            selves afford the largest scope for panegyric, because they <lb/>
            may be set forth with the greatest ornaments of eloquence, <lb/>
            and the account of them may be heard with the utmost satis- <lb/>
            faction; for that appears the highest virtue in a man of <lb/>
            eminence, which is beneficial to others, but attended with <lb/>
            danger or toil, or at least without advantage, to himself. It <lb/>
            is commonly regarded, too, as a great and admirable merit, <lb/>
            to have borne adversity with wisdom, not to have been van- <lb/>
            quished by fortune, and to have maintained dignity in the <lb/>
            worst of circumstances. It is also an honour to a man that <lb/>
            distinctions have been bestowed upon him, rewards decreed <lb/>
            to his merit, and that his achievements have been approved <lb/>
            by the judgment of mankind; and, on such subjects, to attri- <lb/>
            bute success itself to the judgment of the immortal gods, is <lb/>
            a part of panegyric. But such actions should be selected for <lb/>
            praise as are either of extraordinary greatness, or unprece- <lb/>
            dented novelty, or singular in their kind; for such as are <lb/>
            trivial, or common, or ordinary, generally appear to deserve <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXXXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            no admiration or even commendation. A comparison also <lb/>
            with other great men has a noble effect in panegyric...</p>
          <p>“ On this species of eloquence I have felt inclined to- say <lb/>
            something more than I had proposed, not so. much for the <lb/>
            improvement of pleading in the forum, which has .been, kept <lb/>
            in view by me through this whole discourse,. as that you <lb/>
            might see that, if panegyric be a part of the orator's business, <lb/>
            .-and nobody denies that it is,-a knowledge of all the virtues, <lb/>
            without which panegyric cannot be composed, is necessary to <lb/>
            the orator. As to the rules for censuring, it is clear, that <lb/>
            they are to be deduced from the vices contrary .to these vir- <lb/>
            tues;. and it is also obvious, that neither can a good man be <lb/>
            praised with propriety and copiousness of matter, without <lb/>
            a knowledge of the several virtues, nor a bad man be stigma- <lb/>
            tized and branded with sufficient distinction and asperity, <lb/>
            without a knowledge of the opposite vices. On these topics <lb/>
            of panegyric and satire we must often touch in all kinds <lb/>
            of causes.</p>
          <p>“ You have now heard what I think about the invention <lb/>
            and arrangement of matter. I shall add some observations <lb/>
            on memory, with a view to lighten the labour of Crassus, and <lb/>
            to leave nothing for him to discuss, but the art of embellish- <lb/>
            ing those departments of eloquence which I have specified."</p>
          <p>LXXXVI. " Proceed," said Crassus; " for I feel pleasure in <lb/>
            seeing you appear as a professed artist, stripped of the disguises <lb/>
            of dissimulation, and fairly exposed to view; and, in leaving <lb/>
            nothing for me to do or but little, you consult my con- <lb/>
            venience, and confer a favour upon me." " How much Heave <lb/>
            you to do," said Antonius, "will be in your own power; for <lb/>
            if you are inclined to act fairly, I leave you everything to do; <lb/>
            but if you wish to shrink from any portion of your under- <lb/>
            taking, you must consider how you can give this company <lb/>
            satisfaction. But to return to the point; I am not," he con- <lb/>
            tinued, " possessed of such intellectual power as Themistocles <lb/>
            had, that I had rather know the art of forgetfulness than that <lb/>
            of memory; and I am grateful to the famous Simonides of <lb/>
            Ceos, who, as people say, first invented an art of memory. <lb/>
            For they relate, that when Simonides was at Crannon in <lb/>
            Thessaly, at an entertainment given by Scopas, a man of <lb/>
            rank and fortune, and had recited a poem which he had com- <lb/>
            posed in his praise, in which, for the sake of embellishment <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            after the manner of the poets, there were many particulars <lb/>
            introduced concerning Castor and Pollux, Scopas told Si- <lb/>
            monides, with extraordinary meanness, that he would pay <lb/>
            him half the sum which he had agreed to give for the poem, <lb/>
            and that he might ask the remainder, if he thought proper, <lb/>
            from his Tyndaridæ, to whom he had given an equal share of <lb/>
            praise. A short time after, they say that a message was <lb/>
            brought in to Simonides, to desire him to go out, as two <lb/>
            youths were waiting at the gate who earnestly wished him to <lb/>
            come forth to them; when he arose, want forth, and found <lb/>
            nobody. In the meantime the apartment in which Scopas <lb/>
            was feasting fell down, and he himself, and his company, were <lb/>
            overwhelmed and buried in the ruins; and when their friends <lb/>
            were desirous to inter their remains, but could not possibly <lb/>
            distinguish one from another, so much crushed were the <lb/>
            bodies, Simonides is said, from his recollection of the place in <lb/>
            which each had sat, to have given satisfactory directions for <lb/>
            their interment. Admonished by this occurrence, he is re- <lb/>
            ported to have discovered, that it is chiefly order that gives <lb/>
            distinctness to memory; and that by those, therefore, who <lb/>
            would improve this part of the understanding, certain places <lb/>
            must be fixed upon, and that of the things which they desire <lb/>
            to keep in memory, symbols must be conceived in the mind, <lb/>
            and ranged, as it were, in those places; thus the order of places <lb/>
            would preserve the order of things, and the symbols of the <lb/>
            things would denote the things themselves; so that we should <lb/>
            use the places as waxen tablets, and the symbols as letters.</p>
          <p>LXXXVII. " How great the benefit of memory is to the <lb/>
            orator, how great the advantage, how great the power, what <lb/>
            need is there for me to observe? Why should I remark how ex- <lb/>
            cellent a thing it is to retain the instructions which you have <lb/>
            received with the cause, and the opinion which you have <lb/>
            formed upon it? to keep all your thoughts upon it fixed <lb/>
            in your mind, all your arrangement of language marked out <lb/>
            there ? to listen to him from whom you receive any informa- <lb/>
            tion, or to him to whom you have to reply, with such power <lb/>
            of retention, that they seem not to have poured their dis- <lb/>
            course into your ears, but to have engraven it on your mental <lb/>
            tablet? They alone. accordingly, who have a vigorous memory, <lb/>
            know what, and how much, and in what manner they are <lb/>
            about to speak; to what they have replied, and what remains <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="margin">C. LXXXVII.] </note> <lb/>
            unanswered; and they also remember many courses that they <lb/>
            have formerly adopted in other cases, and many which they <lb/>
            have heard from others. I must, however, acknowledge that <lb/>
            nature is the chief author of this qualification, as of all those <lb/>
            of which I have previously spoken; (but this whole art of <lb/>
            oratory, or image and resemblance of an art, has the power, <lb/>
            not of engendering and producing anything entirely of itself, <lb/>
            of which no part previously existed in our understandings, <lb/>
            but of being able to give education and strength to what has <lb/>
            been generated, and has had its birth there;) yet there is <lb/>
            scarcely any one of so strong a memory as to retain the order <lb/>
            of his language and thoughts without a previous arrangement <lb/>
            and observation of heads; nor is any one of so weak a <lb/>
            memory as not to receive assistance from this practice and <lb/>
            exercise. For Simonides, or whoever else invented the art, <lb/>
            wisely raw, that those things are the most strongly fixed in <lb/>
            our minds, which are communicated to them, and imprinted <lb/>
            upon them, by the senses; that of all the senses that of seeing <lb/>
            is the most acute; and that, accordingly, those things are most <lb/>
            easily retained in our minds which we have received from the <lb/>
            hearing or the understanding, if they are also recommended <lb/>
            to the imagination by means of the mental eye; so that a <lb/>
            kind of form, resemblance, and representation might denote <lb/>
            invisible objects, and such as are in their nature withdrawn <lb/>
            from the cognisance of the sight, in such a manner, that what <lb/>
            we are scarcely capable of comprehending by thought we may <lb/>
            retain as it were by the aid of the visual faculty. By these <lb/>
            imaginary forms and objects, as by all those that come under <lb/>
            our corporeal vision, our memory is admonished and excited; <lb/>
            but some place for them must be imagined; as bodily shape <lb/>
            cannot be conceived without a place for it. That I may not, <lb/>
            then, be prolix and impertinent upon so well-known and <lb/>
            common a subject, we must fancy many plain distinct places, <lb/>
            at moderate distances; and such symbols as are impressive, <lb/>
            striking, and well-marked, so that they may present them- <lb/>
            selves to the mind, and act upon it with the greatest quickness. <lb/>
            This faculty of artificial memory practice will afford, (from <lb/>
            which proceeds habit,) as well as the derivation of similar <lb/>
            words converted and altered in cases, or transferred from <lb/>
            particulars to generals, and the idea of an entire sentence from <lb/>
            the symbol of a single word, after the manner and method of <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>

          <p>LXXXVIII. " But the memory of words, which, however, <lb/>
            is less necessary for us,' is to be distinguished by , a greater <lb/>
            variety of symbols; for there are many words which, like <lb/>
            joints, connect the members of our speech, that cannot <lb/>
            possibly be represented by anything similar to them; and for. <lb/>
            these we must invent symbols that we may invariably use. <lb/>
            The memory of things is the proper business of the orator; <lb/>
            this we may be enabled to impress on ourselves by the creation <lb/>
            of imaginary figures, aptly arranged, to represent particular <lb/>
            heads, so that we may recollect thoughts by images, and their <lb/>
            order by place. Nor is that true which is said by people un- <lb/>
            skilled in this artifice, that the memory is oppressed by the <lb/>
            weight of these representations, aud that even obscured which <lb/>
            unassisted nature might have clearly kept in view; for I have <lb/>
            seen men of consummate abilities, and an almost divine faculty <lb/>
            of memory, as Charmadas at Athens, and Scepsius Metrodorus <lb/>
            in Asia, who is said to be still living, each of whom used. to <lb/>
            say that, as he wrote with letters on wax, so he wrote with <lb/>
            symbols as it were, whatever he wished to remember, on <lb/>
            these places which he had conceived in imagination. Though, <lb/>
            therefore, a memory cannot be entirely formed by this prac- <lb/>
            tice, if there is none given by nature; yet certainly, if there <lb/>
            is latent natural faculty, it may be called forth.</p>
          <p>" You have now had a very long dissertation from a person <lb/>
            whom I wish you may not esteem impudent, but who is cer- <lb/>
            tainly not over-modest, in having spoken, so copiously as <lb/>
            I have done, upon the art of eloquence, in your hearing, <lb/>
            Catulus, and that of Lucius Crassus; for of the rest of the <lb/>
            company the age might perhaps reasonably make less impres- <lb/>
            sion upon me; but you will certainly excuse me, if you but <lb/>

            think that I have reaped this benefit, that I am freed from a <lb/>
            great mistake, and relieved from that astonishment which I <lb/>
            used always to feel,-in common with many others, as to the <lb/>
            source from which that divine power of yours in pleading was <lb/>
            derived; for I never imagined that you had even slightly <lb/>
            touched upon those matters, of which I now perceive that you <lb/>
            possess an exact knowledge, gathered. from all quarters, and <lb/>
            which, taught -by experience, you have partly corrected and <lb/>
            partly approved. -Nor have I now a less high opinion of your <lb/>
            eloquence, while I have a far higher one of your general merit <lb/>
            and diligence; and I am pleased, at the same time, that my <lb/>
            own judgment is confirmed, inasmuch as I always laid it <lb/>
            down as a maxim, that no man can attain a character for <lb/>
            wisdom and eloquence without the greatest study, industry, <lb/>
            and learning. But-what was it that you meant, when you <lb/>
            said that we should excuse you if we knew the motive which <lb/>
            had impelled you to this discourse? What other motive <lb/>
            could there be but your inclination to oblige us, and to satisfy <lb/>
            the desire of these young gentlemen, who have listened to you <lb/>
            with the utmost attention ?"</p>
          <p>“I was desirous," replied Antonius, "to take away from <lb/>
            Crassus every pretence for refusal, who would, I was sure; <lb/>
            engage in- such a kind of dissertation either a little too <lb/>
            modestly, or too reluctantly, for I would not apply the word <lb/>
            disdainfully to a man of his affability. But what excuse will <lb/>
            he now be able to make ? That he is a person of consular and <lb/>
            censorial dignity? I might have made the same excuse. <lb/>
            Will he plead-his age? He is four years younger than I. <lb/>
            Can he say that he is ignorant of these matters, of which <lb/>
            I indeed have snatched some knowledge late in life, cur- <lb/>
            sorily, and, as people say, at spare times, while he has <lb/>
            applied to them from his youth with the most, diligent study, <lb/>
            under the most able masters? I will say nothing of his genius, <lb/>
            in which no man was ever his equal; for no one that hears me <lb/>
            speak, has so contemptible an opinion of himself, as not to <lb/>
            hope to speak better,, or at least as well; but while Crassus is <lb/>
            speaking, no one is so conceited as to have the presumption <lb/>
            to. think that he shall ever speak like him. Lest persons, <lb/>
            therefore, of so much dignity as the present company, should <lb/>
            have come to you in vain, let us at length, Crassus, hear you <lb/>
            speak.” <pb n="330"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. II. </note>XC. “ If I should grant you, Antonius," replied Crassus, <lb/>
            " that these things are so, which however are far otherwise, <lb/>
            what have you left for me this day, or. for any man, that <lb/>
            he can possibly say? For I will speak, my dearest friends, <lb/>
            what I really think: I have often heard men of learning, <lb/>
            (why do I say often? I should rather say sometimes; for how <lb/>
            could I have that opportunity often, when I entered the <lb/>
            forum quite a youth, and was never absent from it longer than <lb/>
            during my qusestorship ?) but I have heard, as I said yester- <lb/>
            day, both while I was at Athens, men of the greatest learning, <lb/>
            and in Asia that famous rhetorician Scepsius Metrodorus, <lb/>
            discoursing upon these very subjects; but no one of them <lb/>
            ever appeared to me to have engaged in such a dissertation <lb/>
            with greater extent of knowledge, or greater penetration, than <lb/>
            our friend has shown to-day; but if it were otherwise, and if <lb/>
            I thought anything had been omitted by Antonius, I should <lb/>
            not be so unpolite, nay so almost churlish, as to think that a <lb/>
            trouble which I perceived to be your desire." “ Have you <lb/>
            then forgotten, Crassus," said Sulpicius, " that Antonius <lb/>
            made such a division with you, that he should explain the <lb/>
            equipment and implements of the orator, and leave it to you <lb/>
            to speak of decoration and embellishment ?" " In the first <lb/>
            place," rejoined Crassus, " who gave Antonius leave either to <lb/>
            make such a partition, or to choose first that part which he <lb/>
            liked best ? In the next, if I rightly comprehended what <lb/>
            I heard with the utmost pleasure, he seemed to me to treat of <lb/>
            both these matters in conjunction." " But," observed Cotta, <lb/>
            “ he said nothing of the embellishments of language, or on <lb/>
            that excellence from which eloquence derives its very name." <lb/>
            " Antonius then," said Crassus, " left me nothing but words, <lb/>
            and took the substance for himself." " Well," remarked Cæsar, <lb/>
            " if he has left you the more difficult part, we have reason to <lb/>
            desire to hear you; if that which is the easier, you have <lb/>
            no reason to refuse." "And in regard to what you said, <lb/>
            Crassus," interposed Catulus, " that if we would stay and pass <lb/>
            the day with you here, you would comply with our wishes, <lb/>
            do you not think it binding on your honour?” Cotta then <lb/>
            smiled, and said, “ I might, Crassus, excuse you; but take <lb/>
            care that Catulus has not made it a matter of religious <lb/>
            faith; it is a point for the censor's cognisance; and you <lb/>
            see how disgraceful it would be for a person of censorial <pb n="331"/>
             <note type="margin">C. I.] </note>- <lb/>
            dignity! to render himself obnoxious to such censure." “ Do <lb/>
            as you please, then," replied Crassus; " but for the present, as <lb/>
            it is time, I think we must rise, and take some repose; in the <lb/>
            afternoon, if it is then agreeable to you, I will say something <lb/>
            on these points, unless perchance you may wish to put me off <lb/>
            till to-morrow." They all replied that they were ready to hear <lb/>
            him either at once, or in the afternoon if he preferred; as <lb/>

          <p>CICERO, in the introduction to this book, laments the sad deaths of <lb/>
            Crassus and Antonius. He then proceeds to relate Crassus's further <lb/>
            remarks on eloquence, and especially on style and delivery, in which <lb/>
            he was thought to excel all other speakers. See Cic. de Clar. Orate <lb/>
            c. 38. He shows that an orator should speak correctly, perspicuously, <lb/>
            elegantly, and to the purpose. Style is to be ornamented by a taste- <lb/>
            ful choice of words, and by tropes and figures; and it must have a <lb/>
            certain rhythm or harmony. Some observations are added on action <lb/>
            and delivery in general. In c. 14 a digression is made on the praises <lb/>
            of eloquence, and the combination of a knowledge of philosophy, <lb/>
            especially the Academic and Peripatetic, with the study of it.</p>
          <p>I. WHEN I proceeded to execute my design, brother Quintus, <lb/>
            of relating and committing to writing in this third book, the <lb/>
            remarks which Crassus made after the dissertation of An- <lb/>
            tonius, bitter remembrance renewed in my mind its former <lb/>
            concern and regret; for the genius worthy of immortality, <lb/>
            the learning, the virtue that were in Lucius Crassus, were all <lb/>
            extinguished by sudden death, within ten days from the day <lb/>
            which is comprised in this and the former book. When he <lb/>
            returned to Rome on the last day of the theatrical enter- <lb/>
            tainments,2 he was put into a violent emotion by that oration <lb/>
            which was reported to have been delivered in an assembly of <lb/>
            the people by Philippus, who, it was agreed, had declared, <lb/>
            “ that he must look for another council, as he could not <note type="footnote"> 1 A man who has been censor, as you have been. Proust. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Which accompanied the public games. Compare i. 7. </note> <pb n="332"/>

            carry on the government with such a senate;” and on the <lb/>
            morning of the thirteenth of September, both Crassus and a <lb/>
            full senate came into the house on-the call of Drusus. There, <lb/>
            when Drusus had made many complaints against Philippus, <lb/>
            he brought formally before the senate the fact that the <lb/>
            consul had thrown such grievous obloquy on that-order, in, <lb/>
            his speech-to the people. Here, as I have often heard it <lb/>
            unanimously said by men of the greatest judgment, although <lb/>
            indeed it continually happened to Crassus, whenever he had <lb/>
            delivered a speech more exquisite than ordinary, that he was <lb/>
            always thought never to have spoken better, yet by universal <lb/>
            consent it was then determined, that all other orators had <lb/>
            always been excelled by Crassus, but that on that day he had <lb/>
            been excelled by himself; for he deplored the misfortune and <lb/>
            unsupported condition of the senate; an order whose heredi- <lb/>
            tary dignity was then being torn from it by a consul, as by <lb/>
            some lawless ruffian, a consul whose duty it was to act the <lb/>
            part of a good parent or trusty guardian towards it; but said <lb/>
            that it was not surprising, if, after he had ruined the com- <lb/>
            monwealth by his own counsels, he should divorce the coun- <lb/>
            sels of the senate from the commonwealth. When he had <lb/>
            applied these expressions, which were like firebrands, to Phi- <lb/>
            lippus, who was a man of violence, as well as of eloquence, <lb/>
            and of the utmost vigour to resist opposition, he could not <lb/>
            restrain himself, but burst forth into a furious flame, and <lb/>
            resolved to bind Crassus to good behaviour, by forfeiting his <lb/>
            securities.1 On that occasion, many things are reported to <lb/>
            have been uttered by Crassus with a sort of divine sublimity, <lb/>
            refusing to acknowledge as a consul him who would not allow <lb/>
            him to possess the senatorial dignity: Do you, said he, who, <lb/>
            when you thought the general authority of the whole senatorial <lb/>
            order entrusted to you as a pledge, yet perfidiously annulled it <lb/>
            in the view of the Roman people, imagine that I can be terrified <lb/>
            by such petty forfeitures ,as those ? It is not such pledges that <lb/>
            are to be forfeited, ifyou would bind Lucius Crassus to silence; <lb/>
            for that purpose you must cut out this tongue; and even if it <note type="footnote"> 1 Pignoribus ablatis. The senators and others were obliged to attend <lb/>

          <p>II. It appeared that a multitude of other expressions were <lb/>
            then uttered by him with the most vehement efforts of mind, <lb/>
            thought, and spirits; and that that resolution of his, which <lb/>
            the senate adopted in a full house, was proposed by him with <lb/>
            the utmost magnificence and dignity of language, That the <lb/>
            counsel and fidelity of the senate had never been wanting to <lb/>
            the commonwealth, in order to do justice to the Roman people; <lb/>
            and he was present (as appears from the names entered in, the <lb/>
            register) at the recording of the resolution. This however <lb/>
            was the last swan-like note and speech of that divine orator; <lb/>
            and, asif expecting to hear it again, we used, after his death, <lb/>
            to go into the senate-house, that we might contemplate the <lb/>
            spot on'which he had last stood to speak; for we heard that <lb/>
            he was seized at the time with a pain in his side while he was <lb/>
            speaking, and that a copious perspiration followed; after <lb/>
            which he was struck with a chillness, and, returning home in a <lb/>
            fever, died the seventh day after of pleurisy. 0 how fallacious <lb/>
            are. the. hopes of mortals, how frail is our condition,, and how <lb/>
            insignificant all our ambitious efforts, which are often broken <lb/>
            and thrown down in the middle. of their'course, and over- <lb/>
            whelmed as it were in their voyage, even before they gain <lb/>
            a sight of the harbour! For as, long as the life of Crassus <lb/>
            was perplexed with the toils of ambition, so long was he <lb/>
            more distinguished for the performance of private duties, and <lb/>
            the praises due to. his genius, than for any benefit; that he <lb/>
            reaped from his greatness, or for the dignified rank which he <lb/>
            bore in the republic; but the first year which, after a dis- <lb/>
            charge of all the. honourable offices of the state,: opened to <lb/>
            him,the entrance to supreme-authority by universal consent, <lb/>
            overthrew all his hopes, and all his future schemes of life,' by <lb/>
            death. This was a, melancholy, occurrence to his friends, a <lb/>
            grievous calamity to his country, and a heavy affliction to all <lb/>
            the virtuous part of mankind; abut such misfortunes after- <lb/>
            wards fell upon the commonwealth, that life does not appear <lb/>
            to me. to have been. taken away from Lucius Crassus by <lb/>
            the immortal gods as a privation, but death to, have been <lb/>
            bestowed on him as a blessing. He did not live to behold <lb/>
            Italy blazing with war, or the senate overwhelmed with <lb/>
            popular odium, or the leading men of tt e state accused o. <pb n="334"/>

            upon the power and vicissitudes of fortune, my observations <lb/>
            shall not expatiate too widely, but shall be confined almost <lb/>
            to the very personages who are contained in this dialogue, <lb/>
            which I have begun to detail. For who would not call the <lb/>
            death of Lucius Crassus, which has been so often lamented <lb/>
            by multitudes, a happy one, when he calls to mind the fate <lb/>
            of those very persons who were almost the last that held dis- <lb/>
            course with him? For we ourselves remember, that Quintus <lb/>
            Catulus, a man distinguished for almost every species ot <lb/>
            merit, when he entreated, not the security of his fortunes, <lb/>
            but retreat into exile, was reduced to deprive himself of life. <lb/>
            It was then, too, that that illustrious head of Marcus Antonius, <lb/>
            by whom the lives of so many citizens had been preserved, <lb/>
            was fixed upon the very rostra on which he had so strenuously <lb/>
            defended the republic when consul, and which he had adorned <lb/>
            with imperial trophies when censor. Not far from his was <lb/>
            exposed the head of Caius Julius, (who was betrayed by his <lb/>
            Tuscan host,) with that of Lucius Julius his brother; so that <lb/>
            he who did not behold such atrocities may justly be thought <lb/>
            to have prolonged his life during the existence of the consti- <lb/>
            tution, and to have expired together with it. He neither <lb/>
            beheld his near relation, Publius Crassus, a man of the greatest <lb/>
            magnanimity, slain by his own hand, nor saw the image of <lb/>
            Vesta sprinkled with the blood of the pontifex, his colleague; <lb/>
            and (such were his feelings towards his country) even the <lb/>
            cruel death of Caius Carbo, his greatest enemy, that occurred <lb/>
            on the same day, would have caused additional grief to him. <lb/>
            He did not behold the horrible and miserable fate of those <lb/>
            young men who had devoted themselves to him; of whom <lb/>
            Caius Cotta, whom he had left in a promising condition, <lb/>
            was expelled, through popular prejudice, from his office of <note type="footnote"> 1 His daughter Licinia was married to Publius Scipio, the grandson <lb/>

            tribune, a few days after the death of Crassus, and, not many <lb/>
            months afterwards, driven from the city. And Sulpicius, who <lb/>
            had been involved in the same popular fury, attempted in his <lb/>
            tribuneship to spoil of all their honours those with whom, <lb/>
            as a private individual, he had lived in the greatest fami- <lb/>
            liarity; but when he was shooting forth into the highest <lb/>
            glory of eloquence, his life was taken from him by the sword, <lb/>
            and punishment was inflicted on his rashness, not without <lb/>
            great damage to the republic. I am indeed of opinion that <lb/>
            you, Crassus, received as well your birth as your death from <lb/>
            the peculiar appointment of divine providence, both on account <lb/>
            of the distinction of your life and the season of your death; <lb/>
            for, in accordance with your virtue and firmness of mind, you <lb/>
            must either have submitted to the cruelty of civil slaughter; <lb/>
            or if any fortune had rescued you from so barbarous a death, <lb/>
            the same fortune would have compelled you to be a spectator <lb/>
            of the ruins of your country; and not only the dominion of <lb/>
            ill-designing men, but even the victory of the honourable <lb/>
            party, would, on account of the civil massacres intermingled <lb/>
            with it, have been an affliction to you.</p>
          <p>IV. Indeed, when I reflect, brother Quintus, upon the <lb/>
            calamities of these great men, (whose fates I have just men- <lb/>
            tioned,) and those which we ourselves have felt and experienced <lb/>
            from our extraordinary and eminent love for our country, <lb/>
            your opinions appear to me to be founded on justice and <lb/>
            wisdom, as you have always, on account of such numerous, <lb/>
            such violent, and such sudden afflictions as have happened to <lb/>
            the most illustrious and virtuous men, dissuaded me from <lb/>
            all civil contention and strife. But, because we cannot put <lb/>
            affairs into the same state as if nothing had occurred, <lb/>
            and because our extreme toils are compensated and miti- <lb/>
            gated by great glory, let us apply ourselves to those con- <lb/>
            solations, which are not only pleasant to us when troubles <lb/>
            have subsided, but may also be salutary while they con- <lb/>
            tinue ; let us deliver as a memorial to posterity the remain- <lb/>
            ing and almost the last discourse of Lucius Crassus; and let <lb/>
            us express the gratitude to him which he so justly merited, <lb/>
            although in terms by no means equal to his genius, yet to <lb/>
            the best of our endeavours; for there is not any of us, when <lb/>
            he reads the admirably written dialogues of Plato, in almost <lb/>
            all of which the character of Socrates is represented, who <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            does not, thougl. what is written of him is written in a divine <lb/>
            spirit, conceive something still greater of him about whom it <lb/>
            is : written: and it is also my request, not indeed to you, <lb/>
            my brother, who attribute to me perfection in all things, but <lb/>
            to others who shall take this treatise into their hands, that <lb/>
            they would entertain a nobler conception of Lucius Crassus <lb/>
            than any that is expressed by me. For I, who was not <lb/>
            present at this dialogue, and to whom Caius Cotta communi- <lb/>
            cated only the topics and heads of the dissertation, have en- <lb/>
            deavoured to shadow forth in the conversation of the speakers <lb/>
            those peculiar styles of oratory, in which I knew that each of <lb/>
            them was conspicuous. But if any person shall be induced <lb/>
            by the common opinion, to think either that Antonius was <lb/>
            more jejune, or Crassus more exuberant in style, than they <lb/>
            have been respectively described by me, he will be among the <lb/>
            number of those who either never heard these great men, or <lb/>
            who have not abilities to judge; for each of them was (as I <lb/>
            have explained before) superior to all other speakers, in appli- <lb/>
            cation, and genius, and learning, as well as excellent in his <lb/>
            particular style, so that embellishment in language was not <lb/>
            wanting in Antonius, nor redundant in Crassus. •</p>
          <p>V. As soon therefore as they had withdrawn before noon, <lb/>
            and reposed themselves a little, Cotta said that he particularly <lb/>
            observed that Crassus employed all the time about the middle <lb/>
            of the day in the most earnest and profound meditation; and <lb/>
            that he himself, who was well acquainted with the counte- <lb/>
            nance which he assumed whenever he was going to speak in <lb/>
            public,. and the nature of his looks when he was fixed in con- <lb/>
            templation, and had often remarked them in causes of the <lb/>
            greatest importance, came on purpose, while the rest were <lb/>
            asleep, into the room in which Crassus had lain down on a <lb/>
            couch prepared for him, and that, as soon as he perceived <lb/>
            him to be settled in a thoughtful posture, he immediately <lb/>
            retired; and that, almost two hours passed in that perfect <lb/>
            stillness. Afterwards, when they all, as the day was now <lb/>
            verging to the afternoon, waited upon Crassus, Cæsar said, <lb/>
            " Well, Crassus, shall we go and take our seats? though we <lb/>
            only come to put you in mind of your promise, and not to <lb/>
            demand the performance of it." Crassus then replied, " Do <lb/>
            you imagine that I have the assurance to think that I can <lb/>
            continue longer indebted to such friends as you, especially in <pb n="337"/>
            <note type="margin">C. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            an obligation of this nature?" "What place then will suit.' <lb/>
            you?" said Caesar. "a seat in the middle of the wood,for <lb/>
            that is the most shady and cool?” " Very well," replied <lb/>
            Crassus, “ for there is in that spot a seat not at all unsuited <lb/>
            far this discourse of ours." This arrangement being agreeable <lb/>
            to the rest of the company, they went into the wood, and sat <lb/>
            down there with the most earnest desire to listen.</p>
          <p>Crassus then said, " Not only the influence of your autho- <lb/>
            rity and friendship, but also the ready compliance of Antonius, <lb/>
            have taken from me all liberty of refusal, though I had an <lb/>
            excellent pretext for refusing. In the partition, however, of <lb/>
            this dissertation between us; Antonius, when he assumed to <lb/>
            himself the part of speaking upon those matters which form <lb/>
            the subject of the orator's speech, and left to me to explain <lb/>
            how they should. be embellished, divided things which <lb/>
            are in their nature incapable of separation; for as every <lb/>
            speech consists of the matter and the language, the language <lb/>
            can have no place if you take away the. matter, nor the <lb/>
            matter receive any illustration if you take away the lan- <lb/>
            guage. Indeed, the great men of antiquity, embracing some- <lb/>
            thing of superior magnificence in their ideas, appear to me to <lb/>
            have seen further into the nature of things than the visual <lb/>
            facilities of our minds can penetrate; as they said that all <lb/>
            these things, above and below, formed one system, and were <lb/>
            linked together in strict 'union by one and the same power, <lb/>
            and one principle of universal harmony in nature; for there <lb/>
            is no order of things which can either of itself, if forcibly <lb/>
            separated from the rest, preserve a permanent existence, or <lb/>
            without which the rest can maintain their power and eternal <lb/>
            duration.</p>
          <p>VI. “ But, if this reasoning appear to be too comprehensive <lb/>
            to be embraced by human sense and understanding, yet that <lb/>
            saying of Plato is true, and certainly not unknown to you, <lb/>
            Catulus, ‘ that all the learning of these liberal and polite de- <lb/>
            partments of knowledge is linked together in one bond of union; <lb/>
            for when the power of that reason, by which the causes and <lb/>
            events of things are known, is once thoroughly discerned, a cer- <lb/>
            tain wonderful agreement and harmony, as it were, in all the <lb/>
            sciences is discovered.' But, if this also appear to be too sublime <lb/>
            a thought for us to contemplate who are prostrate on the <lb/>
            earth, it, however, certainly is our duty to know and remember <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            that which we have embraced, which we profess, which wo <lb/>
            have taken upon ourselves. Since eloquence, as I observed <lb/>
            yesterday, and Antonius signified in some passages of his dis- <lb/>
            course this morning, is one and the same, into whatever tracts <lb/>
            or regions of'd'ebate it may be carried: for whether itdis- <lb/>
            courses concerning the nature of the heavens or of the earth, <lb/>
            -whether of divine or human power,-whether it speaks <lb/>
            from a lower, or an equal, or a superior place,—whether to <lb/>
            impel an audience, or to instruct, or to deter, or to incite, or <lb/>
            to dissuade, or to inflame, or to soothe,-whether to a small <lb/>
            or to a large assembly,-whether to strangers, to friends, or <lb/>
            alone,-its language is derived through different channels, <lb/>
            not from different sources; and,-wherever it directs its course, <lb/>
            it is attended with the same equipment and decoration. But <lb/>
            since we are overwhelmed by opinions, not only those of the <lb/>
            vulgar, but those also of men imperfectly instructed, who <lb/>
            treat of those things more easily when divided and torn <lb/>
            asunder which they have not capacity to comprehend in <lb/>
            a general view, and who sever the language from the thoughts <lb/>
            like the body from the soul, neither of which separations <lb/>
            can be made without destruction, I will not undertake in <lb/>
            this discourse more than that which is imposed upon me; <lb/>
            I will only signify briefly, that neither can embellishments of <lb/>
            language be found without arrangement and expression of <lb/>
            thoughts, nor can thoughts be made to shine without the <lb/>
            light of language. But before I proceed to touch upon those <lb/>
            particulars by which I think language is beautified and <lb/>
            illumined, I will state briefly what I think concerning elo- <lb/>
            quence in general.</p>
          <p>VII. "There is no one of the natural senses, in my <lb/>
            opinion, which does not include under its general compre- <lb/>
            hension many things dissimilar one to another, but which are <lb/>
            still thought deserving of similar approbation; for we both <lb/>
            perceive many things by the ear, which, although they all <lb/>
            charm us with their sounds, are yet often so various in them-* <lb/>
            selves, that that which we hear last appears to be the most <lb/>
            delightful; and almost innumerable pleasures are received <lb/>
            by the eye, which all captivate us in such a manner as to <lb/>
            delight the same sense in different ways; and pleasures <lb/>
            that bear no sort of resemblance to each other charm the <lb/>
            rest of the senses in such a manner that it is difficult to <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="margin">C. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            determine which affords the most exquisite enjoyment. But <lb/>
            the same observation which is to be made in regard to nature <lb/>
            may be applied also to the different kinds of art. Sculpture <lb/>
            is a single art, in which Myro, Polycletus, and Lysippus <lb/>
            excelled; all of whom differed one from another, but so that <lb/>
            you would not wish any one of them to be unlike himself. <lb/>
            The art and science of painting is one, yet Zeuxis, Aglaophon, <lb/>
            and Apelles are quite unlike one another in themselves, <lb/>
            though to none of them does anything seem wanting in his <lb/>
            peculiar style. And if this be wonderful, and yet true, in <lb/>
            these, as it were, mute arts, how much more wonderful is' it <lb/>
            in language and speech ? which, though employed about the <lb/>
            same thoughts and .words, yet admits of the greatest varia- <lb/>
            tions; and not so that some speakers are to be censured and <lb/>
            others commended, but that those who are allowed to. merit <lb/>
            praise, merit it for different excellences. This is fully exem- <lb/>
            plified in poets, who have the nearest affinity to orators: how <lb/>
            distinct from cach other are Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius; <lb/>
            how distinct, among the Greeks, Æschylus, Sophocles, and <lb/>
            Euripides; though almost equal praise may -be attributed <lb/>
            to them all in different kinds of writing. Then, behold and <lb/>
            contemplate those whose art is the subject of our present <lb/>
            inquiry; what a wide distinction there is between the ac- <lb/>
            complishments and natural abilities of orators! Isocrates <lb/>
            possessed sweetness, Lysias delicacy, Hyperides -pointedness, <lb/>
            Æschines sound, and Demosthenes energy; and which of <lb/>
            them was not excellent ? yet which of them resembled any <lb/>
            one but himself? Africanus had weight, Lælius smoothness, <lb/>
            Galba asperity, Carbo something of fluency and harmony; <lb/>
            but which of these was not an orator of the first rank in <lb/>
            those times ? and yet every one attained that rank by a style <lb/>
            of oratory peculiar to himself.</p>
          <p>VIII. " But why should I search into antiquity for exam- <lb/>
            ples, when I can point to present and living characters ? <lb/>
            What was ever more pleasing to the ear than the language of <lb/>
            our friend Catulus ?. language of such purity, that he appears <lb/>
            to be almost the only orator that speaks pure Latin; and of <lb/>
            such power, that with its peculiar dignity there is yet blended <lb/>
            the utmost politeness and wit. In a word, when I hear him, I <lb/>
            always think that whatever you should add, or.alter, or take <lb/>
            away, his language would be impair ed and deteriorated. Has <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            not our friend Cæsar here, too, introduced a new kind of oratory, <lb/>
            and brought before us an almost peculiar style of eloquence ? <lb/>
            Who has ever, besides him, treated tragical subjects in an <lb/>
            almost comic manner, serious subjects with pleasantry, grave <lb/>
            subjects with gaiety, and subjects suited to the forum with a <lb/>
            grace peculiar to the stage ? in such a way that neither is the <lb/>
            jocular style excluded by the importance of the subject, nor <lb/>
            is the weight of the matter lessened by the humour with <lb/>
            which it is treated. Here are present with us two young <lb/>
            men, almost of equal age, Sulpicius and Cotta; what things <lb/>
            were ever so dissimilar as they are one to another? yet what <lb/>
            is so excellent as they are in their respective styles ? One is <lb/>
            polished and refined, explaining things with the greatest pro- <lb/>
            priety and aptitude of expression; he always adheres to his <lb/>
            cause, and, when he has discovered, with his keen discern- <lb/>
            ment, what he ought to prove to the judge, he directs his <lb/>
            whole attention and force of oratory to that point, without <lb/>
            regarding other arguments; while Sulpicius has a certain <lb/>
            irresistible energy of mind, a most full and powerful voice, a <lb/>
            most vigorous action, and consummate dignity of motion, <lb/>
            united with such weight and copiousness of language, that he' <lb/>
            appears of all men the best qualified by nature for eloquence.</p>
          <p>IX. "I now return to ourselves; (because there has ever <lb/>
            been such a comparison made between us, that we are <lb/>
            brought, as it were, into judgment on account of rivalship, in <lb/>
            the common conversation of mankind;) what two things can <lb/>
            be more dissimilar than Antonius's manner of speaking and <lb/>
            my own ? though he is such an orator that no one can possibly <lb/>
            surpass him; and I, though I am altogether dissatisfied with <lb/>
            myself, am yet in preference to others admitted to a com- <lb/>
            parison with him. Do you notice what the manner of Auto- <lb/>
            nius is ? It is bold, vehement, full of energy and action, <lb/>
            fortified and guarded on every point of the cause, spirited, <lb/>
            acute, explicit, dwelling upon every circumstance, retiring <lb/>
            with honour, pursuing with eagerness, terrifying, supplicating, <lb/>
            exhibiting the greatest variety of language, yet without satiety <lb/>
            to the ear; but as to myself, whatever I am as a speaker <lb/>
            (since I appear to you to hold some place among speakers), I <lb/>
            certainly differ very greatly from his style. What my talents <lb/>
            are it becomes not me to say, because every ere is least <lb/>
            known to himself, and it is extremely difficult for any person <pb n="341"/>
            <note type="margin">C. X.] </note> <lb/>
            to form a judgment of his own capacity ; but the dissimilitude <lb/>
            -may be easily perceived, both from the mediocrity,of my <lb/>
            -action, and from the circumstance that I usually conclude in <lb/>
            the same track in which I first set out; and. that labour <lb/>
            and care in choosing words causes me greater anxiety than <lb/>
            choice of matter, being afraid that if my language should <lb/>
            be a little obsolete, it may,appear unworthy of the expecta- <lb/>
            tion and silent attention of the audience. But if in us who <lb/>
            .are present there are such remarkable dissimilitudes, such <lb/>
            decided peculiarities in each of us, and in all this variety the <lb/>
            better is distinguished from the worse by difference in ability <lb/>
            rather than by difference in kind, and everything is praise- <lb/>
            worthy that is perfect in its nature, what do you imagine <lb/>
            must be the case if we should .take into consideration all the <lb/>
            orators that anywhere exist, or ever existed ? Would it not <lb/>
            happen that almost as many kinds of eloquence as of orators <lb/>
            would be found ? But from this observation of mine, it may <lb/>
            perhaps occur to you, that if there be almost innumerable <lb/>
            varieties and characters of eloquence, dissimilar in species, <lb/>
            yet laudable in their kind, things of so diversified a nature <lb/>
            can never be formed into an art by the same precepts and <lb/>
            one single method of instruction. This is not the case; and <lb/>
            it is to be attentively considered by those who have the con- <lb/>
            duct and education of others, in what direction the natural <lb/>
            genius of each seems principally to incline him. For we see <lb/>
            that from the same schools of artists and masters, eminent in <lb/>
            their respective pursuits, there have gone forth pupils very <lb/>
            unlike each other, yet all praiseworthy, because the instruc- <lb/>
            tion of the teacher has been adapted to each person's natural <lb/>
            genius; a fact of which the most remarkable example (to say <lb/>
            nothing of other sciences) is that saying of Isocrates, all <lb/>
            eminent teacher of eloquence, that he used to apply the spur <lb/>
            to Ephorus, but to put the rein on Theopompus; for the one, <lb/>
            who overleaped all bounds in the boldness of his expressions, <lb/>
            he restrained; the other, who hesitated and was bashful, as <lb/>
            it were, he stimulated: nor did he produce in them any <lb/>
            resemblance to each other, but gave to the one such an addi- <lb/>
            tion, and retrenched from the other so much superfluity, as <lb/>
            to form in both that excellence of which the natural genius <lb/>
            of each was susceptible.</p>
          <p>X. " I thought it necessary to premise these particulars <pb n="342"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            that if every remark of mine did not exactly adapt itself to <lb/>
            the inclinations of you all, and to that peculiar style of speak- <lb/>
            ing which each of you most admired, you might be sensible <lb/>
            that I described that character of eloquence of which I myself <lb/>
            most approved.</p>
          <p>“ Those matters, therefore, of which Antonius has treated <lb/>
            so explicitly, are to be endowed with action and elocution by <lb/>
            the orator in some certain manner. What manner of elocu- <lb/>
            tion can be better (for I will consider action by-and-by) than <lb/>
            that of speaking in pure Latin, with perspicuity, with grace- <lb/>
            fulness, and with aptitude and congruity to the subject in <lb/>
            question ? Of the two which I mentioned first, purity and <lb/>
            clearness of language, I do not suppose that any account is <lb/>
            expected from me; for we do not attempt to teach him to be <lb/>
            an orator who cannot speak; nor can we hope that he who <lb/>
            cannot speak grammatical Latin will speak elegantly; nor <lb/>
            that he who cannot speak what we can understand, will ever <lb/>
            speak anything for us to admire. Let us, therefore, omit <lb/>
            these matters, which are easy of attainment, though necessary <lb/>
            in practice ; for the one is taught in school-learning and the <lb/>
            rudiments of children; the other1 is cultivated for this reason, <lb/>
            that what every person says may be understood,-a qualifica- <lb/>
            tion which we perceive indeed to be necessary, yet that none <lb/>
            can be held in less estimation.2 But all elegance of lan- <lb/>
            guage, though it receive a polish from the science of grammar, <lb/>
            is yet augmented by the reading of orators and poets; for <lb/>
            those ancients, who could not then adorn what they expressed, <lb/>
            had almost all a kind of nobleness of diction; and those <lb/>
            who are accustomed to their style cannot express themselves <lb/>
            otherwise than in pure Latin, even though they desire to do <lb/>
            so. Yet we must not make use of such of their words as our <lb/>
            modern mode of speaking does not admit, unless sometimes <lb/>
            for the sake of ornament, and but sparingly, as I shall ex- <lb/>
            plain; but he who is studious and much conversant with <lb/>
            ancient writers, will make such use of common expressions as <lb/>
            always to adopt the most eligible.</p>
          <p>XI. “ In order to speak pure Latin, we must take care not <lb/>
            only to use words with which nobody can justly find fault, <note type="footnote"> 1 Perspicuity. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This seems to be speaking rather too lightly of the merit of <lb/>

            and preserve the construction by proper cases, and tenses, <lb/>
            and genders, and numbers, so that there may be nothing con- <lb/>
            fused, or incongruous, or preposterous; but also that the <lb/>
            tongue, and the breath, and the tone of the voice come under <lb/>
            proper regulation. I would not have letters sounded with <lb/>
            too much affectation, or uttered imperfectly through negli- <lb/>
            gence; I would not have the words dropped out without <lb/>
            expression or spirit; I would not have them puffed and, as it <lb/>
            were, panted forth, with a difficulty of breathing; for I do <lb/>
            not as yet speak of those things relating to the voice which <lb/>
            belong to oratorical delivery, but merely of that which seems <lb/>
            to me to concern pronunciation. For there are certain faults <lb/>
            which every one is desirous to avoid, as a too delicate and <lb/>
            effeminate tone of voice, or one that is extravagantly harsh <lb/>
            and grating. There is also a fault which some industriously <lb/>
            strive to attain; a rustic and rough pronunciation is agree- <lb/>
            able to some, that their language, if it has that tone, may <lb/>
            seem to partake more of antiquity; as Lucius Cotta, an ac- <lb/>
            quaintance of yours, Catulus, appears to me to take a delight <lb/>
            in the broadness of his speech and the rough sound of his <lb/>
            voice, and thinks that what he says will savour of the antique <lb/>
            if it certainly savour of rusticity. But your harmony and <lb/>
            sweetness delight me ; I do not refer to the harmony of your <lb/>
            words, which is a principal point, but one which method in- <lb/>
            troduces, learning teaches, practice in reading and speaking <lb/>
            confirms; but I mean the mere sweetness of pronunciation, <lb/>
            which, as among the Greeks it was peculiar to the Athenians, <lb/>
            so in the Latin tongue is chiefly remarkable in this city. At <lb/>
            Athens, learning among the Athenians themselves has long <lb/>
            been entirely neglected; there remains in that city only the <lb/>
            seat of the studies which the citizens do not cultivate, but <lb/>
            which foreigners enjoy, being captivated in a manner with <lb/>
            the very name and authority of the place; yet any illiterate <lb/>
            Athenian will easily surpass the most learned Asiatics,1 not in <lb/>
            his language, but in sweetness of tone, not so much in speak- <lb/>
            ing well as in speaking agreeably. Our citizens2 pay less <lb/>
            attention to letters than the people of Latium, yet among all <lb/>

            of the mouth, and in the general tone of pronunciation.</p>
          <p>XII. “ As there is a certain tone of voice, therefore, peculiar <lb/>
            to the Roman people and city, in which nothing can offend, <lb/>
            or displease, nothing can be liable to animadversion, nothing <lb/>

            and learn to avoid not only the asperity of rustic but. the <lb/>
            strangeness of outlandish pronunciation. - Indeed when I <lb/>
            listen to my wife's mother, Lælia,2 (for women more easily <lb/>
            preserve the ancient language unaltered, because, not having <lb/>
            experience of the conversation of a multitude of people, they <lb/>
            always retain what they originally learned,) I hear her with <lb/>
            such attention that I imagine myself listening to Plautus or <lb/>
            Nævius; she has a tone of voice so unaffected-and simple, that <lb/>
            it seems to carry in it nothing of ostentation or imitation:; <lb/>
            from whence I judge that her father and forefathers spoke in <lb/>
            like manner; not with a rough tone, as he whom I mentioned, <lb/>
            nor with one broad, or rustic, or too open, but with one that <lb/>
            was close and equable and smooth.. Our friend Cotta, there- <lb/>
            fore, whose broad manner of speaking you, Sulpicius, some- <lb/>
            times imitate, so as to drop the letter I and pronounce ;E as <lb/>
            full as possible, does not seem to me to resemble the ancient <lb/>
            orators, but the modern farmers." As Sulpicius, laughedat <lb/>
            this, " I will act with you," said Crassus, " in such a manner, <lb/>
            that, as you oblige me to speak, you shall hear something of <lb/>
            your own faults." " I wish we may," replied Sulpicius, " for <lb/>
            that is what we desire; and if you do so, we shall to-day, <lb/>
            I fancy, throw off many of our inelegances." " But," said <lb/>
            Crassus, " I cannot censure you, Sulpicius, without being in <lb/>
            danger of censure myself; since Antouius has declared that <lb/>
            he thinks you very similar to me."3 " But," rejoined Sulpicius, <lb/>
            " as Antonius also recommended us to imitate those things <lb/>
            which were most conspicuous in any one,4 I am afraid'in con- <lb/>

            perhaps something of your action." "With what you have <lb/>
            caught from me, then," said Crassus, " I find no fault, lest I <lb/>
            should . ridicule myself; (but there are many more and <lb/>
            greater, faults of mine than you mention;) of faults, however, <lb/>

          <p>XIII. " Let us therefore pass over the rules for speaking the <lb/>
            Latin-tongue in its purity; which the teaching given- to <lb/>
            children conveys, which refined knowledge and method in <lb/>
            study, or the habit of daily and domestic conversation <lb/>
            cherishes, and which books and the reading of the ancient <lb/>
            orators and poets confirm. Nor let us dwell long upon that <lb/>
            other point, so as to discuss by what means we may succeed <lb/>
            in making what we say understood ; an object which we shall <lb/>
            doubtless effect by speaking good Latin, adopting words <lb/>
            in common use, and such as aptly express what we wish to <lb/>
            communicate or explain, without any ambiguous word or <lb/>
            phrase, not making our sentences too long, not making such <lb/>
            observations as are drawn from other subjects, for the sake of <lb/>
            comparison, too prolix; avoiding all incoherency of thought, <lb/>
            reversion of the order of time, all confusion of persons, all <lb/>
            irregularity of. arrangement whatever. In short, the whole <lb/>
            matter is so easy, that it often appears astonishing to me, that <lb/>
            what the advocate would express should, be more difficult to <lb/>
            understand, than he who. employs the advocate would be, if <lb/>
            he were to speak on his own business; for the persons them- <lb/>
            selves who bring cases to us, give us in general such instruc- <lb/>
            tions, that you would not desire anything to be delivered in <lb/>
            a plainer manner; but as soon as Fufius, or your equal in age <lb/>
            Pomponius,1 proceeds to plead those cases, I do not find them <lb/>
            equally intelligible, unless I give an extraordinary degree of <lb/>
            attention; their speech is so confused .and ill arranged that <lb/>
            there is nothing first, and nothing second; there is such <lb/>
            a jumble of strange words, that language, which ought to <lb/>
            throw a light upon things, involves them in. obscurity and <lb/>
            darkness; and the speakers, in what they say, seem in a <lb/>
            manner to contradict themselves. But; if it is agreeable, <lb/>
            since I think that these topics must appear troublesome and <lb/>
            distasteful, at least to you of a more advanced age,2 let us <note type="footnote"> 1 See L 39; Brut. c. 57, 62, 90..Ellendt. </note><note type="footnote">2 Antonius and Catullus. </note> <pb n="346"/>

            factory."1</p>
          <p>XIV. " You see," said Antonius, " how inattentive we are, <lb/>
            and how unwillingly we listen to you,2 when we might be in- <lb/>
            duced (I judge from myself) to neglect all other concerns to <lb/>
            follow you and give you our attention; so elegant are your <lb/>
            remarks upon unpleasing, so copious upon barren, so new <lb/>
            upon common subjects."</p>
          <p>" Those two parts indeed, Antonius," continued Crassus, <lb/>
            " which I have just run over, or rather have almost passed by, <lb/>
            that of speaking in pure Latin, and with perspicuity, were <lb/>
            easy to treat; those which remain are important, intricate, <lb/>
            diversified, weighty, on which depends all the admiration <lb/>
            bestowed upon ability and all the praise given to eloquence; <lb/>
            for nobody ever admired an orator for merely speaking good <lb/>
            Latin; if he speaks otherwise, they ridicule him; and not <lb/>
            only do not think him an orator, but not even a man. Nor <lb/>
            has any one ever extolled a speaker for merely speaking <lb/>
            in such a manner that those who were present understood <lb/>
            what he said; though every one has despised him who was <lb/>
            not able to do so. Whom then do men regard with awe? <lb/>
            What speaker do they behold with astonishment ? At whom <lb/>
            do they utter exclamations? Whom do they consider as <lb/>
            a deity, if I may use the expression, amongst mortals? Him <lb/>
            who speaks distinctly, explicitly, copiously, and luminously, <lb/>
            both as to matter and words; who produces in his language <lb/>
            a sort of rhythm and harmony; who speaks, as I call it, grace- <lb/>
            fully. Those also who treat their subject as the importance of <lb/>
            things and persons requires, are to be commended for that <lb/>
            peculiar kind of merit, which I term aptitude and congruity. <lb/>
            Antonius said that he had never seen any who spoke in such <lb/>
            a manner, and observed that to such only was to be attri- <lb/>
            buted the distinguishing title of eloquence. On my authority, <lb/>
            therefore, deride and despise all those who imagine that <lb/>
            from the precepts of such as are now called rhetoricians they <lb/>
            have gained all the powers of oratory, and have not yet been <lb/>
            able to understand what character they hold, or what they <lb/>
            profess; for indeed, by an orator everything that relates to <lb/>
            human life, since that is the field on which his abilities are <lb/>
            displayed, and is the subject for his eloquence, should be ex- <note type="footnote"> 1 Odiosiora. Auditoribus odiosiora. Schutz. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ironically. </note> <pb n="347"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            amined, heard, read, discussed, handled, and considered; since <lb/>
            eloquence is one of the most eminent virtues; and though all <lb/>
            the virtues are in their nature equal and alike, yet one species <lb/>
            is more beautiful and noble than another; as is this power, <lb/>
            which, comprehending a knowledge of things, expresses the <lb/>
            thoughts and purposes of the mind in such a manner, that it <lb/>
            can impel the audience whithersoever it inclines its force; <lb/>
            and, the greater is its influence, the more necessary it is that <lb/>
            it should be united with probity and eminent judgment; for <lb/>
            if we bestow the faculty of eloquence upon persons destitute <lb/>
            of these virtues, we shall not make them orators, but give <lb/>
            arms to madmen.</p>
          <p>XV. " This faculty, I say, of thinking and speaking, this <lb/>
            power of eloquence, the ancient Greeks denominated wisdom. <lb/>
            Hence the Lycurgi, the Pittaci, the Solons; and, compared <lb/>
            with them, our Coruncanii, Fabricii, Catos, and Scipios, were <lb/>
            perhaps not so learned, but were certainly of a like force and <lb/>
            inclination of mind. Others, of equal ability, but of dissimilar <lb/>
            affection towards the pursuits of life, preferred ease and <lb/>
            retirement, as Pythagoras, Democritus, Anaxagoras, and <lb/>
            transferred their attention entirely from civil polity to the <lb/>
            contemplation of nature ; a mode of life which, on account of <lb/>
            its tranquillity, and the pleasure derived from science, than <lb/>
            which nothing is more delightful to mankind, attracted <lb/>
            a greater number than was of advantage to public concerns. <lb/>
            Accordingly, as men of the most excellent natural talents <lb/>
            gave themselves up to that study, in the enjoyment of the <lb/>
            greatest abundance of free and unoccupied time, so men of <lb/>
            the greatest learning, blessed with excess of leisure and fer- <lb/>
            tility of thought, imagined it their duty to make more things <lb/>
            than were really necessary the objects of their attention, <lb/>
            investigation, and inquiry. That ancient learning, indeed, <lb/>
            appears to have been at the same time the preceptress of <lb/>
            living rightly and of speaking well; nor were there separate <lb/>
            masters for those subjects, but the same teachers formed the <lb/>
            morals and the language; as Phoenix in Homer, who says <lb/>
            that he was appointed a companion in war to the young <lb/>
            Achilles by his father Peleus, to make him an orator in <lb/>
            words, and a hero in deeds. But as men accustomed to <lb/>
            constant and daily employment, when they are hindered from <lb/>
            their occupation by the weather, betake themselves to play at <pb n="348"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            ball, or dice, or draughts, or even invent some new game of <lb/>
            their own to amuse their leisure; so they, being either <lb/>
            excluded from public employments, as from business, by the <lb/>
            state of the times, or being idle from inclination, gave them- <lb/>
            selves up wholly, some to the poets, some to the geometers, <lb/>
            some to music; ethers even, as the logicians, found out a new <lb/>
            study and exercise for themselves, and consumed their whole <lb/>
            time and lives in those arts which have -been discovered <lb/>
            to form the minds of youth to learning and to virtue.</p>
          <p>XVI. " But, because there were some, and those not a few, <lb/>
            who either were eminent in public affairs, through their two- <lb/>
            fold excellence in acting and speaking, excellences which are <lb/>
            indeed inseparable, as Themistocles, Pericles, Theramenes; or <lb/>
            who, though they were not employed themselves in public <lb/>
            affairs, were teachers of others in that science, as Gorgias, <lb/>
            Thrasymachus, Isocrates; there appeared others who, being <lb/>
            themselves men of abundant learning and ingenuity, but averse <lb/>
            to political business and employments, derided and despised <lb/>
            the exercise of oratory; at the head of which, party was <lb/>
            Socrates. He, who, by the testimony of all the learned, and <lb/>
            the judgment of all Greece, was the first of all men as well <lb/>
            in wisdom and penetration, grace and refinement, as in elo- <lb/>
            quence, variety, and copiousness of language on whatever <lb/>
            subject he took in hand, deprived of their common name <lb/>
            those who handled, treated, and gave instruction in those <lb/>
            matters which are the objects of our present inquiry, when <lb/>
            they were previously comprised under one appellation; as all <lb/>
            knowledge in the best arts and sciences, and all exercise in <lb/>
            them, was denominated philosophy; and he separated in his <lb/>
            discussions the ability of thinking wisely, and speaking grace- <lb/>
            fully, though they are naturally united; Socrates, I say, <lb/>
            whose great genius and varied conversation Plato has in his <lb/>
            Dialogues consigned to immortality, he himself having left <lb/>
            us nothing in writing. Hence arose that divorce as it <lb/>
            were of the tongue from the heart, a division certainly <lb/>
            , absurd, useless, and reprehensible, that one class of persons <lb/>
            should teach us to think, and another to speak, rightly: for, <lb/>
            as many reasoners had their origin almost from Socrates, <lb/>
            and as they caught up some one thing, some another, from <lb/>
            his disputations, which were various, diversified, and diffusive <lb/>
            upon all subjects, many sects as it were became propagated, <pb n="349"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            dissenting one from another, and much divided and very dis- <lb/>
            similar in opinions, though all the philosophers wished to be <lb/>
            called, and thought that they were, Socratics.</p>
          <p>XVII. " First from Plato himself came Aristotle and <lb/>
            Xenocrates; the one of whom founded the Peripatetic sect, <lb/>
            the other the Academy; and from Antisthenes, who was <lb/>
            chiefly delighted with the patience and endurance recom- <lb/>
            mended in the discourses of Socrates, sprung first the Cynics, <lb/>
            afterwards the Stoics. Next, from Aristippus, for whom the <lb/>
            dissertations on pleasure had greater charms, emanated the <lb/>
            Cyrenaic philosophy, which he'and his followers maintained <lb/>
            in its simplicity; those who in our days measure all things <lb/>
            by the standard of pleasure, while they act more modestly in <lb/>
            this particular, neither satisfy that dignity which they are <lb/>
            far from rejecting, nor adhere to that pleasure which they <lb/>
            are inclined to embrace. There were also other sects of phi- <lb/>
            losophers, who almost all in general called themselves the <lb/>
            followers of Socrates; as those of the Eretrians, Herillians, <lb/>
            Megarians, and Pyrrhonians; but these have long since been <lb/>
            overthrown and extinguished by the superior arguments of <lb/>
            the others. Of those which remain, that philosophy which <lb/>
            has undertaken the patronage of pleasure, however true it <lb/>
            may appear to some, is very unsuitable for that personage of <lb/>
            whom we are forming a conception, and whom we would have <lb/>
            to be of authority in public councils, a leader in the admi- <lb/>
            nistration of government, a consummate master of thought <lb/>
            and eloquence, as well in the senate, as in popular assemblies, <lb/>
            and in public causes. Yet no injury shall be done to that phi- <lb/>
            losophy by us; for it shall not be repelled from the mark at <lb/>
            which it wishes to aim, but shall repose quietly in its gardens, <lb/>
            where it wishes, and where, reclining softly and delicately, it <lb/>
            calls us away from the rostra, from the courts of justice, and <lb/>
            from the senate, and perhaps wisely, especially in such times of <lb/>
            the republic as these. But my present inquiry is not which <lb/>
            philosophy is the nearest to truth, but which is the best <lb/>
            suited to the orator. Let us therefore dismiss those of this <lb/>
            sect without any contumely; for'they are well-meaning, <lb/>
            and, as they seem so to themselves, happy; let us only <lb/>
            admonish them to keep that maxim of theirs, though it be <lb/>
            eminently true, secret however as a mystery, I mean their <lb/>
            denial that it is the part of a wise man to concern himself <pb n="350"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            with public affairs; for if they should convince us, and every <lb/>
            man of eminent ability, of the truth of that maxim, they will <lb/>
            be unable to remain, as they especially desire, in tranquillity.</p>
          <p>XVIII. "The Stoics, too, whom I by no means disapprove, <lb/>
            I notwithstanding dismiss; nor am I afraid that they will be <lb/>
            angry, as they are proof against anger; and I feel grateful <lb/>
            to them on this account, that they alone, of all the philoso- <lb/>
            phers, have declared eloquence to be virtue and wisdom. <lb/>
            But there are two peculiarities in their doctrine, which are <lb/>
            quite unsuitable to that orator whom we are forming; one, <lb/>
            that they pronounce all who are not wise, to be slaves, <lb/>
            robbers, enemies, and madmen, and yet do not admit that <lb/>
            any person is wise; (but it would be very absurd to trust the <lb/>
            interests of an assembly of the people, or of the senate, or <lb/>
            any other body of men, to one to whom none of those present <lb/>
            would appear to be iu their senses, none to be citizens, none <lb/>
            to be freemen;) the other, that they have a manner of <lb/>
            speaking which is perhaps subtle, and certainly acute, but <lb/>
            for an orator, dry, strange, unsuited to the ear of the popu- <lb/>
            lace, obscure, barren, jejune, and altogether of that species <lb/>
            which a speaker cannot use to a multitude. Other citizens, <lb/>
            or rather all other people, have very different notions of good <lb/>
            and evil from the Stoics; their estimation of honour and <lb/>
            ignominy, rewards and punishments, is entirely different; <lb/>
            whether justly or otherwise, is nothing to the present occa- <lb/>
            sion ; but if we should adopt their notions, we should never <lb/>
            be able to expedite any business by speaking. The remaining <lb/>
            sects are the Peripatetic and the Academic; though of the <lb/>
            Academics, notwithstanding there is but one name, there are <lb/>
            two distinct systems of opinion; for Speusippus, Plato's <lb/>
            sister's son, and Xenocrates, who had been a hearer of Plato, <lb/>
            and Polemo, who had been a hearer of Xenocrates, and <lb/>
            Crantor, differed in no great degree from Aristotle, who had <lb/>
            also been a hearer of Plato; in copiousness and variety of <lb/>
            diction, however, they were perhaps unequal to him. Arce- <lb/>
            silas, who had been a hearer of Polemo, was the first who <lb/>
            eagerly embraced the doctrine drawn from the various <lb/>
            writings of Plato and the discourses of Socrates, that ' there <lb/>
            is nothing certain to be known, either by the senses or the <lb/>
            understanding;' he is reported to have adopted an eminently <lb/>
            graceful manner of speaking, to have rejected all judgment <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            of the mind and the senses, and to have established first the <lb/>
            practice (though it was indeed greatly adopted by Socrates) <lb/>
            of not declaring what he himself thought, but of disputing <lb/>
            against whatever any other person said that he thought. <lb/>
            Hence the New Academy derived its origin, in which Car- <lb/>
            neades distinguished himself by a quickness of wit, that was <lb/>
            in a manner divine, and a peculiar force of eloquence. I <lb/>
            knew many at Athens who had been hearers of this philo- <lb/>
            sopher, but I can refer for his character to two persons of <lb/>
            undoubted authority, my father-in-law Scævola, who heard <lb/>
            him when a youth at Rome, and Quiutus Metellus, the son <lb/>
            of Lucius, my intimate friend, a man of high dignity, who <lb/>
            informed me that in the early part of his life at Athens, he <lb/>
            attended for many days the lectures of this celebrated phi- <lb/>
            losopher, then almost broken with age.1</p>
          <p>XIX. " But the streams of learning have flowed from the <lb/>
            common summit of science,2 like rivers from the Apennines, <lb/>
            in different directions, so that the philosophers have passed, <lb/>
            as it were, into the Upper or Ionian sea, a Greek sea, abound- <lb/>
            ing with harbours, but the orators have fallen into the Lower <lb/>
            or Tuscan, a barbarian sea, infested with rocks and dangers, <lb/>
            in which even Ulysses himself had mistaken his course. If, <lb/>
            therefore, we are content with such a degree of eloquence, <lb/>
            and such an orator as has the common discretion to know <lb/>
            that you ought either to deny the charge which is brought <lb/>
            against you, or, if you cannot do that, to show that what he <lb/>
            who is accused has committed, was either done justifiably, or <lb/>
            through the fault or wrong of some other person, or that it <lb/>
            is agreeable to law, or at least not contrary to any law, or <lb/>
            that it was done without design, or from necessity; or that <lb/>
            it does not merit the term given it in the accusation; or that <lb/>
            the pleading is not conducted as it ought to have been or <lb/>
            might have been; and if you think it sufficient to have <lb/>
            learned the rules which the writers on rhetoric have delivered, <lb/>
            which however Antonius has set forth with much more grace <lb/>
            and fulness than they are treated by them; if, I say, you are <note type="footnote"> 1 Qui illwn a se adolescente Athenis jam affectum senectute multos dies <lb/>
            auditum esse dicebat. " Who said that he had been heard by him when <lb/>
            a young man for many days at Athens (where he was) now affected <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            content with these qualifications, and those which you wished <lb/>
            to be specified by me, you reduce the orator from a spacious <lb/>
            and immense field of action into a very narrow compass: <lb/>
            but if you are desirous to emulate Pericles, or Demo- <lb/>
            sthenes, who is more familiar to us from his numerous <lb/>
            writings; and if you are captivated with this noble and <lb/>
            illustrious idea and excellence of a perfect orator, you must <lb/>
            include in your minds all the powers of Carneades, or those <lb/>
            of Aristotle. For, as I observed before, the ancients, till the <lb/>
            time of Socrates, united all knowledge and science in all <lb/>
            things, whether they appertained to morality, to the duties <lb/>
            of life, to virtue, or to civil government, with the faculty of <lb/>
            speaking; but afterwards, the eloquent being separated by <lb/>
            Socrates from the learned, (as I have already explained,) and <lb/>
            this distinction being continued by all the followers of <lb/>
            Socrates, the philosophers disregarded eloquence, and the <lb/>
            orators philosophy; nor did they at all encroach upon each <lb/>
            other's provinces, except that the orators borrowed from the <lb/>
            philosophers, and :the philosophers from the orators, such <lb/>
            things as they would have taken from the common stock if <lb/>
            they had been inclined to remain in their pristine union. <lb/>
            But as the old pontiffs, on account of the multitude of reli- <lb/>
            gious ceremonies, appointed three officers called Epulones, <lb/>
            though they themselves were instituted by Numa to perform <lb/>
            the epulare sacrificium at the games; so the followers of <lb/>
            Socrates excluded the pleaders of causes from their own <lb/>
            body, and from the common title of philosophers, though <lb/>
            the ancients were of opinion that there was a .miraculous <lb/>
            harmony between speaking and understanding.</p>
          <p>-XX. " Such being the case, I shall crave some little indul- <lb/>
            gence for'myself and beg you to consider that whatever <lb/>
            I say, I say not of myself, but of the complete orator. For I <lb/>
            am a person, who, having been educated in my boyhood, with <lb/>
            great care on the part of my father, and having brought into <lb/>
            the forum such a portion of talent as I am conscious of possess- <lb/>
            ing, and not so much as I may perhaps appear to you to have, <lb/>
            cannot aver that I learned what I now comprehend, exactly <lb/>
            as I shall say that it ought to be learned; since I engaged in' <lb/>
            public business most early of all men, and at one-and-twenty <lb/>
            years of age brought to trial a man of the highest rank, and <note type="footnote"> 1 See Liv. xxxiii. 42. </note> <pb n="353"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            the greatest eloquence;1 and the forum has been my school <lb/>
            and practice, with the laws and institutions of the Roman <lb/>
            people, and the customs of our ancestors, my instructors. I <lb/>
            got a small taste of those sciences of which I am speaking, <lb/>
            feeling some thirst for them, while I was quæstor in Asia; <lb/>
            having procured a rhetorician about my own age from the <lb/>
            Academy, that Metrodorus, of whose memory Antonius has <lb/>
            made honourable mention; and, on my departure from Asia, <lb/>
            at Athens, where I should have stayed longer, had I not been <lb/>
            displeased with the Athenians, who would not repeat their <lb/>
            mysteries, for which I came two days too late. The fact, <lb/>
            therefore, that I comprise within my scheme so much science, <lb/>
            and attribute so much influence to learning, makes not only <lb/>
            not in my favour, but rather against me, (for I am not con- <lb/>
            sidering what I, but what a perfect orator can do,) and against <lb/>
            all those who put forth treatises on the art of rhetoric, and <lb/>
            who are indeed obnoxious to extreme ridicule; for they write <lb/>
            merely about the several kinds of suits, about exordia, and <lb/>
            statements of facts; but the real power of eloquence is such, <lb/>
            that it embraces the origin, the influence, the changes of <lb/>
            all things in the world, all virtues, duties, and all nature, so <lb/>
            far as it affects the manners, minds, and lives of mankind. <lb/>
            It can give an account of customs, laws, and rights, can <lb/>
            govern a state, and speak on everything relating to any sub- <lb/>
            ject whatsoever with elegance and force. In this pursuit I <lb/>
            employ ray talents as well as I can, as far as I am enabled by <lb/>
            natural capacity, moderate learning, and constant practice; <lb/>
            nor do I conceive myself much inferior in disputation to <lb/>
            those who have as it were pitched their tent for life in phi- <lb/>
            losophy alone.</p>
          <p>XXI. " For what can my friend Caius Velleins2 allege, to <lb/>
            show why pleasure is the chief good, which I cannot either <lb/>
            maintain more fully, if I were so inclined, or refute, with the <lb/>
            aid of those common-places which Antonius has set forth, and <lb/>
            that habit of speaking in which Velleius himself is unexercised, <lb/>
            but every one of us experienced ? What is there that either <lb/>
            Sextus Pompeius, or the two Balbi,3 or my acquaintance <note type="footnote"> ' Carbo. See note on i. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The same that speaks, in the dialogue De Naturâ Deorum, on the <lb/>

            Marcus Vigellius, who lived with Panætius, all lien of the <lb/>
            Stoic sect, can maintain concerning virtue, in such a manner <lb/>
            that either I, or any one of you, should give place to them in <lb/>
            debate? For philosophy is not like other arts or sciences; <lb/>
            since what can he do in geometry, or in music, who has never <lb/>
            learned? He must be silent, or be thought a madman; but <lb/>
            the principles of philosophy are discovered by such minds as <lb/>
            have acuteness and penetration enough to extract what is <lb/>
            most probable concerning any subject, and are elegantly <lb/>
            expressed with the aid of exercise in speaking. On such <lb/>
            topics, a speaker of ordinary abilities, if he has no great <lb/>
            learning, but has had practice in declaiming, will, by virtue <lb/>
            of such practice, common to others as well as to him, beat <lb/>
            our friends the philosophers, and not suffer himself to be <lb/>
            despised and held in contempt; but if ever a person shall <lb/>
            arise who shall have abilities to deliver opinions on both <lb/>
            sides of a question on all subjects, after the manner of <lb/>
            Aristotle, and, from a knowledge of the precepts of that phi- <lb/>
            losopher, to deliver two contradictory orations on every con- <lb/>
            ceivable topic, or shall be able, after the manner of Arcesilas <lb/>
            or Carneades, to dispute against every proposition that can <lb/>

            skill, and practice and exercise in speaking, be will be the true, <lb/>
            the perfect, the only orator. For neither without the nervous <lb/>
            eloquence of the forum, can an orator have sufficient weight, <lb/>
            dignity, and force; nor, without variety of learning, sufficient <lb/>
            elegance and judgment. Let us suffer that old Corax of yours,1 <lb/>
            therefore, to hatch his young birds in the nest, that they <lb/>
            may fly out disagreeable and troublesome bawlers; and let us <lb/>
            allow Pamphilus, whoever he was,2 to depict a science of such <note type="footnote"> of the Stoics. The other, says Ellendt, is supposed to be the lawyer <lb/>
            who is mentioned by Cicero, Brut. c. 42, and who was the master of <lb/>
            Serous Sulpicius. Of Vigellius nothing is known. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See i. 20. He jokes on the name of Corax, which signifies a crow. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pamphilum nescio quem. Some suppose him to be the painter that <lb/>
            is mentioned as the instructor of Apelles by Pliny, H. N. xxxv. 36. 8. <lb/>
            He seems, whoever he was, to have given some fanciful map-like view <lb/>
            of the rules of rhetoric. But it is not intimated by Pliny that the <lb/>
            Pamphilus of whom he speaks was, though a learned painter, anything <lb/>
            more than a painter. A Pamphilus is mentioned by Quintilian, iii. 6. <lb/>
            34; xii. 10. 6; and by Aristotle, Rhet. iL 23. By infulce in the text, <lb/>
            which I have rendered " flags," Ellendt supposes that something similar <lb/>
            to our printed cotton handkerchiefs, or flags hung out at booths at </note> <pb n="355"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            consequence upon flags, as if for an amusement for children; <lb/>
            while we ourselves describe the whole business of an orator, <lb/>
            in so short a disputation as that of yesterday and to- <lb/>
            day; admitting, however, that it is of such extent as to be <lb/>
            spread through all the books of the philosophers, into which <lb/>
            none of those rhetoricians1 has ever dipped."</p>
          <p>XXII. Catulus then said, " It is, indeed, by no means <lb/>
            astonishing, Crassus, that there should appear in you either <lb/>
            such energy, or such agreeableness, or such copiousness of lan- <lb/>
            guage; though I previously supposed that it was merely from <lb/>
            the force of natural genius that you spoke in such a way as <lb/>
            to seem to me not only the greatest of orators, but the <lb/>
            wisest of men; but I now understand that you have always <lb/>
            given precedence to matters relating to philosophy, and your <lb/>
            copious stream of eloquence has flowed from that source; and <lb/>
            yet, when I recollect the different stages of your life, and <lb/>
            when I consider your manner of living and pursuits, I can <lb/>
            neither conceive at what time you acquired that learning, nor <lb/>
            can I imagine you to be strongly addicted to those studies, <lb/>
            or men, or writings; nor can I determine at which of these <lb/>
            two things I ought most to feel surprised, that you could <lb/>
            obtain a thorough knowledge of those matters which you <lb/>
            persuade me are of the utmost assistance to oratory, amid <lb/>
            such important occupations as yours, or that, if you could <lb/>
            not do so, you can speak with such effect." Here Crassus <lb/>
            rejoined, " I would have you first of all, Catulus, persuade <lb/>
            yourself of this, that, when I speak of an orator, I speak not <lb/>
            much otherwise than I should do if I had to speak of an <lb/>
            actor; for I should say that he could not possibly give satis- <lb/>
            faction in his gesture unless he had learned the exercises of <lb/>
            the palæstra, and dancing; nor would it be necessary that, <lb/>
            when I said this, I should be myself a player, though it per- <lb/>
            haps would be necessary that I should be a not unskilful <lb/>
            critic in another man's profession. In like manner I am now, <lb/>
            at your request, speaking of the orator, that is, the perfect <lb/>
            orator; for, about whatever art or faculty inquiry is made, it <lb/>
            always relates to it in its state of absolute perfection; and if, <note type="footnote"> fairs, is meant. Talæus thinks that the tables of rules might have <lb/>
            been called infulœ in ridicule, from their shape. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Such " disagreeable and troublesome bawlers," as those from the <lb/>
            nest of Corax just mentioned. Ernesti. </note> <note type="footnote"> A, A 2 </note> <pb n="356"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            therefore, you now allow me to be a speaker, :f even a pretty <lb/>
            good one, or a positively good one, I will not contradict you; <lb/>
            (for why should I, at my time of life, be so foolish ? I know <lb/>
            that I am esteemed such;) but, if it be so, I am certainly not <lb/>
            perfect. For there is not among mankind any pursuit of <lb/>
            greater difficulty or effort, or that requires more aids from <lb/>
            learning ; but, since I have to speak of the orator, I must <lb/>
            of necessity speak of the perfect orator; for unless the <lb/>
            powers and nature of a thing be set before the eyes in their <lb/>
            utmost perfection, its character and magnitude cannot be <lb/>
            understood. Yet I confess, Catulus, that I do not at present <lb/>
            live in any great familiarity with the writings or the pro- <lb/>
            fessors of philosophy, and that, as you have rightly observed, <lb/>
            I never had much leisure to set apart for the acquisition <lb/>
            of such learning, and that I have only given to study such <lb/>
            portions of time as my leisure when I was a youth, and vaca- <lb/>
            tions from the business of the forum, have allowed me.</p>
          <p>XXIII. " But if, Catulus, you inquire my sentiments on <lb/>
            that learning, I am of opinion that so much time need not be <lb/>
            spent on it by a man of ability, and one who studies with a <lb/>
            view to the forum, to the senate, to causes, to civil administra- <lb/>
            tion, as those have chosen to give to it whom life has failed <lb/>
            while they were learning. For all arts are handled in one <lb/>
            manner by those who apply them to practice; in another by <lb/>
            those who, taking delight in treating of the arts themselves, <lb/>
            never intend to do anything else during the whole course of <lb/>
            their lives. The master of the gladiators1 is now in the ex- <lb/>
            tremity of age, yet daily meditates upon the improvement of <lb/>
            his science, for he has no other care; but Quintus Velocius2 <lb/>
            had learned that exercise in his youth, and, as he was na- <lb/>
            turally formed for it, and had thoroughly acquired it, he was, <lb/>
            as it is said in Lucilius, <lb/>
            Though as a gladiator in the school <lb/>
            Well skill'd, and bold enough to match with any, <lb/>
            yet resolved to devote more attention to the duties of the forum, <lb/>
            and of friendship, and to his domestic concerns. Valerius3 <lb/>
            sung every day; for he was on the stage; what else was he <note type="footnote"> 1 See note on ii. 80. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This name was introduced on the conjecture of Victorius. Pre- <lb/>
            riously the passage was unintelligible. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Of Valerius and Furius nothing is known. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="357"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            to do? But our friend Numerius Furius sings only when it <lb/>
            is agreeable to him; for he is the head of a family, and of <lb/>
            equestrian dignity; he learned when a boy as much as it was <lb/>
            necessary for him to learn. The case is similar with regard <lb/>
            to sciences of the greatest importance; we have seen Quintus <lb/>
            Tubero,l a mail of eminent virtue and prudence, engaged in <lb/>
            the study of philosophy night and day, but his uncle Africa- <lb/>
            nus 2 you could scarcely ever perceive paying any attention <lb/>
            to it, though he paid a great deal. Such knowledge is easily <lb/>
            gained, if you only get as much of it as is necessary, and <lb/>
            have a faithful and able instructor, and know how to learn <lb/>
            yourself. But if you are inclined to do nothing else all your <lb/>
            life, your very studies and inquiries daily give rise to some- <lb/>
            thing for you to investigate as an amusement at your leisure; <lb/>
            thus it happens, that the investigation of particular points is <lb/>
            endless, though general knowledge is easy, if practice establish <lb/>
            learning once acquired, moderate exercise be devoted to it, <lb/>
            and memory and inclination continue. But it is pleasant to <lb/>
            be constantly learning, if we wish to be thoroughly masters <lb/>
            of anything; as if I, for instance, had a desire to play excel- <lb/>
            lently at backgammon, or had a strong attachment to tennis, <lb/>
            though perhaps I should not attain perfection in those games; <lb/>
            but others, because they excel in any performance, take a <lb/>
            more vehement delight in it than the object requires, as <lb/>
            Titius 3 in tennis, Brulla in backgammon. There is no reason, <lb/>
            therefore, why any one should dread the extent of the sciences <lb/>
            because he perceives old men still learning them; for either <lb/>
            they were old men when they first applied to them, or have <lb/>
            been detained in the study of them till they became old; or <lb/>
            are of more than ordinary stupidity. And the truth in my <lb/>
            opinion is, that a man can never learn thoroughly that which <lb/>
            he has not been able to learn quickly."</p>
          <p>XXIV. " Now, now," exclaimed Catulus, " I understand, <lb/>
            Crassus, what you say, and readily assent to it; I see that there <lb/>
            has been time enough for you, a man of vigour and ability to <lb/>
            learn, to acquire a knowledge of what you mention." " Do you <lb/>
            still persist," rejoined Crassus, " to think that I say what I say <lb/>
            of myself; and not of my subject ? But, if it be agreeable to <note type="footnote"> ' Cic. Tusc. Quæst. iv. 2; Fin. iv. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> a See ii. 37. </note><note type="footnote"> a Titius is mentioned ii. 62. Of Brulla nothing is known. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="358"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            you, let its now return to our stated business." " To me," <lb/>
            said Catulus, " it is very agreeable."</p>
          <p>" To what end, then," continued Crassus, " does this dis- <lb/>
            course, drawn out to so great a length, and brought from <lb/>
            such deep sources, tend ? The two parts which remain for <lb/>
            me, that of adorning language, and contemplating eloquence <lb/>
            in general in its highest perfection,-one of which requires <lb/>
            that we should speak gracefully, the other aptly,-have this <lb/>
            influence, that eloquence is rendered by their means pro- <lb/>
            ductive of the utmost delight, made to penetrate effectually <lb/>
            into the inmost hearts of the audience, and furnished with <lb/>
            all possible variety of matter. But the speech which we use <lb/>
            in the forum, adapted for contest, full of acrimony, formed <lb/>
            to suit the taste of the vulgar, is poor indeed and beggarly; <lb/>
            and, on the other hand, even that which they teach who pro- <lb/>
            fess themselves masters of the art of speaking, is not of much <lb/>
            more dignity than the common style of the forum. We have <lb/>
            need of greater pomp,1 of choice matter collected, imported, <lb/>
            and brought together from all parts; such a provision as <lb/>
            must be made by you, Cæsar, for the next year,2 with such <lb/>
            pains as I took in my ædileship, because I did not suppose <lb/>
            that I could satisfy such a people as ours with ordinary mat- <lb/>
            ters, or those of their own country.</p>
          <p>" As for choosing and arranging words, and forming them <lb/>
            into proper periods, the art is easy, or, I may say, the mere <lb/>
            practice without any art at all. Of matter, the quantity and <lb/>
            variety are infinite; and as the Greeks3 were not properly <lb/>
            furnished with it, and our youth in consequence almost <lb/>
            grew ignorant while they were learning, even Latin teachers <lb/>
            of rhetoric, please the gods, have arisen within the last two <lb/>
            years; a class of persons whom I had suppressed by my <lb/>
            edict,4 when I was censor, not because I was unwilling (as <note type="footnote"> 1 Apparatu. In allusion, says Petavius, to the shows given by the <lb/>

            ancient severity, is preserved in Aul. Gell. xv. 11; and Suetonius, Do <lb/>
            Clar. Rhet. procem. Crassus intimates that that class of men sprung up <lb/>
            again after his edict; for the censors had not such power that their <lb/>
            mere prohibitions could continue in force after their term of office was <lb/>
            expired. Ellendt. </note> <pb n="359"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXV.] </note> <lb/>
            some, I know not who, asserted,) that the abilities of cur <lb/>
            youth should be improved, but because I did not wish that <lb/>
            their understandings should be weakened and their impudence <lb/>
            strengthened. For among the Greeks, whatever was their <lb/>
            character, I perceived that there was, besides exercise of the <lb/>
            tongue, some degree of learning, as well as politeness suited <lb/>
            to liberal knowledge; but I knew that these new masters <lb/>
            could teach youth nothing but effrontery, which, even when <lb/>
            joined with good qualities, is to be avoided, and, in itself, <lb/>
            especially so; and as this, therefore, was the only thing that <lb/>
            was taught by the Latins, their school being indeed a school <lb/>
            of impudence, I thought it became the censor to take care <lb/>
            that the evil should not spread further. I do not, however, <lb/>
            determine and decree on the point, as if I despaired that the <lb/>
            subjects which we are discussing can be delivered, and treated <lb/>
            with elegance, in Latin; for both our language and the nature <lb/>
            of things allows the ancient and excellent science of Greece to <lb/>
            be adapted to our customs and manners; but for such a work <lb/>
            are required men of learning, such as none of our country- <lb/>
            men have been in this department; but if ever such arise, <lb/>
            they will be preferable to the Greeks themselves.</p>
          <p>XXV. "A speech, then, is to be made becoming in its <lb/>
            kind, with a sort of complexion and substance of its own; for <lb/>
            that it be weighty, agreeable, savouring of erudition and <lb/>
            liberal knowledge, worthy of admiration, polished, having <lb/>
            feeling and passion in it, as far as is required, are qualities <lb/>
            not confined to particular members, but are apparent in the <lb/>
            whole body; but that it be, as it were, strewed with flowers <lb/>
            of language and thought, is a property which ought not to be <lb/>
            equally diffused throughout the whole speech, but at such <lb/>
            intervals, that, as in the arrangement of ornaments,1 there <lb/>
            may be certain remarkable and luminous objects disposed <lb/>
            here and there. Such a kind of eloquence, therefore, is to be <lb/>
            chosen, as is most adapted to interest the audience, such as <lb/>
            may not only delight, but delight without satiety; (for I do <lb/>
            not imagine it to be expected of me, that I should admonish <lb/>
            you to beware that your language be not poor, or rude, or <lb/>
            vulgar, or obsolete; both your age and your geniuses en- <lb/>
            courage me to something of a higher nature;) for it is difficult <note type="footnote"> 1 In ornatu. The arrangement of such ornaments as were displayed <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            to tell what the cause is why, from those objects which <lb/>
            most strongly strike our senses with pleasure, and occasion <lb/>
            the most violent emotions at their first appearance, we should <lb/>
            soonest turn away with a certain loathing and satiety. How <lb/>
            much more florid, in the gaiety and variety of the colouring, <lb/>
            are most objects in modern pictures than in ancient ones; <lb/>
            which, however, though they captivate us at first sight, do <lb/>
            not afford any lasting pleasure; whereas we are strongly <lb/>
            attracted by rough and faded colouring in the paintings of <lb/>
            antiquity. How much softer and more delicate are fanciful1 <lb/>
            modulations and notes in music, than those which are strict <lb/>
            and grave; and yet if the former are often repeated, not only <lb/>
            persons of an austere character, but even the multitude, raise <lb/>
            an outcry against them. We may perceive, too, in regard to <lb/>
            the other senses, that we take a less permanent delight in <lb/>
            perfumes composed of the sweetest and most powerful odours, <lb/>
            than in those of a more moderate scent; that that is more <lb/>
            commended which appears to smell like wax, than that which <lb/>
            is as strong as saffron; and that, in the sense of feeling itself, <lb/>
            there is a limit required both to softness and smoothness. <lb/>
            How soon does even the taste, which of all our senses is the <lb/>
            most desirous of gratification, and is delighted with sweetness <lb/>
            beyond the others, nauseate and reject that which is too <lb/>
            luscious! Who can take sweet drinks and meats long <lb/>
            together ? while, in both kinds of nutriment, such things as <lb/>
            affect the sense with but a slight pleasure are the furthest <lb/>
            removed from that satiating quality; and so, in all ether <lb/>
            things, loathing still borders upon the most exquisite delights; <lb/>
            and therefore we should the less wonder at this effect in lan- <lb/>
            guage, in which we may form a judgment, either from the <lb/>
            poets or the orators, that a style elegant, ornate, embellished, <lb/>
            and sparkling, without intermission, without restraint, with- <lb/>
            out variety, whether it be prose or poetry, though painted <lb/>
            with the brightest colours, cannot possibly give lasting <lb/>
            pleasure. And we the sooner take offence at the false locks <lb/>
            and paint of the orator or poet, for this cause, that the senses, <lb/>
            when affected with too much pleasure, are satiated, not from <lb/>
            reason, but constitutionally; in writings and in speeches <lb/>
            these disguised blemishes are even more readily noticed, not <note type="footnote"> I Falsœ. Fractæ et molliores. Ernesti. </note> <pb n="361"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            only from the judgment of the ear, but from that of the <lb/>
            understanding.</p>
          <p>XXVI. “ Though such expressions of applause, therefore, as <lb/>
            ‘ very well,' ‘ excellent,' may be often repeated to me, I would <lb/>
            not have ' beautifully,' ‘ pleasantly,' come too often; yet 1 <lb/>
            would have the exclamation Nothing can be better, very <lb/>
            frequent. But this high excellence and merit in speaking <lb/>
            should be attended with some portions of shade and obscurity, <lb/>
            that the part on which a stronger light is thrown may seem <lb/>
            to stand out, and become more prominent. Roscius never <lb/>
            delivers this passage with all the spirit that he can, <lb/>
            The wise man seeks for honour, not for spoil, <lb/>
            As the reward of virtue; <lb/>
            but rather in an abject manner, that into the next speech, <lb/>
            What do I see ? the steel-girt soldier holds <lb/>
            The sacred seats, <lb/>
            he may throw his whole powers, may gaze, may express wonder <lb/>
            and astonishment. How does the other great actor1 utter <lb/>
            What aid shall I solicit ?</p>
          <p>How gently, how sedately, how calmly ! For he proceeds <lb/>
            with <lb/>
            0 father ! 0 my country ! House of Priam ! <lb/>
            in which so much action could not be exerted if it had been <lb/>
            consumed and exhausted by any preceding emotion. Nor <lb/>
            did the actors discover this before the poets themselves, or, <lb/>
            indeed, before even those who composed the music, by both of <lb/>
            whom their tone is sometimes lowered, sometimes heightened, <lb/>
            sometimes made slender, sometimes full, with variation and <lb/>
            distinction. Let our orator, then, be thus graceful and de- <lb/>
            lightful (nor can he indeed be so otherwise) ; let him have a <lb/>
            severe and solid grace, not a luscious and delicious sweetness; <lb/>
            for the precepts relative to the ornament of eloquence, which <lb/>
            are commonly given, are of such a nature that even the worst <lb/>
            speaker can observe them. It is first of all necessary, there- <lb/>
            fore, as I said before, that a stock of matter and thoughts bo <lb/>
            got together; a point on which Antonius has already spoken; <lb/>
            these are to be interwoven into the very thread and essence <lb/>
            of the oration, embellished by words, and diversified by <lb/>
            illustrations. <note type="footnote"> 1 AEsopus, as I suppose. Ellendt; who observes that the verses art <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">[B. III. </note> "But the greatest glory of eloquence is to exaggerate a <lb/>
            subject by embellishment; which has effect not only in am- <lb/>
            plifying and extolling anything in a speech to an extra- <lb/>
            ordinary degree, but also in extenuating it, and making it <lb/>
            appear contemptible. XXVII. This is required on all those <lb/>
            points which Antonius said must be observed in order to <lb/>
            gain credit to our statements, when we explain anything, or <lb/>
            when we conciliate the feelings, or when we excite the pas- <lb/>
            sions of our audience; but in the particular which I men- <lb/>
            tioned last, amplification is of the greatest effect; and excel- <lb/>
            lence in it the peculiar and appropriate praise of the orator. <lb/>
            Even that exercise is of more than ordinary importance <lb/>
            which Antonius illustrated1 in the latter part of his disser- <lb/>
            tation, (in the beginning2 he set it aside,) I mean that of <lb/>
            panegyric and satire; for nothing is a better preparative for <lb/>
            exaggeration and amplification in a speech than the talent of <lb/>
            performing both these parts in a most effective manner. <lb/>
            Consequently, even those topics are of use which, though <lb/>
            they ought to be proper to causes, and to be inherent in <lb/>
            their very vitals, yet, as they are commonly applied to ge- <lb/>
            neral subjects, have been by the ancients denominated com- <lb/>
            mon places; of which some consist in bitter accusations and <lb/>
            complaints against vices and crimes, with a certain amplifica- <lb/>
            tion, (in opposition to which nothing is usually said, or can <lb/>
            be said,) as against an embezzler of the public money, or <lb/>
            a traitor, or a parricide; remarks which we ought to intro- <lb/>
            duce when the charges have been proved, for otherwise they <lb/>
            are jejune and trifling; others consist in entreaty or com- <lb/>
            miseration; others relate to contested points of argument, <lb/>
            whence you may be enabled to speak fully on either side of <lb/>
            any general question, an exercise which is now imagined to <lb/>
            be peculiar to those two sects of philosophy3 of which I spoke <lb/>
            before; among those of remote antiquity it belonged to those <lb/>
            from whom all the art and power of speaking in forensic <lb/>
            pleadings was derived;4 for concerning virtue, duty, justice <lb/>
            and equity, dignity, utility, honour, ignominy, rewards and <lb/>
            punishments, and similar subjects, we ought to possess the <lb/>
            spirit, and talent, and address, to speak on either side of the <note type="footnote"> 1 B. ii. c. 84. </note><note type="footnote">2 B. it 3. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Academic and Peripatetic; ace iii.

            question. But since, being driven from our own possessions, <lb/>
            we are left in a poor little farm, and even that the subject of <lb/>
            litigation, and since, though the patrons of others, we have <lb/>
            not been able to preserve and protect our own property, let <lb/>
            us borrow what is requisite for us (which is a notable dis- <lb/>
            grace) from those1 who have made this irruption into our <lb/>
            patrimony.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " Those, then, who take their name from a very <lb/>
            small portion2 of Athens and its neighbourhood, and are <lb/>
            denominated Peripatetic or Academic philosophers, but who <lb/>
            formerly, on account of their eminent knowledge in important <lb/>
            affairs, were by the Greeks called political philosophers, being <lb/>
            distinguished by a name relating to all public administration, <lb/>
            say that every speech on civil affairs is employed on one or <lb/>
            other of these two kinds of questions, either that of a de- <lb/>
            finite controversy limited to certain times and parties; as, <lb/>
            ' Whether is it proper that our captives be recovered from <lb/>
            the Carthaginians by the restitution of theirs?' or on an <lb/>
            indefinite question, inquiring about a subject generally; as, <lb/>
            'What should be determined or considered concerning captives <lb/>
            in generalI' Of these, they term the former kind a cause or <lb/>
            controversy, and limit it to three things, law-suits, delibera- <lb/>
            tions, and panegyric; but the other kind of question, or pro- <lb/>
            position as it were, the indefinite, is denominated a consulta- <lb/>
            tion.3 So far they instruct us. The rhetoricians, however, <lb/>
            use this division in their instructions, but not so that they <lb/>
            seem to recover a lost possession by right, by a decision in <lb/>
            their favour, or by force, but appear, according to the prac- <lb/>
            tice of the civil law, to assert their claim to the premises by <lb/>
            breaking off a branch;4 for they keep possession of that <lb/>
            former kind which is restricted to certain times, places, and <lb/>
            parties, and that as it were by the hem of the garment;5 for <lb/>

            chief of the Academy, the knowledge and practice of even <lb/>
            these causes is much observed; as to the latter kind, they <lb/>
            only mention it in delivering the first principles of the art, <lb/>
            and say that it belongs to the orator; but neither explain its <lb/>
            powers, nor its nature, nor its parts, nor general heads, so <lb/>
            that it had better have been passed over entirely, than left <lb/>
            when it was once attempted; for they are now understood to <lb/>
            say nothing about it for want of something to say; in the <lb/>
            other case, they would have appeared to be silent from <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>XXIX. " Every subject, then, has the same susceptibleness <lb/>
            of ambiguity, concerning which it may be inquired and dis- <lb/>
            puted ; whether the discussion relate to consultations on inde- <lb/>
            finite points, or to those causes which are concerned with <lb/>
            civil affairs and contests in the forum; nor is there any that <lb/>
            may not be referred either to the nature and principles of <lb/>
            knowledge or of action. For either the knowledge itself and <lb/>
            acquaintance with any affair is the object of inquiry; as, <lb/>
            ' Whether virtue be desirable on account of its own intrinsic <lb/>
            worth, or for the sake of some emolument attending it?' or <lb/>
            counsel with regard to an act is sought; as,' Whether a wise <lb/>
            man ought to concern himself in the administration of go- <lb/>
            vernment?' And of knowledge there are three kinds,-that <lb/>
            which is formed by conjecture, that which admits of certain <lb/>
            definition, and that which is (if I may so term it) conse- <lb/>
            quential. For whether there be anything in any other thing, <lb/>
            is inquired by conjecture; as, ' Whether there is wisdom in <lb/>
            mankind?' But what nature anything has, a definition ex- <lb/>
            plains; as if the inquiry be, 'What is wisdom?' And con- <lb/>
            sequential knowledge is the subject treated of, when the <lb/>
            question is, 'What peculiarity attends on anything?' as, <lb/>
            ‘ Whether it be the part of a good man to tell a falsehood on <lb/>
            any occasion ?' But to conjecture they return again, and divide <lb/>
            it into four kinds; for the question is either, ‘ What a thing <lb/>
            is,' as, 'Whether law among mankind is from nature or from <lb/>
            opinions?' or, 'What the origin of a thing is,' as, ‘ What is <lb/>
            the foundation of civil laws and governments?' or the cause <note type="footnote"> of the chief men of Athens, in the Mithridatic war, when Cicero, then <lb/>

            <note type="margin">C. XXX.] </note> <lb/>
            and reason of it; as if it is asked, ‘ Why do the most learned <lb/>
            men differ upon points of the greatest importance ?' or as to <lb/>
            the possible changes in anything; as if it is disputed, ' Whe- <lb/>
            ther virtue cau die in men, or whether it be convertible into <lb/>
            vice?' With regard to definition, disputes arise, either when <lb/>
            the question is, ' What is impressed, as it were, on the com- <lb/>
            mon understanding ?' as if it be considered, Whether that be <lb/>
            right which is advantageous to the greater number?' or <lb/>
            when it is inquired, ' What is the peculiar property of any <lb/>
            character?' as, ' Whether to speak elegantly be peculiar to <lb/>
            the orator, or whether any one else can do so ?' or when <lb/>
            a thing is distributed into parts; as if the question be, ' How <lb/>
            many kinds of desirable things there are?' and, 'Whether <lb/>
            there be three, those of the body, those of the mind, and <lb/>
            external things ?' or when it is described what is the form or, <lb/>
            as it were, natural characteristic of any person; as if it be <lb/>
            inquired, ' What is the exact representation of an avaricious, <lb/>
            a seditious, or a vain-glorious man?' Of the consequential, <lb/>
            two principal kinds of questions are proposed; for the ques- <lb/>
            tion is either simple, as if it be disputed, ' Whether glory be <lb/>
            desirable ?' or comparative, ' Whether praise or wealth is <lb/>
            more to be coveted?' But of such simple questions there are <lb/>
            three sorts, as to things that are to be desired or avoided; <lb/>
            as, 'Whether honours are desirable?' 'Whether poverty is to <lb/>
            be avoided ?' as to right and wrong; as, 'Whether it be right <lb/>
            to revenge injuries, even those of relations?' as to honour <lb/>
            and ignominy; as, Whether it be honourable to suffer death <lb/>
            for the sake of glory ?' Of the comparative also there are two <lb/>
            sorts: one, when the question is whether things are the same, <lb/>
            or there be any difference betwixt them; as betwixt fear and <lb/>
            reverence, a king and a tyrant, a flatterer and a friend; the <lb/>
            other, when the inquiry is, 'Which of two things is pre- <lb/>
            ferable ?' as, ' Whether wise men are led by the approbation <lb/>
            of the most worthy, or by popular applause ?' Thus are the <lb/>
            controversies which relate to knowledge described, for the <lb/>
            most part, by men of the greatest learning.</p>
          <p>XXX. " But those which relate to action, either concern <lb/>
            controverted points of moral duty, under which head it may <lb/>
            be inquired, 'What is right and to be practised;' of which <lb/>
            head the whole train of virtues and of vices is the subject- <lb/>
            matter ; or refer to the excitement, or alleviation, or removal <pb n="366"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            of some emotion of the mind. Under this head are included <lb/>
            exhortation, reproof, consolation, compassion, and all that <lb/>
            either gives impulse to any emotion of the mind, or, if it so <lb/>
            happen, mitigates it. These kinds, then, and modes of all <lb/>
            questions being explained, it is of no consequence if the <lb/>
            partition of Antonius in any particular disagrees with my <lb/>
            division; for there are the same parts in both our disserta- <lb/>
            tions, though divided and distributed by me a little otherwise <lb/>
            than by him. Now I will proceed to the sequel, and recall <lb/>
            myself to my appointed task and business. For the argu- <lb/>
            ments for every kind of question are to be drawn from <lb/>
            those common places which Antonius enumerated; but some <lb/>
            common places will be more adapted to some kinds than to <lb/>
            others; concerning which there is no necessity for me to <lb/>
            speak, not because it is a matter of any great length, but of <lb/>
            sufficient perspicuity.</p>
          <p>" Those speeches, then, are the most ornate which spread <lb/>
            over the widest field, and, from some private and single <lb/>
            question, apply and direct themselves to show the nature of- <lb/>
            such questions in general, so that the audience, from under- <lb/>
            standing its nature, and kind, and whole bearing, may deter- <lb/>
            mine as to particular individuals, and as to all suits criminal <lb/>
            and civil. Antonius has encouraged you, young men, to per- <lb/>
            severance in this exercise, and intimated that you were to be <lb/>
            conducted by degrees from small and confined questions to <lb/>
            all the power and varieties of argument. Such qualifications <lb/>
            are not to be gained from a few small treatises, as they have <lb/>
            imagined who have written on the art of speaking; nor are <lb/>
            they work merely for a Tusculan villa, or for a morning <lb/>
            walk and afternoon sitting, such as these of ours; for we <lb/>
            have not only to point and fashion the tongue, but have to <lb/>
            store the mind with the sweetness, abundance, and variety of <lb/>
            most important and numerous subjects.</p>
          <p>XXXI. "For ours is the possession (if we are indeed <lb/>
            orators, if we are to be consulted as persons of authority and <lb/>
            leaders in the civil contests and perils of the citizens and in <lb/>
            public councils), ours, I say, is the entire possession of all that <lb/>
            wisdom and learning, upon which, as if it were vacant and <lb/>
            had fallen in to them, men abounding in leisure have seized, <lb/>
            taking advantage of us, and either speak of the orator with <lb/>
            ridicule and sarcasm, as Socrates in the Gorgias, or write <pb n="367"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXII.] </note> <lb/>
            something on the art of oratory in a few little treatises, and <lb/>
            call them books on rhetoric; as if all those things did not <lb/>
            equally concern the orator, which are taught by the same <lb/>
            philosophers on justice, on the duties of life, on the establish- <lb/>
            ment and administration of civil government, and on the <lb/>
            whole systems of moral and even natural philosophy. These <lb/>
            matters, since we cannot get them elsewhere, we must now <lb/>
            borrow from those very persons by whom we have been pil- <lb/>
            laged; so that we apply them to the knowledge of civil <lb/>
            affairs, to which they belong, and have a regard; nor let us <lb/>
            (as I observed before) consume all our lives in this kind <lb/>
            of learning, but, when we have discovered the fountains, <lb/>
            (which he who does not find out immediately will never find <lb/>
            at all,) let us draw from them as much as occasion may re- <lb/>
            quire, as often as we need. For neither is there so sharp <lb/>
            a discernment in the nature and understanding of man, that <lb/>
            any one can descry things of such importance, unless they <lb/>
            are pointed out; nor yet is there so much obscurity in the <lb/>
            things, that a man of penetrating genius cannot obtain an <lb/>
            insight into them, if he only direct his view towards them. <lb/>
            As the orator therefore has liberty to expatiate in so large <lb/>
            and immense a field, and, wherever he stops, can stand upon <lb/>
            his own territory, all the furniture and embellishments of <lb/>
            eloquence readily offer themselves to him. For copiousness <lb/>
            of matter produces copiousness of language; and, if there <lb/>
            be an inherent dignity in the subjects on which he speaks, <lb/>
            there must be, from the nature of the thing, a certain <lb/>
            splendour in his expression. If the speaker or writer has but <lb/>
            been liberally instructed in the learning proper for youth, <lb/>
            and has an ardent attachment to study, and is assisted by <lb/>
            natural endowments, and exercised in those indefinite ques- <lb/>
            tions on general subjects, and has chosen, at the same time, <lb/>
            the most elegant writers and speakers to study and imitate, <lb/>
            he will never, be assured, need instruction from such pre- <lb/>
            ceptors how to compose or embellish his language; so readily, <lb/>
            in an abundance of matter, will nature herself, if she be but <lb/>
            stimulated, fall without any guide into all the art of adorning <lb/>
            eloquence."</p>
          <p>XXXII. Catulus here observed, " <unclear>ie</unclear> immortal gods, what <lb/>
            an infinite variety, force, and extent of matter have you, <lb/>
            Crassus, embraced, and from how narrow a circle have you <pb n="368"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            ventured to lead forth the orator, and to place him in the <lb/>
            domains of his ancestors! For we have understood that <lb/>
            those ancient masters and authors of the art of speaking <lb/>
            considered no kind of disputation to be foreign to their pro. <lb/>
            fession, but were always exercising themselves in every branch <lb/>
            of oratory. Of which number was Hippias of Elis, who, <lb/>
            when he came to Olympia, at the time of the vast concourse <lb/>
            at the games celebrated every fifth year, boasted, in the <lb/>
            hearing of almost all Greece, that there was no subject in <lb/>
            any art or science of which he was ignorant; as he under- <lb/>
            stood not only those arts in which all liberal and polite <lb/>
            learning is comprised, geometry, music, grammar, and poetry, <lb/>
            and whatever is said on the natures of things, the moral <lb/>
            duties of men, and the science of government, but that he <lb/>
            had himself made, with his own hand, the ring which he <lb/>
            wore, and the cloak and shoes which he had on.1 He indeed <lb/>
            went a little too far; but, even from his example, we may <lb/>
            easily conjecture how much knowledge those very orators <lb/>
            desired to gain in the most noble arts, when they did not <lb/>
            shrink from learning even the more humble. Why need I <lb/>
            allude to Prodicus of Chios, Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, or <lb/>
            Protagoras of Abdera? every one of whom in those days dis- <lb/>
            puted and wrote much even on the nature of things. Even <lb/>
            Gorgias the Leontine himself, under whose advocacy (as <lb/>
            Plato represented) the orator yielded to the philosopher;2 who <lb/>
            was either never defeated in argument by Socrates, (and then <lb/>
            the Dialogue of Plato is wholly fictitious,) or, if he was so de- <lb/>
            feated, it was because Socrates was the more eloquent and <lb/>
            convincing, or, as you term it, the more powerful and better <lb/>
            orator ;-but this Gorgias, in that very book of Plato, offers <lb/>
            to speak most copiously on any subject whatever, that could <lb/>
            be brought under discussion or inquiry; and he was the first <lb/>
            of all men that ventured to demand, in a large assembly, on <lb/>
            what subject any one desired to hear him speak; and to <lb/>
            whom such honours were paid in Greece, that to him alone, <lb/>
            of all great men, a statue was erected at Delphi, not gilded, <lb/>
            but of solid gold. Those whom I have named, and many <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plato, Hipp. Min. p. 231 G. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gorgias, in the Dialogue of Plato, undertakes the defence of <lb/>

            other most consummate masters in the art of speaking, <lb/>
            flourished at the same time; from whose examples it may <lb/>
            be understood, that the truth is really such as you, Crassus, <lb/>
            have stated, and that the name of the orator was distin- <lb/>
            guished among the ancients in Greece in a more extensive <lb/>
            sense, and with greater honour than among ourselves. I am <lb/>
            therefore the more in doubt whether I should attribute <lb/>
            a greater degree of praise to you, or of blame to the Greeks; <lb/>
            since you, born under a different language and manners, in <lb/>
            the busiest of cities, occupied either with almost all the private <lb/>
            causes of the people, or with the government of the world <lb/>
            and the direction of the mightiest of empires, have mastered <lb/>
            such numbers of subjects, and acquired so extensive a know- <lb/>
            ledge, and have united all this with the science and practice <lb/>
            of one who is of authority in the republic by his counsels <lb/>
            and eloquence; whilst they, born in an atmosphere of learning, <lb/>
            ardently attached to such studies, but dissolved in idleness, <lb/>
            have not only made no acquisitions, but have not even <lb/>
            preserved as their own that which was left and consigned to <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Crassus then said, "Not only in this particular, <lb/>
            Catulus, but in many others, the grandeur of the sciences <lb/>
            has been diminished by the distribution and separation of <lb/>
            their parts. Do you imagine, that when the famous Hippo- <lb/>
            crates of Cos flourished, there were then some of the medical <lb/>
            faculty who cured diseases, others wounds, and a third class <lb/>
            the eyes ? Do you suppose that geometry under Euclid and <lb/>
            Archimedes, that music under Damon and Aristoxenus, that <lb/>
            grammar itself when Aristophanes and Callimachus treated <lb/>
            of it, were so divided into parts, that no one comprehended <lb/>
            the universal system of any of those sciences, but different <lb/>
            persons selected different parts on which they meant to <lb/>
            bestow their labour? I have, indeed, often heard from my <lb/>
            father and father-in-law, that even our own countrymen, who <lb/>
            were ambitious to excel in renown for wisdom, were wont te <lb/>
            comprehend all the objects of knowledge which this city had <lb/>
            then learned. They mentioned, as an instance of this, Sextus <lb/>
            Ælius; and we ourselves have seen Manius Manilius walking <lb/>
            across the forura; a signal that he who did so, gave all the <lb/>
            citizens liberty to consult him upon any subject; and to such <lb/>
            persons, when thus walking or sitting at home upon their seats <note type="footnote"> <unclear>B</unclear> 3 </note> <pb n="370"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            of ceremony, all people had free access, not only to consult <lb/>
            them upon points of civil law, but even upon the settlement <lb/>
            of a daughter in marriage, the purchase of an estate, or the <lb/>
            cultivation of a farm, and indeed upon any employment or <lb/>
            business whatsoever. Such was the wisdom of the well- <lb/>
            known elder Publius Crassus, such that of Titus Coruncanius, <lb/>
            such that of the great-grandfather of Scipio, my son-in-law, a <lb/>
            person of great judgment; all of whom were supreme pon- <lb/>
            tiffs, so that they were consulted upon all affairs, divine <lb/>
            and human; and the same men gave their counsel and dis- <lb/>
            charged their duty in the senate, before the people, and in <lb/>
            the private causes of their friends, in civil and military <lb/>
            service, both at home and abroad. What was deficient in <lb/>
            Marcus Cato, except the modern polish of foreign and ad- <lb/>
            ventitious learning? Did he, because he was versed in the <lb/>
            civil law, forbear from pleading causes? or, because he could <lb/>
            speak, neglect the study of jurisprudence? He laboured in <lb/>
            both these kinds of learning, and succeeded in both. Was <lb/>
            he, by the popularity which he acquired by attending to the <lb/>
            business of private persons, rendered more tardy in the <lb/>
            public service of the state? No man spoke with more <lb/>
            courage before the-people, none was ever a better senator; <lb/>
            he was at the same time a most excellent commander-in- <lb/>
            chief; and indeed nothing in those days could possibly be <lb/>
            known or learned in this city which he did not investigate <lb/>
            and thoroughly understand, and on which he did not also <lb/>
            write. Now, on the contrary, men generally come to assume <lb/>
            offices and the duties of public administration unarmed and <lb/>
            defenceless; prepared with no science, nor any knowledge of <lb/>
            business. But if any one happen to excel the multitude, he <lb/>
            is elevated with pride by the possession of any single talent, <lb/>
            as military courage, or a little experience in war, (which <lb/>
            indeed has now fallen into decay,1) or a knowledge of the <lb/>
            law, (not of the whole law, for nobody studies the pontifical <lb/>
            law, which is annexed to civil jurisprudence,2) or eloquence, <note type="footnote"> 1 For, except Metellus Numidicus and Marius, no one in those days <lb/>

            even the virtues themselves.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. " But to direct my remarks to the Greeks, (whom <lb/>
            we cannot omit in a dissertation of this nature; for as exam- <lb/>
            ples of virtue are to be sought among our own countrymen, <lb/>
            so examples of learning are to be derived from them;) seven <lb/>
            are said to have lived at one time, who were esteemed and <lb/>
            denominated wise men. All these, except Thales of Miletus, <lb/>
            had the government of their respective cities. Whose learning <lb/>
            is reported, at the same period, to have been greater, or <lb/>
            whose eloquence to have received more ornament from <lb/>
            literature, than that of Pisistratus? who is said to have been <lb/>
            the first that arranged the books of Homer as we now have <lb/>
            them, when they were previously confused. He was not <lb/>
            indeed of any great service to the community, but was <lb/>
            eminent for eloquence, at the same time that he excelled in <lb/>
            erudition and liberal knowledge. What was the character of <lb/>
            Pericles ?-of whose power in speaking we have heard, that <lb/>
            when he spoke for the good of his country against the incli- <lb/>
            nations of the Athenians, that very severity with which he <lb/>
            contradicted the favourites of the people, became popular <lb/>
            and agreeable to all men; and on whose lips the old <lb/>
            comic poets declared, (even when they satirized him, as was <lb/>
            then lawful to be done at Athens,) that the graces of per- <lb/>
            suasion dwelt, and that there was such mighty energy in him <lb/>
            that he left, as it were, certain stings in the minds of those <lb/>
            who listened to him. Yet no declaimer had taught him <lb/>
            to bawl for hours by the water-clock, but, as we have it from <lb/>
            tradition, the famous Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, a man emi- <lb/>
            nent in all the most valuable sciences, had instructed him. <lb/>
            He, accordingly, excelling as he did in learning, judgment, <lb/>
            and eloquence, presided at Athens forty years together over <lb/>
            civil and military affairs. What was the character of Critias, <lb/>
            or of Alcibiades? They were not indeed useful members of <lb/>
            the state in which they lived, but were certainly men of <lb/>
            learning and eloquence; and were they not improved by con- <lb/>
            versation with Socrates? Who instructed Dion of Syracuse <lb/>
            in every branch of learning? Was it not Plato? The same <lb/>
            illustrious philosopher, too, who formed him not to oratory <note type="footnote">B B 2 </note> <pb n="372"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            only, but to courage and virtue, impelled, equipped, and <lb/>
            armed him to deliver his country. Did Plato, then, instruct <lb/>
            Dion in sciences different from those in which Isocrates <lb/>
            formed the renowned Timotheus the son of Conon the <lb/>
            eminent general, and himself a most excellent commander, <lb/>
            and a man of extensive learning? Or from those in which <lb/>
            Lysis the Pythagorean trained Epaminondas of Thebes, who <lb/>
            perhaps was the most remarkable man of all Gieece? Or <lb/>
            from those which Xenophon taught Agesilaus, or Archytas <lb/>
            of Tarentum Philolaus, or Pythagoras himself all that old <lb/>
            province of Italy which was formerly called Great Greece? <lb/>
            XXXV. I do not imagine that they were different; for I see <lb/>
            that one and the same course of study comprised all those <lb/>
            branches of knowledge which were esteemed necessary for <lb/>
            a man of learning, and one who wished to become eminent <lb/>
            in civil administration; and that they who had received this <lb/>
            knowledge, if they had sufficient powers for speaking in <lb/>
            public, and devoted themselves, without any impediment <lb/>
            from nature, to oratory, became distinguished for eloquence. <lb/>
            Aristotle himself, accordingly, when he saw Isocrates grow <lb/>
            remarkable for the number and quality of his scholars, [be- <lb/>
            cause he himself had diverted his lectures from forensic and <lb/>
            civil causes to mere elegance of language,1] changed on a <lb/>
            sudden almost his whole system of teaching, and quoted a <lb/>
            verse from the tragedy of Philoctetes2 with a little alteration; <lb/>
            for the hero said, that It was disgraceful for him to be silent <lb/>
            while he allowed barbarians to speak; but Aristotle said that <lb/>
            it was disgraceful for him to be silent while he allowed Isocrates <lb/>
            to speak. He therefore adorned and illustrated all philoso- <lb/>
            phical learning, and associated the knowledge of things with <lb/>
            practice in speaking. Nor did this escape the knowledge of <lb/>
            that very sagacious monarch Philip, who sent for him as <lb/>
            a tutor for his son Alexander, that he might acquire from the <lb/>
            same teacher instructions at once in conduct and in language. <lb/>
            Now, if any one desires either to call that philosopher, who <lb/>
            instructs us fully in things and words, an orator, he may do <note type="footnote"> 1 The words in brackets, says Ellendt, are certainly spurious, for they <lb/>
            could not possibly have been written by Cicero. In the original, quod <lb/>
            ipse, &amp;c., ipse necessarily refers to Aristotle, of whom what is here said <lb/>
            could never have been true. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Philoctetes of Euri pides, as is generally supposed. </note> <pb n="373"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            so without opposition from me; or if he prefer to call that <lb/>
            orator, of whom I speak as having wisdom united with <lb/>
            eloquence, a philosopher, I shall make no objection, provided <lb/>
            it be allowed that neither his inability to speak, who under- <lb/>
            stands his subject but cannot set it forth in words, nor his <lb/>
            ignorance, to whom matter is wanting though words abound, <lb/>
            can merit commendation; and if I had to choose one of the <lb/>
            two, I should prefer uneloquent good sense to loquacious folly. <lb/>
            But if it be inquired which is the more eminent excellence, <lb/>
            the palm is to be given to the learned orator; and if they <lb/>
            allow the same person to be a philosopher, there is an end of <lb/>
            controversy; but if they distinguish them, they will acknow- <lb/>
            ledge their inferiority in this respect, that all their knowledge <lb/>
            is inherent in the complete orator; but in the knowledge of <lb/>
            the philosophers eloquence is not necessarily inherent; which, <lb/>
            though it may be undervalued by them, must of necessity be <lb/>
            thought to give a finishing grace to their sciences." When <lb/>
            Crassus had spoken thus, he made a pause for a while, and <lb/>
            the rest kept silence.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Cotta then observed, "I cannot indeed complain, <lb/>
            Crassus, that you seem to me to have given a dissertation <lb/>
            upon a different subject from that on which you had under- <lb/>
            taken to speak; for you have contributed to our conversation <lb/>
            more than was either laid upon you by us, or given notice <lb/>
            of by yourself. But certainly it was the part that belonged <lb/>
            to you, to speak upon the embellishments of language, and <lb/>
            you had already entered upon it, and distributed the whole <lb/>
            excellence of eloquence into four parts; and, when you had <lb/>
            spoken upon the first two, as we indeed thought sum- <lb/>
            ciently, but, as you said yourself, cursorily and slightly, you <lb/>
            had two others left: how we should speak, first, elegantly, <lb/>
            and next, aptly. But when you were proceeding to these <lb/>
            particulars, the tide, as it were, of your genius suddenly <lb/>
            hurried you to a distance from land, and carried you out <lb/>
            into the deep, almost beyond the view of us all; for, em- <lb/>
            bracing all knowledge of everything, you did not indeed <lb/>
            teach it us, (for that was impossible in so short a space of <lb/>
            time,) but,—I know not what improvement you may have <lb/>
            made in the rest of the company,-as for myself, you <lb/>
            have carried me altogether into the heart of the academy, <lb/>
            in regard to which I could wish that that were true which <pb n="374"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            you have often asserted, that it is not necessary to consume, <lb/>
            our lives in it, but that he may see everything in it who only <lb/>
            turns his eyes towards it: but even if the view be somewhat <lb/>
            obscure, or I should be extraordinarily dull, I shall assuredly <lb/>
            never rest, or yield to fatigue, until I understand their <lb/>
            doubtful ways and arts of disputing for and against every <lb/>
            question." Cæsar then said, " One thing in your remarks, <lb/>
            Crassus, struck me very much, that you said that he who did <lb/>
            not learn anything soon, could never thoroughly learn it at <lb/>
            all; so that I can have no difficulty in making the trial, and <lb/>
            either immediately understanding what you extolled to the <lb/>
            skies in your observations, or, if I cannot do so, losing no <lb/>
            time, as I may remain content with what I have already <lb/>
            acquired." Here Sulpicius observed, “I, indeed, Crassus, <lb/>
            neither desire any acquaintance with your Aristotle, nor <lb/>
            Carneades, nor any of the philosophers; you may either <lb/>
            imagine that I despair of being able to acquire their know- <lb/>
            ledge, or that, as is really the case, I despise it. The ordinary <lb/>
            knowledge of common affairs, and such as are litigated in the <lb/>
            forum, is great enough for me, for attaining that degree of <lb/>
            eloquence which is my object; and even in that narrow circle <lb/>
            of science I am ignorant of a multitude of things, which I <lb/>
            begin to study, whenever any cause in which I am to speak <lb/>
            requires them. If, therefore, you are not now fatigued, and <lb/>
            if we are not troublesome to you, revert to those particulars <lb/>
            which contribute to the merit and splendour of language; <lb/>
            particulars which I desired to hear from you, not to make <lb/>
            me despair that I can ever possibly attain eloquence, but to <lb/>
            make some addition to my stock of learning."</p>
          <p>, XXXVII. " You require of me," said Crassus, " to speak <lb/>
            on matters which are very well known, and with which you, <lb/>
            Sulpicius, are not unacquainted; for what rhetorician has not <lb/>
            treated of this subject, has not given instructions on it, has <lb/>
            not even left something about it in writing? But I will com- <lb/>
            ply with your request, and briefly explain to you at least such <lb/>
            points as are known to me; but I shall still think that you <lb/>
            ought to refer to those who are the authors and inventors of <lb/>
            these minute precepts. All speech, then, is formed of words, <lb/>
            which we must first consider singly, then in composition; for <lb/>
            there is one merit of language which lies in single words , <lb/>
            another which is produced by words joined and compounded <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XXXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            We shall therefore either use such words as are the proper and <lb/>
            fixed names as it were of things, and apparently almost-born <lb/>
            at the same time with the things themselves; or such as are <lb/>
            metaphorical, and placed as it were in a situation foreign to <lb/>
            them; or such as we invent and make ourselves. In -regard <lb/>
            then to words taken in their own proper sense, it is a merit <lb/>
            in the orator to avoid mean and obsolete ones, and to use <lb/>
            such as are choice and ornamental; such as have in them <lb/>
            some fulness and force of sound. But in this kind of proper <lb/>
            words, selection is necessary, which must be decided in some <lb/>
            measure by the judgment of the ear; in which point the <lb/>
            mere habit of speaking well is of great effect. Even what <lb/>
            is vulgarly said of orators by the illiterate multitude, He <lb/>
            uses proper words, or Such a one uses improper words, is not <lb/>
            the result of any acquired skill, but is a judgment arising <lb/>
            from a natural sense of what is right; in which respect it is <lb/>
            no great merit to avoid a fault, (though it is of great im- <lb/>
            portance to do so,).yet this is the ground-work, as it were <lb/>
            and foundation of the whole, namely, the use and command <lb/>
            of proper words. But the superstructure which the orator <lb/>
            himself is to raise upon this, and in which he is to display <lb/>
            his art, appears to be a matter for us to examine and <lb/>
            illustrate.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. “ There are three qualities, then, in a simple <lb/>
            word, which the orator may employ to illustrate and adorn <lb/>
            his language; he may choose either an unusual word, or one <lb/>
            that is new or metaphorical. Unusual words are generally <lb/>
            of ancient date and fashion, and such as have been long out <lb/>
            of use in daily conversation; these are allowed more freely <lb/>
            to poetical licence than to ours; yet a poetical word gives <lb/>
            occasionally dignity also to oratory; nor would I shrink from <lb/>
            saying, with Cœlius, Qud tempestate Pœnus in Italiam venit, <lb/>
            ‘ At the season when the Carthaginian came into Italy:' nor <lb/>
            proles, 'progeny;' nor suboles, ‘offspring ;’ nor effari, 'to <lb/>
            utter;' nor nuncupari, 'to declare;' nor, as you are in the <lb/>
            habit of saying, Catulus, non rebar, 'I did not deem;' nor <lb/>
            non opinabar, 'I did not opine;' nor many others, from <lb/>
            which, if properly introduced, a speech assumes an air of <lb/>
            greater grandeur. New words are such as are produced and <lb/>
            formed by the speaker; either by joining words together, as <lb/>
            these. <pb n="376"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>

            Would you not have me dread his cunning malice ? <lb/>
            for you see that versutiloquas and expectorat are words not <lb/>
            newly produced, but merely formed by composition. But <lb/>
            words are often invented, without composition, as the ex- <lb/>
            pression of Ennius,l Dii genitales, 'the genial gods;' or bac- <lb/>
            carum ubertate incurviscere, ‘ to bend down with the fertile <lb/>
            crop of berries.'</p>
          <p>" The third mode, that of using words in a metaphorical <lb/>
            sense, is widely prevalent, a mode of which necessity was the <lb/>
            parent, compelled by the sterility and narrowness of language; <lb/>
            but afterwards delight and pleasure made it frequent; for as <lb/>
            a dress was first adopted for the sake of keeping off the cold, <lb/>
            but in process of time began to be made an ornament of the <lb/>
            body, and an emblem of dignity, so the metaphorical use of <lb/>
            words was originally invented on account of their paucity, but <lb/>
            became common from the delight which it afforded. For <lb/>
            even the countrymen say, gemmare vites, that ‘ the vines are <lb/>
            budding;' luxuriem esse in herbis, that ‘ there is a luxuriancy <lb/>
            in the grass;' and lœtas segetes, that ‘ there is a bountiful <lb/>
            crop;' for when that which can scarcely be signified by its <lb/>
            proper word is expressed by one used in a metaphorical sense, <lb/>
            the similitude taken from that which we indicate by a foreign <lb/>
            term gives clearness to that which we wish to be understood. <lb/>
            These metaphors, therefore, are a species of borrowing, as you <lb/>
            take from something else that which you have not of your own. <lb/>
            Those have a greater degree of boldness which do not show <lb/>
            poverty, but bring some accession of splendour to our lan- <lb/>
            guage. But why should I specify to you either the modes of <lb/>
            their production or their various kinds ?</p>
          <p>XXXIX. " A metaphor is a brief similitude contracted into <lb/>
            a single word; which word being put in the place of another, <note type="footnote"> 1 All the editions retain tHe senius, though universally acknowledged <lb/>
            to be corrupt. The conjecture of Turnebus, ille Ennius, has found most <lb/>

            as if it were in its own place, conveys, if the resemblance be <lb/>
            acknowledged, delight; if there is no resemblance, it is con- <lb/>
            demned. But such words should be metaphorically used as <lb/>
            may make the subject clearer; as all these :1 <lb/>
            Inhorrescit mare, <lb/>
            Tenebrce conduplicantur, noctisque et nimbûm occcecat nigror, <lb/>
            Plamma inter nubes coruscat, colum. tonitru contremit, <lb/>
            Grando mixta imbri largifluo subita prœcipitans cadit; <lb/>
            Undique omnes venti erumpunt, sævi existunt turbines ; <lb/>
            Fervit œstu pelagus. <lb/>
            The sea begins to shudder, <lb/>
            Darkness is doubled; and the black of night <lb/>
            And of the tempest thickens; fire gleams vivid <lb/>
            Amid the clouds; the heavens with thunder shake; <lb/>
            Hail mixed with copious rain sudden descends <lb/>
            Precipitate ; from all sides every blast <lb/>
            Breaks forth ; fierce whirlwinds gather, and the flood <lb/>
            Boils with fresh tumult.</p>
          <p>Here almost everything is expressed in words metaphori- <lb/>
            cally adapted from something similar, that the description <lb/>
            may be heightened. Or metaphors are employed that the <lb/>
            whole nature of any action or design may be more signi- <lb/>
            ficantly expressed; as in the. case of him who indicates, by <lb/>
            two metaphorical words, that another person was designedly <lb/>
            obscure, in order that what he intended might not be under- <lb/>
            stood, <lb/>
            Quandoquidem is se circumvestit dictis, sœpit sedulo, <lb/>
            Since thus he clothes himself around with words, <lb/>
            And hedges constantly.</p>
          <p>“ Sometimes, also, brevity is the object attained by meta- <lb/>
            phor; as, Si telum manu fugit, 'If from his hand the javelin <lb/>
            fled.' The throwing of a missile weapon unawares could not be <lb/>
            described with more brevity in the proper words than it is <lb/>
            signified by one used metaphorically. On this head, it often <lb/>
            appears to me wonderful why all men are more delighted <lb/>
            with words used in a metaphorical or foreign sense than in <lb/>
            their own proper and natural signification. XL. For if a <lb/>
            thing has not a name of its own, and a term peculiar to it,- <lb/>
            as the pes, or ‘ hawser,' in a ship ; nexum, a ' bond,' which is <lb/>
            a ceremony performed with scales ;2 divortium, al divorce,' with <note type="footnote"> 1 From Pacuvius. See Cic. Divin. i. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Smith's Dict. of Gr. and Rom. Ant., art. Nexun. </note> <pb n="378"/>

            another what you have not yourself; but, even in the greatest <lb/>
            abundance of proper words, men are much more charmed <lb/>
            with such as are uncommon, if they are used metaphori- <lb/>
            cally with judgment. This happens, I imagine, either because <lb/>
            it is some manifestation of wit to jump over such expres- <lb/>
            sions as lie before you, and catch at others from a greater <lb/>
            distance; or because he who listens is led another way in <lb/>
            thought, and yet does not wander from the subject, which is <lb/>
            a very great pleasure; or because a subject, and entire com- <lb/>
            parison, is despatched in a single word; or because every <lb/>
            metaphor that is adopted with judgment, is directed imme- <lb/>
            diately to our senses, and principally to the sense of sight, <lb/>
            which is the keenest of them all. For such expressions as <lb/>
            the odour of urbanity, the softness of humanity, the murmur <lb/>
            of the sea, and sweetness of language, are derived from the <lb/>
            other senses; but those which relate to the sight are much <lb/>
            more striking, for they place almost in the eye of the mind <lb/>
            such objects as we cannot see and discern by the natural eyes. <lb/>
            There is, indeed, nothing in universal nature, the proper name <lb/>
            and term of which we may not use with regard to other <lb/>
            matters; for whencesoever a simile may be drawn (and it <lb/>
            may be drawn from anything), from thence a single word, <lb/>
            which contains the resemblance, metaphorically applied, may <lb/>
            give illustration to our language. In such metaphorical ex- <lb/>
            pressions, dissimilitude is principally to be avoided ; as, <lb/>
            Caeli ingentes fornices, <lb/>
            The arch immense of heaven; <lb/>
            for though Ennius2 is said to have brought a globe upon the <lb/>
            stage, yet the semblance of an arch can never be inherent in <lb/>
            the form of a globe.</p>

            able to what he had said before, dum licet,‘ while you may.'</p>
          <p>XLI. " Care is next to be taken that the simile be not too <lb/>
            far-fetched; as, for the Syrtis of his patrimony,' I should <lb/>
            rather have said, ‘ the rock;’ for ‘ the Charybdis of his posses- <lb/>
            sions,' rather ‘ the gulf:' for the eyes of the mind are more <lb/>
            easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to <lb/>
            those of which we have only heard. And since it is the <lb/>
            greatest merit in a metaphorical word, that what is meta- <lb/>
            phorical should strike the senses, all offensiveness is to be <lb/>
            avoided in those objects to which the comparison must <lb/>
            naturally draw the minds of the audience. I would not have <lb/>
            it said that the republic was ‘ castrated' by the death of <lb/>
            Africanus; I would not have Glaucia called ‘the excrement <lb/>
            of the senate;' for though there may be a resemblance, yet it <lb/>
            is a depraved imagination in both cases that gives rise to <lb/>
            such a comparison. I would not have the metaphor grander <lb/>
            than the subject requires, as ‘ a tempest of revelling;' nor <lb/>
            meaner, as ‘ the revelling of the tempest.' I would not have <lb/>
            the metaphorical be of a more confined sense than the proper <lb/>
            and peculiar term would have been; as, <lb/>
            Quidnam est, obsecro, quid te adiri abnutas?1 <lb/>
            Why is it, prythee, that thou nodd'st us back <lb/>
            From coming to thee ?</p>
          <p>Vetas, proves, absterres, ‘ forbid,' ‘ hinder,' ‘ terrify,' had been <lb/>
            better, because he had before said, <lb/>
            Fly quickly hence,2 <lb/>
            Lest my contagion or my shadow fall <lb/>
            On men of worth.</p>
          <p>Also, if you apprehend that the metaphor may appear too <lb/>
            harsh, it may frequently be softened by prefixing a word or <lb/>
            words to it; as if, in old times, on the death of Marcus Cato, <lb/>
            any one had said that the senate was left an orphan,' the ex- <lb/>
            pression had been rather bold; but,‘so to speak, an orphan,' <lb/>
            is somewhat milder; for a metaphor ought not to be too daring, <note type="footnote"> 1 From the Thyestes of Ennius. Cic. Tusc. iii. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Orellius's text has istim, which is considered to be the same as <lb/>

            but of such a nature that it may appear to have been introduced <lb/>
            into the place of another expression, not to have sprung into <lb/>
            it; to have come in by entreaty, and not by violence. And <lb/>
            there is no mode of embellishment more effective as regards <lb/>
            single words, nor any that throws a greater lustre upon lan- <lb/>
            guage ; for the ornament that flows from this figure does not <lb/>
            consist merely in a single metaphorical word, but may be <lb/>
            connected by a continuation of many, so that one thing may <lb/>
            be expressed and another understood; as, <lb/>
            Nor will I allow <lb/>
            Myself again to strike the Grecian fleet <lb/>
            On the same rock and instrument of ruin.1 <lb/>
            And this, <lb/>

            Too much in your own self, and make you bow <lb/>
            Beneath the yoke of empire.</p>
          <p>Something being assumed as similar, the words which are <lb/>

            words only, but in phrases, that is, in a continuation of words. <lb/>
            Nor have metonymy and hypallage2 their form from a single <lb/>
            word, but from a phrase or sentence; as, <lb/>
            Grim Afric trembles with an awful tumult ;3 <lb/>
            where for the Africans is used Afric; not a word newly <lb/>
            compounded, as in Mare saxifragis undis, ‘ The sea with its <lb/>
            rock-breaking waves; nora metaphorical one, as, Mollitur <lb/>
            mare, ' The sea is softened;' but one proper name exchanged <lb/>
            for another, for the sake of embellishment. Thus, Cease, Rome, <lb/>
            thy foes to cherish,' and, ‘ The spacious plains are witnesses. <lb/>
            This figure contributes exceedingly to the ornament of style, <lb/>
            and is frequently to be used; of which kind of expression these <lb/>

            the comitia or elections; the gown, for peace; arms or weapons, <lb/>

            the persons in whom they are inherent: ‘ Luxury has broken <lb/>

            elegantly; and to this figure is closely allied another,1 which, <lb/>
            though less ornamental, ought not to be unknown; as when <lb/>
            we would have the whole of a thing understood from a part; <lb/>
            as we say walls or roof for a whole building; or a part <lb/>
            from the whole, as when we call one troop the cavalry of the <lb/>
            Roman people; or when we signify the plural by the sin- <lb/>
            gular, as, <lb/>
            But still the Roman, though the affair has been <lb/>
            Conducted well, is anxious in his heart ;2 <lb/>
            or when the singular is understood from the plural, <lb/>
            We that were Rudians once are Romans now; <lb/>
            or iu whatever way, by this figure, the sense is to be under- <lb/>
            stood, not as it is expressed, but as it is meant.</p>
          <p>XLIII. " We often also put one word catachrestically for <lb/>
            another, not with that elegance, indeed, which there is in a <lb/>
            metaphor; but, though this is done licentiously, it is some- <lb/>
            times done inoffensively; as when we say a great speech for a <lb/>
            long one, a minute soul for a little one.</p>
          <p>" But have you perceived that those elegances which arise <lb/>
            from the connexion of several metaphors, do not, as I ob- <lb/>
            served,3 lie in one word, but in a series of words ? But all <lb/>
            those modes of expression which, I said, lay in the change of <lb/>
            a word, or are to be understood differently from what is <lb/>
            expressed, are in some measure metaphorical. Hence it hap- <lb/>
            pens, that all the virtue and merit of single words consists in <lb/>
            three particulars: if a word be antique, but such, however, as <lb/>
            usage will tolerate; if it be formed by composition, or newly <lb/>
            invented, where regard is to be paid to the judgment of the <lb/>
            ear and to custom; or if it be used metaphorically; pecu- <note type="footnote"> 1 Synecdoche. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This quotation and the following are from the Annals of Ennius. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 C. 41 </note> <pb n="382"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            liarities which eminently distinguish and brighten language, <lb/>
            as with so many stars.</p>
          <p>" The composition of words follows next, which principally <lb/>
            requires attention to two things; first, collocation, and, next, <lb/>
            a certain modulation and form. To collocation it belongs to <lb/>
            compose and arrange the words in such a way that their <lb/>
            junction may not be rough or gaping, but compact, as it were, <lb/>
            and smooth; in reference to which qualities of style, the poet <lb/>
            Lucilius, who could do so most elegantly, has expressed him- <lb/>
            self wittily and sportively in the character of my father- <lb/>
            in-law :1 <lb/>
            How elegantly are his words arranged ! <lb/>
            All like square stones inserted skilfully <lb/>
            In pavements, with vermiculated emblems !</p>
          <p>And after saying this in ridicule of Albucius, he does not <lb/>
            refrain from touching on me : <lb/>
            I've Crassus for a son-in-law, nor think <lb/>
            Yourself more of an orator.</p>
          <p>What then ? this Crassus, of whose name you, Lucilius, make <lb/>
            such free use, what does he attempt? The very same thing <lb/>
            indeed as Scævola wished, and as I would wish, but with some- <lb/>
            what better effect than Albucius. But Lucilius spoke jestingly <lb/>
            with regard to me, according to his custom. However, such <lb/>
            an arrangement of words is to be observed, as that of which <lb/>
            I was speaking; such a one as may give a compactness and <lb/>
            coherence to the language, and a smooth and equal flow; this <lb/>
            you will attain if you join the extremities of the antecedent <lb/>
            words to the commencements of those that follow in such a <lb/>
            manner that there be no rough clashing in the consonants, <lb/>
            nor wide hiatus in the vowels.</p>
          <p>XLIV. " Next to diligent attention to this particular, follows <lb/>
            modulation and harmonious structure of the words; a point, <lb/>
            I fear, that may seem puerile to our friend Catulus here. The <lb/>
            ancients, however, imagined in prose a harmony almost like <lb/>
            that of poetry; that is, they thought that we ought to adopt <lb/>
            a sort of numbers; for they wished that there should be <lb/>
            short phrases in speeches, to allow us to recover, and not <lb/>
            lose our breath; and that they should be distinguished, not <lb/>
            by the marks of transcribers, but according to the modulation <note type="footnote"> 1 Mucius Scævola. He accused Albucius of extortion. </note> <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="margin">C. XLV.] </note> <lb/>
            of the words and sentences;1 and this practice Isocrates is <lb/>
            said to have been the first to introduce, that he might (as <lb/>
            his scholar Naucrates writes) 'confine the rude manner of <lb/>
            speaking among those of antiquity within certain numbers, <lb/>
            to give pleasure and captivate the ear.' For musicians, who <lb/>
            were also the poets of former ages, contrived these two things <lb/>
            as the ministers of pleasure, verse, and song; that they <lb/>
            might banish satiety from the sense of hearing by gratifica- <lb/>
            tion, arising from the numbers of language and the modulation <lb/>
            of notes. These two things, therefore, (I mean the musical <lb/>
            management of the voice, and the harmonious structure of <lb/>
            words,) should be transferred, they thought, as far as the <lb/>
            strictness of prose will admit, from poetry to oratory. On <lb/>
            this head it is remarkable, that if a verse is formed by the <lb/>
            composition of words in prose, it is a fault; and yet we wish <lb/>
            such composition to have a harmonious cadence, roundness, <lb/>
            and finish, like verse; nor is there any single quality, out <lb/>
            of many, that more distinguishes a true orator from an un- <lb/>
            skilful and ignorant speaker, than that he who is unpractised <lb/>
            pours forth all he can without discrimination, and measures <lb/>
            out the periods of his speech, not with art, but by the power <lb/>
            of his breath; but the orator clothes his thoughts in such <lb/>
            a manner as to comprise them in a flow of numbers, at once <lb/>
            confined to measure, yet free from restraint; for, after restrict- <lb/>
            ing it to proper modulation and structure, he gives it an ease <lb/>
            and freedom by a variety in the flow, so that the words are <lb/>
            neither bound by strict laws, as those of verse, nor yet have <lb/>
            such a degree of liberty as to wander without control.</p>
          <p>XLV. “ In what manner, then, shall we pursue so important <lb/>
            an object, so as to entertain hopes of being able to acquire <lb/>
            this talent of speaking in harmonious numbers? It is not <lb/>
            a matter of so much difficulty as it is of necessity; for there <lb/>
            is nothing so pliant, nothing so flexible, nothing which will <lb/>
            so easily follow whithersoever you incline to lead it, as lan- <lb/>
            guage; out of which verses are composed; out of which all <lb/>
            the variety of poetical numbers; out of which also prose of <lb/>
            various modulation and of many different kinds; for there is <lb/>
            not one set of words for common discourse, and another for <lb/>
            oratorical debate; nor are they taken from one class for daily <lb/>
            conversation, and from another for the stage and for display ; <note type="footnote"> 1 Ellendt aptly refers to Cic. Orate c. 68; Aristotle, Rhet. iii. 8. 6. </note> <pb n="384"/>

            but, when we have made our selection from those that lie <lb/>
            before us, we form and fashion them at our pleasure like the <lb/>
            softest wax. According, therefore, as we ourselves are grave, <lb/>
            or subtle, or hold a middle course between both, so the form <lb/>
            of our language follows the nature of our thoughts, and is <lb/>
            changed and varied to suit every method by which we delight <lb/>
            the ear or move the passions of mankind. But as in most <lb/>
            things, so in language, Nature herself has wonderfully con- <lb/>
            trived, that what carries in it the greatest utility, should <lb/>
            have at the same time either the most dignity, or, as <lb/>
            it often happens, the most beauty. We perceive the very <lb/>
            system of the universe and of nature to be constituted with <lb/>
            a view to the safety and preservation of the whole; so that <lb/>
            the firmament should be round, and the earth in the middle, <lb/>
            and that it should be held in its place by its own nature and <lb/>
            tendency; 1 that the sun should go round, that it should <lb/>
            approach to the winter sign,2 and thence gradually ascend to <lb/>
            the opposite region; that the moon, by her advance and <lb/>
            retreat, should receive the light of the sun; and that the <lb/>
            five planets should perform the same revolutions by different <lb/>
            motions and courses. This order of things has such force, <lb/>
            that, if there were the least alteration in it, they could not <lb/>
            possibly subsist together; and such beauty, that no fairer <lb/>
            appearance of nature could even be imagined. Turn your <lb/>
            thoughts now to the shape and figure of man, or even that <lb/>
            of other animals; you will find no part of the body fashioned <lb/>
            without some necessary use, and the whole frame perfected <lb/>
            as it were by art, not by chance. XLVI. How is it with <lb/>
            regard to trees, of which neither the trunk, nor the boughs, <lb/>
            nor even the leaves, are formed otherwise than to maintain <lb/>
            and preserve their own nature, yet in which there is no part <lb/>
            that is not beautiful? Or let us turn from natural objects, <lb/>
            and cast our eyes on those of art; what is so necessary in <lb/>
            a ship as the sides, the hold,3 the prow, the stern, the yards, <note type="footnote"> 1 Nutu. Compare Cic. De Nat. Deor. ii. 39. Ellendt thinks that <lb/>

            the sails, the masts? which yet have so much beauty in their <lb/>
            appearance, that they seem to have been invented not for <lb/>
            safety only, but also for the delight afforded by the spectacle. <lb/>
            Pillars support temples and porticoes, and yet have not more <lb/>
            of utility than of dignity. It was not regard to beauty, but <lb/>
            necessity, that contrived the cupola of the Capitol, and other <lb/>
            buildings; for when a plan was contemplated by which the <lb/>
            water might run off from each side of the roof, the dignity of <lb/>
            the cupola was added to the utility of the temple; but in <lb/>
            such a manner, that should the Capitol be built in heaven, <lb/>
            where no rain can fall, it would appear to have no dignity <lb/>
            without the cupola. It happens likewise in all parts of lan- <lb/>
            guage, that a certain agreeableness and grace are attendant <lb/>
            on utility, and, I may say, on necessity; for the stoppage of <lb/>
            the breath, and the confined play of the lungs, introduced <lb/>
            periods and the pointing of words. This invention gives such <lb/>
            gratification, that, if unlimited powers of breath were granted <lb/>
            to a person, yet we could not wish him to speak without <lb/>
            stopping; for the invention of stops is pleasing to the ears of <lb/>
            mankind, and not only tolerable, but easy, to the lungs.</p>
          <p>XLVII. " The largest compass of a period, then, is that <lb/>
            which can be rounded forth in one breath. This is the <lb/>
            bound set by nature; art has other limits; for as there is <lb/>
            a great variety of numbers, your favourite Aristotle, Catulus, <lb/>
            inclines to banish from oratorical language the frequent use <lb/>
            of the iambus and the trochee; which, however, fall of them- <lb/>
            selves naturally into our common discourse and conversation; <lb/>
            but the strokes of time1 in those numbers are remarkable, <lb/>
            and the feet short. He therefore principally invites us to <lb/>
            the heroic measure, [of the dactyl, the anapaest, and the <lb/>
            spondee ;] 2 in which we may proceed with impunity two <note type="footnote">which precedes. Ellendt himself, therefore, inclines to take it in tho <lb/>
            sense of cavitas alvei, " hold " or " keel," which, as it is divided into <lb/>
            parts, may, he thinks, be expressed in the plural number. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Percussiones. The ictus metrici, so called, because the musician, <lb/>

          <p>These three heroic feet fall in gracefully enough with the be- <lb/>

            all approved by Aristotle; it is of two kinds;1 for it either <lb/>
            begins with a long syllable which three short syllables follow, <lb/>

            cession of three short syllables, the last being produced and <lb/>

            is agreeable to the notions of that philosopher to commence <lb/>
            with the former pæon, and to conclude with the latter; and <lb/>
            this latter pæon is almost equal, not indeed in the number <lb/>
            of the syllables, but by the measure of the ear, which is <lb/>
            a more acute and certain method of judgment, to the cretic, <lb/>
            which consists of a long, a short, and a long syllable; as in <lb/>

            illius. This Aristotle thinks better adapted to conclusions <lb/>
            of periods, which he wishes to be terminated generally by a <lb/>
            syllable that is long.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. “ But these numbers in oratory do not require <lb/>
            such sharp-sighted care and diligence as that which must <lb/>
            be used by poets, whom necessity compels, as do the very <lb/>
            numbers and measures, so to include the words in versi- <lb/>
            fication, as that no part may be, even by the least breath,4 <lb/>
            shorter or longer than the metre absolutely demands. Prose <lb/>
            has a more free scope, and is plainly, as it is called, soluta, <lb/>
            unconfined, yet not so that it may fly off or wander without <note type="footnote"> nous. I follow those critics also in reading Altæ sunt geminæ quious, <lb/>
            though, as Ellendt observes, Altce ought very likely to be Arœ. Aliæ, <lb/>
            which is in most editions, made the passage utterly inexplicable, <lb/>
            though Emesti, Strebæus, and others did what they could to put some <lb/>

            control, but may regulate itself withors being absolutely in <lb/>
            fetters; for I agree in this particular with Theophrastus, <lb/>
            who thinks that style, at least such as is to a certain degree <lb/>
            polished and well constructed,' ought to be numerous, yet not <lb/>
            as in confinement, but at ease. For, as he suspects, from <lb/>
            those feet of which the common hexameter verse is formed, <lb/>
            grew forth afterwards the anapæstic, a longer kind of measure ; <lb/>
            thence flowed the still more free and rich dithyramb, the <lb/>
            members and feet of which, as the same writer observes, are <lb/>
            diffused through all style, that is enriched with the distin- <lb/>
            guishing ornaments of eloquence. And if that is numerous in <lb/>
            all sounds and words, which gives certain strokes as it were, <lb/>
            and which we can measure by equal intervals, this harmony <lb/>
            of numbers, if it be free from sameness, will be justly con- <lb/>
            sidered a merit in the oratorical style. Sinec if perpetual <lb/>
            and ever-flowing loquacity, without any pauses, is to be <lb/>
            thought rude and unpolished, what other reason is there <lb/>
            why it should be disliked, except that Nature herself modu- <lb/>
            lates the voice for the human ear ? and this could not be the <lb/>
            case unless numbers were inherent in the human voice. But <lb/>
            in an uninterrupted continuation of sound there are no <lb/>
            numbers; distinction, and strokes at equal or often varied <lb/>
            intervals, constitute numbers; which we may remark in <lb/>
            the falling of drops of water, because they are distin- <lb/>
            guished by intervals, but which we cannot observe in the <lb/>
            rolling stream of a river. But as this unrestrained com- <lb/>
            position of words 2 is more eligible and harmonious, if it be <lb/>
            distinguished into parts and members, than if it be carried <lb/>
            on without intermission, those members ought to be mea- <lb/>
            sured by a certain rule of proportion; for if those at the <lb/>
            end are shorter, the compass as it were of the words is made <lb/>
            irregular; the compass,' I say, for so the Greeks denominate <lb/>
            these rounded divisions of style; the subsequent clauses in <lb/>
            a sentence, therefore, ought to be equal to the antecedent, the <lb/>
            last to the first; or, which has a better and more pleasing <lb/>
            effect, of a greater length.</p>

            to wh&lt; m you, Catulus, have the greatest attachment; a re- <lb/>
            mark which I the oftener make, that by referring to my <lb/>
            authors, I may avoid the charge of impertinence.,, “ Of <lb/>
            what sort of impertinence?” said Catulus; "or what could <lb/>
            be brought before us more elegant than this discussion of <lb/>
            yours, or expressed more judiciously?” "But still I am <lb/>
            afraid," said Crassus, " lest these matters should either <lb/>
            appear to these youths1 too difficult for study, or lest, as <lb/>
            they are not given in the common rules of instruction, I <lb/>
            should appear to have an inclination that they should seem <lb/>
            of more importance and difficulty than they really are." <lb/>
            Catulus replied, "You are mistaken, Crassus, if you imagine <lb/>
            that either I or any of the company expected from you <lb/>
            those ordinary or vulgar precepts; what you say is what we <lb/>
            wished to be said; and not so much indeed to be said, as to <lb/>
            be said in the very manner in which you have said it; nor <lb/>
            do I answer for myself only, but for all the. rest, without the <lb/>
            least hesitation." “ And I," said Antonius, “ have at length <lb/>
            discovered such a one as, in the book which I wrote, I said <lb/>
            that I had never found, a person of eloquence; but I never <lb/>
            interrupted you, not even to pay you a compliment, for this <lb/>
            reason, that no part of the short time allotted for your dis- <lb/>
            course might be diminished by a single word of mine."</p>
          <p>“To this standard, then," proceeded Crassus, “is your <lb/>
            style to be formed, as well by the practice of speaking, as <lb/>
            by writing, which contributes a grace and refinement to other <lb/>
            excellences, but to this in a more peculiar manner. Nor is <lb/>
            this a matter of so much labour as it appears to be; nor are <lb/>
            our phrases to be governed by the rigid laws of the cul- <lb/>
            tivators of numbers and music; and the only object for our <lb/>
            endeavours is, that our sentences may not be loose or ram- <lb/>
            bling, that they neither stop within too narrow a compass, <lb/>
            nor run out too far; that they be distinguished into clauses, <lb/>
            and have well-rounded periods. Nor are you to use per- <lb/>
            petually this fulness and as it were roundness of language, <lb/>
            but a sentence is often to be interrupted by minuter clauses, <lb/>
            which very clauses are still to be modulated by numbers. <lb/>
            Nor let the pæon or heroic foot give you any alarm; they <lb/>
            will naturally come into your phrases; they will, I say, offer <lb/>
            themselves, and will answer without being called; only let it <note type="footnote"> 1 Cotta and Sulpicius. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="margin">C. L.] </note> <lb/>
            be your care and practice, both in writing and speaking, that <lb/>
            your sentences be concluded with verbs, and that the junction <lb/>
            of those verbs with other words proceed with numbers that are <lb/>
            long and free, especially the heroic feet, the first pæon, or <lb/>
            the cretic; but let the cadence be varied and diversified; <lb/>
            for it is in the conclusion that sameness is chiefly remarked. <lb/>
            And if these measures are observed at the beginning and at <lb/>
            the conclusion of sentences, the intermediate numbers may be <lb/>
            disregarded; only let the compass of your sentence not be <lb/>
            shorter than the ear expects, nor longer than your strength <lb/>
            and breath will allow.</p>
          <p>L. " But I think that the conclusions of periods ought to <lb/>
            be studied more carefully than the former parts; because it <lb/>
            is chiefly from these that the finish of style is judged; for in <lb/>
            a verse, the commencement of it, the middle, and the ex- <lb/>
            tremity are equally regarded; and in whatever part it fails, it <lb/>
            loses its force; but in a speech, few notice the beginnings, <lb/>
            but almost all the closes, of the periods, which, as they are <lb/>
            observable and best understood, should be varied, lest they be <lb/>
            disapproved, either by the judgment of the understanding or <lb/>
            by the satiety of the ear. For the two or three feet towards <lb/>
            the conclusion are to be marked and noted, if the preceding <lb/>
            members of the sentence were not extremely short and <lb/>
            concise; and these last feet ought either to be trochees, cr <lb/>
            heroic feet, or those feet used alternately, or to consist of the <lb/>
            latter pæon, of which Aristotle approves, or, what is equal to <lb/>
            it, the cretic. An interchange of such feet will have these <lb/>
            good effects, that the audience will not be tired by an offen- <lb/>
            sive sameness, and that we shall not appear to make similar <lb/>
            endings on purpose. But if the famous Antipater of Sidon,1 <lb/>
            whom you, Catulus, very well remember, used to pour forth <lb/>
            extempore hexameter and other verses, in various numbers <lb/>
            and measures, and if practice had so much power in a man <lb/>
            of great ability and memory, that whenever he turned his <lb/>
            thoughts and inclinations upon verse, the words followed of <lb/>
            course, how much more easily shall we attain this facility in <lb/>
            oratory, when application and exercise are used !</p>
          <p>" Nor let any one wonder how the illiterate part of an <lb/>
            audience observe these things when they listen to a speech; <note type="footnote">1 Some of whose epigrams are to be seen in the Greek Anthology <lb/>
            He flourished about 100 B.C. </note> <pb n="390"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            since, in all other things, as well as in this, the force of nature is <lb/>
            great and extraordinary; for all men, by a kind of tacit sense, <lb/>
            without any art or reasoning, can form a judgment of what is <lb/>
            right and wrong in art and reasoning; and as they do this <lb/>
            with regard to pictures, statues, and other works, for under- <lb/>
            standing which they have less assistance from nature, so <lb/>
            they display this faculty much more in criticising words, <lb/>
            numbers, and sounds of language, because these powers are <lb/>
            inherent in our common senses, nor has nature intended that <lb/>
            any person should be utterly destitute of judgment in these <lb/>
            particulars. All people are accordingly moved, not only by <lb/>
            words artfully arranged, but also by numbers and the sounds <lb/>
            of the voice. How few are those that understand the science <lb/>
            of numbers and measures ! yet if in these the smallest offence <lb/>
            be given by an actor, so that any sound is made too short by <lb/>
            contraction, or too long by extension, whole theatres burst <lb/>
            into exclamations. Does not the same thing also happen with <lb/>
            regard to musical notes, that not only whole sets and bands <lb/>
            of musicians are turned out by the multitude and the populace <lb/>
            for varying one from another, but even single performers for <lb/>
            playing out of tune ?</p>
          <p>LI. “ It is wonderful, when there is a wide interval of dis- <lb/>
            tinction betwixt the learned and illiterate in acting, how little <lb/>
            difference there is in judging for art, being derived from <lb/>
            nature, appears to have effected nothing at all if it does not <lb/>
            move and delight nature. And there is nothing which so <lb/>
            naturally affects our minds as numbers and the harmony of <lb/>
            sounds, by which we are excited, and inflamed, and soothed, <lb/>
            and thrown into a state of languor, and often moved to cheer- <lb/>
            fulness or sorrow; the most exquisite power of which is best <lb/>
            suited to poetry and music, and was not, as it seems to me, <lb/>
            undervalued by our most learned monarch Numa and our <lb/>
            ancestors, (as the stringed and wind instruments at the sacred <lb/>
            banquets and the verses of the Salii sufficiently indicate,) but <lb/>
            was most cultivated in ancient Greece; [concerning whicH <lb/>
            subjects, and similar ones, I could wish that you had chosen <lb/>
            to discourse, rather than about these puerile verbal meta- <lb/>
            phors!]2 But as the common people notice where there is <note type="footnote"> 1 See Cic. Brut. c. 49. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The words in brackets are condemned as spurious by all the recent <lb/>

            anything faulty in a verse, so they are sensible of any lame- <lb/>
            ness in our language; but they grant the poet no pardon; to <lb/>
            us they show some indulgence; but all tacitly discern that <lb/>
            what we have uttered has not its peculiar propriety and finish. <lb/>
            The speakers of old, therefore, as we see some do at the present <lb/>
            day, when they were unable to complete a circuit and, as it <lb/>
            were, roundness of period, (for that is what we have recently <lb/>
            begun, indeed, either to effect or attempt,) spoke in clauses <lb/>
            consisting of three, or two words, or sometimes uttered only a <lb/>
            single word at a time; and yet in that infancy of our tongue <lb/>
            they understood the natural gratification which the human <lb/>
            cars required, and even studied that what they spoke should <lb/>
            be expressed in correspondent phrases, and that they should <lb/>
            take breath at equal intervals.</p>
          <p>LII. “ I have now shown, as far as I could, what I deemed <lb/>
            most conducive to the embellishment of language; for I have <lb/>
            spoken of the merits of single words; I have spoken of them <lb/>
            in composition; I have spoken of the harmony of numbers <lb/>
            and structure. But if you wish me to speak also of the form <lb/>
            and, as it were, complexion of eloquence, there is one sort <lb/>
            which has a fulness, but is free from tumour; one which is <lb/>
            plain, but not without nerve and vigour; and one which, par- <lb/>
            ticipating of both these kinds, is commended for a certain <lb/>
            middle quality. In each of these three forms there ought to <lb/>
            be a peculiar complexion of beauty, not produced by the <lb/>
            daubing of paint, but diffused throughout the system by the <lb/>
            blood. Then, finally,1 this orator of ours is so to be finished <lb/>
            as to his style and thoughts in general, that, as those who <lb/>
            study fencing and polite exercises, not only think it necessary <lb/>
            to acquire a skill in parrying and striking, but also grace <lb/>
            and elegance of motion, so he may use such words as are <lb/>
            suited to elegant and graceful composition, and such thoughts <lb/>
            as contribute to the impressiveness of language. Words and <lb/>
            thoughts are formed in almost innumerable ways; as is, I am <lb/>
            suro, well known to you; but betwixt the formation of words <lb/>
            and that of thoughts there is this difference, that that of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Turn denique. Ellendt incloses tum in brackets, and thinks that <lb/>
            much of the language of the rest of the chapter is confused and in- <lb/>
            correct. The words ut ii, qui in armorum tractatione versantur, which <lb/>
            occur a little below, and which are generally condemned, are not <lb/>
            translated. </note> <pb n="392"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            words is destroyed if you change them, that of the thoughts <lb/>
            remains, whatever words you think proper to use. But I <lb/>
            think that you ought to be reminded (although, indeed, you <lb/>
            net agreeably to what I say) that you should not imagine <lb/>
            there is anything else to be done by the orator, at least any- <lb/>
            thing else to produce a striking and admirable effect, than <lb/>
            to observe these three rules with regard to single words; to <lb/>
            use frequently metaphorical ones, sometimes new ones, and <lb/>
            rarely very old ones.</p>
          <p>" But with regard to continuous composition, when we <lb/>
            have acquired that smoothness of junction and harmony of <lb/>
            numbers which I have explained; our whole style of oratory <lb/>
            is to be distinguished and frequently interspersed with bril- <lb/>
            liant lights, as it were, of thoughts and of words. LIII. For <lb/>
            the dwelling on a single circumstance has often a considerable <lb/>
            effect; and a clear illustration and exhibition of matters to <lb/>
            the eye of the audience, almost as if they were transacted <lb/>
            before them. This has wonderful influence in giving a re- <lb/>
            presentation of any affair, both to illustrate what is repre- <lb/>
            sented, and to amplify it, so that the point which we amplify <lb/>
            may appear to the audience to be really as great as the powers <lb/>
            of our language can represent it. Opposed to this is rapid <lb/>
            transition over a thing, which may often be practised. There <lb/>
            is also signification that more is to be understood than you <lb/>
            have expressed; distinct and concise brevity ; and extenuation, <lb/>
            and, what borders upon this, ridicule, not very different from <lb/>
            that which was the object of Cæsar's instructions; and di- <lb/>
            gression from the subject, and when gratification has thus <lb/>
            been afforded, the return to the subject ought to be happy <lb/>
            and elegant; proposition of what you are about to say, transi- <lb/>
            tion from what has been said, and retrogression; there is <lb/>
            repetition; apt conclusion of reasoning; exaggeration, or sur- <lb/>
            passing of the truth, for the sake of amplification or diminu- <lb/>
            tion; interrogation, and, akin to this, as it were, consultation <lb/>
            or seeming inquiry, followed by the delivery of your own <lb/>
            opinion; and dissimulation, the humour of saying one thing <lb/>
            and signifying another, which steals into the minds of men in <lb/>
            a peculiar manner, and which is extremely pleasing when it is <lb/>
            well managed, not in a vehement strain of language, but it. <lb/>
            a conversational style; also doubt; and distribution; and <lb/>
            correction of yourself, either before or after you have said <pb n="393"/>
             <note type="margin">C. LIV.] </note> <lb/>
            a. thing, or when you repel anything from your self; there <lb/>
            is also premunition, with regard to what you are going to <lb/>
            prove; there is the transference of blame to another person; <lb/>
            there is communication, or consultation, as it were, with the <lb/>
            audience before whom you are speaking; imitation of manners <lb/>
            and character, either with names of persons or without, which <lb/>
            is a great ornament to a speech, and adapted to conciliate the <lb/>
            feelings even in the utmost degree, and often also to rouse <lb/>
            them; the introduction of fictitious characters, the most height- <lb/>
            ened figure of exaggeration; there is description; falling into <lb/>
            a wilful mistake; excitement of the audience to cheerfulness; <lb/>
            anticipation; comparison and example, two figures which <lb/>
            have a very great effect; division; interruption; contention;1 <lb/>
            suppression; commendation; a certain freedom and even un- <lb/>
            controlledness of language, for the purpose of exaggeration; <lb/>
            anger; reproach; promise; deprecation; beseeching; slight devia- <lb/>
            tion from your intended course, but not like digression, which <lb/>
            I mentioned before; expurgation; conciliation; attack; wishing; <lb/>
            execration. Such are the figures with which thoughts give <lb/>
            lustre to a speech.</p>
          <p>LIV. " Of words themselves, as of arms, there is a sort of <lb/>
            threatening and attack for use, and also a management for <lb/>
            grace. For the reiteration of words has sometimes a peculiar <lb/>
            force, and sometimes elegance; as well as the valuation or <lb/>
            deflexion of a word from its common signification; and the <lb/>
            frequent repetition of the same word in the beginning, and <lb/>
            recurrence to it at the end, of a period; forcible emphasis on <lb/>
            the same words; conjunction;2 adjunction;3 progression,4 a sort <lb/>

            that you have poured forth to us without any definitions or <lb/>
            examples, because you imagined us acquainted with them." <lb/>
            " I did not, indeed," said Crassus, " suppose that any of the <lb/>
            things which I previously mentioned were new to you, but <lb/>
            acted merely in obedience to the inclinations of the whole <lb/>

            mental parts of oratory are, if not illustrated, at least pointed <lb/>
            out, let us now consider what is meant by propriety, that is, <lb/>
            what is most becoming, in oratory. It is, however, clear that <lb/>
            no single kind of style can be adapted to every cause, or every <lb/>
            audience, or every person, or every occasion. For capital <lb/>
            causes require one style of speaking, private and inferior <lb/>
            causes another; deliberations require one kind of oratory, <lb/>
            panegyric another, judicial proceedings another, common con- <lb/>
            versation another, consolation another, reproof another, dis- <lb/>
            putation another, historical narrative another. It is of conse- <lb/>
            quence also to consider who form the audience, whether the <lb/>
            senate, or the people, or the judges; whether it is a large or a <lb/>
            small assembly, or a single person, and of what character; it <lb/>
            ought to be taken into account, too, who the speakers them- <lb/>
            selves are, of what age, rank, and authority; and the time <lb/>
            also, whether it be one of peace or war, of hurry or leisure. <lb/>
            On this head, therefore, no direction seems possible to be <lb/>
            given but this, that we adopt a character of style, fuller, <lb/>
            plainer, or middling,1 suited to the subject on which we are to <lb/>
            speak; the same ornaments we may use almost constantly, but <lb/>
            sometimes in a higher, sometimes in a lower strain; and it is <lb/>
            the part of art and nature to be able to do what is becoming <lb/>
            on every occasion; to know what is becoming, and when, is an <lb/>
            aflair of judgment.</p>
          <p>LVI. " But all these parts of oratory succeed according as <lb/>
            they are delivered. Delivery, I say, has the sole and supreme <lb/>
            power in oratory; without it, a speaker of the highest mental <lb/>
            capacity can be held in no esteem; while one of moderate <lb/>
            abilities, with this qualification, may surpass even those of <lb/>
            the highest talent. To this Demosthenes is said to have <lb/>
            assigned the first place, when he was asked what was the chief <lb/>
            requisite in eloquence; to this the second, and to this the <lb/>
            third. For this reason, I am wont the more to admire what <lb/>
            was said by Æschines, who, when he had retired from Athens, <lb/>
            on account of the disgrace of having lost his cause, and <lb/>
            betaken himself to Rhodes, is reported to have read, at the <lb/>
            entreaty of the Rhodians, that excellent oration which he had <lb/>
            spoken against Ctesiphon, in opposition to Demosthenes; and <lb/>
            when he had concluded it, he was asked to read, next day <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare c. 52 init. </note> <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            that also which had been published by Demosthenes on the <lb/>
            other side in favour of Ctesiphon; and when he had read this <lb/>
            too in a most pleasing and powerful tone of voice, and all <lb/>
            expressed their admiration, How much more would you have <lb/>
            admired it, said he, if you had heard him deliver it himself I <lb/>
            By this remark, he sufficiently indicated how much depends <lb/>
            on delivery, as he thought the same speech would appear <lb/>
            different if the speaker were changed. What was it in Grac- <lb/>
            chus,—whom you, Catulus, remember better,-that was so <lb/>
            highly extolled when I was a boy ? Whither shall I, unhappy <lb/>
            wretch, betake myself ? Whither shall I turn ? To the Capitol ? <lb/>
            But that is drenched with the blood of my brother ! Or to my <lb/>
            home, that I may see my distressed and afflicted mother in all <lb/>
            the agony of lamentation ? These words, it was allowed, were <lb/>
            uttered by him with such delivery, as to countenance, voice, <lb/>
            and gesture, that his very enemies could not restrain their <lb/>
            tears. I dwell the longer on these particulars, because the <lb/>
            orators, who are the deliverers of truth itself, have neglected <lb/>
            this whole department, and the players, who are only the <lb/>
            imitators of truth, have taken possession of it.</p>
          <p>LVII. " In everything, without doubt, truth has the ad- <lb/>
            vantage over imitation; and if truth were efficient enough in <lb/>
            delivery of itself, we should certainly have no need for the aid <lb/>
            of art. But as that emotion of mind, which ought to be <lb/>
            chiefly expressed or imitated in delivery, is often so confused <lb/>
            as to be obscured and almost overwhelmed, the peculiarities <lb/>
            which throw that veil over it are to be set aside, and such as <lb/>
            are eminent and conspicuous to be selected. For every emo- <lb/>
            tion of the mind has from nature its own peculiar look, tone, <lb/>
            and gesture; and the whole frame of a man, and his whole <lb/>
            countenance, and the variations of his voice, sound1 like strings <lb/>
            in a musical instrument, just as they are moved by the affec- <lb/>
            tions of the mind. For the tones of the voice, like musical <lb/>
            chords, are so wound up as to be responsive to every touch, <lb/>
            sharp, flat, quick, slow, loud, gentle; and yet, among all these, <lb/>
            each in its kind has its own middle tone. From these tones, <lb/>
            too, are derived many other sorts, as the rough, the smooth, <lb/>
            the contracted, the broad, the protracted, and interrupted) <note type="footnote">1 Sonant. As this word does not properly apply to vultus, the coun' <lb/>

            the broken and divided, the attenuated and inflated, with <lb/>
            varieties of modulation; for there is none of these, or those <lb/>
            that resemble them, which may not be influenced by art and <lb/>
            management; and they are presented to the orator, as colours <lb/>
            to the painter, to produce variety.</p>
          <p>LVIII. " Anger, for instance, assumes a particular tone of <lb/>
            voice, acute, vehement, and with frequent breaks : <lb/>
            My impious brother drives me on, ah wretched ! <lb/>
            To tear my children with my teeth! !1 <lb/>
            and in those lines which you, Antonius, cited awhile ago <lb/>
            Have you, then, dared to separate him from you ? <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Does any one perceive this ? Bind him <lb/>
            and almost the whole tragedy of Atreus. But lamentation <lb/>
            and bewailing assumes another tone, flexible, full, interrupted, <lb/>
            in a voice of sorrow: as, <lb/>
            Whither shall I now turn myself? what road <lb/>
            Shall I attempt to tread ? Home to my father, <lb/>
            Or go to Pelias' daughters ? 3— <lb/>
            and this, <lb/>
            0 father, 0 my country, House of Prism ! <lb/>
            and that which follows, <lb/>
            All these did I behold enwrapt in flames, <lb/>
            And life from Priam torn by violence.* <lb/>
            Fear has another tone, desponding, hesitating, abject: <lb/>
            In many ways am I encompass'd round I <lb/>
            By sickness, exile, want. And terror drives <lb/>
            All judgment from my breast, deprived of sense ! <lb/>
            One threats my life with torture and destruction, <lb/>
            And no man has so firm a soul, such boldness, <lb/>
            But that his blood shrinks backward, and his look <lb/>
            Grows pale with timid fear.5</p>
          <p>Violence has another tone, strained, vehement, impetuous, <lb/>
            with a kind of forcible excitement: <note type="footnote"> 1 From the Atreus of Accius, whence also the next quotation but <lb/>

            Bring forth her latest offspring, Polydore.</p>
          <p>LIX. " On all these emotions a proper gesture ought to <lb/>
            attend; not the gesture of the stage, expressive of mere <lb/>
            words, but one showing the whole force and meaning of <lb/>
            a passage, not by gesticulation, but by emphatic delivery, by <lb/>
            a strong and manly exertion of the lungs, not imitated from <lb/>
            the theatre and the players, but rather from the camp and <lb/>
            the palæstra. The action of the hand should not be too <lb/>
            affected,3 but following the words rather than, as it were, <lb/>
            expressing them by mimicry; the arm should be considerably <lb/>
            extended, as one of the weapons of oratory; the stamping <lb/>
            of the foot should be used only in the most vehement efforts, <lb/>
            at their commencement or conclusion. But all depends on <lb/>
            the countenance; and even in that the eyes bear sovereign <lb/>
            sway; and therefore the oldest of our countrymen showed <lb/>
            the more judgment in not applauding even Roscius himself <lb/>
            to any great degree when he performed in a mask; for all the <lb/>
            powers of action proceed from the mind, and the countenance <lb/>
            is the image of the mind, and the eyes are its interpreters. <lb/>

            display as infinite a number of significations and changes, aa <lb/>
            there is of emotions in the soul; nor can any speaker pro- <lb/>
            duce the same effect with his eyes shut,1 as with them open. <lb/>
            Theophrastus indeed has told us, that a certain Tauriscus <lb/>
            used to say, that a player who pronounced his part gazing <lb/>
            on any particular object was like one who turned his back <lb/>
            on the audience.2 Great care in managing the eyes is there- <lb/>
            fore necessary; for the appearance of the features is not to <lb/>
            be too much varied, lest we fall into some absurdity or dis- <lb/>
            tortion. It is the eyes, by whose intense or languid gaze, as <lb/>
            well as by their quick glances and gaiety, we indicate <lb/>
            the workings of our mind with a peculiar aptitude to the <lb/>
            tenor of our discourse; for action is, as it were, the speech <lb/>
            of the body, and ought therefore the more to accord with <lb/>
            that of the soul. And Nature has given eyes to us, to declare <lb/>
            our internal emotions, as she has bestowed a mane, tail, and <lb/>
            ears on the horse and the lion. For these reasons, in our <lb/>
            oratorical action, the countenance is next in power to the <lb/>
            voice, and is influenced by the motion of the eyes. But in <lb/>
            everything appertaining to action there is a certain force <lb/>
            bestowed by Nature herself; and it is by action accordingly <lb/>
            that the illiterate, the vulgar, and even barbarians themselves, <lb/>
            are principally moved. For words move none but those who <lb/>
            are associated in a participation of the same language; and <lb/>
            sensible thoughts often escape the understandings of senseless <lb/>
            men; but action, which by its own powers displays the <lb/>
            movements of the soul, affects all mankind; for the minds <lb/>
            of all men are excited by the same emotions, which they <lb/>
            recognise in others, and indicate in themselves, by the same <lb/>
            tokens.</p>
          <p>LX. " To effectiveness and excellence in delivery the voice <lb/>
            doubtless contributes most; the voice, I say, which, in its <lb/>
            full strength, must be the chief object of our wishes; and <lb/>
            next, whatever strength of voice we have, to cherish it. On <lb/>
            this point, how we are to assist the voice has nothing to do <lb/>
            with precepts of this kind, though, for my part, I think that <lb/>
            we should assist it to the utmost. But it seems not un- <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow Ellendt in reading connivens, instead of contuens. the com- <lb/>

            suitable to the purport of my present remarks, to observe, as <lb/>
            I observed a little while ago, ' that in most things what is <lb/>
            most useful is, I know not how, the most becoming;' for <lb/>
            nothing is more useful for securing power of voice, than the <lb/>
            frequent variation of it; nothing more pernicious than an <lb/>
            immoderate straining of it without intermission. And what <lb/>
            is more adapted to delight the ear, and produce agreeableness <lb/>
            of delivery, than change, variety, and alteration of tone? <lb/>
            Caius Gracchus, accordingly, (as you may hear, Catulus, <lb/>
            from your client Licinius, a man of letters, whom Gracchus <lb/>
            formerly had for his amanuensis,) used to have a skilful <lb/>
            person with an ivory pitch-pipe, to stand concealed behind <lb/>
            him when he made a speech, and who was in an instant to <lb/>
            sound such a note as might either excite him from too <lb/>
            languid a tone, or recal him from one too elevated." " I <lb/>
            have heard this before," said Catulus, " and have often <lb/>
            admired the diligence of that great man, as well as his <lb/>
            learning and knowledge." "And I, too," said Crassus; "and <lb/>
            am grieved that men of such talents should fall into such <lb/>
            miscarriages with regard to the commonwealth; although <lb/>
            the same web is still being woven;l and such a state of <lb/>
            manners is advancing in the country, and held out to pos- <lb/>
            terity, that we now desire to have citizens such as our lathers <lb/>
            would not tolerate." " Forbear, Crassus, I entreat you," in- <lb/>
            terposed Cæsar, " from this sort of conversation, and go back <lb/>
            to Gracchus's pitch-pipe, of which I do not yet clearly under- <lb/>
            stand the object."</p>
          <p>LXI. " There is in every voice," continued Crassus, "a <lb/>
            certain middle key; but in each particular voice that key is <lb/>
            peculiar. For the voice to ascend gradually from this key <lb/>
            is advantageous and pleasing; since to bawl at the beginning <lb/>
            of a speech is boorish, and gradation is salutary in strength- <lb/>
            ening the voice. There is also a certain extreme in the <lb/>
            highest pitch, (which, however, is lower than the shrillest cry,) <lb/>
            to which the pipe will not allow you to ascend, but will recal <lb/>
            you from too strained an effort of voice. There is also, on <lb/>
            the other hand, an extreme in the lowest notes, to which, as <lb/>
            oeing of a full sound, we by degrees descend. This variety <lb/>
            and this gradual progression of the voice throughout all the <lb/>
            notes, will preserve its powers, and add agreeableness to deli- <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the state of the republic at that time, seci. 7, Ellendt </note> <pb n="401"/>

            very. But you will leave the piper at home, and carry with <lb/>
            you into the forum merely the intention of the custom.</p>
          <p>" I have said what I could, though not as I wished, but as <lb/>
            the shortness of the time obliged me; for it is wise to lay the <lb/>
            blame upon the time, when you cannot add more even if you <lb/>
            desired." "But," said Catulus, "you have, as far as I can <lb/>
            judge, brought together everything upon the subject, and <lb/>
            that in so excellent a manner, that you seem not to have <lb/>
            received instructions in the art from the Greeks, but to be <lb/>
            able to instruct the Greeks themselves. I rejoice that I have <lb/>
            been present at your conversation; and could wish that my <lb/>
            son-in-law, your friend Hortensius,l had also been present; <lb/>
            who, I trust, will excel in all those good qualities of which you <lb/>
            have treated in this dissertation." " Will excel!" exclaimed <lb/>
            Crassus; "I consider that he already excels. I had that <lb/>
            opinion of him when he pleaded, in my consulship, the cause <lb/>
            of Africa2 in the senate; and I found myself still more coil- <lb/>
            firmed in it lately, when he spoke for the king of Bithynia. <lb/>
            You judge rightly, therefore, Catulus; for I am convinced <lb/>
            that nothing is wanting to that young man, on the part <lb/>
            either of nature or of learning. You, therefore, Cotta, and <lb/>
            you, Sulpicius, must exert the greater vigilance and industry; <lb/>
            for he is no ordinary orator, who is springing up to rival <lb/>
            those of your age; but one of a penetrating genius, and an <lb/>
            ardent attachment to study, of eminent learning, and of <lb/>
            singular powers of memory; but, though he is a favourite of <lb/>
            mine, I only wish him to excel those of his own standing; <lb/>
            for to desire that he, who is so much younger,8 should outstrip <lb/>
            you, is hardly fair. But let us now arise, and refresh our- <lb/>
            selves, and at length relieve our minds and attention from <lb/>

          <p>Tuis treatise was the fruit of Cicero's retirement, during the remains <lb/>
            of the civil war in Africa, and was composed in the form of a <lb/>
            dialogue. It contains a few short, but very masterly sketches of all <lb/>
            the speakers who had flourished either in Greece or Rome, with any <lb/>
            reputation of eloquence, down to his own time ; and as he generally <lb/>
            touches the principal incidents of their lives, it will be considered, <lb/>
            by an attentive reader, as a concealed epitome of the Roman history. <lb/>
            The conference is supposed to have been held with Atticus, and their <lb/>
            common friend Brutus, in Cicero's garden at Rome, under the statue <lb/>
            of Plato, whom he always admired, and usually imitated in his <lb/>
            Dialogues.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN I had left Cilicia, and arrived at Rhodes, word was <lb/>
            brought me of the death of Hortensius. I was more affected <lb/>
            with it than, I believe, was generally expected; for, by the <lb/>
            loss of my friend, I saw myself for ever deprived of the <lb/>
            pleasure of his acquaintance, and of our mutual intercourse <lb/>
            A good offices. I likewise reflected, with concern, that the <lb/>
            dignity of our college must suffer greatly by the decease of <lb/>
            such an eminent augur. This reminded me that he was the <lb/>
            person who first introduced me to the college, where he <lb/>
            attested my qualification upon oath, and that it was he also <lb/>
            who installed me as a member; so that I was bound by the <lb/>
            constitution of the order to respect and honour him as a <lb/>
            parent. My affliction was increased, that, in such a deplorable <lb/>
            dearth of wise and virtuous citizens, this excellent man, my <lb/>
            faithful associate in the service of the public, expired at the <lb/>
            very time when the commonwealth could least spare him, and <lb/>
            when we had the greatest reason to regret the want of his <lb/>
            prudence and authority. I can add, very sincerely, that in <lb/>
            him I lamented the loss, not (as most people imagined) of a <lb/>
            dangerous rival who opposed my reputation, but of a generous <lb/>
            associate who engaged with me in the pursuit of fame. For <lb/>
            if we have instances in history, though in studies of less <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            importance, that some distinguished poets have been greatly <lb/>
            afllicted at the death of their contemporary bards, with what <lb/>
            tender concern should I honour the memory of a man with <lb/>
            whom it is more glorious to have disputed the prize of <lb/>
            eloquence, than never to have combated as an antagonist, <lb/>
            especially as he was always so far from obstructing my endea- <lb/>
            vours, or I his, that, on the contrary, we mutually assisted <lb/>
            each other with our credit and advice ! But as he, who had a <lb/>
            perpetual run of felicity,1 left the world at a happy moment <lb/>
            for himself, though a most unfortunate one for his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens,-and died when it would have been much easier for <lb/>
            him to lament the miseries of his country than to assist it, <lb/>
            after living in it as long as he could have lived with honour <lb/>
            and reputation,—we may, indeed, deplore his death as a <lb/>
            heavy loss to us who survive him. If, however, we consider <lb/>
            it merely as a personal event, we ought rather to congra- <lb/>
            tulate his fate than to pity it; that, as often as we revive the <lb/>
            memory of this illustrious and truly happy man, we may <lb/>
            appear at least to have as much affection for him as for our- <lb/>
            selves. For if we only lament that we are no longer permitted <lb/>
            to enjoy him, it must, indeed, be acknowledged that this is a <lb/>
            heavy misfortune to us; which it however becomes us to <lb/>
            support with moderation, lest our sorrow should be suspected <lb/>
            to arise from motives of interest, and not from friendship. <lb/>
            But if we afflict ourselves, on the supposition that he was the <lb/>
            sufferer, we misconstrue an event, which to him was certainly. <lb/>
            a very happy one.</p>
          <p>II. If Hortensius were now living, he would probably regret <lb/>
            many other advantages in common with his worthy fellow- <lb/>
            citizens. But when he beheld the forum, the great theatre in <lb/>
            which he used to exercise his genius, no longer accessible to <lb/>
            that accomplished eloquence which could charm the ears of a <lb/>
            Roman or a Grecian audience, he must have felt a pang cf <lb/>
            which none, or at least but few, besides himself could be <lb/>
            susceptible. Even I indulge heartfelt anguish, when I behold <lb/>
            my country no longer supported by the talents, the wisdom, <lb/>
            and the authority of law,—the only weapons which I have <note type="footnote"> 1 Quoniam perpetud quddam felicitate usus ille, cessit è vitd, suo magis <lb/>
            quam suorum, civium tempore. This fine sentiment, conveyed in such <lb/>
            elegant language, carries an allusion to the conversation of Solon <lb/>
            with Crœsus, in which the former maintained the seeming paradox, <lb/>
            that he alone can be deemed happy who meets a happy death. See <lb/>
            Herod. Clio, 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            earned to wield, and to which I have long been accustomed, <lb/>
            and which are most suitable to the character of an illustrious <lb/>
            citizen, and of a virtuous and well-regulated state. But if <lb/>
            there ever was a time when the authority and eloquence of an <lb/>
            honest individual could have wrested their arms from the <lb/>
            hands of his distracted fellow-citizens, it was then when the <lb/>
            proposal of a compromise of our mutual differences was <lb/>
            rejected, by the hasty imprudence of some and the timorous <lb/>
            mistrust of others. Thus it happened, among other mis- <lb/>
            fortunes of a more deplorable nature, that when my declining <lb/>
            age, after a life spent in the service of the public, should have <lb/>
            reposed in the peaceful harbour, not of an indolent and <lb/>
            total inactivity, but of a moderate and honourable retirement, <lb/>
            and when my eloquence was properly mellowed and had <lb/>
            acquired its full maturity;—thus it happened, I say, that <lb/>
            recourse was then had to those fatal arms, which the persons <lb/>
            who had learned the use of them in honourable conquest <lb/>
            could no longer employ to any salutary purpose. Those, <lb/>
            therefore, appear to me to have enjoyed a fortunate and <lb/>
            happy life, (of whatever state they were members, but <lb/>
            especially in ours,) who, together with their authority and <lb/>
            reputation, either for their military or political services, are <lb/>
            allowed to enjoy the advantages of philosophy; and the sole <lb/>
            remembrance of them, in our present melancholy situation, <lb/>
            was a pleasing relief to me, when we lately happened to <lb/>
            mention them in the course of conversation.</p>
          <p>III. For, not long ago, when I was walking for my amuse- <lb/>
            ment in a private avenue at home, I was agreeably interrupted <lb/>
            by my friend Brutus and Titus Pomponius, who came, as indeed <lb/>
            they frequently did, to visit me,—two worthy citizens, who <lb/>
            were united to each other in the closest friendship, and were <lb/>
            so dear and so agreeable to me, that on the first sight of them, <lb/>
            all my anxiety for the commonwealth subsided. After the <lb/>
            usual salutations, " Well, gentlemen," said I, "how go the <lb/>
            times? What news have you brought?" "None," replied <lb/>
            Brutus, " that you would wish to hear, or that I can venture <lb/>
            to tell you for truth." "No," said Atticus; "we are come <lb/>
            with an intention that all matters of state should be dropped, <lb/>
            and rather to hear something from you, than to say anything <lb/>
            which might serve to distress you." " Indeed," said I, " your <lb/>
            company is a present remedy for my sorrow; and your letters, <lb/>
            when absent, were so encouraging, that they first revived <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            my attention to my studies." " I remember," replied Atticus, <lb/>
            " that Brutus sent you a letter from Asia, which I read with <lb/>
            infinite pleasure; for he advised you in it like a man of sense, <lb/>
            and gave you every consolation which the warmest friendship <lb/>
            could suggest." " True," said I; " for it was the receipt of <lb/>
            that letter which recovered me from a growing indisposition, <lb/>
            to behold once more the cheerful face of day; and as the <lb/>
            Roman state, after the dreadful defeat near Cannæ, first raised <lb/>
            its drooping head by the victory of Marcellus at Nola, which <lb/>
            was succeeded by many other victories, so, after the dismal <lb/>
            wreck of our affairs, both public and private, nothing occurred <lb/>
            to me, before the letter of my friend Brutus, which I thought <lb/>
            to be worth my attention, or which contributed, in any <lb/>
            degree, to ease the anxiety of my heart." " That was certainly <lb/>
            my intention," answered Brutus; " and if I had the happiness <lb/>
            to succeed, I was sufficiently rewarded for my trouble. But <lb/>
            I could wish to be informed what you received from Atticus, <lb/>
            which gave you such uncommon pleasure." " That," said I, <lb/>
            " which not only entertained me, but I hope has restored me <lb/>
            entirely to myself." " Indeed !" replied he; "and what mi- <lb/>
            raculous composition could that be ?" " Nothing," answered <lb/>
            I, " could have been a more acceptable or a more seasonable <lb/>
            present than that excellent treatise of his, which roused me <lb/>
            from a state of languor and despondency." " You mean; <lb/>
            said he, " his short and, I think, very accurate abridgement <lb/>
            of universal history." " The very same," said I; " for that <lb/>
            little treatise has absolutely saved me."</p>
          <p>IV. "I am heartily glad of it," said Atticus; " but what <lb/>
            could you discover in it which was either new to you or so won- <lb/>
            derfully beneficial as you pretend?" " It certainly furnished <lb/>
            many hints," said I, " which were entirely new to me; and <lb/>
            the exact order of time which you observed through the <lb/>
            whole, gave me the opportunity I had long wished for, of <lb/>
            beholding the history of all nations in one regular and com- <lb/>
            prehensive view. The attentive perusal of it proved an excel- <lb/>
            lent remedy for my sorrows, and led me to think of attempt- <lb/>
            ing something on your own plan, partly to amuse myself, and <lb/>
            partly to return your favour by a grateful, though not an <lb/>
            equal, acknowledgment. We are commanded, it is true, in <lb/>
            that precept of Hesiod, so much admired by the learned, to <lb/>
            return with the same measure we have received, or, if possible, <lb/>
            with a larger. As to a friendly inclination, I shall certainly <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            return you a fall proportion of it; but as to a recompense in <lb/>
            kind, I confess it to be out of my power, and therefore hope <lb/>
            you will excuse me; for I have not, as husbandmen are <lb/>
            accustomed to have, gathered a fresh harvest out of which to <lb/>
            repay the kindness1 I have received; my whole harvest having <lb/>
            sickened and died, for want of the usual manure; and as <lb/>
            little am I able to present you with anything from those <lb/>
            hidden stores which are now consigned to perpetual darkness, <lb/>
            and to which I am denied all access, though formerly I was <lb/>
            almost the only person who was able to command them at <lb/>
            pleasure. I must, therefore, try my skill in a long-neglected <lb/>
            and uncultivated soil; which I will endeavour to improve <lb/>
            with so much care, that I may be able to repay your liberality <lb/>
            with interest; provided my genius should be so happy as to <lb/>
            resemble a fertile field, which, after being suffered to lie fallow <lb/>
            a considerable time, produces a heavier crop than usual."</p>
          <p>" Very well," replied Atticus, " I shall expect the fulfilment <lb/>
            of your promise; but I shall not insist upon it till it suits <lb/>
            your convenience, though, after all, I shall certainly be better <lb/>
            pleased if you discharge the obligation." " And I also," said <lb/>
            Brutus, " shall expect that you perform your promise to my <lb/>
            friend Atticus; nay, though I am only his voluntary solicitor, <lb/>
            I shall, perhaps, be very pressing for the discharge of a debt <lb/>
            which the creditor himself is willing to submit to your own <lb/>
            choice." V. " But I shall refuse to pay you," said I, "unless <lb/>
            the original creditor takes no further part in the suit." " This <lb/>
            is more than I can promise," replied he; " for I can easily fore- <lb/>
            see that this easy man, who disclaims all severity, will urge <lb/>
            his demand upon you, not indeed to distress you, but yet <lb/>
            with earnestness and importunity." " To speak ingenuously," <lb/>
            said Atticus, " my friend Brutus, I believe, is not much mis- <lb/>
            taken ; for as I now find you in good spirits for the first time, <lb/>
            after a tedious interval of despondency, I shall soon make <lb/>
            bold to apply to you; and as this gentleman has promised his <lb/>
            assistance to recover what you owe me, the least I can do is <lb/>
            to solicit, in my turn, for what is due to him." " Explain <lb/>
            your meaning," said I. " I mean," replied he, " that you <lb/>
            must write something to amuse us; for your pen has been <note type="footnote">1 Non enim ex novis, ut agricolæ solent, fructibus est, unde tibi reddan <lb/>
            quod accepi. The allusion is to a farmer, who, in time of necessity, <lb/>
            borrows corn or fruit of his more opulent neighbour, which he repays <lb/>
            in kind as soon as his harvest is gathered home. Cicero was not, he <lb/>
            says, in a situation to make a similar return. </note> <lb/>

            totally silent this long time; and since your treatise on <lb/>
            politics, we have had nothing from you of any kind, though <lb/>
            it was the perusal of that which fired me with the ambition <lb/>
            to write an abridgement of universal history. But we shall, <lb/>
            however, leave you to answer this demand when and in what <lb/>
            manner you shall think most convenient. At present, if you <lb/>
            are not otherwise engaged, you must give us your sentiments <lb/>
            on a subject on which we both desire to be better informed." <lb/>
            "And what is that?" said I. " A work which you had just <lb/>
            begun," replied he, " when I saw you last at Tusculanum,- <lb/>
            the History of Eminent Orators,—when they made their ap- <lb/>
            pearance, and who and what they were; which furnished such <lb/>
            an agreeable train of conversation, that when I related the <lb/>
            substance of it to your, or I ought rather to have said our <lb/>
            common, friend Brutus, he expressed an ardent desire to hear <lb/>
            the whole of it from your own mouth. Knowing you, there- <lb/>
            fore, to be at leisure, we have taken the present opportunity <lb/>
            to wait upon you; so that, if it is really convenient, you will <lb/>
            oblige us both by resuming the subject." " Well, gentlemen," <lb/>
            said I, " as you are so pressing, I will endeavour to satisfy you <lb/>
            in the best manner I am able." " You are able enough," <lb/>
            replied he; " only unbend, or rather, if possible, set at full <lb/>
            liberty your mind." " If I remember right," said I, " Atticus. <lb/>
            what gave rise to the conversation was my observing that the <lb/>
            cause of Deiotarus, a most excellent sovereign and a faithful <lb/>
            ally, was pleaded by our friend Brutus, in my hearing, with <lb/>
            the greatest elegance and dignity."</p>
          <p>VI. "True," replied he; " and you took occasion, from the <lb/>
            ill-success of Brutus, to lament the loss of a fair administration <lb/>
            of justice in the forum." " I did so," answered I, " as indeed <lb/>
            I frequently do; and whenever I see you, my Brutus, I am <lb/>
            concerned to think where your wonderful genius, your finished <lb/>
            erudition, and unparalleled industry will find a theatre to <lb/>
            display themselves. For after you had thoroughly improved <lb/>
            your abilities, by pleading a variety of important causes, and <lb/>
            when my declining vigour was just giving way and lowering <lb/>
            the ensigns of dignity to your more active talents, the liberty <lb/>
            of the state received a fatal overthrow, and that eloquence, of <lb/>
            which we are now to give the history, was condemned to per- <lb/>
            petual silence." " Our other misfortuues," replied Brutus, " I <lb/>
            lament sincerely, and I think I ought to lament them; but as <lb/>
            to eloquence, I am not so fond of the influence and the glory <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            it bestows, as of the study and the practice of it, which <lb/>
            nothing can deprive me of, while you are so well disposed to <lb/>
            assist me; for no man can be an eloquent speaker who has <lb/>
            not a clear and ready conception. Whoever, therefore, applies <lb/>
            himself to the study of eloquence, is at the same time im- <lb/>
            proving his judgment, which is a talent equally necessary in <lb/>
            all military operations." " Your remark," said I, " is very <lb/>
            just; and I have a higher opinion of the merit of eloquence, <lb/>
            because, though there is scarcely any person so diffident as <lb/>
            not to persuade himself that he either has or may acquire <lb/>
            every other accomplishment which formerly could have given <lb/>
            him consequence in the state, I can find no person who has <lb/>
            been made an orator by the success of his military prowess. <lb/>
            But that we may carry on the conversation with greater ease, <lb/>
            let us seat ourselves." As my visitors had no objection to <lb/>
            this, we accordingly took our seats in a private lawn, near <lb/>
            a statue of Plato. Then resuming the conversation,—" To <lb/>
            recommend the study of'eloquence," said I, " and describe its <lb/>
            force, and the great dignity it confers upon those who have <lb/>
            acquired it, is neither our present design, nor has any neces- <lb/>
            sary connexion with it. But I will not hesitate to affirm, that <lb/>
            whether it is acquired by art or practice, or the mere powers <lb/>
            of nature, it is the most difficult of all attainments; for each <lb/>
            of the five branches of which it is said to consist, is of itself a <lb/>
            very important art; from whence it may easily be conjectured <lb/>
            how great and arduous must be the profession which unites <lb/>
            and comprehends them all.</p>
          <p>VII. " Greece alone is a sufficient witness of this; for though <lb/>
            she was fired with a wonderful love of eloquence, and has long <lb/>
            since excelled every other nation in the practice of it, yet she <lb/>
            had all the rest of the arts much earlier; and had not only <lb/>
            invented, but even completed them, a considerable time before <lb/>
            she was mistress of the full powers of elocution. But when I <lb/>
            direct my eyes to Greece, your beloved Athens, my Atticus, <lb/>
            first strikes my sight, and is the brightest object in my view; <lb/>
            for in that illustrious city the orator first made his appearance, <lb/>
            and it is there we shall find the earliest records of eloquence, <lb/>
            and the first specimens of a discourse conducted by rules of <lb/>
            art. But even in Athens there is not a single production <lb/>
            now extant which discovers any taste for ornament, or seems <lb/>
            to have been the effort of a real orator, before the time of <lb/>
            Pericles (whose name is prefixed to some orations which still <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            remain) and his contemporary Thucydides; who flourished, <lb/>
            not in the infancy of the state, but when it had arrived at <lb/>
            its full maturity of power. It is, however, supposed, that <lb/>
            Pisistratus, (who lived many years before,) together with Solon, <lb/>
            who was something older, and Clisthenes, who survived them <lb/>
            both, were very able speakers for the age they lived in. But <lb/>
            some years after these, as may be collected from the Attic <lb/>
            annals, came Themistocles, who is said to have been as <lb/>
            much distinguished by his eloquence as by his political abili- <lb/>
            ties; and after him the celebrated Pericles, who, though <lb/>
            adorned with every kind of excellence, was most admired <lb/>
            for his talents as a speaker. Cleon also, their contem- <lb/>
            porary, though a turbulent citizen, was allowed to be a <lb/>
            tolerable orator These were immediately succeeded by <lb/>
            Alcibiades, Critias, and Theramenes; the character of their <lb/>
            eloquence may be easily inferred from the writings of Thucy- <lb/>
            dides, who lived at the same time; their discourses were <lb/>
            nervous and stately, full of sententious remarks, and so exces- <lb/>
            sively concise as to be sometimes obscure.</p>
          <p>VIII. " But as soon as the force of a regular and well- <lb/>
            adjusted style was understood, a crowd of rhetoricians immedi- <lb/>
            ately appeared,-such as Gorgias the Leontine, Thrasymachus <lb/>
            the Chalcedonian, Protagoras the Abderite, and Hippias the <lb/>
            Elean, who were all held in great esteem,—:with many others <lb/>
            of the same age, who professed (it must be owned rather too <lb/>
            arrogantly) to teach their scholars how the worse might <lb/>
            be made, by the force of eloquence, to appear the better cause. <lb/>
            But these were openly opposed by Socrates, who, by a subtle <lb/>
            method of arguing peculiar to himself, took every opportunity <lb/>
            to refute the principles of their art. His instructive confer- <lb/>
            ences produced a number of intelligent men, and Philosophy <lb/>
            is said to have derived her birth from him; not the doctrine <lb/>
            of Physics, which was of an earlier date, but that Philosophy <lb/>
            which treats of men and manners, and of the nature of good <lb/>
            and evil. But as this is foreign to our present subject, <lb/>
            we must defer the philosophers to another opportunity, and <lb/>
            return to the orators, from whom I have ventured to make <lb/>
            a short digression. When the professors, therefore, above- <lb/>
            mentioned, were in the decline of life, Isocrates made his <lb/>
            appearance, whose house stood open to all Grecce as the <lb/>
            school of eloquence. He was an accomplished orator, and an <lb/>
            excellent teacher; though he did not display his talents in the <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            splendour of the forum, but cherished a:-d improved within <lb/>
            the walls of an obscure academy, that glory which, in my <lb/>
            opinion, no orator has since acquired. He composed many <lb/>
            valuable specimens of his art, and taught the principles of it <lb/>
            to others ; and not only excelled his predecessors in every part <lb/>
            of it, but first discovered that a certainr hythm and modu- <lb/>
            lation should be observed in prose, care being taken, however, <lb/>
            to avoid making verses. Before him, the artificial structure <lb/>
            and harmony of language was unknown ;-or, if there are any <lb/>
            traces of it to be discovered, they appear to have been made <lb/>
            without design; which, perhaps, will be thought a beauty; <lb/>
            but whatever it may be deemed, it was, in the present case, <lb/>
            the effect rather of native genius, or of accident, than of art <lb/>
            and observation. For Nature herself teaches us to close our <lb/>
            sentences within certain limits; and when they are thus con- <lb/>
            fined to a moderate flow of expression, they will frequently <lb/>
            have an harmonious cadence; for the ear alone can decide <lb/>
            what is full and complete, and what is deficient; and the <lb/>
            course of our language will necessarily be regulated by our <lb/>
            breath, in which it is excessively disagreeable, not only to fail, <lb/>
            but even to labour.</p>
          <p>IX. " After Isocrates came Lysias, who, though not personally <lb/>
            engaged in forensic causes, was a very accurate and elegant <lb/>
            composer, and such a one as you might almost venture to <lb/>
            pronounce a complete orator; for Demosthenes is the man <lb/>
            who approaches the character so nearly, that you may apply <lb/>
            it to him without hesitation. No keen, no artful turns could <lb/>
            have been contrived for the pleadings he has left behind him, <lb/>
            which he did not readily discover; nothing could have been <lb/>
            expressed with greater nicety, or more clearly and poignantly, <lb/>
            than it has been already expressed by him; and nothing <lb/>
            greater, nothing more rapid and forcible, nothing adorned <lb/>
            with a nobler elevation, either of language or sentiment, can <lb/>
            be conceived, than what is to be found in his orations. He <lb/>
            was soon rivalled by his contemporaries Hyperides, Æschines, <lb/>
            Lycurgus, Dinarchus, and Demades, (none of whose writings <lb/>
            are extant,) with many others that might be mentioned; for <lb/>
            this age was adorned with a profusion of good orators; and <lb/>
            to the end of this period appears to me to have flourished <lb/>
            that vigorous and blooming eloquence, which is distinguished <lb/>
            by a natural beauty of composition, without disguise or affec- <lb/>
            tation. When these orators were in the decline of life, they <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            were succeeded by Phalerens. then in the prime of youth. He <lb/>
            indeed surpassed them all in learning, but was fitter to <lb/>
            appear on the parade, than in the field; and, accordingly, he <lb/>
            rather pleased and entertained the Athenians, than inflamed <lb/>
            their passions; and marched forth into the dust and heat of <lb/>
            the forum, not from a weather-beaten tent, but from the shady <lb/>
            recesses of Theophrastus, a man of consummate erudition. <lb/>
            He was the first who relaxed the force of Eloquence, and gave <lb/>
            her a soft and tender air; and he rather chose to be agree- <lb/>
            able, as indeed he was, than great and striking; but agreeable <lb/>
            in such a manner as rather charmed, than warmed the mind of <lb/>
            the hearer. His greatest ambition was to impress his audience <lb/>
            with a high opinion of his elegance, and not, as Eupolis <lb/>
            relates of Pericles, to animate as well as to please.</p>
          <p>X. " You see, then, in the very city in which Eloquence <lb/>
            was born and nurtured, how'late it was before she grew to <lb/>
            maturity; for before the time of Solon and Pisistratus, we <lb/>
            meet with no one who is so much as mentioned as an able <lb/>
            speaker. These, indeed, if we compute by the Roman date, <lb/>
            may be reckoned very ancient: but if by that of the Athe- <lb/>
            nians, we shall find them to be moderns. For though they <lb/>
            flourished in the reign of Servius Tullius, Athens had then <lb/>
            subsisted much longer than Rome has at present. I have not, <lb/>
            nowever, the least doubt that the power of eloquence has <lb/>
            been always more or less conspicuous. For Homer, we may <lb/>
            suppose, would not have ascribed such superior talents of <lb/>
            elocution to Ulysses and Nestor, (one of whom he celebrates <lb/>
            for his force, and the other for his sweetness,) unless the art <lb/>
            of speaking had then been held in some esteem ; nor could the <lb/>
            poet himself have attained a style so finished, nor exhibited such <lb/>
            fine specimens of oratory, as we actually find in him. The <lb/>
            time, indeed, in which he lived is undetermined; but we are <lb/>
            certain that he flourished many years before Romulus, and a? <lb/>
            early at least as the elder1 Lycurgus, the legislator of the <lb/>
            Spartans. But a more particular attention to the art, and a <lb/>
            greater ability in the practice of it, may be observed in Pisis- <lb/>
            tratus. He was succeeded in the following century by The- <lb/>
            mistocles, who, according to the Roman date, was a person of <lb/>
            the remotest antiquity; but according to that of the Athe- <lb/>
            nians, he was almost a modern. For he lived when Greece <note type="footnote"> 1 Saperiorem. So called, as Orellius observes, to distinguish him <lb/>
            from Lycurgus the Athenian orator, mentioned in the preceding chapter- </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            was in the height of her power, and when the city of Rome <lb/>
            had but lately been emancipated from the shackles of regal <lb/>
            tyranny; for the dangerous war with the Volsci, who were <lb/>
            headed by Coriolanus (then a voluntary exile), happened nearly <lb/>
            at the same time as the Persian war; and we may add, that <lb/>
            the fate of both commanders was remarkably similar. Each <lb/>
            of them, after distinguishing himself as an excellent citizen, <lb/>
            being driven from his country by the insults of an ungrateful <lb/>
            people, went over to the enemy; and each of them repressed <lb/>
            the efforts of his resentment by a voluntary death. For <lb/>
            though you, my Atticns, have represented the death of Corio- <lb/>
            lanus in a different manner, you must pardon me if I do not <lb/>
            subscribe to the justness of your representation."</p>
          <p>XI. " You may use your pleasure," replied Atticus, with a <lb/>
            smile; " for it is the privilege of rhetoricians to exceed the <lb/>
            truth of history, that they may have an opportunity of em- <lb/>
            bellishing the fate of their heroes : and accordingly, Clitarchus <lb/>
            and Stratocles have entertained us with the same pretty <lb/>
            fiction about the death of Themistocles, which you have in- <lb/>
            vented for Coriolanus. Thucydides, indeed, who was himself <lb/>
            an Athenian of the highest rank and merit, and lived nearly <lb/>
            at the same time, has only informed us that he died, and was <lb/>
            privately buried in Attica, adding, that it was suspected by <lb/>
            some that he had poisoned himself. But these ingenious <lb/>
            writers have assured us, that, having slain a bull at the altar, <lb/>
            he caught the blood in a large bowl, and, drinking it off, fell <lb/>
            suddenly dead upon the ground. For this species of death <lb/>
            had a tragical air, and might be described with all the pomp <lb/>
            of rhetoric ; whereas the ordinary way of dying afforded no <lb/>
            opportunity for ornament. As it will, therefore, suit your <lb/>
            purpose, that Coriolanus should resemble Themistocles in <lb/>
            everything. I give you leave to introduce the fatal bowl; and <lb/>
            you may still farther heighten the catastrophe by a solemn <lb/>
            sacrifice, that Coriolanus may appear in all respects to have <lb/>
            been a second Themistocles." "I am much obliged to you," said <lb/>
            I, "for your courtesy; but, for the future, I shall be more <lb/>
            cautious in meddling with history when you are present; <lb/>
            whom I may justly commend as a most exact and scrupulous <lb/>
            relator of the Roman history; but nearly at the time we are <lb/>
            speaking of (though somewhat later) lived the above-men- <lb/>
            tioned Pericles, the illustrious son of Xantippus, who first <lb/>
            improved his eloq uence by the friendly aids of literature ;— <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            not that kind of literature which treats professedly of the art <lb/>
            of speaking, of which there was then no regular system; but <lb/>
            after he had studied under Anaxagoras, the naturalist, he <lb/>
            directed with alacrity his attention from abstruse and intricate <lb/>
            speculations to forensic and popular debates. All Athens was <lb/>
            charmed with the sweetness of his language, and not only <lb/>
            admired him for his fluency, but was awed by the superior <lb/>
            force and terrors of his eloquence.</p>
          <p>XII. " This age, therefore, which may be considered as the <lb/>
            infancy of the art, furnished Athens with an orator who almost <lb/>
            reached the summit of his profession; for an emulation <lb/>
            to shine in the forum is not usually found among a people <lb/>
            who are either employed in settling the form of their govern- <lb/>
            ment, or engaged in war, or struggling with difficulties, or <lb/>
            subjected to the arbitrary power of kings. Eloquence is the <lb/>
            attendant of peace, the companion of ease and prosperity, and <lb/>
            the tender offspring of a free and well-established constitu- <lb/>
            tion. Aristotle, therefore, informs us, that when the tyrants <lb/>
            were expelled from Sicily, and private property, after a long <lb/>
            interval of servitude, was secured by the administration of <lb/>
            justice, the Sicilians, Corax and Tisias, (for this people, in <lb/>
            general, were very quick and acute, and had a natural turn <lb/>
            for disquisition,) first attempted to write precepts on the art of <lb/>
            speaking. Before them, he says, no one spoke by prescribed <lb/>
            method, conformably to rules of art, though many discoursed <lb/>
            very sensibly, and generally from written notes ; but Prota- <lb/>
            goras took the pains to compose a number of dissertations, on <lb/>
            such leading and general topics as are now called common <lb/>
            places. Gorgias, he adds, did the same, and wrote panegyrics <lb/>
            and invectives on every subject; for he thought it was the <lb/>
            province of an orator to be able either to exaggerate, or <lb/>
            extenuate, as occasion might require. Antiphon the Rham- <lb/>
            nusian composed several essays of the same species; and <lb/>
            (according to Thucydides, a very respectable writer, who was <lb/>
            present to hear him) pleaded a capital cause in his own <lb/>
            defence, with as much eloquence as had ever yet been dis- <lb/>
            played by any man. But Lysias was the first who openly <lb/>
            professed the art ; and, after him, Theodorus, being better <lb/>
            versed in the theory than the practice of it, began to compose <lb/>
            orations for others to pronounce ; but confined to himself the <lb/>
            art of composing them. In the same manner, Isocrates at <lb/>
            first declined to teach the art, but wrote speeches for other <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            people to deliver ; on which account, being often prosecuted <lb/>
            for assisting, contrary to law, to circumvent one or another of <lb/>
            the parties in judgment, he left off composing orations for <lb/>
            other people, and wholly applied himself to prescribe rules, <lb/>
            and reduce them into a system.</p>
          <p>XIII. " Thus, then, we have traced the birth and origin of <lb/>
            the orators of Greece, who were, indeed, very ancient, as I have <lb/>
            before observed, if we compute by the Roman annals ; but of <lb/>
            a much later date, if we reckon by their own; for the Athe- <lb/>
            nian state had signalized itself by a variety of great exploits, <lb/>
            both at home and abroad, a considerable time before she <lb/>
            became enamoured of the charms of eloquence. But this <lb/>
            noble art was not common to Greece in general, but almost <lb/>
            peculiar to Athens. For who has ever heard of an Argive, a <lb/>
            Corinthian, or a Theban orator, at the times we are speaking <lb/>
            of ? unless, perhaps, some merit of the kind may be allowed <lb/>
            to Epaminondas, who was a man of uncommon erudition. But <lb/>
            I have never read of a Lacedemonian orator, from the earliest <lb/>
            period of time to the present. For Menelaus himself, though <lb/>
            said by Homer to have possessed a sweet elocution, is like- <lb/>
            wise described as a man of few words. Brevity, indeed, upon <lb/>
            some occasions, is a real excellence ; but it is very far from <lb/>
            being compatible with the general character of eloquence. <lb/>
            The art of speaking was likewise studied, and admired, beyond <lb/>
            the limits of Greece; and the extraordinary honours which <lb/>
            were paid to oratory have perpetuated the names of many <lb/>
            foreigners who had the happiness to excel in it. For no <lb/>
            sooner had eloquence ventured to sail from the Piræeus, but <lb/>
            she traversed all the isles, and visited every part of Asia; till <lb/>
            at last, infected with their manners, she lost all the purity and <lb/>
            the healthy complexion of the Attic style, and indeed almost <lb/>
            forgot her native language. The Asiatic orators, therefore, <lb/>
            though not to be undervalued for the rapidity and the copious <lb/>
            variety of their elocution, were certainly too loose and luxu- <lb/>
            riant. But the Rhodians were of a sounder constitution, and <lb/>
            more resembled the Athenians. So much, then, for the <lb/>
            Greeks; for, perhaps, what I have already said of them is <lb/>
            more than was necessary." " Respecting the necessity of it," <lb/>
            answered Brutus, " there is no occasion to speak; but what you <lb/>
            have said of them has entertained me so agreeably, that <lb/>
            instead of being longer, it has been much shorter than I could <lb/>
            have wished." " A very handsome compliment," said I; " but <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            it is time to begin with our countrymen, of whom it is difficult <lb/>
            to give any further account than what we are able to conjec- <lb/>
            ture from our annals.</p>
          <p>XIV. " For who can question the address and the capacity <lb/>
            of Brutus, the illustrious founder of your family ;-that <lb/>
            Brutus, who so readily discovered the meaning of the oracle, <lb/>
            which promised the supremacy to him who should first salute <lb/>
            his mother;1—that Brutus, who, under the appearance of <lb/>
            stupidity, concealed the most exalted understanding ;-who <lb/>
            dethroned and banished a powerful monarch, the son of an <lb/>
            illustrious sovereign ;-who settled the state, which he had <lb/>
            rescued from arbitrary power, by the appointment of an <lb/>
            annual magistracy, a regular system of laws, and a free and <lb/>
            open course of justice;—and who abrogated the authority of <lb/>
            his colleague, that he might banish from the city the smallest <lb/>
            vestige of the regal name ?—events which could never have <lb/>
            been produced without exerting the powers of persuasion! <lb/>
            We are likewise informed that a few years after the expulsion <lb/>
            of the kings, when the Plebeians retired to the banks of the <lb/>
            Anio, about three miles from the city, and had possessed <lb/>
            themselves of what is called the Sacred Mount, Marcus Vale- <lb/>
            rius the dictator appeased their fury by a public harangue; <lb/>
            for which he was afterwards rewarded with the highest posts <lb/>
            of honour, and was the first Roman who was distinguished by <lb/>
            the surname of Maximus. Nor can Lucius Valerius Potitus <lb/>
            be supposed to have been destitute of the powers of utterance, <lb/>
            who, after the odium which had been excited against the <lb/>
            Patricians by the tyrannical government of the Decemviri, <lb/>
            reconciled the people to the senate by his prudent laws and <lb/>
            conciliatory speeches. We may likewise suppose, that Appiua <lb/>
            Claudius was a man of some eloquence; since he dissuaded <lb/>
            the senate from consenting to a peace with king Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            though they were much inclined to it. The same might be <lb/>
            said of Caius Fabricius, who was despatched to Pyrrhus to <lb/>
            treat for the ransom of his captive fellow-citizens; and of <lb/>
            Tiberius Coruncanius, who appears, by the memoirs of the pon- <lb/>
            tifical college, to have been a person of the greatest genius; <note type="footnote"> 1 The words here alluded to occur in Livy: " Imperium summum <lb/>
            Romæ habebit, qui vestrum primus, 0 juvenes, osculum matri tulerit." <lb/>
            This at first was interpreted of Tarquin, who kissed his mother. But <lb/>
            Brutus gave the words a different and more ingenious turn; he illus- <lb/>
            trated their meaning by falling down and kissing the earth, the corumon <lb/>
            mother of all mankind. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            and likewise of Manius Curius (then a tribune of the people), <lb/>
            who, when the Interrex Appius the Blind, an able speaker, <lb/>
            held the Comitia contrary to law, refusing to admit any <lb/>
            consul of plebeian rank, prevailed upon the senate to protest <lb/>
            against the conduct of his antagonist; which, if we consider <lb/>
            that the Mænian law was not then in being, was a very bold <lb/>
            attempt. We may also conclude that Marcus Pompilius was <lb/>
            a man of abilities, who, in the time of his consulship, when he <lb/>
            was solemnizing a public sacrifice in the proper habit of his <lb/>
            office, (for he was also a Flamen Carmentalis,) hearing of the <lb/>
            mutiny and insurrection of the people against the senate, - <lb/>
            rushed immediately into the midst of the assembly, covered <lb/>
            as he was with his sacerdotal robes, and quelled the sedition <lb/>
            by his authority and the force of his elocution. I do not <lb/>
            pretend to have historical evidence that the persons here <lb/>
            mentioned were then reckoned orators, or that any sort of <lb/>
            reward Or encouragement was given to eloquence; I only infer <lb/>
            what appears very probable. It is also recorded that Caius <lb/>
            Flaminius, who, when tribune of the people, proposed the law <lb/>
            for dividing the conquered territories of the Gauls and Piceni <lb/>
            among the citizens, and who, after his promotion to the <lb/>
            consulship, was slain near the lake Thrasimenus, became very <lb/>
            popular by historical talents. Quintus Maximus Verrucosus <lb/>
            was likewise reckoned a good speaker by his contemporaries; <lb/>
            as was also .Quintus Metellus, who, in the second Punic war. <lb/>
            was joint-consul with Lucius Veturius Philo.</p>
          <p>XV. " But the first person we have any certain account of, <lb/>
            who was publicly distinguished as an orator, and who really <lb/>
            appears to have been such, was Marcus Cornelius Cethegus; <lb/>
            whose eloquence is attested by Quintus Ennius, a voucher of <lb/>
            the highest credibility; bince he actually heard him speak, <lb/>
            and gave him this character after his death; so that there is <lb/>
            no reason to suspect that he was prompted by the warmth of <lb/>
            his friendship to exceed the bounds of truth. In the ninth <lb/>
            book of his Annals, he has mentioned him in the following <lb/>
            terms : <lb/>
            Additur orator Corneliu' suaviloquenti <lb/>
            Or3 Cethegus Marcu', Tuditano collega, <lb/>
            Marci filius.</p>
          <p>Add the orator Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, so much admired <lb/>
            for his mellifluent tongue; who was the colleague of Tuditanus, <lb/>
            and the son of Marcus.' He expressly calls him an orator, you <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            see, and attributes to him a remarkable sweetness of elocution : <lb/>
            which, even in the present times, is an excellence of which few <lb/>
            are possessed : for some of our modern orators are so insuffer- <lb/>
            aoly harsh, that they may be said rather to bark than to <lb/>
            speak. But what the poet so much admires in his friend, <lb/>
            may certainly be considered as one of the principal ornaments <lb/>
            of eloquence. He adds : <lb/>
            is dictus, ollis popularibus olim, <lb/>
            Qui turn vivebant homines, atque ævum agitabant, <lb/>
            Flos delibatus populi.</p>
          <p>He was called by his contemporaries, the choicest flower of the <lb/>
            state.' A very elegant compliment! for as the glory of a man <lb/>
            is the strength of his mental capacity, so the brightest orna- <lb/>
            ment of genius is eloquence; in which, whoever had the <lb/>
            happiness to excel, was beautifully styled, by the ancients, the <lb/>
            flower of the state ; and, as the poet immediatelysubjoins, <lb/>
            ———— suadæque medulla: <lb/>
             the very marrow and quintessence of persuasion.' That which <lb/>
            the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειθώ</foreign> (i. e. persuasion), and which it is the <lb/>
            chief business of an orator to effect, is here called suada by <lb/>
            Ennius; and of this he commends Cethegus as the quint- <lb/>
            essence; so that he makes the Roman orator to be himself the <lb/>
            very substance of that amiable goddess, who is said by Eupolis <lb/>
            to have dwelt on the lips of Pericles. This Cethegus was <lb/>
            joint-consul with Publius Tuditanus in the second Punic war <lb/>
            at which time also Marcus Cato was quæstor, about one hun- <lb/>
            died and forty years before I myself was promoted to the <lb/>
            consulship ; which circumstance would have been absolutely <lb/>
            lost, if it had not been recorded by Ennius ; and the memory <lb/>
            of that illustrious citizen, as has probably been the case of <lb/>
            many others, would have been buried in the ruins of anti- <lb/>
            quity. The manner of speaking which was then in vogue, <lb/>
            may easily be collected from the writings of Nævius; for <lb/>
            Nævius died, as we learn from the memoirs of the times, <lb/>
            when the persons above-mentioned were consuls ; though <lb/>
            Varro, a most accurate investigator of historical truth, thinks <lb/>
            there is a mistake in this, and fixes the death of Nævius <lb/>
            something later. For Plautus died in the consulship of Pub- <lb/>
            lius Claudius and Lucius Porcius, twenty years after the <lb/>
            consulship of the persons we have been spiking cf, and when <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            Cato was censor. Cato, therefore, must have been younger <lb/>
            than Cethegus, for he was consul nine years after him; but <lb/>
            we always consider him as a person of the remotest antiquity, <lb/>
            though he died in the consulship of Lucius Marcius and <lb/>
            Manius Manilius, and but eighty-three years before my own <lb/>
            promotion to the same office.</p>
          <p>XVI. " He is certainly, however, the most ancient orator we <lb/>
            have, whose writings may claim our attention; unless any <lb/>
            one is pleased, on account of the above-mentioned speech re- <lb/>
            specting the peace with Pyrrhus, or a series of panegyrics on <lb/>
            the dead, which, I own, are still extant, to compliment Appius <lb/>
            with that character. For it was customary, in most families <lb/>
            of note, to preserve their images, their trophies of honour, <lb/>
            and their memoirs, either to adorn a funeral when any of the <lb/>
            family deceased, or to perpetuate the fame of their ancestors, <lb/>
            or prove their own nobility. But the truth of history has <lb/>
            been much corrupted by these encomiastic essays; for many <lb/>
            circumstances were recorded in them which never existed, <lb/>
            such as false triumphs, a pretended succession of consulships, <lb/>
            and false alliances and elevations, when men of inferior rank <lb/>
            were confounded with a noble family of the same name; as if I <lb/>
            myself should pretend that I am descended from Manius <lb/>
            Tullius, who was a Patrician, and shared the consulship with <lb/>
            Servius Sulpicius, about ten years after the expulsion of the <lb/>
            kings. But the real speeches of Cato are almost as numerous <lb/>
            as those of Lysias the Athenian; under whose name a great <lb/>
            number are still extant. For Lysias was certainly an Athe- <lb/>
            nian; because he not only died, but received his birth at <lb/>
            Athens, and served all the offices of the city; though Timæus, <lb/>
            as if he acted by the Licinian or the Mucian law, orders his <lb/>
            return to Syracuse. There is, however, a manifest resem- <lb/>
            blance between his character and that of Cato ; for they are <lb/>
            both of them distinguished by their acuteness, their elegance, <lb/>
            their agreeable humour, and their brevity. But the Greek <lb/>
            has the happiness to be most admired; for there are some <lb/>
            who are so extravagantly fond of him, as to prefer a graceful <lb/>
            air to a vigorous constitution, and who are perfectly satisfied <lb/>
            with a slender and an easy shape, if it is only attended with <lb/>
            a moderate share of health. It must, however, be acknow- <lb/>
            ledged, that even Lysias often displays a vigour of mind, <lb/>
            which no human power can excel; though his mental frame <lb/>
            is certainly more delicately wrought than that of Cato. Not- <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            withstanding, he has many admirers, who are charmed with <lb/>
            him, merely on account of his delicacy.</p>
          <p>XVII. "But as to Cato, where will you find a modern <lb/>
            orator who condescends to read him?—nay, I might have <lb/>
            said, who has the least knowledge of him? And yet, good <lb/>
            gods! what a wonderful man ! I say nothing of his merit as <lb/>
            a citizen, a senator, and a general; we must confine our <lb/>
            attention to the orator. Who, then, has displayed more <lb/>
            dignity as a panegyrist?—more severity as an accused- <lb/>
            greater acuteness of sentiments?—or greater address in re- <lb/>
            lating and informing ? Though he composed above a hun- <lb/>
            dred and fifty orations, (which I have seen and read,) they are <lb/>
            crowded with all the beauties of language and sentiment. <lb/>
            Let us select from these what deserves our notice and ap- <lb/>
            plause ; they will supply us with all the graces of oratory. <lb/>
            Not to omit his Antiquities, who will deny that these also <lb/>
            are adorned with every flower, and with all the lustre of elo- <lb/>
            quence ? and yet he has scarcely any admirers; which some <lb/>
            ages ago was the case of Philistus the Syracusan, and even of <lb/>
            Thucydides himself. For as the lofty and elevated style of <lb/>
            Theopompus soon diminished the reputation of their pithy <lb/>
            and laconic harangues, which were sometimes scarcely intel- <lb/>
            ligible from excessive brevity and quaintness; and as De- <lb/>
            mosthenes eclipsed the glory of Lysias; so the pompous and <lb/>
            stately elocution of the moderns has obscured the lustre of <lb/>
            Cato. But many of us are deficient in taste and discernment, <lb/>
            for we admire the Greeks for their antiquity, and what is <lb/>
            called their Attic neatness, and yet have never noticed the <lb/>
            same quality in Cato. This was the distinguishing character, <lb/>
            say they, of Lysias and Hyperides. I own it, and I admire <lb/>
            them for it; but why not allow a share of it to Cato ? They <lb/>
            are fond, they tell us, of the Attic style of eloquence; and <lb/>
            their choice is certainly judicious, provided they not only <lb/>
            copy the dry bones, but imbibe the animal spirits of those <lb/>
            models. What they recommend, however, is, to do it justice, <lb/>
            an agreeable quality. But why must Lysias and Hyperides <lb/>
            be so fondly admired, while Cato is entirely overlooked? <lb/>
            His language indeed has an antiquated air, and some of his <lb/>
            expressions are rather too harsh and inelegant. But let us <lb/>
            remember that this was the language of the time; only <lb/>
            change and modernise it, which it was not in his power to <lb/>
            do; add the improvements of number and cadence, give an <note type="footnote">E E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            easier turn to his sentences, and regulate the structure and <lb/>
            connexion of his words, (which was as little practised even by <lb/>
            the older Greeks as by him,) and you will find no one who can <lb/>
            claim the preference to Cato. The Greeks themselves acknow- <lb/>
            ledge that the chief beauty of composition results from the <lb/>
            frequent use of those tralatitious forms of expression which <lb/>
            they call tropes, and of those various attitudes of language <lb/>
            and sentiment which they call figures; but it is almost in- <lb/>
            credible in what copiousness, and with what amazing variety, <lb/>
            they are all employed by Cato.</p>
          <p>XVIII. " I know, indeed, that he is not sufficiently polished, <lb/>
            and that recourse must be had to a more perfect model for <lb/>
            imitation; for he is an author of such antiquity, that he is the <lb/>
            oldest now extant whose writings can be read with patience; <lb/>
            and the ancients, in general, acquired a much greater reputa- <lb/>
            tion in every other art, than in that of speaking. But who <lb/>
            that has seen the statues of the moderns, will not perceive in <lb/>
            a moment that the figures of Canachus are too stiff and <lb/>
            formal to resemble life? Those of Calamis, though evidently <lb/>
            harsh, are somewhat softer. Even the statues of Myron are <lb/>
            not sufficiently alive ; and yet you would not hesitate to pro- <lb/>
            nounce them beautiful. But those of Polycletes are much <lb/>
            finer, and, in my mind, completely finished. The case is the <lb/>
            same in painting; for in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus, <lb/>
            Timanthes, and several other masters, who confined themselves <lb/>
            to the use of four colours, we commend the air and the sym- <lb/>
            metry of their figures ; but in Echion, Nicomachus, Proto- <lb/>
            genes, and Apelles, everything is finished to perfection. This, <lb/>
            I believe, will hold equally true in all the other arts ; for there <lb/>
            is not one of them which was invented and carried to perfec- <lb/>
            tion at the same time. I cannot doubt, for instance, that <lb/>
            there were many poets before Homer; we may infer it from. <lb/>
            those very songs which he himself informs us were sung at <lb/>
            the feasts of the Phæacians, and of the profligate suitors of <lb/>
            Penelope. Nay, to go no farther, what is become of the <lb/>
            ancient poems of our own countrymen ? .</p>
          <p>Such as the fauns and rustic bards composed, <lb/>
            When none the rocks of poetry had cross'd, <lb/>
            Nor wish'd to form his style by rules of art, <lb/>
            Before this vent'rous man, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>“ Old Ennius here speaks of himself; nor does he carry his <lb/>
            boast beyond the bounds of truth; the case being really as <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            ne describes it. For we had only an Odyssey in Latin, which <lb/>
            resembled one of the rough and unfinished statues of Dædalus; <lb/>
            and some dramatic pieces of Livius, which will scarcely bear <lb/>
            a second reading. This Livius exhibited his first performance <lb/>
            at Rome in the consulship of Marcus Tuditanus, and Caius <lb/>
            Clodius the son of Cæcus, the year before Ennius was born, <lb/>
            and, according to the account of my friend Atticus, (whom <lb/>
            I choose to follow,) the five hundred and fourteenth from the <lb/>
            'building of the city. But historians are not agreed about the <lb/>
            date of the year. Attius informs us that Livius was taken <lb/>
            prisoner at Tarentum by Quintus Maximus in his fifth con- <lb/>
            sulship, about thirty years after he is said by Atticus, and <lb/>
            our ancient annals, to have introduced the drama. He adds, <lb/>
            that, he exhibited his first dramatic piece about eleven years <lb/>
            after, in the consulship of Caius Cornelius and Quintus <lb/>
            Minucius, at the public games which Salinator had vowed to <lb/>
            the Goddess of Youth for his victory over the Senones.: But <lb/>
            in this, Attius was so far mistaken, that Ennius, when the <lb/>
            persons above-mentioned were consuls, was forty years old,; <lb/>
            so that if Livius was of the same age, as in this case he would <lb/>
            have been, the first dramatic author we had must have been <lb/>
            younger than Plautus and Neevius, who had exhibited a great <lb/>
            number of plays before the time he specifies.</p>
          <p>XIX. “ If these remarks, my Brutus, appear unsuitable to <lb/>
            the subject before us, you must throw the whole blame upon <lb/>
            Atticus, who has inspired me with a strange curiosity to <lb/>
            inquire into the age of illustrious men, and the respective <lb/>
            times of their appearance." " On the contrary," said Brutus, <lb/>
            “ I am highly pleased that you have carried your attention so <lb/>
            far; and I think your remarks well adapted to the curious <lb/>
            task you have undertaken, the giving us a history of the dif- <lb/>
            ferent classes of orators in their proper order." " You under- <lb/>
            stand me rightly,” said I; " and I heartily wish those venerable <lb/>
            Odes were still extant, which Cato informs us, in his Anti- <lb/>
            quities, used to be sung by every guest in his turn at the <lb/>
            homely feasts of our ancestors, many ages before, to comme- <lb/>
            morate the feats of their heroes. But the Punic War of that <lb/>
            antiquated poet, whom Ennius so proudly ranks among the <lb/>
            fauns and rustic bards, affords me as exquisite a pleasure as <lb/>
            the finest statue that was ever formed by Myron. Ennius, <lb/>
            I allow, was a more finished writer; but if he had really <lb/>
            undervalued the other, as he pretends to do, he would scarcely <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            have omitted such a bloody war as the first Puncc, when he <lb/>
            attempted professedly to describe all the wars of the Republic <lb/>
            Nay, he himself assigns the reason: <lb/>
            Others (said he) that cruel war have sung.</p>
          <p>Very true, and they have sung it with great order and pre- <lb/>
            cision, though not, indeed, in such elegant strains as yourself. <lb/>
            This you ought to have acknowledged, as you must certainly <lb/>
            be conscious that you have borrowed many ornaments from <lb/>
            Nævius; or if you refuse to own it, I shall tell you plainly <lb/>
            that you have pilfered them.</p>
          <p>" Contemporary with the Cato above-mentioned (though <lb/>
            somewhat older) were Caius Flaminius, Caius Varro, Quintus <lb/>
            Maximus, Quintus Metellus, Publius Lentulus, and Publius <lb/>
            Crassus, who was joint consul with the elder Africanus. This <lb/>
            Scipio; we are told, was not destitute of the powers of elocu- <lb/>
            tion ; but his son, who adopted the younger Scipio (the son <lb/>
            of Paulus Æmilius), would have stood foremost in the list of <lb/>
            orators, if he had possessed a firmer constitution. This is <lb/>
            evident from a few speeches, and a Greek History of his, <lb/>
            which are very agreeably written.</p>
          <p>XX. " In the same class we may place Sextus Ælius, who <lb/>
            was the best lawyer of his time, and a ready speaker. A little <lb/>
            after these, flourished Caius Sulpicius Gallus, who was better <lb/>
            acquainted with the Grecian literature than all the rest of <lb/>
            the nobility, and to his reputation as a graceful orator, he <lb/>
            added the highest accomplishments in every other respect; <lb/>
            for a more copious and splendid way of speaking began now <lb/>
            to prevail. When this Sulpicius, in quality of prætor, was <lb/>
            celebrating the public shows in honour of Apollo, died the <lb/>
            poet Ennius, in the consulship of Quintus Marcius and <lb/>
            Cneius Servilius, after exhibiting his tragedy of Thyestes. At <lb/>
            the same time lived Tiberius Gracchus, the son of Publius, <lb/>
            who was twice consul and censor; a Greek oration of his to <lb/>
            the Rhodiaus is still extant, and he bore the character of a <lb/>
            worthy citizen and an eloquent speaker. We are likewise <lb/>
            told that Publius Scipio Nasica, surnamed Corculum,1 as a <lb/>
            favourite of the people, and who also had the honour to bo <note type="footnote"> 1 His name was Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica. From Cornelius, <lb/>
            as being a favourite of the people, he was called Corculum, the " little <lb/>
            heart" of the people. In our language, with nearer affinity to his real <lb/>
            name, he might have been styled “ kernel" of the people. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            twice chosen consul and censor, was esteemed an able orator. <lb/>
            To him we may add Lucius Lentulus, who was joint consul <lb/>
            with Caius Figulus; Quintus Nobilior, the son of Marcus, <lb/>
            who was inclined to the study of literature by his father's <lb/>
            example, and presented Ennius (who had served under his <lb/>
            father in Ætolia) with the freedom of the city, when he <lb/>
            founded a colony in quality of triumvir; and his colleague <lb/>
            Titus Annius Luscus, who is said to have been tolerably elo- <lb/>
            quent. We are likewise informed that Lucius Paulus, the <lb/>
            father of Africanus, defended the character of an eminent <lb/>
            citizen in a public speech; and that Cato, who died in the <lb/>
            eighty-third year of his age, was then living, and actually <lb/>
            pleaded that very year against the defendant Servius Galba, <lb/>
            in the open forum, with great energy and spirit; he has left <lb/>
            a copy of this oration behind him.</p>
          <p>XXI. " But when Cato was in the decline of life, a crowd <lb/>
            of orators, all younger than himself, made their appearance <lb/>
            at the same time; for Aulus Albinus, who wrote a history in <lb/>
            Greek, and shared the consulship with Lucius Lucullus, was <lb/>
            greatly admired for his learning and elocution; and nearly <lb/>
            ranked with him were Servius Fulvius and Servius Fabius <lb/>
            Pictor, the latter of whom was well acquainted with the laws <lb/>
            of his country, the belles lettres, and the history of antiquity. <lb/>
            Quintus Fabius Labeo likewise excelled in the same accom- <lb/>
            plishments. But Quintus Metellus, whose four sons attained <lb/>
            the consular dignity, was admired for his eloquence beyond <lb/>
            the rest; he undertook the defence of Lucius Cotta, when <lb/>
            accused by Africanus, and composed many ether speeches, <lb/>
            particularly that against Tiberius Gracchus, of which we havo <lb/>
            a full account in the annals of Caius Fannius. Lucius Cotta <lb/>
            himself was likewise reckoned a skilful speaker ;1 but Caius <lb/>
            Lælius and Publius Africanus were allowed by all to be more <lb/>
            finished orators; their orations are still extant, and may serve <lb/>
            as specimens of their respective abilities. But Servius Galba, <lb/>
            who somewhat preceded either of them in years, was indis- <lb/>
            putably the best speaker of the age. He was the first among <lb/>
            the Romans who displayed the proper and distinguishing <lb/>
            talents of an orator; such as, digressing from his subject to <note type="footnote"> 1 The original is veterator habitus. He was deemed " a veteran," i. e. <lb/>
            he possessed all the skill of long-continued practice. Sextus Pom- <lb/>
            peius interprets veteratores, " callidi dicti A multâ rerum gerendarum <lb/>
            vetustate." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            embellish and diversify it,-soothing or alarming the passions, <lb/>
            exhibiting every circumstance in the strongest light,—im- <lb/>
            ploring the compassion of his audience,-and artfully en- <lb/>
            larging on those topics, or general principles of prudence or <lb/>
            morality, on which the stress of his argument depended: and <lb/>
            yet, I know not how, though he is allowed to have been the <lb/>
            greatest orator of his time, the orations he has left are more <lb/>
            inanimate, and have more the air of antiquity, than those of <lb/>
            Lælius, or Scipio, or even of Cato himself. Their beauties <lb/>
            have so decayed with age, that scarcely anything remains of <lb/>
            them but the bare skeleton. In the same manner, though <lb/>
            both Lælius and Scipio are greatly extolled for their abilities, <lb/>
            the preference was given to Lælius as a speaker; and yet his <lb/>
            oration, in defence of the privileges of the Sacerdotal college, <lb/>
            has no greater merit than any one that might be named of <lb/>
            the numerous speeches of Scipio. Nothing, indeed, can be <lb/>
            sweeter and milder than that of Lælius, nor could anything <lb/>
            have been urged with greater dignity to support the honour <lb/>
            of religion; but, of the two, Lælius appears to me to be <lb/>
            less polished, and to speak more of the mould of time than <lb/>
            Scipio; and, as different speakers have different tastes, he <lb/>
            had, in my mind, too strong a relish for antiquity, and was <lb/>
            too fond of using obsolete expressions. But such is the jea- <lb/>
            lousy of mankind, that they will not allow the same person to <lb/>
            be possessed of too many perfections. For, as in military <lb/>
            prowess they thought it impossible that any man could vie <lb/>
            with Scipio, though Lælius had not a little distinguished <lb/>
            himself in the war with Viriathus ; so for learning, eloquence, <lb/>
            and wisdom, though each was allowed to be above the reach <lb/>
            of any other competitor, they adjudged the preference to <lb/>
            Lælius. Nor was this the opinion of the public only, but it <lb/>
            seems to have been allowed by mutual consent between <lb/>
            themselves; for it was then a general custom, as candid in <lb/>
            this respect as it was fair and just in every other, to give his <lb/>
            due to each.</p>
          <p>XXII. "I accordingly remember that Publius Rutilius Rufus <lb/>
            once told me at Smyrna, that when he was a young man, the <lb/>
            two consuls Publius Scipio and Decimus Brutus, by order of <lb/>
            the Senate, tried a capital cause of great consequence. For <lb/>
            several persons of note having been murdered in the Silan <lb/>
            Forest, and the domestics and some of the sons of a company <lb/>
            of gentlemen who farmed the taxes of the pitch-manufactory, <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            being charged with the fact, the consuls were ordered to try <lb/>
            the cause in person. Lælius, he said, spoke very sensibly and <lb/>
            elegantly, as indeed he always did, on the side of the farmers <lb/>
            of the customs. But the consuls, after hearing both sides, <lb/>
            judging it necessary to refer the matter to a second trial, the <lb/>
            same Lælius, a few days after, pleaded their cause again <lb/>
            with more accuracy, and much better than at first. The <lb/>
            affair, however, was once more put off for a further hearing. <lb/>
            Upon this, when his clients attended Lælius to his own house, <lb/>
            and, after thanking him for what he had already done, earn- <lb/>
            estly begged him not to be disheartened by the fatigue he <lb/>
            had suffered, he assured them he had exerted his utmost to <lb/>
            defend their reputation; but frankly added, that he thought <lb/>
            their cause would be more effectually supported by Servius <lb/>
            Galba, who possessed talents more powerful and penetrating <lb/>
            than his own. They, accordingly, by the advice of Lælius, <lb/>
            requested Galba to undertake it. To this he consented, but <lb/>
            with the greatest modesty and reluctance, out of respect to <lb/>
            the illustrious advocate he was going to succeed; and as he <lb/>
            had only the next day to prepare himself, he spent the whole <lb/>
            of it in considering and digesting his cause. When the day <lb/>
            of trial was come, Rutilius himself, at the request of the <lb/>
            defendants, went early in the morning to Galba, to give him <lb/>
            notice of it, and conduct him to the court in proper time. <lb/>
            But till word was brought that the consuls were going to the <lb/>
            bench, he confined himself in his study, where he suffered <lb/>
            no one to be admitted; and continued very busy in dictating <lb/>
            to his amanuenses, several of whom (as indeed he often used <lb/>
            to do) he kept fully employed at the same time. While he <lb/>
            was thus engaged, being informed that it was high time for <lb/>
            him to appear in court, he left his house with that animation <lb/>
            and glow of countenance, that you would have thought he had <lb/>
            not only prepared his cause, but actually carried it. Rutilius <lb/>
            added, as another circumstance worth noticing, that his <lb/>
            scribes, who attended him to the bar, appeared excessively <lb/>
            fatigued; from whence he thought it probable that he was <lb/>
            equally warm and vigorous in the composition, as in the de- <lb/>
            livery of his speeches. But to conclude the story, Galba <lb/>
            pleaded his cause before Lælius himself, and a very numerous <lb/>
            and attentive audience, with such uncommon force and dig- <lb/>
            nity, that every part of his oration received the applause of <lb/>
            his hearers; and so powerfully did he move the feelings and <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            ensure the sympathy of the judges, that his clients were im <lb/>
            mediately acquitted of the charge, to the satisfaction of the <lb/>
            whole court.</p>
          <p>XXIII. " As, therefore, the two principal qualities required <lb/>
            in an orator, are perspicuity in stating the subject, and dig- <lb/>
            nified ardour in moving the passions; and as he who fires <lb/>
            and inflames his audience, will always effect more than he who <lb/>
            can barely inform and amuse them; we may conjecture from <lb/>
            the above narrative, with which I was favoured by Rutilius, <lb/>
            that Lælius was most admired for his elegance, and Galba for <lb/>
            his pathetic force. But the energy peculiar to him was most <lb/>
            remarkably exerted, when, having in his prætorship put to <lb/>
            death some Lusitanians, contrary, it was believed, to his pre- <lb/>
            vious and express engagement, Titus Libo, the tribune, exas- <lb/>
            perated the people against him, and preferred a bill which <lb/>
            was. to operate against his conduct as a subsequent law. <lb/>
            Marcus Cato, as I have before mentioned, though extremely <lb/>
            old, spoke in support of the bill with great vehemence; which <lb/>
            speech he inserted in his book of Antiquities, a few days, or <lb/>
            at most only a month or two, before his death. On this occa- <lb/>
            sion, Galba not refusing to plead to the charge, and submitting <lb/>
            his fate to the generosity of the people, recommended his. <lb/>
            children to their protection, with tears in his eyes; and par- <lb/>
            ticularly his young ward, the son of Caius Gallus Sulpicius, <lb/>
            his deceased friend, whose orphan state and piercing cries, <lb/>
            which were the more regarded for the sake of his illustrious. <lb/>
            father, excited their pity in a wonderful manner; and thus, as <lb/>
            Cato informs us in his History, he escaped the flames which <lb/>
            would otherwise have consumed him, by employing the children <lb/>
            to move the compassion of the people. I likewise find (what <lb/>
            may be easily judged from his orations still extant) that his. <lb/>
            prosecutor, Libo, was a man of some eloquence." As I con- <lb/>
            cluded these remarks with a short pause, " What can be the <lb/>
            reason," said Brutus, "if there was so much merit in the <lb/>
            oratory of Galba, that there is no trace of it to be seen in his <lb/>
            orations ? a circumstance which I have no opportunity to be <lb/>
            surprised at in others, who have left nothing behind them in <lb/>
            writing."</p>
          <p>XXIV. " The reasons," said I, "why some have not written: <lb/>
            anything, and others not so well as they spoke, are very <lb/>
            different. Some of our orators, as being indolent, and un- <lb/>
            willing to add the fatigue of private to public business, de <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            not practise composition; for most of the orations we are now <lb/>
            possessed of were written, not before they were spoken, but <lb/>
            some time afterwards. Others did not choose the trouble of <lb/>
            improving themselves, to which nothing more contributes <lb/>
            than frequent writing; and as to perpetuating the fame of <lb/>
            their eloquence, they thought it unnecessary; supposing that <lb/>
            their eminence in that respect was sufficiently established <lb/>
            already, and that it would be rather diminished than in- <lb/>
            creased by submitting any written specimen of it to the arbi-- <lb/>
            trary test of criticism. Some also were sensible that they <lb/>
            spoke much better than they were able to write; which is- <lb/>
            generally the case of those who have a great genius, but little <lb/>
            learning, such as Servius Galba. When he spoke, he was <lb/>
            perhaps so much animated by the force of his abilities, and <lb/>
            the natural warmth and impetuosity of his temper, that his- <lb/>
            language was rapid, bold, and striking; but afterwards, when <lb/>
            he took up the pen in his leisure hours, and his passion had <lb/>
            sunk into a calm, his elocution became dull and languid. <lb/>
            This indeed can never happen to those whose only aim <lb/>
            is to be neat and polished; because an orator may always be <lb/>
            master of that discretion which will enable him both to <lb/>
            speak and write in the same agreeable manner; but no man. <lb/>
            can revive at pleasure the ardour of his passions; and when <lb/>
            that has once subsided, the fire and pathos of his language <lb/>
            will be extinguished. This is the reason why the calm and <lb/>
            easy spirit of Lælius seems still to breathe in his writings; <lb/>
            whereas the vigour of Galba is entirely withered away.</p>
          <p>XXV. " We may also reckon in the number of middling. <lb/>
            orators, the two brothers Lucius and Spurius Mummius,. <lb/>
            both whose orations are still in being; the style of Lucius is <lb/>
            plain and antiquated; but that of Spurius, though equally <lb/>
            unembellished, is more close and compact; for he was well, <lb/>
            versed in the doctrine of the Stoics. The orations of Spurius <lb/>
            Alpinus, their contemporary, are very numerous; and we <lb/>
            have several by Lucius and Caius Aurelius Oresta, who were <lb/>
            esteemed indifferent speakers. Publius Popilius also was <lb/>
            a worthy citizen, and had a moderate share of elocution; but <lb/>
            his son Caius was really eloquent. To these we may add. <lb/>
            Caius Tuditanus, who was not only very polished and grace- <lb/>
            ful in his manners and appearance, but had an elegant turn, <lb/>
            of expression; and of the same class was Marcus Octavius, a <lb/>
            man of inflexible constancy in every just and laudable <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            measure; and who, after being insulted and disgraced in the <lb/>
            most public manner, defeated his rival Tiberius Gracchus by <lb/>
            the mere dint of his perseverance. But Marcus Æmilius <lb/>
            Lepidus, who was surnamed Porcina, and flourished at the <lb/>
            same time as Galba, though he was indeed something <lb/>
            younger, was esteemed an orator of the first eminence; <lb/>
            and really appears, from his orations which are still extant, to <lb/>
            have been a masterly writer. For he was the first speaker <lb/>
            among the Romans who gave us a specimen of the easy <lb/>
            gracefulness of the Greeks; and who was distinguished by <lb/>
            the measured flow of his language, and a style regularly <lb/>
            polished and improved by art. His manner was carefully <lb/>
            studied by Caius Carbo and Tiberius Gracchus, two accom- <lb/>
            plished youths, who were nearly of an age : but we must <lb/>
            defer their character as public speakers, till we have finished <lb/>
            our account of their elders. For Quintus Pompeius, consider- <lb/>
            ing the time in which he lived, was no contemptible orator, <lb/>
            and actually raised himself to the highest honours of the <lb/>
            state by his own personal merit, and without being recom- <lb/>
            mended, as usual, by the quality of his ancestors. Lucius <lb/>
            Cassius too derived his influence, which was very considerable, <lb/>
            not indeed from the highest powers, yet from a tolerable <lb/>
            share of eloquence; for it is remarkable that he made himself <lb/>
            popular, not as others did, by his complaisance and liberality, <lb/>
            but by the gloomy rigour and severity of his manners. His <lb/>
            law for collecting the votes of the people by way of ballot, <lb/>
            was strongly opposed by the tribune Marcus Antius Briso, <lb/>
            who was supported by Marcus Lepidus, one of the consuls: <lb/>
            and it was afterwards objected to Africanus, that Briso <lb/>
            dropped the opposition by his advice. At this time the two <lb/>
            Cæpios were very serviceable to a number of clients by their <lb/>
            superior judgment and eloquence ; but still more so by their <lb/>
            extensive interest and popularity. But the written speeches <lb/>
            of Pompeius (though it must be owned they have rather • <lb/>
            an antiquated air) discover an amazing sagacity, and are very <lb/>
            far from being dry and spiritless.</p>
          <p>XXVI. " To these we must add Publius Crassus, an orator <lb/>
            of uncommon merit, who was qualified for the profession by <lb/>
            the united efforts of art and nature, and enjoyed some other <lb/>
            advantages which were almost peculiar to his family. For he <lb/>
            had contracted an affinity with that accomplished speaker <lb/>
            'Servius Galba above-mentioned, by giving his daughter in <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            marriage to Galba's son ; and being likewise himself the son <lb/>
            of Mucius and the brother of Publius Scævola, he had a fine <lb/>
            opportunity at home (which he made the best use of) to gain <lb/>
            a thorough knowledge of the civil law. He was a man of <lb/>
            unusual application, and was much beloved by his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens; being constantly employed either in giving his <lb/>
            advice, or pleading causes in the forum. Contemporary with <lb/>
            the speakers I have mentioned were the two Caii Fannii, <lb/>
            the sons of Cams and Marcus, one of whom, (the son of <lb/>
            Caius,) who was joint consul with Domitius, has left us an ex- <lb/>
            cellent speech against Gracchus, who proposed the admission <lb/>
            of the Latin and Italian allies to the freedom of Rome." " Do- <lb/>
            you really think, then," said Atticus, " that Fannius was the <lb/>
            author of that oration ? For when we were young, there were <lb/>
            different opinions about it. Some asserted it was written by <lb/>
            Caius Persius, a man of letters, and much extolled for his <lb/>
            learning by Lucilius; and others believed it the joint pro- <lb/>
            duction of a number of noblemen, each of whom contributed <lb/>
            his best to complete it." “ This I remember," said I; “ but I <lb/>
            could never persuade myself to coincide with either of them. <lb/>
            Their suspicion, I believe, was entirely founded on the cha- <lb/>
            racter of Fannius, who was only reckoned among the middling <lb/>
            orators; whereas the speech in question is esteemed the best <lb/>
            which the time afforded. But, on the other hand, it is too <lb/>
            much of a piece to have been the mingled composition. <lb/>
            of many; for the flow of the periods, and the turn of the <lb/>
            language, are perfectly similar, throughout the whole of it. <lb/>
            And as to Persius, if he had composed it for Fannius to pro- <lb/>
            nounce, Gracchus would certainly have taken some notice of <lb/>
            it in his reply; because Fannius rallies Gracchus pretty <lb/>
            severely, in one part of it, for employing Menelaus of Maratho,. <lb/>
            and several others, to compose his speeches. We may add,. <lb/>
            that Fannius himself was no contemptible orator; for he <lb/>
            pleaded a number of causes, and his tribuneship, which was. <lb/>
            chiefly conducted under the management and direction of <lb/>
            Publius Africanus, exhibited much oratory. But the other <lb/>
            Caius Fannius (the son of Marcus and son-in-law of Caius <lb/>
            Lælius) was of a rougher cast, both in his temper and manner <lb/>
            of speaking. By the advice of his father-in-law, (of whom, <lb/>
            by the by, he was not remarkably fond, because he had not <lb/>
            voted for his admission into the college of augurs, but gavo <lb/>
            the preference to his younger son-in-law, Quintus Scævola; <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            though Lælius politely excused himself, by saying that the <lb/>
            preference was not given to the youngest son, but to his wife <lb/>
            the eldest daughter,) by his advice, I say, he attended the <lb/>
            lectures of Panætius. His abilities as a speaker may be <lb/>
            easily inferred from his history, which is neither destitute of <lb/>
            elegance, nor a perfect model of composition. As to his <lb/>
            brother Mucius, the augur, whenever he was called upon to <lb/>
            defend himself, he always pleaded his own cause ; as, for in- <lb/>
            stance, in the action which was brought against him for <lb/>
            bribery by Titus Albucius. But he was never ranked among <lb/>
            the orators; his chief merit being a critical knowledge <lb/>
            of the civil law, and an uncommon accuracy of judgment. <lb/>
            Lucius Cælius Antipater, likewise, (as you may see by his <lb/>
            works,) was an elegant and a perspicuous writer for the time <lb/>
            he lived in; he was also an excellent lawyer, and taught the <lb/>
            principles of jurisprudence to many others, particularly to <lb/>
            Lucius Crassus.</p>
          <p>XXVII: " As to Caius Carbo and Tiberius Gracchus, I <lb/>
            wish they had been as well inclined to maintain peace and <lb/>
            good order in the state, as they were qualified to support it <lb/>
            by their eloquence ; their glory would then have never been <lb/>
            -excelled. But the latter, for his turbulent tribuneship, which <lb/>
            he entered upon with a heart full of resentment against the <lb/>
            great and good, on account of the odium he had brought upon <lb/>
            ihimself by the treaty of Numantia, was slain by the hands of <lb/>
            the republic ; and the other, being impeached of a seditious <lb/>
            affectation of popularity, rescued himself from the severity of <lb/>
            the judges by a voluntary death. That both of them were <lb/>
            -excellent speakers, is very plain from the general testimony of <lb/>
            their contemporaries; for, as to their speeches now extant, <lb/>
            though I allow them to be very skilful and judicious, they are <lb/>
            certainly defective in elocution. Gracchus had the advantage <lb/>
            of being carefully instructed by his mother Cornelia from his <lb/>
            very childhood, and his mind was enriched with all the stores <lb/>
            of Grecian literature; for he was constantly attended by the <lb/>
            ablest masters from Greece, a: d particularly, in his youth, by <lb/>
            Diophanes of Mitylene, who was the most eloquent Grecian of <lb/>
            his age; but though he was a man of uncommon genius, he <lb/>
            had but a short time to improve and display it. As to <lb/>
            'Carbo, his whole life was spent in trials, and forensic debates. <lb/>
            He is said, by very sensible men who heard him, and among <lb/>
            others by our friend Lucius Gellius, who lived in his family <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            in the time of his consulship, to have been a sonorous, a <lb/>
            fluent, and a spirited speaker, and likewise, upon occasion. <lb/>
            very pathetic, very engaging, and excessively humorous: <lb/>
            Gellius used to add, that he applied himself very closely <lb/>
            to his studies, and bestowed much of his time in writing and <lb/>
            private declamation. He was, therefore, esteemed the best <lb/>
            pleader of his time; for no sooner had he begun to distin- <lb/>
            guish himself in the forum, but the depravity of the age.gave <lb/>
            birth to a number of law-suits; and it was first found neces- <lb/>
            sary, in the time of his youth, to settle the form of public <lb/>
            trials, which had never been done before. We accordingly <lb/>
            find that Lucius Piso, then a tribune of the people, was the <lb/>
            first who proposed a law against bribery; which he did when <lb/>
            Censorinus and Manilius were consuls. This Piso too was <lb/>
            a professed pleader, who moved and opposed a great number <lb/>
            of laws; he left some orations behind him, which are now <lb/>
            lost, and a book of annals very indifferently written. But in <lb/>
            the public trials, in which Carbo was concerned, the assistance <lb/>
            of an able advocate had become more necessary than ever, in <lb/>
            consequence of the law for voting by ballots, which was pro- <lb/>
            posed and carried by Lucius Cassius, in the consulship of <lb/>
            Lepidus and Mancinus.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. “ I have likewise been often assured by the poet <lb/>
            Attius, (an intimate friend of his,) that your ancestor Decimus <lb/>
            Brutus, the son of Marcus, was no inelegant speaker; and <lb/>
            that, for the time he lived in, he was well versed both in the <lb/>
            Greek and Roman literature. He ascribed the same accom- <lb/>
            plishments to Quintus Maximus, the grandson of Lucius <lb/>
            Paulus; and added that, a little prior to Maximus, the Scipio, <lb/>
            by whose instigation (though only in a private capacity) <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus was assassinated, was not only a man of <lb/>
            great ardour in all other respects, but very warm and spirited <lb/>
            in his manner of speaking. Publius Lentulus too, the father <lb/>
            of the senate, had a sufficient share of eloquence for an honest <lb/>
            and useful magistrate. About the same time Lucius Furius <lb/>
            Philus was thought to speak our language as elegantly and <lb/>
            more correctly than any other man; Publius Scævola to <lb/>
            be very acute and judicious, and rather more fluent than <lb/>
            Philus; Manius Manilius to possess almost an equal share of <lb/>
            judgment with the latter ; and Appius Claudius to be equally <lb/>
            fluent, but more warm and pathetic. Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, <lb/>
            and Caius Cato the nephew of Africanus, were likewise t olerable <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            orators; some of the writings of Flaccus are still in being <lb/>
            in which nothing, however, is to be seen but the mere scholar. <lb/>
            Publius Decius was a professed rival of Flaccus ; he too was <lb/>
            not destitute of eloquence ; but his style was too bold, as his <lb/>
            temper was too violent. Marcus Drusus, the son of Claudius; <lb/>
            who, in his tribuneship, baffled1 his colleague Gracchus (then <lb/>
            raised to the same office a second time), was a nervous <lb/>
            speaker, and a man of great popularity: and next to him was <lb/>
            his brother Caius Drusus. Your kinsman also, my Brutus, <lb/>
            (Marcus Pennus,) successfully opposed the tribune Gracchus, <lb/>
            who was something younger than himself. For Gracchus <lb/>
            was quæstor, and, Pennus (the son of that Marcus, who was <lb/>
            joint consul with Quintus Ælius) was tribune, in the consul- <lb/>
            ship of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Orestes; but after enjoy- <lb/>
            ing the ædileship, and a prospect of succeeding to the highest <lb/>
            honours, he was snatched off by an untimely death. As to <lb/>
            Titus Flamiuinus, whom I myself have seen, I can learn <lb/>
            nothing but that he spoke our language with great accuracy.</p>
          <p>XXIX. " To these we may join Caius Curio, Marcus <lb/>
            Scaurus, Publius Rutilius, and Caius Gracchus. It will not <lb/>
            be amiss to give a short account of Scaurus and Rutilius ; <lb/>
            neither of whom, indeed, had the reputation of being a first- <lb/>
            rate orator, though each of them pleaded a number of causes. <lb/>
            But some deserving men, who were not remarkable for their <lb/>
            genius, may be justly commended for their industry; not <lb/>
            that the persons I am speaking of were really destitute of <lb/>
            genius, but only of that particular kind of it which distin- <lb/>
            guishes the orator. For it is cf little consequence to discover <lb/>
            what is proper to be said, unless you are able to express it in <lb/>
            a free and agreeable manner; and even that will be insuffi- <lb/>
            cient, if not recommended by the voice, the look, and the <lb/>
            gesture. It is needless to add, that much depends upon art ; <lb/>
            for though, even without this, it is possible, by the mere force <lb/>
            of nature, to say many striking things; yet, as they will after <lb/>
            all be nothing more than so many lucky hits, we shall not be <lb/>
            able to repeat them at our pleasure. The style of Scaurus,. <lb/>
            who was a very sensible and an honest man, was remarkably <note type="footnote"> 1 Baffled. In the original it runs, Caium Gracchum collegam, iterum <lb/>
            Tribunum, fecit: but this was undoubtedly a mistake of the tran. <lb/>
            scriber, as being contrary not only to the truth of history, but to Cicero's <lb/>
            own account of the matter in lib. iv. De Finibus. Pighius therefore <lb/>
            has very properly recommended the word fregit instead of fecit. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            grave, and commanded the respect of the hearer; so that, <lb/>
            when he was speaking for his client, you would rather have <lb/>
            thought he was giving evidence in his favour, than pleading <lb/>
            his cause. This manner of speaking, however, though but <lb/>
            indifferently adapted to the bar, was very much so to a calm <lb/>
            debate in the senate, of which Scaurus was then esteemed the <lb/>
            father; for it not only bespoke his prudence, but, what was <lb/>
            still a more important recommendation, his credibility. This <lb/>
            advantage, which it is not easy to acquire by art, he derived <lb/>
            entirely from nature; though you know that even here we <lb/>
            have some precepts to assist us. We have several of his <lb/>
            orations still extant, and three books inscribed to Lucius <lb/>
            Fufidius, containing the history of his own life, which, though <lb/>
            a very useful work, is scarcely read by anybody. But the <lb/>
            Institution of Cyrus, by Xenophon, is read by every one ; <lb/>
            which, though an excellent performance of the kind, is much <lb/>
            less adapted to our manners and form of government, and <lb/>
            not superior in merit to the honest simplicity of Scaurus.</p>
          <p>XXX. " Fufidius himself was likewise a tolerable pleader; <lb/>
            but Rutilius was distinguished by his solemn and austere <lb/>
            way of speaking; and both of them were naturally warm <lb/>
            and spirited. Accordingly, after they had rivalled each <lb/>
            other for the consulship, he who had lost his election, imme- <lb/>
            diately sued his competitor for bribery; and Scaurus, the <lb/>
            defendant, being honourably acquitted of the charge, re- <lb/>
            turned the compliment to Rutilius, by commencing a similar <lb/>
            prosecution against him. Rutilius was a man of great indus- <lb/>
            try and application; for which he was the more respected, <lb/>
            because, besides his pleadings, he undertook the office (which <lb/>
            was a very troublesome one) of giving advice to all who <lb/>
            applied to him, in matters of law. His orations are very dry, <lb/>
            but his juridical remarks are excellent; for he was a learned <lb/>
            man, and well versed in the Greek literature, and was likewise <lb/>
            an attentive and constant hearer of Panætius, and a thorough <lb/>
            proficient in the doctrine of the Stoics; whose method of dis- <lb/>
            coursing, though very close and artful, is too precise, and not <lb/>
            at all adapted to engage the attention of common people. <lb/>
            That self-confidence, therefore, which is so peculiar to the <lb/>
            sect, was displayed by him with amazing firmness and resolu- <lb/>
            tion ; for though he was perfectly innocent of the charge, a <lb/>
            prosecution was commenced against him for bribery (a trial <lb/>
            which raised a violent commotion in the city), and yet. <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            though Lucius Crassus and Marcus Antonius, both of consu- <lb/>
            lar dignity, were at that time in very high repute for their <lb/>
            eloquence, he refused the assistance of either; being deter- <lb/>
            mined to plead his cause himself, which he accordingly did. <lb/>
            Caius Cotta, indeed, who was his nephew, made a short <lb/>
            speech in his vindication, which he spoke in the true style of <lb/>
            an orator, though he was then but a youth. Quintus Mucius <lb/>
            too said much in his defence, with his usual accuracy and <lb/>
            elegance; but not with that force and extension which the <lb/>
            mode of trial and the importance of the cause demanded. <lb/>
            Rutilius, therefore, was an orator of the Stoical, and Scaurus <lb/>
            of the Antique cast; but they are both entitled to our com- <lb/>
            mendation ; because, in them, even this formal and unpromising <lb/>
            species of elocution has appeared among us with some degree <lb/>
            of merit. For as in the theatre, so in the forum, I would not <lb/>
            have our applause confined to those alone who act the busy <lb/>
            and more important characters; but reserve a share of it for <lb/>
            the quiet and, unambitious performer, who is- distinguished <lb/>
            by a simple truth of gesture, without any violence.</p>
          <p>XXXI. " As I have mentioned the Stoics, I must take <lb/>
            some notice of Quintus Ælius Tubero, the grandson of Lucius <lb/>
            Paullus, who made his appearance at the time we are speaking <lb/>
            of He was never esteemed an orator, but was a man of the <lb/>
            most rigid virtue, and strictly conformable to the doctrine <lb/>
            he professed; but, in truth, he had not sufficient ease and <lb/>
            polish. In his Triumvirate, he declared, contrary to the <lb/>
            opinion of Publius Africanus his uncle, that the augurs had <lb/>
            no right of exemption from sitting in the courts of justice; and <lb/>
            as in his temper, so in his manner of speaking, he was harsh, <lb/>
            unpolished, and austere; on which account, he could never <lb/>
            raise himself to the honourable posts which were enjoyed by <lb/>
            his ancestors. But he was a brave and steady citizen, and <lb/>
            a warm opposer of Gracchus, as appears from Gracchus's <lb/>
            oration against him ; we have likewise some of Tubero's <lb/>
            speeches against Gracchus. , He was not indeed a shining <lb/>
            orator: but he was a learned and very skilful, disputant." <lb/>
            " I find," said Brutus, " that the case is much the same among <lb/>
            us, as with the Greeks; and that the Stoics, in general, are <lb/>
            very judicious at an argument, which they conduct by cer- <lb/>
            tain rules of art, and are likewise very neat and exact in their <lb/>
            language; but if we take them from this, to speak in public, <lb/>
            they make a poor appearance. Cato, however, must be ex <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            cepted; in whom, though as rigid a Stoic as ever existed, I <lb/>
            could not wish for a more consummate degree of eloquence. <lb/>
            I can likewise discover a moderate share of it in Fannius,— <lb/>
            not so much in Rutilius; but none at all in Tubero." <lb/>
            “ True," said I; " and we may easily account for it; their <lb/>
            whole attention was so closely confined to the study of logic, <lb/>
            that they never troubled themselves to acquire the free, dif- <lb/>
            fusive, and variegated style which is so necessary for a public <lb/>
            speaker. But your uncle, you doubtless know, was wise <lb/>
            enough to borrow only that from the Stoics which they were <lb/>
            able to furnish for his purpose (the art of reasoning); but for <lb/>
            the art of speaking, he had recourse to the masters of rhetoric, <lb/>
            and exercised himself in the manner they directed. If, how- <lb/>
            ever, we must be indebted for everything to the philosophers, <lb/>
            the Peripatetic discipline is, in my mind, much the most proper <lb/>
            to form our language. For which reason, my Brutus, I the <lb/>
            more approve your choice, in attaching yourself to a sect, <lb/>
            (I mean the philosophers of the old Academy,) in whose <lb/>
            system a just and accurate way of reasoning is enlivened by <lb/>
            a perpetual sweetness and fluency of expression; but even the <lb/>
            delicate and flowing style of the Peripatetics and Academics <lb/>
            is not sufficient to complete an orator; nor yet can he be <lb/>
            complete without it. For as the language of the Stoics is too <lb/>
            close and contracted to suit the ears of common people, so <lb/>
            that of the latter is too diffusive and luxuriant for a spirited <lb/>
            contest in the forum, or a pleading at the bar. Who had <lb/>
            a richer style than Plato ? The philosophers tell us, that if <lb/>
            Jupiter himself was to converse in Greek, he would speak like <lb/>
            him. Who also was more nervous than Aristotle? Who <lb/>
            sweeter than Theophrastus ? We are told that even Demo- <lb/>
            sthenes attended the lectures of Plato, and was fond of reading <lb/>
            what he published ; which, indeed, is sufficiently evident <lb/>
            from the turn and majesty of his language; and he himself <lb/>
            has expressly mentioned it in one of his letters. But the style <lb/>
            of this excellent orator is, notwithstanding, much too violent <lb/>
            for the academy ; as that of the philosophers is too mild and <lb/>
            placid for the forum.</p>
          <p>XXXII. " I shall now, with your leave, proceed to the age <lb/>
            and merits of the rest of, the Roman orators." " Nothing," said <lb/>
            Atticus—“ for I can safely answer for my friend Brutus— <lb/>
            would please us better." " Curio, then," said I, “ was nearly 01 <lb/>
            the age I have just mentioned; a celebrated speaker, whose <note type="footnote"> FF2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            genius may be easily ascertained from his orations. For, <lb/>
            among several others, we have a noble speech cf his for Ser- <lb/>
            vius Fulvius, in a prosecution for incest. When we were <lb/>
            children, it was esteemed the best then extant; but now it is <lb/>
            almost overlooked among the numerous performances of the <lb/>
            same kind which have been lately published." " I am very <lb/>
            sensible," replied Brutus, “ to whom we are obliged for the <lb/>
            numerous performances you speak of." "And I am equally <lb/>
            sensible," said I, " who is the person you intend; for I have <lb/>
            at least done a service to my young countrymen, by intro- <lb/>
            ducing a loftier and more embellished way of speaking than <lb/>
            was used before; and, perhaps, I have also done some <lb/>
            harm, because after mine appeared, the speeches of our pre- <lb/>
            decessors began to be neglected by most people; though <lb/>
            never by me, for I can assure you, I always prefer them to <lb/>
            my own." “ But you must reckon me," said Brutus, “ among <lb/>
            the most people; though I now see, from your recommenda- <lb/>
            tion, that I have a great many books to read, of which before <lb/>
            I had very little opinion." “ But this celebrated oration," <lb/>
            said I, “ in the prosecution for incest, is in some places exces- <lb/>
            sively puerile; and what is said in it of the passion of love, <lb/>
            the inefficacy of questioning by tortures, and the danger of <lb/>
            trusting to common hearsay, is indeed pretty enough, but <lb/>
            would be insufferable to the chastened ears of the moderns, <lb/>
            and to a people who are justly distinguished for the solidity <lb/>
            of their knowledge. He likewise wrote several other pieces, <lb/>
            spoke a number of good orations, and was certainly an emi- <lb/>
            nent pleader; so that I much wonder, considering how long <lb/>
            he lived and the character he bore, that he was never preferred <lb/>
            to the consulship.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. “ But I have a man here,1 (Caius Gracchus,) who <lb/>
            had an amazing genius, and the most ardent application; <lb/>
            and was a scholar from his very childhood; for you must not <lb/>
            imagine, my Brutus, that we have ever yet had a speaker <lb/>
            whose language was richer and more copious than his." “ I <lb/>
            really think so," answered Brutus; " and he is almost the <lb/>
            only author we have, among the ancients, that I take the <lb/>
            trouble to read." “ And he well deserves it," said I; “for the <lb/>
            Roman name and literature were great losers by his untimely <note type="footnote"> I He refers, perhaps, to the works of Gracchus, which he might then <lb/>
            have in his hand; or, more probably, to a statue of him, which stood <lb/>
            near the place where he and his friends were sitting. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            fate. I wish he had transferred his affection for his brother <lb/>
            to his country ! How easily, if he had thus prolonged his <lb/>
            life, would he have rivalled the glory of his father and grand- <lb/>
            father! In eloquence, I scarcely know whether we should <lb/>
            yet have had his equal. His language was noble; his senti- <lb/>
            ments manly and judicious; and his whole manner great <lb/>
            and striking. He wanted nothing but the finishing touch : <lb/>
            for though his first attempts were as excellent as they were <lb/>
            numerous, he did not live to complete them. In short, my <lb/>
            Brutus, he, if any one, should be carefully studied by the <lb/>
            Roman youth; for he is able, not only to sharpen, but to <lb/>
            enrich and ripen their talents. After him appeared Caius <lb/>
            Galba, the son of the eloquent Servius, and the son-in-law of <lb/>
            Publius Crassus, who was both an eminent speaker and <lb/>
            a skilful civilian. He was much commended by our fathers, <lb/>
            who respected him for the sake of his; but he had the mis- <lb/>
            fortune to be stopped in his career. For being tried by the <lb/>
            Mamilian law, as a party concerned in the conspiracy to sup- <lb/>
            port Jugurtha, though he exerted all his abilities to defend <lb/>
            himself, he was unhappily condemned. His peroration, or, <lb/>
            as it is often called, his epilogue, is still extant; and was so <lb/>
            much in repute; when we were schoolboys, that we used to <lb/>
            learn it by heart; he was the first member of the Sacerdotal <lb/>
            College, since the building of Rome, who was publicly tried <lb/>
            and condemned.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. " As to Publius Scipio, who died in his consul- <lb/>
            ship, he neither spoke much, nor often; but he was inferior <lb/>
            to no one in purity of language, and superior to all in wit <lb/>
            and pleasantry. His colleague, Lucius Bestia, who began his <lb/>
            tribuneship very successfully, (for, by a law which he preferred <lb/>
            for the purpose, he procured the recal of Popillius, who <lb/>
            had been exiled by the influence of Caius Gracchus,) was a <lb/>
            man of spirit, and a tolerable speaker; but he did not finish <lb/>
            his consulship equally happily. For, in consequence of the <lb/>
            invidious law of Mamilius above-mentioned, Caius Galba, one <lb/>
            of the priests, and the four consular gentlemen, Lucius <lb/>
            Bestia, Caius Cato, Spurius Albinus, and that excellent citizen <lb/>
            Lucius Opimius, who killed Gracchus, of which he was ac- <lb/>
            quitted by the people, though he had constantly sided against <lb/>
            them, were all condemned by their judges, who were of the <lb/>
            Gracchan party. Very unlike him in his tribuneship, and <lb/>
            indeed in every other part of his life, was that infamous <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            citizen Cams Licinius Nerva; but he was not destitute of <lb/>
            eloquence. Nearly at the same time (though, indeed he was <lb/>
            somewhat older) flourished Caius Fimbria, who was rather <lb/>
            rough and abusive, and much too warm and hasty; but his <lb/>
            application, and his great integrity and firmness, made him a <lb/>
            serviceable speaker in the senate. He was likewise a tolerable <lb/>
            pleader and civilian, and distinguished by the same rigid <lb/>
            freedom in the turn of his language, as in that of his vir- <lb/>
            tues. When we were boys, we used to think his orations worth <lb/>
            reading; though they are now scarcely to be met with. But <lb/>
            Caius Sextius Calvinus was equally elegant, both in his <lb/>
            taste and his language, though, unhappily, of a very infirm <lb/>
            constitution; when the pain in his feet intermitted, he did <lb/>
            not decline the trouble of pleading, but he did not attempt it <lb/>
            very often. His fellow-citizens, therefore, made use of his <lb/>
            advice, whenever they had occasion for it; but of his patron- <lb/>
            age, only when his health permitted. Contemporary with <lb/>
            these, my good friend, was your namesake Marcus Brutus, <lb/>
            the disgrace of your noble family; who, though he bore that <lb/>
            honourable name, and had the best of men and an eminent <lb/>
            civilian for his father, confined his practice to accusations, as <lb/>
            Lycurgus is said to have done at Athens. He never sued for <lb/>
            any of our magistracies; but was a severe and a troublesome <lb/>
            prosecutor; so that we easily see that, in him, the natural <lb/>
            goodness of the stock was corrupted by the vicious inclina-. <lb/>
            tions of the man. At the same time lived Lucius Cæsulenus, <lb/>
            a man of plebeian rank, and a professed accuser, like the <lb/>
            former; I myself heard him in his old age, when he endea- <lb/>
            voured, by the Aquilian law, to subject Lucius Sabellius to a <lb/>
            fine, for a breach of justice. But I should not have taken <lb/>
            any notice of such a low-born wretch, if I had not thought <lb/>
            that no person I ever heard, could give a more suspicious <lb/>
            turn to the cause of the defendant, or exaggerate it to a <lb/>
            higher degree of criminality.</p>
          <p>XXXV. "Titus Albucius, who lived in the same age, <lb/>
            was well versed in the Grecian literature, or, rather, was <lb/>
            almost a Greek himself. I speak of him as I think; but <lb/>
            any person who pleases may judge what he was by his <lb/>
            orations. In his youth, he studied at Athens, and returned <lb/>
            from thence a thorough proficient in the doctrine of Epicurus; <lb/>
            which, of all others, is the least adapted to form an orator. <lb/>
            His contemporary, Quintus Catulus, was an accomplished <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            speaker, not in the ancient taste, but (unless anything more <lb/>
            perfect caMe exhibited) in the finished style of the moderns. <lb/>
            He had copious stores of learning; an easy, winning elegance, <lb/>
            not only in his manners and disposition, but in his very lan- <lb/>
            guage; and an unblemished purity and correctness of style. <lb/>
            This may be easily seen by his orations; and particularly by <lb/>
            the History of his Consulship, and of his subsequent trans- <lb/>
            actions, which he composed in the soft and agreeable manner <lb/>
            of Xenophon, and made a present of to the poet Aulus Furius, <lb/>
            an intimate acquaintance of his. But this performance is as <lb/>
            little known as the three books of Scaurus before-mentioned." <lb/>
            " Indeed, I must confess," said Brutus, " that both the one and <lb/>
            the other are perfectly unknown to me; but that is entirely <lb/>
            my own fault. I shall now, therefore, request a sight of them <lb/>
            from you; and am resolved, in future, to be more careful in <lb/>
            collecting such valuable curiosities." “ This Catulus," said I, <lb/>
            “ as I have just observed, was distinguished by the purity of <lb/>
            his language; which, though a material accomplishment, <lb/>
            is too much neglected by most of the Roman orators; for as <lb/>
            to the elegant tone of his voice, and the sweetness of his <lb/>
            accent, as you knew his son, it will be needless to take <lb/>
            any notice of them. His son, indeed, was not in, the list <lb/>
            of orators; but whenever he had occasion to deliver his sen- <lb/>
            timents in public, he neither wanted judgment, nor a neat <lb/>
            and liberal turn of expression. Nay, even the father himself <lb/>
            was not reckoned the foremost in the rank of orators; but <lb/>
            still he had that kind of merit, that notwithstanding after <lb/>
            you had heard two or three speakers who were particularly <lb/>
            eminent in their profession, you might judge him inferior; <lb/>
            yet, whenever you hear him alone, and without an immediate <lb/>
            opportunity of making a comparison, you would not only be <lb/>
            satisfied with him, but scarcely wish for a better advocate. <lb/>
            As to Quintus Metellus Numidicus, and his colleague Marcus <lb/>
            Silanus, they spoke, on matters of government, with as much <lb/>
            eloquence as was really necessary for men of their illustrious <lb/>
            character, and of consular dignity. But Marcus Aurclius <lb/>
            Scaurus, though he spoke in public but seldom, always spoke <lb/>
            very neatly, and he had a more elegant command of the <lb/>
            Roman language than most men. Auks Albinns was a <lb/>
            speaker of the same kind; but Albinos the flatten was <lb/>
            esteemed an orator. Quintus Cæpio, too, had a great deal of <lb/>
            spirit, and was a brave citizen; but the unlucky chance of <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            war was imputed to him as a crime, and the general odium <lb/>
            of the people proved his ruin.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. " Caius and Lucius Memmius were likewise in- <lb/>
            different orators, and distinguished by the bitterness and. <lb/>
            asperity of their accusations; for they prosecuted many, but <lb/>
            seldom spoke for the defendant. Spurius Thorius, on the <lb/>
            other hand, was distinguished by his popular way of speak- <lb/>
            ing ; the very same man who, by his corrupt and frivolous <lb/>
            law, diminished1 the taxes which were levied on the public <lb/>
            lands. Marcus Marcellus, the father of Æserninus, though <lb/>
            not reckoned a professed pleader, was a prompt, and, in some <lb/>
            degree, a practised speaker; as was also his son Publius Len- <lb/>
            tulus. Lucius Cotta likewise, a man of praetorian rank, was. <lb/>
            esteemed a tolerable orator; but he never made any great <lb/>
            progress; on the contrary, he purposely endeavoured, both in <lb/>
            the choice of his words and the rusticity of his pronunciation, <lb/>
            to imitate the manner of the ancients. I am indeed sensible <lb/>
            that in this instance of Cotta, and in many others, I have and <lb/>
            shall again insert in the list of orators those who, in reality, <lb/>
            had but little claim to the character. For it was, professedly <lb/>
            my design to collect an account of all the Romans, without <lb/>
            exception, who made it their business to excel in the profes. <lb/>
            sion of eloquence ; and it may be easily seen from this account <lb/>
            by what slow gradations they advanced, and how excessively <lb/>
            difficult it is in everything to rise to the summit of perfec- <lb/>
            tion. As a proof of this, how many orators have been already <lb/>
            recounted, and how much time have we bestowed upon them, <lb/>
            before we could ascend, after infinite fatigue and drudgery, <lb/>
            as, among the Greeks, to Demosthenes and Hyperides, so <lb/>
            now, among our own countrymen, to Antonius and Crassus! <lb/>
            For, in my mind, these were consummate orators, and the <lb/>
            first among the Romans whose diffusive eloquence rivalled the <lb/>
            glory of the Greeks.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. "Antonius comprehended everything which could <lb/>
            be of service to his cause, and he arranged his materials in. <lb/>
            the most advantageous order; and as a skilful general posts <lb/>
            the cavalry, the infantry, and the light troops, where each of <lb/>
            them can act to most advantage, so Antonius drew up his <lb/>
            arguments in those parts of his discourse, where they were. <lb/>
            likely to have the best effect. He had a quick and retentive <lb/>
            memory, and a frankness of manner which precluded any <note type="footnote"> 1 By dividing great part of them among the people. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            suspicion of artifice. All his speeches were, in appearance, <lb/>
            the unpremeditated effusions of an honest heart; and yet, in <lb/>
            reality, they were preconcerted with so much skill, that the <lb/>
            judges were sometimes not so well prepared as they, should <lb/>
            have been, to withstand the force of them. His language, <lb/>
            indeed, was not so refined as to pass for the standard of ele- <lb/>
            gance ; for which reason he was thought to be rather a care- <lb/>
            less speaker; and yet, on the other hand, it was neither. <lb/>
            vulgar nor incorrect, but of that solid and judicious turn. <lb/>
            which constitutes the real merit of an orator, as to the choice <lb/>
            of his words. For, though a purity of style is certainly, as. <lb/>
            has been observed, a very commendable quality, it is not so <lb/>
            much so for its intrinsic consequence, as because it is too gene- <lb/>
            rally neglected. In short, it is not so meritorious to speak our <lb/>
            native tongue correctly, as it is disgraceful to speak it other- <lb/>
            wise; nor is it so much the characteristic of a good orator as <lb/>
            of a well-bred citizen. But in the choice of his words (in <lb/>
            which he had more regard to their weight than their bril- <lb/>
            liance), and likewise in the structure of his language and the <lb/>
            compass of his periods, Antonius conformed himself to the <lb/>
            dictates of reason, and, in a great measure, to the nicer rules, <lb/>
            of art; though his chief excellence was a judicious manage- <lb/>
            ment of the figures and decorations of sentiment. This was <lb/>
            likewise the distinguishing excellence of Demosthenes; in <lb/>
            which he was so far superior to all others, as to be allowed, <lb/>
            in the opinion of the best judges, to be the prince of orators. <lb/>
            For the figures (as they are called by the Greeks) are the <lb/>
            principal ornaments of an able speaker;—I mean those which, <lb/>
            contribute not so much to paint and embellish our language, <lb/>
            as to give a lustre to our sentiments.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. "But besides these, of which Antonius had a <lb/>
            great command, he had a peculiar excellence in his manner of <lb/>
            delivery, both as to his voice and gesture; for the latter was <lb/>
            such as to correspond to the meaning of every sentence, <lb/>
            without beating time to the words. His hands, his shoulders, <lb/>
            the turn of his body, the stamp of his foot, his posture, his. <lb/>
            air, and, in short, all his motions, were adapted to his language <lb/>
            and sentiments; and his voice was strong and firm, though. <lb/>
            naturally hoarse,-a defect which he alone was capable of <lb/>
            improving to his advantage; for in capital causes, it had <lb/>
            a mournful dignity of accent, which was exceedingly proper <lb/>
            both to win the assent of the judges, and excite their com- <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            passion for a suffering client; so that in him the observation <lb/>
            of Demosthenes was eminently verified; who, being, asked <lb/>
            what was the first quality of a good orator, what the second, <lb/>
            and what the third, constantly replied, ‘ A good enunciation.' <lb/>
            But many thought that he was equalled, and others that he <lb/>
            was even excelled, by Lucius Crassus. All, however, were <lb/>
            agreed in this, that whoever had either of them for his advo- <lb/>
            cate, had no cause to wish for a better. For my own part, <lb/>
            notwithstanding the uncommon merit I have ascribed to <lb/>
            Antonius, I must also acknowledge, that there cannot be <lb/>
            a more finished character than that of. Crassus. He pos- <lb/>
            sessed a wonderful dignity of elocution, with an agreeable <lb/>
            mixture of wit and pleasantry, which was perfectly polished, <lb/>
            and without the smallest tincture of scurrility. His style <lb/>
            was correct and elegant, without stiffness or affectation; his <lb/>
            method of reasoning was remarkably clear and distinct; and <lb/>
            when his cause turned upon any point of law or equity, he <lb/>
            had an inexhaustible fund of arguments and comparative <lb/>
            illustrations.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. " For as Antonius had an admirable turn for sug- <lb/>
            gesting apposite hints, and either suppressing or exciting the <lb/>
            suspicions of the hearer, so no man could explain and define, <lb/>
            or discuss a point of equity, with a more copious facility <lb/>
            than Crassus; as sufficiently appeared upon many other <lb/>
            occasions, but particularly in the cause of Manius Curius, <lb/>
            which was tried before the Centumviri. For he urged a great <lb/>
            variety of arguments in the defence of right and equity, <lb/>
            against the literal jubet of the law; and supported them by <lb/>
            such a numerous series of precedents, that he overpowered <lb/>
            'Quintus Scævola (a man of uncommon penetration, and the <lb/>
            ablest civilian of his time), though the case before them was <lb/>
            only a matter of legal right. But the cause was so ably <lb/>
            managed by the two advocates, who were nearly of an age, <lb/>
            and both of consular rank, that while each endeavoured to <lb/>
            interpret the law in favour of his client, Crassus was univer- <lb/>
            sally allowed to be the best lawyer among the orators, and <lb/>
            Scævola to be the most eloquent civilian of the age; for the <lb/>
            latter could not only discover with the nicest precision what <lb/>
            was agreeable to law and equity, but had likewise a concise- <lb/>
            ness and propriety of expression, which was admirably adapted <lb/>
            to his purpose. In short, he had such a wonderful vein of <lb/>
            oratory in commenting, explaining, and discussing, that I <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            never beheld his equal; though in amplifying, embellishing, <lb/>
            and refuting, he was rather to be dreaded as a formidable <lb/>
            critic, than admired as an eloquent speaker."</p>
          <p>XL. " Indeed," said Brutus, “ though I always thought I <lb/>
            sufficiently understood the character of Scævola, by the <lb/>
            account I had heard of him from Caius Rutilius, whose <lb/>
            company I frequented for the sake of his acquaintance with <lb/>
            him, I had not the least idea of his merit as an orator. I <lb/>
            am now, therefore, not a little pleased to be informed, that <lb/>
            our republic has had the honour of producing so accom- <lb/>
            plished a man, and such an excellent genius." " Really, my <lb/>
            Brutus," said I, " you may take it from me, that the Roman <lb/>
            state had never been adorned with two finer characters than <lb/>
            these. For, as I have before observed that the one was the- <lb/>
            best lawyer among the orators, and the other the best speaker <lb/>
            among the civilians of his time; so the difference between <lb/>
            them, in all other respects, was of such a nature, that it <lb/>
            would almost be impossible for you to determine which of <lb/>
            the two you would rather choose to resemble. For, as <lb/>
            Crassus was the closest of all our elegant speakers, so Scævola <lb/>
            was the most elegant among those who were distinguished- <lb/>
            by the concise accuracy of their language; and as Crassus <lb/>
            tempered his affability with a proper share of severity, so <lb/>
            the rigid air. of Scævola was not destitute of the milder <lb/>
            graces of an affable condescension. Though this was really <lb/>
            their character, it is very possible that I may be thought to <lb/>
            have embellished it beyond the bounds of truth, to give an <lb/>
            agreeable air to my narrative; but as your favourite sect, <lb/>
            my Brutus, the old Academy, has defined all virtue to be <lb/>
            a just mediocrity, it was the constant endeavour of these two <lb/>
            eminent men to pursue this golden mean; and yet it so hap- <lb/>
            pened, that while each of them shared a part of the other's <lb/>
            excellence, he preserved his own entire." " To speak what <lb/>
            I think," replied Brutus, " I have not only acquired a proper <lb/>
            acquaintance with their characters from your account of <lb/>
            them, but I can likewise discover, that the same comparison <lb/>
            might be drawn between you and Servius Sulpicius, which <lb/>
            you have just been making between Crassus and Scævola.” <lb/>
            "In what manner?" said I. "Because you," replied Brutus, <lb/>
            " have taken the pains to acquire as extensive a knowledge of <lb/>
            the law as is necessary for an orator; and Sulpicius, on the <lb/>
            other hand, took care to furnish himself with sufficient <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            eloquence to support the character. of an able civilian. <lb/>
            Besides, your age corresponded as nearly to his, as the age of <lb/>
            Crassus did to that of Scævola.”</p>
          <p>XLI. "As to my own abilities," said I, "the rules of <lb/>
            decency forbid me to speak of them; but your character of <lb/>
            Servius is a very just one, and I may freely tell you what I <lb/>
            think of him. There are few, I believe, who have applied <lb/>
            themselves more assiduously to the art of speaking than he <lb/>
            did, or indeed to the study of every useful science. In our <lb/>
            youth, we both of us followed the same liberal exercises; and <lb/>
            he afterwards accompanied me to Rhodes, to pursue those <lb/>
            studies which might equally improve him as a man and a. <lb/>
            scholar; but when he reamed from thence, he appears to <lb/>
            me to have been rather ambitious of being the foremost <lb/>
            man in a secondary profession, than the second in that which <lb/>
            claims the highest dignity. I will not pretend to say, that <lb/>
            he could not have ranked himself among the first in the- <lb/>
            latter profession; but he rather chose to be, what he actually <lb/>
            made himself, the first lawyer of his time." . “Indeed!” <lb/>
            said Brutus: " and do you really prefer Servius to Quintus <lb/>
            Scævola?”"My opinion," said I, "Brutus, is, that Quintus <lb/>
            Scævola and many others had a thorough practical know- <lb/>
            ledge of the law; but that Servius alone understood it as. <lb/>
            a science; which he could never have done by the mere study <lb/>
            of the law, and without a previous acquaintance with the. <lb/>
            art, which teaches us to divide a whole into its subordinate <lb/>
            parts, to explain an indeterminate idea by an accurate defini- <lb/>
            tion; to illustrate what is obscure by a clear interpretation; <lb/>
            and first to discover what things are of a doubtful nature, <lb/>
            then to distinguish them by their different degrees of proba- <lb/>
            bility; and, lastly, to be provided with a certain rule or <lb/>
            measure by which we may judge what is true, and what <lb/>
            false, and what inferences fairly may or may not be deduced <lb/>
            from any given premises. This important art he applied to <lb/>
            those subjects which, for want of it, were necessarily managed <lb/>
            by others without due order and precision."</p>
          <p>. XLII. "You mean, I suppose," said Brutus, "the art of <lb/>
            logic." “You suppose very rightly,” answered I; " but he <lb/>
            added to it an extensive acquaintance with polite literature, <lb/>
            and an elegant manner of expressing himself; as is suffi- <lb/>
            ciently evident from the incomparable writings he has left <lb/>
            behind him. And as he attached himself, for the improve- <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            ment of his eloquence, to Lucius Lu cilius Balbus and Caius <lb/>
            Aquilius Gallus, two very able speakers, he effectually thwarted <lb/>
            the prompt celerity of the latter (though a keen, experienced <lb/>
            man) both in supporting and refuting a charge, by his ac- <lb/>
            curacy and precision, and overpowered the deliberate formality <lb/>
            of Balbus (a man of great learning and erudition) by his <lb/>
            adroit and dexterous method of arguing; so that he equally <lb/>
            possessed the good qualities of both, without their defects. <lb/>
            As Crassus, therefore, in my mind, acted more prudently <lb/>
            than Scævola; (for the latter was very fond of pleading <lb/>
            causes, in which he was certainly inferior to Crassus; whereas <lb/>
            the former never engaged himself in an unequal competition <lb/>
            with Scævola, by assuming the character of a civilian;) so <lb/>
            Servius pursued a plan which sufficiently discovered his <lb/>
            wisdom; for as the profession of a pleader and a lawyer are <lb/>
            both of them held in great esteem, and give those who are <lb/>
            masters of them the most extensive influence among their <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, he acquired an undisputed superiority in the <lb/>
            one, and improved himself as much in the other as was <lb/>
            necessary to support the authority of the civil law, and <lb/>
            promote him to the dignity of consul." “ This is precisely <lb/>
            the opinion I had formed of him," said Brutus. " For a few <lb/>
            years ago I heard him often, and very attentively, at Samos, <lb/>
            when I wanted to be instructed by him in the pontifical <lb/>
            law, as far as it is connected with the civil; and I am now <lb/>
            greatly confirmed in my opinion of him, by finding that it <lb/>
            coincides so exactly with yours. I am likewise not a little <lb/>
            pleased to observe, that the equality of your ages, your <lb/>
            sharing the same honours and preferments, and the affinity <lb/>
            of your respective studies and professions, has been so far <lb/>
            from precipitating either of you into that envious detraction <lb/>
            of the other's merit, which most people are tormented with, <lb/>
            that, instead of interrupting your mutual friendship, it has <lb/>
            only served to increase and strengthen it; for, to my own <lb/>
            knowledge, he had the same affection for, and the same <lb/>
            favourable sentiments of you, which I now discover in you <lb/>
            towards him. I cannot, therefore, help regretting very- sin- <lb/>
            cerely, that the Roman state has so long been deprived of <lb/>
            the benefit of his advice and of your eloquence ; a circum- <lb/>
            stance which is indeed calamitous enough in itself, but must <lb/>
            appear much more so to him who considers into what hands <lb/>
            that once respectable authority has been of late, I will not <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            say transferred, but forcibly wrested." " You certainly <lb/>
            forget," said Atticus, " that I proposed, when we began the <lb/>
            conversation, to drop all matters of state ; by all means, <lb/>
            therefore, let us keep to our plan; for if we once begin to <lb/>
            repeat our grievances, there will be no end, I need not say <lb/>
            to our inquiries, but to our sighs and lamentations."</p>
          <p>XLIII. " Let us proceed, then," said I, " without any <lb/>
            farther digression, and pursue the plan we set out upon. <lb/>
            Crassus (for he is the orator we were just speaking of) always <lb/>
            came into the forum ready prepared for the combat. He <lb/>
            was expected with impatience, and heard with pleasure. <lb/>
            When he first began his oration (which he always did in <lb/>
            a very accurate style), he seemed worthy of the great ex- <lb/>
            pectations he had raised. He was very moderate in the <lb/>
            movements of his body, had no remarkable variation of <lb/>
            voice, never advanced from the ground he stood upon, and <lb/>
            seldom stamped his foot; his language was forcible, and <lb/>
            sometimes warm and pathetic; he had many, strokes of <lb/>
            humour, which were always tempered with a becoming <lb/>
            dignity; and, what is difficult to attain, he was at once very <lb/>
            florid and very concise. In a close contest, he never met <lb/>
            with his equal; and there was scarcely any kind of causes in <lb/>
            which he had not signalised his abilities; so that he enrolled; <lb/>
            himself very early among the first orators of the time. He <lb/>
            accused Caius Carbo, though a man of great eloquence, when <lb/>
            he was but a youth; and displayed his talents in such a <lb/>
            manner, that they were not only applauded, but admired by <lb/>
            everybody. He afterwards defended the virgin Licinia,. <lb/>
            when he was only twenty-seven years of age; on which <lb/>
            occasion he discovered an uncommon share of eloquence, as <lb/>
            is evident from those parts of his oration which he left <lb/>
            behind him in writing. As he was then desirous to have the <lb/>
            honour of settling the colony of Narbonne (as he afterwards <lb/>
            did), he thought it advisable to recommend himself by under- <lb/>
            taking the management of some popular cause., His oration <lb/>
            in support of the act which was proposed for that purpose, is <lb/>
            still extant; and discovers a greater maturity of genius than <lb/>
            might have been expected at that time of life. He afterwards <lb/>
            pleaded many other causes; but his tribuneship was so re- <lb/>
            markably silent, that if he had not supped with Granius the <lb/>
            beadle when he enjoyed that office (a circumstance which <lb/>
            has been twice mentioned by Lucilius), we should scarcely <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            have known that a tribune of that name had existed." " I <lb/>
            believe so," replied Brutus; "but I have heard as little of <lb/>
            the tribuneship of Scævola, though I must naturally suppose <lb/>
            that he was the colleague of Crassus." " He was so," said I, <lb/>
            "in all his other preferments; but he was not tribune till <lb/>
            the year after him; and when he sat in the rostrum in that <lb/>
            capacity, Crassus spoke in support of the Servilian law. I <lb/>
            must observe, however, that Crassus had not Scævola for his <lb/>
            colleague in the censorship; for none of the Scævolas ever <lb/>
            solicited that office. But when the last-mentioned oration of <lb/>
            Crassus was published (which I dare say you have frequently <lb/>
            read), he was thirty-four years of age, which was exactly the <lb/>
            difference between his age and mine. For he supported the <lb/>
            law I have just been speaking of, in the very consulship <lb/>
            under which I was born; whereas he himself was born in <lb/>
            the consulship of Quintus Cæpio and Caius Lælius, about <lb/>
            three years later than Antonius. I have particularly noticed <lb/>
            this circumstance, to specify the time when the Roman <lb/>
            eloquence attained its first maturity; and was actually car- <lb/>
            ried to such a degree of perfection, as to leave no room for <lb/>
            any one to carry it higher, unless by the assistance of a more- <lb/>
            complete and extensive knowledge of philosophy, jurispru- <lb/>
            dence, and history."</p>
          <p>XLIV. " But does there," said Brutus, " or will there ever <lb/>
            exist a man, who is furnished with all the united accomplish- <lb/>
            ments you require?" "I really do not know," said I; " but <lb/>
            we have a speech made by Crassus in his consulship, in praise <lb/>
            of Quintus Cæpio, intermingled with a defence of his conduct, <lb/>
            which, though a short one if we consider it as an oration, is. <lb/>
            not so as a panegyric; and another, which was his last, <lb/>
            and which he spoke in the forty-eighth year of his age, at <lb/>
            the time he was censor. In these we have the genuine com- <lb/>
            plexion of eloquence, without any painting or disguise; but <lb/>
            his periods (I mean those of Crassus) were generally short <lb/>
            and concise; and he was fond of expressing himself in those <lb/>
            minuter sentences, or members, which the Greeks call colons" <lb/>
            " As you have spoken so largely," said Brutus, "in praise of <lb/>
            the two last-mentioned orators, I heartily wish that Antonius. <lb/>
            had left us some other specimen of his abilities than his <lb/>
            trifling essay on the art of speaking, and Crassus more than <lb/>
            he has; by so doing, they would have transmitted their fame <lb/>
            to posterity, and to us a valuable system of eloquence. For as- <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            to the elegant language of Scævola, we have sufficient proofs <lb/>
            of it in the orations he has left behind him." " For my <lb/>
            part," said I, " the oration I, was speaking of, on Cæpio's <lb/>
            case, has been a model which served to instruct me from my <lb/>
            very childhood. It supports the dignity of the senate, which <lb/>
            was deeply interested in the debate; and excites the jealousy <lb/>
            of the audience against the party of the judges and accusers, <lb/>
            whose powers it was necessary to expose in the most popular <lb/>
            terms. Many parts of it are very strong and nervous; many <lb/>
            others very cool and composed; and some are distinguished <lb/>
            by the asperity of their language, and not a few by their wit <lb/>
            and pleasantry: but much more was said than was committed <lb/>
            to writing, as is sufficiently evident from several heads of <lb/>
            the oration, which are merely proposed without any enlarge- <lb/>
            ment or explanation. But the oration in his censorship <lb/>
            against his colleague Cneius Domitius, is not so much an <lb/>
            oration as an analysis of the subject, or a general sketch of <lb/>
            what he had said, with here and there a few ornamental <lb/>
            touches, by way of specimen; for no contest was ever con- <lb/>
            ducted with greater spirit than this. Crassus, however, was <lb/>
            eminently distinguished by the popular turn of his language; <lb/>
            but that of Antonius was better adapted to judicial trials <lb/>
            than to a public debate.</p>
          <p>XLV. " As we have had occasion to mention him, Domitius <lb/>
            himself must not be left unnoticed; for though he is not <lb/>
            enrolled in the list of orators, he had a sufficient share, both <lb/>
            of utterance and genius, to support his character as a magis- <lb/>
            trate, and his dignity as a consul. I might likewise observe <lb/>
            of Caius Cælius, that he was a man of great application and <lb/>
            many eminent qualities, and had eloquence enough to support <lb/>
            the private interests of his friends, and his own dignity in <lb/>
            the state. At the same time lived Marcus Herennius, who <lb/>
            was reckoned among the middling orators, whose principal <lb/>
            . merit was the purity and correctness of their language; and <lb/>
            yet, in a suit for the consulship, he got. the -better of Lucius <lb/>
            Philippus, a man of the first rank and family, and of the <lb/>
            most extensive connexions, and who was likewise a member <lb/>
            of the college, and a very eloquent speaker. Then also lived <lb/>
            Caius Clodius, who, besides his consequence as a nobleman of <lb/>
            the first distinction and a man of the most powerful influence., <lb/>
            was likewise possessed cf a moderate share of eloquence. <lb/>
            Nearly of the same age was Caius Titius, a Roman knight <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            who, in my judgment, arrived at as high a degree of per- <lb/>
            tection as a Roman orator was able to do, without the assist- <lb/>
            anco of the Grecian literature, and a good share of practice. <lb/>
            His orations have so many delicate turns, such a number of <lb/>
            well-chosen examples, and such an agreeable vein of polite- <lb/>
            ness, that they almost seem to have been composed in the <lb/>
            true Attic style. He likewise transferred his delicacies into <lb/>
            his tragedies, with ingenuity enough, I confess, but not in <lb/>
            the tragic taste. But the poet Lucius Afranius, whom he <lb/>
            studiously imitated, was a very lively writer, and, as you <lb/>
            well know, possessed great dramatic eloquence. Quintus <lb/>
            Rubrius Varro, who with Caius Marius was declared an <lb/>
            enemy by the senate, was likewise a warm and very spirited <lb/>
            prosecutor. My relation, Marcus Gratidius, was a plausible <lb/>
            speaker of the same kind, well versed in Grecian literature, <lb/>
            formed by nature for the profession of eloquence, and an <lb/>
            intimate acquaintance of Marcus Antonius; he commanded <lb/>
            under him in Cilicia, where he lost his life; and he once <lb/>
            commenced a prosecution against Caius Fimbria, the father <lb/>
            of Marcus Marius Gratidianus.</p>
          <p>XLVI. " There have likewise been several among the <lb/>
            allies, and the Latins, who were esteemed good orators; as, <lb/>
            for instance, Quintus Vettius of Vettium, one of the Marsi, <lb/>
            whom I myself was acquainted with, a man of sense, and <lb/>
            a concise speaker; the Valerii, Quintus and Decimus, of Sora, <lb/>
            my neighbours and acquaintances, who were not so remark- <lb/>
            able for their talent in speaking, as for their skill both in <lb/>
            Greek and Roman literature ; and Caius Rusticellus of <lb/>
            Bononia, an experienced orator, and a man of great natural <lb/>
            volubility. But the most eloquent of all those who were not <lb/>
            citizens of Rome, was Tiberius Betucius Barrus of Asculum, <lb/>
            some of whose orations, which were spoken in that city, are <lb/>
            still extant; that which he made at Rome against Cæpio, is <lb/>
            really excellent; the speech which Crepio delivered in answer <lb/>
            to it, was made by Ælius, who composed a number of orations, <lb/>
            but pronounced none himself. But among those of a re- <lb/>
            moter date, Lucius Papirius of Fregellæ in Latium, who was <lb/>
            almost contemporary with Tiberius Gracchus, was universally <lb/>
            esteemed the most eloquent; we have a speech of his in vin- <lb/>
            dication of the Fregellans, and the Latin colonies, which was <lb/>
            delivered before the senate." " And what then is the merit," <lb/>
            said Brutus, " which you mean to ascribe to these provincial <note type="footnote"> <unclear>ft</unclear> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            orators?" "What else," replied I, " but the very same which <lb/>
            I have ascribed to the city orators ; excepting that their lan- <lb/>
            guage is not tinctured with the same fashionable delicacy." <lb/>
            "What fashionable delicacy do you mean?" said he: "I <lb/>
            cannot," said I, " pretend to define it; I only know that <lb/>
            there is such a quality existing. When you go to your pro- <lb/>
            vince in Gaul, you will be convinced of it. You will there <lb/>
            find many expressions which are not current in Rome; but <lb/>
            these may be easily changed, and corrected. But what is of <lb/>
            greater importance, our orators have a particular accent in <lb/>
            their manner of pronouncing, which is more elegant, and has <lb/>
            a more agreeable effect than any other. This, however, is <lb/>
            not peculiar to the orators, but is equally common to every <lb/>
            well-bred citizen. I myself remember that Titus Tineas, of <lb/>
            Placentia, who was a very facetious man, once engaged in <lb/>
            raillery with my old friend Quintus Granius, the public <lb/>
            crier." " Do you mean that Granius," said Brutus, " of whom <lb/>
            Lucilius has related such a number of stories?" " The very <lb/>
            same, said I; " but though Tincas said as many smart <lb/>
            things as the other, Granius at, last overpowered him by a <lb/>
            certain vernacular goat, which gave an additional relish to his <lb/>
            humour; so that I am no longer surprised at what is said to <lb/>
            have happened to Theophrastus, when he inquired of an old <lb/>
            woman who kept a stall, what was the price of something <lb/>
            which he wanted to purchase. After telling him the value of <lb/>
            it, ' Honest stranger,' said she, ' I cannot afford it for less;' an <lb/>
            answer which nettled him not a little, to think that he who <lb/>
            had resided almost all his life at Athens, and spoke the lan- <lb/>
            guage very correctly, should be taken at last for a foreigner. <lb/>
            In the same manner, there is, in my opinion, a certain accent <lb/>
            as peculiar to the native citizens of Rome, as the other was to <lb/>
            those of Athens. But it is time for us to return-home; I <lb/>
            mean, to the orators of our own growth.</p>
          <p>XLVII. " Next, therefore, to the two capital speakers <lb/>
            above-mentioned, (that is, Crassus and Antonius,) came Lucius <lb/>
            Philippus,—not indeed till a considerable time afterwards; <lb/>
            but still he must be reckoned the next. I do not mean, <lb/>
            however, though nobody appeared in the interim who could <lb/>
            dispute the prize with him, that he was entitled to the <lb/>
            second, or even the third post of honour. For as in a chariot- <lb/>
            race I cannot properly consider him as either the second or <lb/>
            third winner, who has scarcely got clear of the starting-post, <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            before the first has reached the goal; so. among orators, I <lb/>
            can scarcely honour him with the name of a competitor, who <lb/>
            has been so far distanced by the foremost as hardly to appear <lb/>
            on the same ground with him. But yet there were certainly <lb/>
            some talents to be observed in Philippus,: which any person <lb/>
            who considers them, without subjecting them to a comparison <lb/>
            with the superior merits of the two before-mentioned, must <lb/>
            allow to have been respectable. He had an uncommon free- <lb/>
            dom of address, a large fund of humour, great facility in the <lb/>
            invention of his sentiments, and a ready and easy manner of <lb/>
            expressing them. He was likewise, for the time he lived in, <lb/>
            a great adept in the literature of the Greeks; and, in the heat <lb/>
            of a debate, he could sting, and lash, as well as ridicule his <lb/>
            opponents. Almost contemporary with these was Lucius <lb/>
            Gellius, who was not so much to be valued for his positive, <lb/>
            as for his negative merits; for he was neither destitute of <lb/>
            learning, nor invention, nor unacquainted with the history <lb/>
            and the laws of his country ; besides which, he had a tolerable <lb/>
            freedom of expression. 'But he happened to live at a time <lb/>
            when many excellent orators made their appearance; and yet <lb/>
            he served his friends upon many occasions to good purpose, <lb/>
            in short, his life was so long, that he was successively con- <lb/>
            temporary with a variety of orators of different periods, and <lb/>
            had an extensive series of practice in judicial causes. Nearly <lb/>
            at the same time lived Decimus Brutus, who was fellow- <lb/>
            consul with Mamercus; and was equally skilled both in the <lb/>
            Grecian and Roman literature. Lucius Scipio likewise was <lb/>
            not an unskilful speaker; and Cnæus Pompeius, the son of <lb/>
            Sextus, had some reputation as an orator; for his brother <lb/>
            Sextus applied the excellent genius he was possessed of, to <lb/>
            acquire a thorough knowledge of the civil law, and a complete <lb/>
            acquaintance with geometry and the doctrine of the Stoics. <lb/>
            A little before these, Marcus Brutus, and very soon after <lb/>
            him Caius Bilienus, who was a man of great natural capacity, <lb/>
            made themselves, by nearly the same application, equally <lb/>
            eminent in the profession of the law; the latter would, have <lb/>
            been chosen consul, if he had not been thwarted by the <lb/>
            repeated promotion of Marius, and some other collateral em- <lb/>
            barrassments which attended his suit. But the eloquence of <lb/>
            Cnæus' Octavius, which was wholly unknown ' before his <lb/>
            elevation to the consulship, was effectually displayed, after his <lb/>
            preferment to that office, in a great variety of speeches. It is, <note type="footnote">G G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            however, time for us to drop those who were only classed in <lb/>
            the number of good speakers, and turn our attention to such <lb/>
            as were really orators."</p>
          <p>" I think so too," replied Atticus ; " for I understood that <lb/>
            you meant to give us an account, not of those who took great <lb/>
            pains to be eloquent, but of those who were so in reality."</p>
          <p>XLVIII. " Caius Julius then," said I, " (the son of Lucius,) <lb/>
            was certainly superior, not only to his predecessors, but to all <lb/>
            his contemporaries, in wit and humour; he was not, indeed, <lb/>
            a nervous and striking orator, but, in the elegance, the plea- <lb/>
            santry, and the agreeableness of his manner, he has not been <lb/>
            excelled by any man. There are some orations of his still <lb/>
            extant, in which, as well as in his tragedies, we may discover <lb/>
            a pleasing tranquillity of expression with very little energy. <lb/>
            Publius Cethegus, his equal in age, had always enough to say <lb/>
            on matters of civil regulation; for he had studied and com- <lb/>
            prehended them with the minutest accuracy ; by which <lb/>
            means he acquired an equal authority in the senate with those <lb/>
            who had served the office of consul, and though he made no <lb/>
            figure in a public debate, he was a serviceable veteran in any <lb/>
            suit of a private nature. Quintus Lucretius Vispillo was an <lb/>
            acute speaker, and a good civilian in the same kind of <lb/>
            causes; but Osella was better qualified for a public harangue <lb/>
            than to conduct a judicial process. Titus Annius Velina <lb/>
            was likewise a man of sense, and a tolerable pleader; and <lb/>
            Titus Juventius had a great deal of practice in the same <lb/>
            way: the latter indeed was rather too heavy and inani- <lb/>
            mate, but at the same time was keen and artful, and <lb/>
            knew how to seize every advantage which was offered by his <lb/>
            antagonist; to which we may add, that he was far from <lb/>
            being a man of no literature, but had an extensive knowledge <lb/>
            of the civil law. His scholar, Publius Orbius, who was almost <lb/>
            contemporary with me, had no great practice as a pleader ; <lb/>
            but his skill in the civil law was in no respect inferior to his <lb/>
            master's. As to Titus Aufidius, who lived to a great age, he <lb/>
            was a professed imitator of both; and was indeed a worthy <lb/>
            inoffensive man; but he seldom spoke at the bar. His <lb/>
            brother, Marcus Virgilius, who, when he was a tribune of the <lb/>
            people, commenced a- prosecution against Lucius Sylla, then <lb/>
            advanced to the rank of general had as little practice as Aufi- <lb/>
            dius. Virgilius's colleague,' Publius Magius, was more copious <lb/>
            and diffusive. But of all the orators, or rather ranters, I ever <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            knew who were totally illiterate and unpolished, and (I might <lb/>
            have added) absolutely coarse and rustic, the readiest and <lb/>
            keenest were Quintus Sertorius, and Caius Gorgonius, the <lb/>
            one of consular, and the other of equestrian rank. Titus <lb/>
            Junius (the son of Lucius), who had served the office cf tri- <lb/>
            bune, and prosecuted and convicted Publius Sextius of bribery, <lb/>
            when he was prætor elect, was a prompt and an easy speaker; <lb/>
            he lived in great splendour, and had a very promising genius; <lb/>
            and, if he had not been of a weak, and indeed a sickly con- <lb/>
            stitution, he would have advanced much further than he did <lb/>
            in the road to preferment.</p>
          <p>XLIX. " I am sensible, however, that in the account I <lb/>
            have been giving, I have included many who were neither <lb/>
            real, nor reputed orators; and that I have omitted others, <lb/>
            among those of a remoter date, who well deserved not only to <lb/>
            have been mentioned, but to be recorded with honour. But <lb/>
            this I was forced to do, for want of better information; for <lb/>
            what could I say concerning men of a distant age, none of <lb/>
            whose productions are now remaining, and of whom no <lb/>
            mention is made in the writings of other people ? But I have <lb/>
            omitted none of those who have fallen within the compass of <lb/>
            my own knowledge, or that I myself remember to have <lb/>
            heard. For I wish to make it appear, that in such a powerful <lb/>
            and ancient republic as ours, in which the greatest rewards <lb/>
            have been proposed to eloquence, though all have desired to <lb/>
            be good speakers, not many have attempted the task, and but <lb/>
            very few have succeeded. But I shall give my opinion of <lb/>
            every one in such explicit terms, that it may be easily under- <lb/>
            stood whom I consider as a mere declaimer, and whom as an <lb/>
            orator. About the same time, or rather something later than <lb/>
            the above-mentioned Julius, but almost contemporary with <lb/>
            each other, were Caius Cotta, Publius Sulpicius, Quintus <lb/>
            Varius, Cnæus Pomponius, Caius Curio, Lucius Fufius, Mar- <lb/>
            cus Drusus, and Publius Antistius; for no age whatsoever <lb/>
            has been distinguished by a more numerous progeny of <lb/>
            orators. Of these, Cotta and Sulpicius, both in my opinion <lb/>
            and in that of the public at large, had an evident claim to the <lb/>
            preference." " But wherefore," interrupted Atticus, " do you <lb/>
            say, in your own opinion, and in that of the public at large f <lb/>
            In deciding the merits of an orator, does the opinion of the <lb/>
            vulgar, think you, always coincide with that of the learned ? <lb/>
            Or rather, does not one receive the approbation of the populace, <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            while another of a quite opposite character is preferred by <lb/>
            those who arc better qualified to give their judgment?" " You <lb/>
            have started a very pertinent question," said I; " but, perhaps, <lb/>
            the public at large will not approve my answer to it." " And <lb/>
            what concern need that give you," replied Atticus, " if it meets <lb/>
            the approbation of Brutus?" " Very true," said I; " for I had <lb/>
            rather my sentiments on the qualifications of an orator should <lb/>
            please you and Brutus, than all the world besides; but as to <lb/>
            my eloquence, I should wish this to please every one. For he <lb/>
            who speaks in such a manner as to please the people, must <lb/>
            inevitably receive the approbation of the learned. As to the <lb/>
            truth and propriety of what I hear, I am indeed to judge of <lb/>
            this for myself, as well as I am able; but the general merit <lb/>
            of an orator must and will be decided by the effects <unclear>whicLis</unclear> <lb/>
            eloquence produces. For (in my opinion at least) there are <lb/>
            three things which an orator should be able to effect; viz. <lb/>
            to inform his hearers, to please them, and to move their <lb/>
            passions. By what qualities in the speaker each of these <lb/>
            effects may be produced, or by what deficiencies they are <lb/>
            either lost, or but imperfectly performed, is an inquiry which <lb/>
            none but an artist can resolve; but whether an audience is <lb/>
            really so affected by an orator as shall best answer his pur- <lb/>
            pose, must be left to their own feelings, and the decision <lb/>
            of the public. The learned therefore, and the people at large, <lb/>
            have never disagreed about who was a good orator, and who <lb/>
            was otherwise.</p>
          <p>L. " For do you suppose, that while the speakers above- <lb/>
            mentioned were in being, they had not the same degree of <lb/>
            reputation among the learned as among the populace? If you <lb/>
            had inquired of one of the latter, who was the most eloquent <lb/>
            man in the city, he might have hesitated whether to say <lb/>
            Antonius or Crassus; or this man, perhaps, would have men- <lb/>
            tioned the one, and that the other. But would any one have <lb/>
            given the preference to Philippus, though otherwise a smooth, <lb/>
            a sensible, and a facetious speaker ?-that Philippus whom <lb/>
            we, who form our judgment upon these matters by rules of <lb/>
            art, have decided to have been the next in merit ? Nobody <lb/>
            would, I am certain. For it is the invariable prerogative of <lb/>
            an accomplished orator, to be reckoned such in the opinion <lb/>
            of the people. Though Antigenidas, therefore, the musician, <lb/>
            might say to his scholar, who was but coldly received by the <lb/>
            public, Play on, to please me and the Muses; 1 shall say tc <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            my friend Brutus, when he mounts the rostra. as he frequently <lb/>
            does, Play to me and the people; that those who hear him <lb/>
            may be sensible of the effect of his eloquence, while I can <lb/>
            likewise amuse myself with remarking the causes which pro- <lb/>
            duce it. When a citizen hears an able orator, he readily <lb/>
            credits what is said; he imagines everything to be true, he <lb/>
            believes and relishes the force of it; and, in short, the per- <lb/>
            suasive language of the speaker wins his absolute, his hearty <lb/>
            assent. You, who are possessed of a critical knowledge of the <lb/>
            art, what more will you require ? The listening multitude is <lb/>
            charmed and captivated by the force of his eloquence, and <lb/>
            feels a pleasure which is not to be resisted. What here can <lb/>
            you find to censure ? The whole audience is either flushed <lb/>
            with joy, or overwhelmed with grief; it smiles or weeps, <lb/>
            it loves or hates, it, scorns or envies, and, in short, is <lb/>
            alternately seized with the various emotions of pity, shame, <lb/>
            remorse, resentment, wonder, hope, and fear, according as it <lb/>
            is influenced by the language, the sentiments, and the action <lb/>
            of the speaker. In this case, what necessity is there to await <lb/>
            the sanction of a critic ? For here, whatever is approved by <lb/>
            the feelings of the people, must be equally so by men of <lb/>
            taste and erudition ; and, in this instance of public decision, <lb/>
            there can be no disagreement between the opinion of the <lb/>
            vulgar, and that of the learned. For though many good <lb/>
            speakers have appeared in every species of oratory, which of <lb/>
            them who was thought to excel the rest in the judgment <lb/>
            of the populace, was not approved as such by every man of <lb/>
            learning? or which of our ancestors, when the choice of <lb/>
            a pleader was left to his own option, did not immediately fix <lb/>
            it either upon Crassus or Antonius There were certainly <lb/>
            many others to be had; but though any person might have <lb/>
            hesitated to which of the above two he should give the pre- <lb/>
            ference, there was nobody, I believe, who would have made <lb/>
            choice of a third. And in the time of my youth, when Cotta <lb/>
            and Hortensius were in such high reputation, who, that had <lb/>
            liberty to choose for himself, would have employed any other?"</p>
          <p>LI. " But what occasion is there," said Brutus, " to quote <lb/>
            the example of other speakers to support your assertion? <lb/>
            have we not seen what has always been the wish of the de- <lb/>
            fendant, and what the judgment of Hortensius, concerning <lb/>
            yourself? for whenever the latter shared a cause with ycu, <lb/>
            (and I was often present on those occasions,) the peroration. <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            which requires the greatest exertion of the powers of elo- <lb/>
            quence, was constantly left to you." " It was" said I; " and <lb/>
            Hortensius (induced, I suppose, by the warmth of his friend- <lb/>
            ship) always resigned the post of honour to me. But, as to <lb/>
            myself, what rank I hold in the opinion of the people I am <lb/>
            unable to determine; as to others, however, I may safely <lb/>
            assert, that such of them as were reckoned most eloquent in <lb/>
            the judgment of the vulgar, were equally high in the esti- <lb/>
            mation of the learned. For even Demosthenes himself could <lb/>
            not have said what is related of Antimachus, a poet of Claros, <lb/>
            who, when he was rehearsing to an audience, assembled for <lb/>
            the purpose, that voluminous piece of his which you are well <lb/>
            acquainted with, and was deserted by all his hearers except <lb/>
            Plato, in the midst of his performance, cried out, I shall pro- <lb/>
            ceed notwithstanding; for Plato alone is of more consequence <lb/>
            to me than many thousands. The remark was very just. For <lb/>
            an abstruse poem, such as his, only requires the approbation <lb/>
            of the judicious few; but a discourse intended for the people <lb/>
            should be perfectly suited to their taste. If Demosthenes, <lb/>
            therefore, after being deserted by the rest of his audience, <lb/>
            had even Plato left to hear him, and no one else, I will <lb/>
            answer for it, he could not have uttered another syllable. Nor <lb/>
            could you yourself, my Brutus, if the whole assembly were to <lb/>
            leave you, as it once did Curio ?" " To open my whole mind <lb/>
            to you," replied he, " I must confess that even in such causes <lb/>
            as fall under the cognisance of a few select judges, and not of <lb/>
            the people at large, if I were to be deserted by the casual <lb/>
            crowd who came to hear the trial, I should not be able to <lb/>
            proceed." " The case, then, is plainly this," said I: "as a <lb/>
            flute, which will not return its proper sound when it is applied <lb/>
            to the lips, would be laid aside by the musician as useless; <lb/>
            so, the ears of the people are the instrument upon which an <lb/>
            orator is to play ; and if these refuse to admit the breath he <lb/>
            bestows upon them, or if the hearer, like a restive horse, will <lb/>
            not obey the spur, the speaker must cease to exert himself <lb/>
            any further.</p>
          <p>LII. " There is, however, this exception to be made; the <lb/>
            people sometimes give their approbation to an orator who <lb/>
            does not deserve it. But even here they approve what they <lb/>
            have had no opportunity of comparing with something better; <lb/>
            as, for instance, when they are pleased with an indifferent or, <lb/>
            perhaps, a bad speaker. His abilities satisfy their expectation; <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            they have seen nothing preferable; and, therefore, the merit <lb/>
            of the day, whatever it may happen to be, meets their full <lb/>
            applause. For even a middling orator, if he is possessed of <lb/>
            any degree of eloquence, will always captivate the ear; and <lb/>
            the order and beauty of a good discourse has an astonishing <lb/>
            effect upon the human mind. Accordingly, what common <lb/>
            hearer who was present when Quintus Scævola pleaded for <lb/>
            Mucius Coponius, in the cause above-mentioned, would <lb/>
            have wished for, or indeed thought it possible to find any- <lb/>
            thing which was more correct, more elegant, or more com- <lb/>
            plete ? When he attempted to prove, that, as Mucius Curius <lb/>
            was left heir to the estate only in case of the death of his <lb/>
            future ward before he came of age, he could not possibly be <lb/>
            a legal heir, when the expected ward was never born; what <lb/>
            did he leave unsaid of the scrupulous regard which should be <lb/>
            paid to the literal meaning of every testament ? what of the <lb/>
            accuracy and preciseness of the old and established forms of <lb/>
            law ? and how carefully did he specify the manner in which <lb/>
            the will would have been expressed, if it had intended that <lb/>
            Curius should be the heir in case of a total default of issue ? <lb/>
            in what a masterly manner did he represent the ill conse- <lb/>
            quences to the public, if the letter of a will should be dis- <lb/>
            regarded, its intention decided by arbitrary conjectures, and <lb/>
            the written bequests of plain illiterate men left to the artful <lb/>
            interpretation of a pleader ? how often did he urge the autho- <lb/>
            rity of his father, who had always been an advocate for a <lb/>
            strict adherence to the letter of a testament ? and with what <lb/>
            emphasis did he enlarge upon the necessity of supporting the <lb/>
            common forms of law ? All which particulars he discussed <lb/>
            not only with great art and ingenuity; but in such a neat, <lb/>
            such a close, and, I may add, in so florid and so elegant <lb/>
            a style, that there was not a single person among the common <lb/>
            part of the audience, who could expect anything more com- <lb/>
            plete, or even think it possible to exist.</p>
          <p>LIII. " But when Crassus, who spoke on the opposite side, <lb/>
            began with the story of a notable youth, who, having found <lb/>
            an oar-niche of a boat as he was rambling along the shore, <lb/>
            took it into his head that he would build a boat to it; and <lb/>
            when he applied the tale to Scævola, who, from the oar-niche <lb/>
            of an argument [which he had deduced from certain imagi- <lb/>
            nary ill consequences to the public], represented the decision <lb/>
            of a private will to be a matter of such importance as to <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            deserve the attention of the Centumviri; when Crassus, I say, <lb/>
            in the beginning of his discourse, had thus taken off the edge <lb/>
            " of the strongest plea of his antagonist, he entertained his <lb/>
            hearers with many other turns of a similar kind; and, in a <lb/>
            short time, changed the serious apprehensions of all who were <lb/>
            present into open mirth and good-humour; which is one of <lb/>
            those three effects which I have just observed an orator should <lb/>
            be able to produce. He then proceeded to remark that it was <lb/>
            evidently the intention and the will of the testator, that in <lb/>
            case, either by death, or default of issue, there should happen <lb/>
            to be no son to fall to his charge, the inheritance should <lb/>
            devolve to Curius; that most people in a similar case would <lb/>
            express themselves in the same manner, and that it would <lb/>
            certainly stand good in law, and always had. By these, and <lb/>
            many other observations of the same kind, he gained the <lb/>
            assent of his hearers; which is another of the three duties of <lb/>
            an orator. Lastly, he supported, at all events, the true mean- <lb/>
            , ing and spirit of a will, against the literal construction; justly <lb/>
            observing, that there would be an endless cavilling about <lb/>
            words, not only in wills, but in all other legal deeds, if the <lb/>
            real intention of the party were to be disregarded; and hint- <lb/>
            ing very smartly, that his friend Scævola had assumed a most <lb/>
            unwarrantable degree of importance, if no person must after- <lb/>
            wards presume to indite a legacy, but in the musty form <lb/>
            which he himself might please to prescribe. As he enlarged <lb/>
            on each of these arguments with great force and propriety, <lb/>
            supported them by a number of precedents, exhibited them <lb/>
            in a variety of views, and enlivened them with many occa- <lb/>
            sional turns of wit and pleasantry, he gained so much applause, <lb/>
            and gave such general satisfaction, that it was scarcely remem- <lb/>
            bered that anything had been said on the contrary side of the <lb/>
            question. This was the third, and the most important duty <lb/>
            we assigned to an orator. Here, if one of the people were to <lb/>
            be judge, the same person who had heard the first speaker <lb/>
            with a degree of admiration, would, on hearing the second, <lb/>
            despise himself for his former want of judgment; whereas <lb/>
            a man of taste and erudition, on hearing Scævola, would have <lb/>
            observed that he was really master of a rich and ornamental <lb/>
            style ; but if, on comparing the manner in which each ot <lb/>
            them concluded his cause, it was to be inquired which of the <lb/>
            two was the best orator, the decision of the man of learning <lb/>
            would not have differed from that of the vulgar.</p><pb n="459"/>
            
          <p>LIV; " What advantage, then, it will be said, has the <lb/>
            skilful critic over the illiterate hearer? A great and very <lb/>
            important advantage; if it is indeed a matter of any conse- <lb/>
            quence, to be able to discover by what means that which is <lb/>
            the true and real end of speaking, is either obtained or lost. <lb/>
            He has likewise this additional superiority, that when two or <lb/>
            more orators, as has frequently happened, have shared the <lb/>
            applauses of the public, he can judge, on a careful observation <lb/>
            of the principal merits of each, what is the most perfect cha- <lb/>
            racter of eloquence; since whatever does not meet the appro- <lb/>
            bation of the people, must be equally condemned by a more <lb/>
            intelligent hearer. For as it is easily understood by the <lb/>
            sound of a harp, whether the strings are skilfully touched; <lb/>
            so it may likewise be discovered from the manner in which <lb/>
            the passions of an audience are affected, how far the speaker <lb/>
            is able to command them. A man, therefore, who is a real <lb/>
            connoisseur in the art, can sometimes by a single glance, as <lb/>
            he passes through the forum, and without stopping to listen <lb/>
            attentively to what is said, form a tolerable judgment of the <lb/>
            ability of the speaker. When he observes any of the bench <lb/>
            either yawning, or speaking to the person who is next to him, <lb/>
            or looking carelessly about him, or sending to inquire the <lb/>
            time of day, or teazing the quæsitor to dismiss the court; he <lb/>
            concludes very naturally that the cause upon trial is not <lb/>
            pleaded by an orator who understands how to apply the <lb/>
            powers of language to the passions of the judges, as a skilful <lb/>
            musician applies his fingers to the harp. On the other hand, <lb/>
            if, as he passes by, he beholds the judges looking attentively <lb/>
            before them, as if they were either receiving some material <lb/>
            information, or visibly approved what they had already heard ; <lb/>
            if he sees them listening to the voice of the pleader with <lb/>
            a kind of ecstasy, like a fond bird to some melodious tune; <lb/>
            and, above all, if he discovers in their looks any strong indi- <lb/>
            cations of pity, abhorrence, or any other emotion of the <lb/>
            mind; though he should not be near enough to hear a single <lb/>
            word, he immediately discovers that the cause is managed <lb/>
            by a real orator, who is either performing, or has already <lb/>
            played his part to good purpose."</p>
          <p>LV. After I had concluded these digressive remarks, my <lb/>
            two friends were kind enough to signify their approbation, <lb/>
            and I resumed my subject. " As this digression," said I, " took <lb/>
            its rise from Cotta and Sulpicius, whom I mentioned as the <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            two most approved orators of the age they lived in, I shall <lb/>
            first return to them, and afterwards notice the rest in their <lb/>
            proper order, according to the plan we began upon. I have <lb/>
            already observed that there are two classes of good orators <lb/>
            (for we have no concern with any others), of which the former <lb/>
            are distinguished by the simple neatness and brevity of their <lb/>
            language, and the latter by their copious dignity and eleva- <lb/>
            tion ; but although the preference must always be given to <lb/>
            that which is great and striking; yet, in speakers of real <lb/>
            merit, whatever is most perfect of the kind, is justly entitled <lb/>
            to our commendation. It must, however, be observed, that <lb/>
            the close and simple orator should be careful not to sink into <lb/>
            a dryness and poverty of expression; while, on the other <lb/>
            hand, the copious and more stately speaker should be equally <lb/>
            on his guard against a swelling and empty parade of words. <lb/>
            To begin with Cotta, he had a ready, quick invention, and <lb/>
            spoke correctly and freely; and as he very prudently avoided <lb/>
            every forcible exertion of his voice, on account of the weak- <lb/>
            .ness of his lungs, so his language was equally adapted to the <lb/>
            delicacy of his constitution. There was nothing in his style <lb/>
            but what was neat, compact, and healthy; and (what may <lb/>
            justly be considered as his greatest excellence) though he was <lb/>
            scarcely able, and therefore never attempted to force the <lb/>
            passions of the judges by a strong and spirited elocution, yet <lb/>
            he managed them so artfully, that the gentle emotions he <lb/>
            raised in them, answered exactly the same purpose, and pro- <lb/>
            duced the same effect, as the violent ones which were excited <lb/>
            by Sulpicius. For Sulpicius was really the most striking, and, <lb/>
            if I may be allowed the expression, the most tragical oratot <lb/>
            I ever heard : his voice was strong and sonorous, and yet sweet <lb/>
            and flowing; his gesture and his deportment were graceful <lb/>
            and ornamental, but in such a style as to appear to have been <lb/>
            formed for the forum, and not for the stage ; and his language, <lb/>
            though rapid and voluble, was neither loose nor exuberant. <lb/>
            He was a professed imitator of Crassus, while Cotta chose <lb/>
            Antonius for his model; but the latter wanted the force of <lb/>
            Antonius, and the former the agreeable humour of Crassus."</p>
          <p>" How extremely difficult, then," said Brutus, " must be <lb/>
            the art of speaking, when such consummate orators as these <lb/>
            were each of them destitute of one of its principal beauties !" <lb/>
            LVI. "'We may likewise observe," said I, "in the present <lb/>
            instance, that two orators may have the highest degree of <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            I merit, who are totally unlike each other; for none could be <lb/>
            more so than Cotta and Sulpicius, and yet both of them were <lb/>
            far superior to any of their contemporaries. It is therefore <lb/>
            the business of every intelligent master to notice what is the <lb/>
            natural bent of his pupil's capacity; and taking that for his <lb/>
            guide, to imitate the conduct of lacerates with his two scho- <lb/>
            lars Theopompus and Ephorus, who, after remarking the lively <lb/>
            genius of the former, and the mild and timid bashfulness of <lb/>
            the latter, is reported to have said, that he applied a spur to <lb/>
            the one, and a curb to the other. The orations now extant, <lb/>
            which bear the name of Sulpicius, are supposed to have been <lb/>
            written after his decease by my contemporary Publius Ca- <lb/>
            nutius, a man indeed of inferior rank, but who, in my mind, <lb/>
            had a great command of language. But we have not a single <lb/>
            speech of Sulpicius that was really his own; for I have often <lb/>
            heard him say, that he neither had, nor ever could commit <lb/>
            anything of the kind to writing. And as to Cotta's speech <lb/>
            in defence of himself, called a vindication of the Varian law, <lb/>
            it was composed, at his own request, by Lucius Ælius. This <lb/>
            Ælius was a man of merit, and a very worthy Roman knight, <lb/>
            who was thoroughly versed in Greek and Roman literature. <lb/>
            He had likewise a critical knowledge of the antiquities <lb/>
            of his country, both as to the date and particulars of every <lb/>
            new improvement, and every memorable transaction, and <lb/>
            was perfectly well read in the ancient writers; a branch of <lb/>
            learning in which he was succeeded by our friend Varro, a <lb/>
            man of genius, and of the most extensive erudition, who after- <lb/>
            wards enlarged the plan by many valuable collections of his <lb/>
            own, and gave a much fuller and more elegant system of it to <lb/>
            the public. For Ælius himself chose to assume the character <lb/>
            of a Stoic, and neither aimed to be, nor ever was an orator; <lb/>
            but he composed several orations for other people to pro- <lb/>
            nounce ; as, for Quintus Metellus, Fabius Quintus Cæpio, and <lb/>
            Quintus Pompeius Rufus; though the latter composed those <lb/>
            speeches himself which he spoke in his own defence, but not <lb/>
            without the assistance of Ælius. For I myself was present <lb/>
            at the writing of them, in the younger part of my life, when I <lb/>
            used to attend Ælius for the benefit of his instructions. But <lb/>
            I am surprised that Cetta, who was really an excellent orator, <lb/>
            and a man of good learning, should be willing that the trifling <lb/>
            speeches of Ælius should be published to the world as his.</p>
          <p>LVII. " To the two above-mentioned, no third person of <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            the same age was esteemed an equal; Pomponins, however <lb/>
            was a. speaker much to my taste; or, at least, I have very <lb/>
            little fault to find with him. But there was no employment <lb/>
            for any in capital causes, excepting for those I have already <lb/>
            mentioned; because Antonius, who was always courted on <lb/>
            these occasions, was very ready to give his service; and <lb/>
            Crassus, though not so compilable, generally consented, on <lb/>
            any pressing solicitation, to give his. Those who had not <lb/>
            interest enough to engage either of these, commonly applied <lb/>
            to Philippus or Cæsar; but when Cotta and Sulpicius were at <lb/>
            liberty, they generally had the preference; so that all the <lb/>
            causes in which any honour was to be acquired, were pleaded <lb/>
            by these six orators. We may add, that trials were not so <lb/>
            frequent then as they are at present ; neither did people <lb/>
            employ, as they do now, several pleaders on the same side of <lb/>
            the question ; a practice which is attended with. many dis- <lb/>
            advantages. For hereby we are often obliged to speak in <lb/>
            reply to those whom we had not an opportunity of hearing; <lb/>
            in which case, what has been alleged on the opposite side, is <lb/>
            often represented to us either falsely or imperfectly; and <lb/>
            besides, it is a very material circumstance, that I myself <lb/>
            should be present to see with what countenance my antago- <lb/>
            nist supports his allegations, and, still more so, to observe <lb/>
            the effect of every part of his discourse upon the audience. <lb/>
            And as every defence should be conducted upon one uniform <lb/>
            plan, nothing can be more improperly contrived, than to <lb/>
            recommence it by assigning the peroration, or pathetical part <lb/>
            of it, to a second advocate. For every cause can have but <lb/>
            one natural introduction and conclusion; and all the other <lb/>
            parts of'it, like the members of an animal body, will best <lb/>
            retain their proper strength and beauty, when they are regu- <lb/>
            larly disposed and connected. We may add, that, as it is <lb/>
            very difficult in a single oration of any length, to avoid saying <lb/>
            something which does not comport with the rest of it so well <lb/>
            as it ought to do, how much more difficult must it be to con- <lb/>
            trive that nothing shall be said, which does not tally exactly <lb/>
            with the speech of another person who has spoken before you ? <lb/>
            But as it certainly requires more labour to plead a whole <lb/>
            cause, than only a part of it, and as many advantageous con- <lb/>
            nexions are formed by assisting in a suit in which several <lb/>
            persons are interested, the custom, however preposterous in <lb/>
            itself, has been readily adopted.</p><pb n="463"/>
            
          <p>LYIII. " There were some, however, who esteemed <unclear>Curie</unclear> <lb/>
            the third best orator of the age; perhaps, because his lan- <lb/>
            guage was brilliant and pompous, and because he had a habit <lb/>
            (for which I suppose he was indebted to his domestic educa- <lb/>
            tion) of expressing himself with tolerable correctness; for he <lb/>
            was a man of very little learning. . But it is a circumstance <lb/>
            of great importance, what sort of people we are used'to con- <lb/>
            verse with at home, especially in the more early part of life; <lb/>
            and what 'sort of language we have been accustomed to hear <lb/>
            from our tutors and parents, not excepting the mother. We <lb/>
            have all read the letters of Cornelia, the mother of the <lb/>
            Gracchi; and are satisfied, that her sons were not so much <lb/>
            nurtured in their mother's lap, as in the elegance, and <lb/>
            purity of her language. I have often too enjoyed the agree- <lb/>
            able conversation of Lælia, the daughter of Caius, and ob- <lb/>
            served in her a strong tincture of her father's elegance. I <lb/>
            have likewise conversed with his two daughters, the Muciæ, <lb/>
            and his grand-daughters, the two Liciniæ, with one of whom <lb/>
            (the wife of'Scipio) you, my Brutus, I believe, have some- <lb/>
            times been in company." " I have," replied he, " and was <lb/>
            much pleased with her conversation; and the more so, <lb/>
            because she was the daughter of Crassus." " And what think <lb/>
            you," said I, " of Crassus the son of that Licinia, who was <lb/>
            adopted by Crassus in his will?" "He is said," replied he, <lb/>
            "to have been a man of great genius; and the Scipio you <lb/>
            have mentioned, who was my colleague, likewise appears to <lb/>
            me to have been a good speaker, and an elegant companion." <lb/>
            " Your opinion, my Brutus," said I, " is very just. For this <lb/>
            family; if I may be allowed the expression, seems to have <lb/>
            been the offspring of wisdom. As to their two grandfathers, <lb/>
            Scipio and Crassus, we have taken notice of them already; as <lb/>
            we also have of their great grandfathers, Quintus Metellus, who <lb/>
            had four sons; Publius Scipio, who, when a private citizen, <lb/>
            rescued the republic from the arbitrary influence'of Tiberius <lb/>
            Gracchus; and Quintus Scævola, the augur, who was the <lb/>
            ablest and most affable civilian of his time. And lastly, how <lb/>
            illustrious are the names of their next immediate progenitors, <lb/>
            Publius Scipio, who was twice consul, and was called the <lb/>
            darling of the people; and Caius Lælius, who was esteemed <lb/>
            the wisest of men." "A generous stock indeed!" cried <lb/>
            Brutus, " into which the wisdom of many has been succes <lb/>
            sively ingrafted, like a number of scions on the same tree!"</p><pb n="464"/>
            
          <p>LIX. " I have likewise a suspicion," replied I, " (if we <lb/>
            may compare small things with great,) that Curio's family, <lb/>
            though he himself was left an orphan, vas indebted to his <lb/>
            father's instruction, and good example, for the habitual <lb/>
            purity of their language; and so much the more, because, <lb/>
            of all those who were held in any estimation for their elo- <lb/>
            quence, I never knew one who was so totally uninformed and <lb/>
            unskilled in every branch of liberal science. He had not <lb/>
            read a single poet, or studied a single orator; and he knew <lb/>
            little or nothing either of public, civil, or common law. We <lb/>
            might say almost the same, indeed, of several others, and <lb/>
            some of them very able orators, who (we know) were but <lb/>
            little acquainted with these useful parts of knowledge; as, <lb/>
            for instance, of Sulpicius and Antonius. But this deficiency <lb/>
            was supplied in them by an elaborate knowledge of the <lb/>
            art of speaking; and there was not one of them who was <lb/>
            totally unqualified in any of the five1 principal parts of <lb/>
            which it is composed; for whenever this is the case, (and it <lb/>
            matters not in which of those parts it happens,) it entirely <lb/>
            incapacitates a man to shine as an orator. Some, however, <lb/>
            excelled in one part, and some in another. Thus Antonius <lb/>
            could readily invent such arguments as were most in point, <lb/>
            and afterwards digest and methodize them to the best advan- <lb/>
            tage; and he could likewise retain the plan he had formed <lb/>
            with great exactness; but his chief merit was the goodness <lb/>
            of his delivery, in which he was justly allowed to excel. In <lb/>
            some of these qualifications he was upon an equal footing with <lb/>
            Crassus, and in others he was superior; but then the lan- <lb/>
            guage of Crassus was indisputably preferable to his. In the <lb/>
            same manner, it cannot be said that either Sulpicius or Cotta, <lb/>
            or any other speaker of repute, was absolutely deficient in <lb/>
            any one of the five parts of oratory. But we may justly infei <lb/>
            from the example of Curio, that nothing will more recommend <lb/>
            an orator, than a brilliant and ready flow of expression ; for <lb/>
            he was remarkably dull in the invention, and very loose and <lb/>
            unconnected in the disposition, of his arguments.</p>
          <p>LX. "The two remaining parts are, pronunciation and <lb/>
            memory; in each of which he was so miserably defective, as <lb/>
            to excite the laughter and the ridicule of his hearers. His <lb/>
            gesture was really such as Caius Julius represented it, in <lb/>
            a severe sarcasm, that will never be forgotten ; for as he was <note type="footnote"> 1Invention, disposition, elocution, memory, and pronunciation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            swaying and reeling his whole body from side to side, Julius <lb/>
            facetiously inquired who it was that was speaking from a <lb/>
            boat ? To the same purpose was the jest of Cnæus Sicinius, a <lb/>
            man very vulgar, but exceedingly humorous, which was the <lb/>
            onlY qualification he had to recommend him as an orator. <lb/>
            When this man, as tribune of the people, had summoned <lb/>
            Curio and Octavius, who were then consuls, into the forum, <lb/>
            and Curio had delivered a tedious harangue, while Octavius <lb/>
            sat silently by him, wrapt up in flannels, and besmeared with <lb/>
            ointments, to ease the pain of tha gout; Octavius, said he, <lb/>
            you are infinitely obliged to your colleague; for if he had <lb/>
            not tossed and flung himself about to-day, in the manner he <lb/>
            did, you would certainly have been devoured by the flies. As <lb/>
            to his memory, it was so extremely treacherous, that after <lb/>
            he had divided his subject into three general heads, he would <lb/>
            sometimes, in the course of speaking, either add a fourth, or <lb/>
            omit the third. In a capital trial, in which I had pleaded for <lb/>
            Titinia, the daughter of Cotta, when he attempted to reply to <lb/>
            me in defence of Servius Nævius, he suddenly forgot every- <lb/>
            thing he intended to say, and attributed it to the pretended <lb/>
            witcheraft and magic artifices of Titinia. These were un- <lb/>
            doubted proofs of the weakness of his memory. But, what is <lb/>
            still more inexcusable, he sometimes forgot, even in his <lb/>
            written treatises, what he had mentioned but a little before. <lb/>
            Thus, in a book of his. in which he introduces himself as en- <lb/>
            tering into conversation with our friend Pansa, and his son <lb/>
            Curio, when he was walking home from the senate-house ; <lb/>
            the senate is supposed to have been summoned by Cæsar in <lb/>
            his first consulship; and the whole conversation arises from <lb/>
            the son's inquiry, what the house had resolved upon. Curio <lb/>
            launches out into a long invective against the conduct of <lb/>
            Cæsar, and as is generally the custom in dialogues, the parties <lb/>
            are engaged in a close dispute on the subject; but very un- <lb/>
            happily, though the conversation commences at the breaking <lb/>
            up of the senate which Cæsar held when he was first consul, <lb/>
            the author censures those very actions of the same Cæsar, <lb/>
            which did not happen till the next, and several other suc- <lb/>
            oeeding years of his government in Gaul."</p>
          <p>LXI. " Is it possible then," said Brutus, with an air of <lb/>
            surprise, "that any man (and especially in a written per- <lb/>
            formance) could be so forgetful as not to discover, upon a <lb/>
            subsequent perusal of his own work, what an egregiout <note type="footnote"> H H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            blunder he had committed?" "Very true," said I; " for if <lb/>
            he wrote with a design to discredit the measures which he <lb/>
            represents in such an odious light, nothing could be more <lb/>
            stupid than not to commence his dialogue at a period which <lb/>
            was subsequent to those measures. But he so entirely forgets <lb/>
            himself, as to tell us, that he did not choose to attend a <lb/>
            senate which was held in one of Caesar's future consulships, <lb/>
            in the very same dialogue in which he introduces himself at <lb/>
            returning home from a senate which was held in his first <lb/>
            consulship. It cannot, therefore, be wondered at, that he <lb/>
            who was so remarkably defective in a faculty which is the <lb/>
            handmaid of our other intellectual powers, as to forget, even <unclear/> <lb/>
            ¡d a written treatise, a material circumstance which he had <lb/>
            mentioned but a little before, should find his memory fail him, <lb/>
            as it generally did, in a sudden and unpremeditated harangue. <lb/>
            It accordingly happened, though he had many connexions, <lb/>
            and was fond of speaking in public, that few causes were <lb/>
            intrusted to his management. But, among his contem- <lb/>
            poraries, he was esteemed next in merit to the first orators of <lb/>
            the age; and that merely, as I said before, for his good <lb/>
            choice of words, and his uncommon readiness, and great <lb/>
            fluency of expression. His orations, therefore, may deserve a <lb/>
            cursory perusal. It is true, indeed, they are much too lan- <lb/>
            guid and spiritless ; but they may yet be of service to enlarge <lb/>
            and improve an accomplishment, of which he certainly had <lb/>
            a moderate share; and which has so much force and efficacy, <lb/>
            that it gave Curio the appearance and reputation of an orator <lb/>
            without the assistance of any other good quality.</p>
          <p>LXII. " But to return to our subject; Caius Carbo, of <lb/>
            the same age, was likewise reckoned an orator of the second <lb/>
            class; he was the son, indeed, of the truly eloquent man <lb/>
            before mentioned, but was far from being an acute speaker <lb/>
            himself; he was, however, esteemed an orator. His lan- <lb/>
            guage was tolerably nervous, he spoke with ease; and there <lb/>
            was an air of authority in his address that was perfectly <lb/>
            natural. But Quintus Varius was a man of quicker inven- <lb/>
            ' tion, and, at the same time, had an equal freedom of expres- <lb/>
            sion; besides which, he had a bold and spirited delivery,, and a <lb/>
            vein of elocution which was neither poor, nor coarse an6 <lb/>
            vulgar; in short, you need not hesitate to pronounce him an <lb/>
            orator. Cnæus Pomponius was a vehement, a rousing, and <lb/>
            a fierce and eager speaker, and more inclined to act the part of <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            a prosecutor, than of an advocate. But far inferior to these was <lb/>
            Lucius Fufius; though his application was, in some measure, <lb/>
            rewarded by the success of his prosecution against Manius <lb/>
            Aquilius. For as to Marcus Drusus, your great uncle, who <lb/>
            spoke like an orator only upon matters of government; Lucius <lb/>
            Lucullus, who was indeed an artful speaker, and your father, <lb/>
            my Brutus, who was well acquainted with the common and civil <lb/>
            law; Marcus Lucullus, and Marcus Octavius, the son of Cnæus, <lb/>
            who was a man of so much authority and address, as to pro- <lb/>
            cure the repeal of Sempronius's corn-act, by the suffrages of <lb/>
            a full assembly of the people; Cnæus Octavius, the son of <lb/>
            Marcus; and Marcus Cato, the father, and Quintus Catulus, <lb/>
            the son; we must excuse these (if I may so express myself) <lb/>
            from the fatigues and dangers of the field,—that is, from the <lb/>
            management of judicial causes, and place them in garrison <lb/>
            over the general interests of the republic, a duty to which <lb/>
            they seem to have been sufficiently adequate. I should have <lb/>
            assigned the same post to Quintus Cæpio, if he had not been <lb/>
            so violently attached to the equestrian order, as to set him- <lb/>
            self at variance with the senate. I have also remarked, that <lb/>
            Cnæus Carbo, Marcus Marius, and several others of the same <lb/>
            stamp, who would not have merited the attention of an <lb/>
            audience that had any taste for elegance, were extremely well <lb/>
            suited to address a tumultuous crowd. In the same class <lb/>
            (if I may be allowed to interrupt the series of my narrative) <lb/>
            Lucius Quintius lately made his appearance; though Pali- <lb/>
            canus, it must be owned, was still better adapted to please <lb/>
            the ears of the populace. But, as I have mentioned this in- <lb/>
            ferior kind of speakers, I must be so just to Lucius Apuleius <lb/>
            Saturninus, as to observe that, of all the factious declaimers <lb/>
            since the time of the Gracchi, ho was generally esteemed the <lb/>
            ablest; and yet he caught the attention of the public more <lb/>
            by his appearance, his gesture, and his dress, than by any <lb/>
            real fluency of expression, or even a tolerable share cf good <lb/>
            sense. But Caius Servilius Glaucia, though the most aban- <lb/>
            doned wretch that ever existed, was very keen and artful, <lb/>
            and excessively humorous; and notwithstanding the mean- <lb/>
            ness of his birth, and the depravity of his life, he would have <lb/>
            been advanced to the dignity of a consul in his prætorship, if <lb/>
            it had been judged lawful to admit his suit; for the populace <lb/>
            were entirely at his devotion, and he had secured the interest <lb/>
            of the knights by an act he had procured in their favour. <note type="footnote">H H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            He was slain in the open forum, while ne was prætor, on the <lb/>
            same day as the tribune Saturninus, in the consulship of <lb/>
            Marius and Flaccus : and bore a near resemblance to Hyper- <lb/>
            bolus, the Athenian, whose profligacy was so severely stigma- <lb/>
            tized in the old Attic comedies. These were succeeded by <lb/>
            Sextus Titius, who was indeed a voluble speaker, and pos • <lb/>
            sessed a ready comprehension ; but he was so loose and effe- <lb/>
            minate in his gesture, as to furnish room for the invention of <lb/>
            a dance, which was called the Titian jig; so careful should <lb/>
            we be to avoid every peculiarity in our manner of speaking, <lb/>
            which may afterwards be exposed to ridicule by a ludicrous <lb/>
            imitation.</p>
          <p>LXIII. " But we have rambled back insensibly to a period <lb/>
            which has been already examined: let us, therefore, return <lb/>
            to that which we were reviewing a little before. Contemporary <lb/>
            with Sulpicius was Publius Antistius, a plausible declaimer, <lb/>
            who, after being silent for several years, and exposed (as he <lb/>
            often was) not only to the contempt, but the derision of his <lb/>
            hearers, first spoke with applause in his tribuneship, in a real <lb/>
            and very interesting protest against the illegal application of <lb/>
            Caius Julius for the consulship; and that so much the more, <lb/>
            because, though Sulpicius himself, who then happened to be <lb/>
            his colleague, spoke on the same side of the debate, Antistius <lb/>
            argued more copiously, and to better purpose. This raised <lb/>
            his reputation so high, that many, and (soon afterwards) <lb/>
            every cause of importance, was eagerly recommended to his <lb/>
            patronage. To speak the truth, he had a quick conception, <lb/>
            a methodical judgment, and a retentive memory; and though <lb/>
            his language was not much embellished, it was very far from <lb/>
            being low. In short, his style was easy and flowing, and his <lb/>
            appearance rather gentlemanly than otherwise; but his action <lb/>
            was a little defective, partly through the disagreeable tone or <lb/>
            his voice, and partly by a few ridiculous gestures, of which <lb/>
            he could not entirely break himself He flourished in the <lb/>
            time between the flight and the return of Sylla, when the <lb/>
            republic was deprived of a regular administration of justice, <lb/>
            and of its former dignity and splendour. But the reception <lb/>
            which he met with was the more favourable, as the forum <lb/>
            was in a measure destitute of good orators. For Sulpicius <lb/>
            was dead; Cotta and Curio were abroad; and no pleaders <lb/>
            of eminence were left but Carbo and Pomponius, from each <lb/>
            of whom he easily carried off the palm.</p><pb n="469"/>
            
          <p>LXIV. " His nearest successor in the following age way <lb/>
            Lucius Sisenna, who was a man of learning, had a taste for <lb/>
            the liberal sciences, spoke the Roman language with accuracy <lb/>
            was well acquainted with the laws and constitution of his <lb/>
            country, and had a tolerable share of wit; but he was not a <lb/>
            speaker of any great application, or extensive practice; and <lb/>
            as he happened to live in the intermediate time between the <lb/>
            appearance of Sulpicius and Hortensius, he was unable to equal <lb/>
            the former, and forced to yield to the superior talents of the <lb/>
            latter. We may easily form a judgment of his abilities from <lb/>
            the historical works he has left behind him; which, though <lb/>
            evidently preferable to anything of the kind which had <lb/>
            appeared before, may serve as a proof that he was far below <lb/>
            the standard of perfection, and that this species of composi- <lb/>
            tion had not then been improved to any great degree of <lb/>
            excellence among the Romans. But the genius of Quintus <lb/>
            Hortensius, even in his early youth, like one of Phidias's sta- <lb/>
            tues, was no sooner beheld than it was universally admired ! <lb/>
            He spoke his first oration in the forum in the consulship of Lu- <lb/>
            cius Crassus and Quintus Scævola, to whom it was personally <lb/>
            addressed; and though he was then only nineteen years old, <lb/>
            lie descended from the rostra with the hearty approbation <lb/>
            not only of the audience in general, but of the two consuls <lb/>
            themselves, who were the most intelligent judges in the <lb/>
            whole city. He died in the consulship of Lucius Paulus and <lb/>
            Caius Marcellus; from which it appears that he was four- <lb/>
            and-forty years a pleader. We shall review his character <lb/>
            more at large in the sequel; but in this part of my history, <lb/>
            I chose to include him in the number of orators who were <lb/>
            rather of an earlier date. This indeed must necessarily <lb/>
            happen to all whose lives are of any considerable length ; for <lb/>
            they are equally liable to a comparison with their elders and <lb/>
            their juniors; as in the case of the poet Attius, who says <lb/>
            that both he and Pacuvius applied themselves to the cultiva- <lb/>
            tion of the drama under the same ædiles; though, at the <lb/>
            time, the one was eighty, and the other only thirty years old. <lb/>
            Thus Hortensius may be compared not only with those who <lb/>
            were properly his contemporaries, but with me, and you, my <lb/>
            Brutus, and with others of a prior date. For he began to speak <lb/>
            in public while Crassus was living j but his fame increased <lb/>
            when he appeared as a joint advocate with Antonius and <lb/>
            Philippus (at that time in the decline of life) in defence of <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            Cnæus Pompeius,—a cause in which (though a mere youth) <lb/>
            he distinguished himself above the rest. He may therefore be <lb/>
            included in the list of those whom I have placed in the time <lb/>
            of Sulpicius ; but among his proper coevals, such as Marcus <lb/>
            Piso, Marcus Crassus, Cnæus Lentulus, and Publius Lentulus <lb/>
            Sura, he excelled beyond the reach of competition; and after <lb/>
            these he happened upon me, in the early part of my life (for <lb/>
            I was eight years younger than himself), and spent a number <lb/>
            of years with me in pursuit of the same forensic glory; and <lb/>
            at last, (a little before his death,) he once pleaded with you, <lb/>
            in defence of Appius Claudius, as I have frequently done for <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>LXV. " Thus you see, my Brutus, I am come insensibly to <lb/>
            yourself, though there was undoubtedly a great variety of <lb/>
            orators between my first appearance in the forum, and yours. <lb/>
            But as I determined, when we began the conversation, to <lb/>
            make no mention of those among them who are still living, <lb/>
            to prevent your inquiring too minutely what is my opinion <lb/>
            concerning each; I shall confine myself to such as are now no <lb/>
            more." " That is not the true reason," said Brutus, " why <lb/>
            you choose to be silent about the living." " What then do <lb/>
            you suppose it to be ?" said 1. " You are only fearful," <lb/>
            replied he, " that your remarks should afterwards be men- <lb/>
            tioned by us in other company, and that, by this means, you <lb/>
            should expose yourself to the resentment of those whom you <lb/>
            may not think it worth your while to notice." " Indeed," <lb/>
            answered I, " I have not the least doubt of your secrecy." <lb/>
            " Neither have you any reason," said he ; " but after all, I <lb/>
            suppose, you had rather be silent yourself, than rely upon <lb/>
            our taciturnity." " To confess the truth," replied I, " when I <lb/>
            first entered upon the subject, I never imagined that I should <lb/>
            have extended it to the age now before us; whereas I have <lb/>
            been drawn by a continued series of history among the <lb/>
            moderns of latest date." " Introduce, then," said he, " those <lb/>
            intermediate orators you may think worthy of our notice; <lb/>
            and afterwards let us return to yourself, and Hortensius." <lb/>
            " To Hortensius," replied I, " with all my heart; but as to <lb/>
            my own character, I shall leave it to other people to examine, <lb/>
            if they choose to take the trouble." " I can by no means <lb/>
            agree to that," said he; " for though every part of the <lb/>
            account you have favoured us with, has entertained me very <lb/>
            agreeably, it now begins to seem tedious, because I am <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            Impatient to hear something of yourself; I do not mean the <lb/>
            wonderful qualities, but the progressive steps, and the advances <lb/>
            of your eloquence; for the former are sufficiently known <lb/>
            already both to me, and the whole world." " As you do not <lb/>
            require me," said I, " to sound the praises of my own genius, <lb/>
            but only to describe my labour and application to improve it, <lb/>
            your request shall be complied with. But to preserve the <lb/>
            order of my narrative, I shall first introduce such other <lb/>
            speakers as I think ought to be previously noticed.</p>
          <p>" And I shall begin with Marcus Crassus, who was con- <lb/>
            temporary with Hortensius. LXVI. With a tolerable share <lb/>
            of learning, and a very moderate capacity, his application, <lb/>
            assiduity, and interest, procured him a place among the <lb/>
            ablest pleaders of the time for several years. His language <lb/>
            was pure, his expression neither low nor vulgar, and his ideas <lb/>
            well digested; but he had nothing in him that was florid <lb/>
            and ornamental; and the real ardour of his mind was not <lb/>
            supported by any vigorous exertion of his voice, so that he <lb/>
            pronounced almost everything in the same uniform tone. <lb/>
            His equal, and professed antagonist, Caius Fimbria, was not <lb/>
            able to maintain his character so long; and though he always <lb/>
            spoke with a strong and elevated voice, and poured forth <lb/>
            a rapid torrent of well-chosen expressions, he was so im- <lb/>
            moderately vehement that you might justly be surprised that <lb/>
            the people should have been so absent and inattentive as <lb/>
            to admit a madman, like him. into the list of orators. As to <lb/>
            Cnæus Lentulus, his action acquired him a reputation for his <lb/>
            eloquence very far beyond his real abilities; for though he <lb/>
            was not a man of any great penetration (notwithstanding he <lb/>
            carried the appearance of it in his countenance), nor possessed <lb/>
            any real fluency of expression (though he was equally specious <lb/>
            in this respect as in the former), yet by his sudden breaks, <lb/>
            and exclamations, he affected such an ironical air of surprise, <lb/>
            with a sweet and sonorous tone of voice, and his whole <lb/>
            action was so warm and lively, that his defects were scarcely <lb/>
            noticed. For as Curio acquired the reputation of an orator <lb/>
            with no other quality than a tolerable freedom of elocution, <lb/>
            so Cnæus Lentulus concealed the mediocrity of his other <lb/>
            accomplishments by his action, which was really excellent. <lb/>
            Much the same might be said of Publius Lentulus, whose <lb/>
            poverty of invention and expression was secured from notice <lb/>
            by the mere dignity of his presence. his correct and graceful <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            gesture, and the strength and sweetness of his voice; and his <lb/>
            merit depended so entirely upon his action, that he was more <lb/>
            deficient in every other quality than his namesake.</p>
          <p>LXVII. " But Marcus Piso derived all his talents from <lb/>
            his erudition ; for he was much better versed in Grecian <lb/>
            literature than any of his predecessors. He had, however, a <lb/>
            natural keenness of discernment, which he greatly improved <lb/>
            by art, and exerted with great address and dexterity, though <lb/>
            in very indifferent language; but he was frequently warm <lb/>
            and choleric, sometimes cold and insipid, and now and then <lb/>
            rather smart and humorous. He did not long support the <lb/>
            fatigue and emulous contention of the forum ; partly on <lb/>
            account of the weakness of his constitution; and partly, <lb/>
            because he could not submit to the follies and impertinences <lb/>
            of the common people (which we orators are forced to <lb/>
            swallow), either, as it was generally supposed, from a peculiar <lb/>
            moroseness of temper, or from a liberal and ingenuous pride <lb/>
            of heart. After acquiring, therefore, in his youth, a tolerable <lb/>
            degree of reputation, his character began to sink; but in the <lb/>
            trial of the Vestals, he again recovered it with some additional <lb/>
            lustre, and being thus recalled to the theatre of eloquence, he <lb/>
            kept his rank, as long as he was able to support the fatigue <lb/>
            of it; after which his credit declined, in proportion as he <lb/>
            remitted his application. Publius Murena had a moderate <lb/>
            genius, but was passionately fond of the study of antiquity; <lb/>
            he applied himself with equal diligence to the belles lettres, <lb/>
            in which he was tolerably versed ; in short, he was a man of <lb/>
            great industry, and took the utmost pains to distinguish <lb/>
            himself. Caius Censorinus had a good stock of Grecian <lb/>
            literature, explained whatever he advanced with great neat- <lb/>
            ness and perspicuity, and had a graceful action, but was too <lb/>
            cold and inanimate for the forum. Lucius Turius, with <lb/>
            a very indifferent genius, but the most indefatigable applica- <lb/>
            tion, spoke in public very often, in the best manner he was <lb/>
            able; and, accordingly, he only wanted the votes of a few <lb/>
            centuries to promote him to the consulship. Caius Macer <lb/>
            was never a man of much interest or authority, but was one <lb/>
            of the most active pleaders of his time; and if his life, his <lb/>
            manners, and his very looks, had not ruined the credit of his <lb/>
            genius, he would have ranked higher in the list of orators. <lb/>
            He was neither copious, nor dry and barren ; neither neat <lb/>
            and embellished, nor wholly inelegant; and his voice, his <lb/>

            gesture, and every part of his action, was without any grace; <lb/>
            but in inventing and digesting his ideas, he had a won- <lb/>
            derful accuracy, such as no man I ever saw either possessed <lb/>
            or exerted in a more eminent degree; and yet, somehow, he <lb/>
            displayed it rather with the air of a quibbler, than of an <lb/>
            orator. Though he had acquired some reputation in public <lb/>
            causes, he appeared to most advantage and was most courted <lb/>
            and employed in private ones.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. “ Caius Piso, who comes next in order, had <lb/>
            scarcely any exertion, but he was a speaker who adopted <lb/>
            a very familiar style; and though, in fact, he was far from <lb/>
            being slow of invention, he had more penetration in his look <lb/>
            and appearance than he really possessed. His contemporary, <lb/>
            Marcus Glabrio, though carefully instructed by his grandfather <lb/>
            Scævola, was prevented from distinguishing himself by his <lb/>
            natural indolence and want of attention. Lucius Torquatus, <lb/>
            on the contrary, had an elegant turn of expression, and a clear <lb/>
            comprehension, and was perfectly polite and well-bred in his <lb/>
            whole manner. But Cnæus Pompeius, my coeval, a man who <lb/>
            was born to excel in everything, would have acquired a more <lb/>
            distinguished reputation for his eloquence, if he had not <lb/>
            been diverted from the pursuit of it by the more dazzling <lb/>
            charms of military fame. His language was naturally bold <lb/>
            and elevated, and he was always master of his subject; and <lb/>
            as to his powers of enunciation, his voice was sonorous and <lb/>
            manly, and his gesture noble and full of dignity. Decimus <lb/>
            Silanus, another of my contemporaries, and your father-in- <lb/>
            law, was not a man of much application, but he had a very <lb/>
            competent share of discernment and elocution. Quintus <lb/>
            Pompeius, the son of Aulus, who had the title of Bithynicus, <lb/>
            and was about two years older than myself, was, to my own <lb/>
            knowledge, remarkably fond of the study of eloquence, had an <lb/>
            uncommon stock of learning, and was a man of indefatigable <lb/>
            industry and perseverance ; for he was connected with Marcus <lb/>
            Piso and me, not only as an intimate acquaintance, but <lb/>
            as an associate in our studies and private exercises. His <lb/>
            elocution was but ill recommended by his action ; for though <lb/>
            the former was sufficiently copious and diffusive, there was <lb/>
            nothing graceful in the latter. His contemporary, Publiua <lb/>
            Autronius, had a very clear and strong voice; but he was <lb/>
            distinguished by no other accomplishment. Lucius Octavius <lb/>
            Reatinus died in his youth, while he was in full practice; but <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            he ascended the iostra with more assurance than ability, <lb/>
            Caius Staienus, who changed his name into Ælius by a kind <lb/>
            of self-adoption, was a warm, an abusive, and indeed a furious <lb/>
            speaker; which was so agreeable to the taste of many, that <lb/>
            he would have risen to some rank in the state, if it had not <lb/>
            been for a crime of which he was clearly convicted, and for <lb/>
            which he afterwards suffered.</p>
          <p>LXIX. " At the same time were the two brothers Caius <lb/>
            and Lucius Cæpasius, who, though men cf an obscure family <lb/>
            and little previous consequence, were yet, by mere dint of <lb/>
            application, suddenly promoted to the quaestorship, with no <lb/>
            other recommendation than a provincial and unpolished kind <lb/>
            of oratory. That I may not seem wilfully to omit any de- <lb/>
            claimer, I must also notice Caius Cosconius Calidianus, who, <lb/>
            without any discernment, amused the people with a rapidity <lb/>
            of language (if such it might be called) which he attended <lb/>
            with a perpetual hurry of action, and a most violent exertion ' <lb/>
            of his voice. Of much the same cast was Quintus Arrius, <lb/>
            who may be considered as a second-hand Marcus Crassus.' <lb/>
            He is a striking proof of what consequence it is in such a <lb/>
            city as ours to devote oneself to the interests of the many, <lb/>
            and to be as active as possible in promoting their safety, or <lb/>
            their honour. For by these means, though of the lowest <lb/>
            parentage, having raised himself to offices of rank, and to <lb/>
            considerable wealth and influence, he likewise acquired the <lb/>
            reputation of a tolerable patron, without either learning or <lb/>
            abilities. But as inexperienced champions, who, from a pas- <lb/>
            sionate desire to distinguish themselves in the circus, can bear <lb/>
            the blows of their opponents without shrinking, are often <lb/>
            overpowered by the heat of the sun, when it is increased by <lb/>
            the reflection of the sand ; so he, who had hitherto supported <lb/>
            even the sharpest encounters with good success, could not <lb/>
            stand the severity of that year of judicial contest, which <lb/>
            blazed upon him like a summer's sun."</p>
          <p>" Upon my word," cried Atticus, “you are now treating us <lb/>
            with the very dregs of oratory, and you have entertained us <lb/>
            in this manner for some time; but I did not offer to inter- <lb/>
            rapt you, because I never dreamed you would have descended <lb/>
            so low as to mention the Staieni and Autronii /" " As I have, <lb/>
            been speaking of the dead, you will not imagine, I suppose," <lb/>
            said I, “that I have done It to court their favour; but in <lb/>
            pursuing the order of history. I was necessarily led by degrees <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            to a period of time which falls within the compass of our own <lb/>
            knowledge. But I wish it to be noticed, that after recount- <lb/>
            ing all who ever ventured to speak in public, we find but <lb/>
            few (very few indeed!) whose names are worth recording; <lb/>
            and not many who had even the repute of being orators. Let <lb/>
            us, however, return to our subject.</p>
          <p>LXX. " Titus Torquatus, then, the son of Titus, was a <lb/>
            man of learning, (which he first acquired in the school of <lb/>
            Molo in Rhodes,) and of a free and easy elocution which he <lb/>
            received from nature. If he had lived to a proper age, he <lb/>
            would have been chosen consul, without any solicitation; <lb/>
            but he had more ability for speaking, than inclination; so <lb/>
            that, in fact, he did not do justice to the art he professed; <lb/>
            and yet he was never wanting to his duty, either in the pri- <lb/>
            vate causes of his friends and dependents, or in his senatorial <lb/>
            capacity. My townsman, too, Marcus Pontidius, pleaded a <lb/>
            number of private causes. He had a rapidity of expression, <lb/>
            and a tolerable quickness of comprehension ; but he was very <lb/>
            warm, and indeed rather too choleric and irascible; so that <lb/>
            he often wrangled, not only with his antagonist, but (what <lb/>
            appears very strange) with the judge himself, whom it was <lb/>
            rather his business to sooth and gratify. Marcus Messala, <lb/>
            who was something younger than myself, was far from being <lb/>
            a poor and abject pleader, and yet he was not a very ele- <lb/>
            gant one. He was judicious, penetrating, and wary, very <lb/>
            exact in digesting and methodizing his subject, and a man of <lb/>
            uncommon diligence and application, and of very extensive <lb/>
            practice. As to the two Metelli, (Celer and Nepos,) these also <lb/>
            had a moderate share of employment at the bar ;but being <lb/>
            destitute neither of learning nor abilities, they chiefly applied <lb/>
            themselves (and with some success) to debates of a more <lb/>
            popular kind. But Cnæus Lentulus Marcellinus, who was <lb/>
            never reckoned a bad speaker, was esteemed a very eloquent <lb/>
            one in his consulship. He wanted neither sentiment nor <lb/>
            expression; his voice was sweet and sonorous; and he had a <lb/>
            sufficient stock of humour. Caius Memmius, the son of Lucius, <lb/>
            was a perfect adept in the learning of the Greeks ;for he had <lb/>
            an insuperable disgust to the literature of the Romans. He <lb/>
            was a neat and polished speaker, and had a sweet and harmo- <lb/>
            nious turn of expression; but as he was equally averse to <lb/>
            every laborious effort either of the mind or the tongue, his <lb/>
            eloquence declined in proportion as he lessened his application."</p><pb n="476"/>
            
          <p>LXXI. " But I heartily wish," said Brutus, " that you <lb/>
            would give us your opinion of those orators who are still <lb/>
            living ; or, if you are determined to say nothing of the rest, <lb/>
            there are two at least, (that is, Cæsar and Marcellus, whom <lb/>
            I have often heard you speak of with the highest approba- <lb/>
            tion,) whose characters would give me as much entertainment <lb/>
            as any of those you have already specified." “But why," <lb/>
            answered I, " should you expect that I should give you my <lb/>
            opinion of men who are as well known to yourself as to me ?” <lb/>
            “Marcellus, indeed," replied he, " I am very well acquainted <lb/>
            with ; but as to Cæsar, I know little of him. For I have <lb/>
            heard the former very often ; but by the time I was able to <lb/>
            judge for myself, the latter had set out for his province." <lb/>
            " But what," said I, " think you of him whom you have heard <lb/>
            so often? " "What else can I think," replied he, "but that you <lb/>
            will soon have an orator, who will very nearly resemble your- <lb/>
            self? " “If that is the case," answered I, " pray think of him as <lb/>
            favourably as you can." “I do," said he ; " for he pleases <lb/>
            me very highly; and not without reason. He is absolutely <lb/>
            master of his profession, and, neglecting every other, has <lb/>
            applied himself solely to this; and, for that purpose, has <lb/>
            persevered in the rigorous task of composing a daily essay in <lb/>
            writing. His words are well chosen ; his language is full <lb/>
            and copious ; and everything he says receives an additional <lb/>
            ornament from the graceful tone of his voice, and the dignity <lb/>
            of his action. In short, he is so complete an orator, that <lb/>
            there is no quality I know of, in which I can think him defi- <lb/>
            cient. But he is still more to be admired, for being able, in <lb/>
            these unhappy times, (which are marked with a distress that, <lb/>
            by some cruel fatality, has overwhelmed us all,) to console <lb/>
            himself, as opportunity offers, with the consciousness of his <lb/>
            own integrity, and by the frequent renewal of his literary <lb/>
            pursuits. I saw him lately at Mitylene ; and then (as I have <lb/>
            already hinted) I saw him a thorough man. For though 1 <lb/>
            had before discovered in him a strong resemblance of your- <lb/>
            self, the likeness was much improved after he was enriched <lb/>
            by the instructions of your learned and very intimate friend <lb/>
            Cratippus." " Though I acknowledge," said I, “that I have <lb/>
            listened with pleasure to your eulogies on a very worthy <lb/>
            man, for whom I have the warmest esteem, they have led <lb/>
            me insensibly to the recollection of our common miseries, <lb/>
            which our present conversation was intended to suspend. <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            But I would willingly hear what is Atticus's opinion of <lb/>
            Cæsar.”</p>
          <p>LXXII. " Upon my word," replied Atticus, "you are <lb/>
            wonderfully consistent with your plan, to say nothing your- <lb/>
            self of the living; and indeed, if you were to deal with them, <lb/>
            as you already have with the dead, and say something of <lb/>
            every paltry fellow that occurs to your memory, you would <lb/>
            plague us with Autronii and Staieni without end. But though <lb/>
            you might possibly have it in view not to encumber yourself <lb/>
            with such a numerous crowd of insignificant wretches; or <lb/>
            perhaps, to avoid giving any one room to complain that he <lb/>
            was either unnoticed, or not extolled according to his ima- <lb/>
            ginary merit; yet, certainly, you might have said something <lb/>
            of Cæsar; especially, as your opinion of his abilities is well <lb/>
            known to everybody, and his concerning yours is very far <lb/>
            from being a secret. But, however," said he, (addressing <lb/>
            himself to Brutus,) “I really think of Cæsar, and everybody <lb/>
            else says the same of this accurate master in the art of speak- <lb/>
            ing, that he has the purest and the most elegant command of <lb/>
            the Roman language of all the orators that have yet appeared; <lb/>
            and that not merely by domestic habit, as we have lately heard <lb/>
            it observed of the families of the Lælii and the Mucii, (though <lb/>
            even here, I believe, this might partly have been the case,) but <lb/>
            he chiefly acquired and brought it to its present perfection, by a <lb/>
            studious application to the most intricate and refined branches <lb/>
            of literature, and by a careful and constant attention to the <lb/>
            purity of his style. But that he, who, involved as he was in , <lb/>
            a perpetual hurry of business, could dedicate to you, my <lb/>
            Cicero, a laboured treatise on the art of speaking correctly ; <lb/>
            that he, who, in the first book of it, laid it down as an axiom, <lb/>
            that an accurate choice of words is the foundation of elo- <lb/>
            quence ; and who has bestowed," said he, (addressing himself <lb/>
            again to Brutus,) " the highest encomiums on this friend of <lb/>
            ours, who yet chooses to leave Cæsar’s character to me;—that <lb/>
            he should be a perfect master of the language of polite con- <lb/>
            versation, is a circumstance which is almost too obvious to be <lb/>
            mentioned. I said, the highest encomiums," pursued Atticus, <lb/>
            " because he says in so many words, when he addresses himself <lb/>
            to Cicero, ‘If others have bestowed all their time and atten- <lb/>
            tion to acquire a habit of expressing themselves with ease and <lb/>
            correctness, how much is the name and dignity of the Roman <lb/>
            people indebted to you, who are the highest pattern, aud <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            indeed the first inventor of that rich fertility of language <lb/>
            which distinguishes your performances.'"</p>
          <p>LXXIII. " Indeed," said Brutus, “I think he has extolled <lb/>
            your merit in a very friendly and a very magnificent style; <lb/>
            for you are not only the highest pattern, and even the first <lb/>
            inventor of all our fertility of language, which alone is praise <lb/>
            enough to content any reasonable man, but you have added <lb/>
            fresh honours to the name and dignity of the Roman people; <lb/>
            for the very excellence in which we had hitherto been con- <lb/>
            quered by the vanquished Greeks, has now been either wrested <lb/>
            from their hands, or equally shared, at least, between us and <lb/>
            them. So that I prefer this honourable testimony of Cæsar, I <lb/>
            will not say to the public thanksgiving which was decreed <lb/>
            for your own military services, but to the triumphs of many <lb/>
            heroes." " Very true," replied I, " provided this honourable <lb/>
            testimony was really the voice of Cæsar’s judgment, and <lb/>
            . not of his friendship ; for he certainly has added more to the <lb/>
            dignity of the Roman people, whoever he may be, (if indeed <lb/>
            any such man has yet existed,) who has not only exemplified <lb/>
            and enlarged, but first produced this rich fertility of expres- <lb/>
            sion, than the doughty warriors who have stormed a few paltry <lb/>
            castles of the Ligurians, which have furnished us, you know, <lb/>
            with many repeated triumphs. In reality, if we can submit <lb/>
            to hear the truth, it may be asserted (to say nothing of those <lb/>
            godlike plans, which, supported by the wisdom of our generals, <lb/>
            have frequently saved the sinking state both abroad and at <lb/>
            home) that an orator is justly entitled to the preference <lb/>
            to any commander in a petty war. But the general, yon <lb/>
            will say, is the more serviceable man to the public. Nobody <lb/>
            denies it: and yet (for I am not afraid of provoking your <lb/>
            censure, in a conversation which leaves each of us at liberty <lb/>
            to say what he thinks) I had rather be the author of the <lb/>
            single oration of Crassus, in defence of Curius, than be <lb/>
            honoured with two Ligurian triumphs. You will, perhaps, <lb/>
            reply, that the storming a castle of the Ligurians was a thing <lb/>
            of more consequence to the state, than that the claim of <lb/>
            Curius should be ably supported. This I own to be true. <lb/>
            But it was also of more consequence to the Athenians, that <lb/>
            their houses should be securely roofed, than to have their <lb/>
            city graced with a most beautiful statue of Minerva: and yet, <lb/>
            notwithstanding this, I would much rather have been a <lb/>
            Phidias, than the most skilful joiner in Athens. In the <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            present case therefore, we are not to consider a man's useful- <lb/>
            ness but the strength of his abilities; especially as the <lb/>
            number of painters and statuaries who have excelled in their <lb/>
            profession, is very small; whereas there can never be any <lb/>
            want of joiners and mechanical labourers. LXXIV. But <lb/>
            proceed, my Atticus, with Cæsar; and oblige us with the <lb/>
            remainder of his character." " We see then," said he, " from <lb/>
            what has just been mentioned, that a pure and correct style <lb/>
            is the groundwork, and the very basis and foundation, upon <lb/>
            which an orator must build his other accomplishments ; <lb/>
            though it is true, that those who had hitherto possessed it, <lb/>
            derived it more from early habit, than from any principles of <lb/>
            art. It is needless to refer you to the instances of Lælius <lb/>
            and Scipio ; for a purity of language, as well as of manners, <lb/>
            was the characteristic of the age they lived in. It could not, <lb/>
            indeed, be applied to every one ; for their two contemporaries, <lb/>
            Cæcilius and Pacuvius, spoke very incorrectly; but yet people <lb/>
            in general who had not resided out of the city nor been cor- <lb/>
            rupted by any domestic barbarisms, spoke the Roman lan- <lb/>
            guage with purity. Time, however, as well at Rome as in <lb/>
            Greece, soon altered matters for the worse; for this city (as <lb/>
            had formerly been the case at Athens) was resorted to by a <lb/>
            crowd of adventurers from different parts, who spoke very <lb/>
            corruptly; which shows the necessity of reforming our lan- <lb/>
            guage, and reducing it to a certain standard, which shall not <lb/>
            be liable to vary like the capricious laws of custom. Though <lb/>
            we were then very young, we can easily remember Titus <lb/>
            Flamininus, who was joint-consul with Quintus Metellus; he <lb/>
            was supposed to speak his native language with correctness, <lb/>
            but was a man of no literature.. As to Catulus, he was far <lb/>
            indeed from being destitute cf learning, as you have already <lb/>
            observed; but his reputed purity of diction was chiefly <lb/>
            owing to the sweetness of his voice and the delicacy of his <lb/>
            accent. Cotta, who, by his broad pronunciation, lost all <lb/>
            resemblance of the elegant tone of the Greeks, and affected a <lb/>
            harsh and rustic utterance, quite opposite to that of Catulus, <lb/>
            acquired the same reputation of correctness, by pursuing a <lb/>
            wild and unfrequented path. „ But Sisenna, who had the am- <lb/>
            bition to think of reforming our phraseology, could not be <lb/>
            lashed out of his whimsical and new-fangled turns of expres- <lb/>
            sion, by all the raillery of Caius Rusius." “What do you refer <lb/>
            to ?” said Brutus; “and who was the Caius Rusius you are <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            speaking of ?” “He was a noted prosecutor," replied he, <lb/>
            " some years ago. When this man had supported an indict- <lb/>
            ment against one Caius Rutilius, Sisenna, who was counsel <lb/>
            for the defendant, told him, that several parts of his accu- <lb/>
            sation were spitatical.1 LXXV. My lords, cried Rusius <lb/>
            to the judges, I shall be cruelly over-reached, unless you <lb/>
            give me your assistance. His charge overpowers my com- <lb/>
            prehension; and I am afraid he has some unfair design <lb/>
            upon me. What, in the name of heaven, can he intend by <lb/>
            SPITATICAL ?I know the meaning of SPIT, or SPITTLE; but this <lb/>
            horrid ATICAL, at the end of it, absolutely puzzles me. The <lb/>
            whole bench laughed very heartily at the singular oddity of <lb/>
            the expression; my old friend, however, was still of opinion, <lb/>
            that to speak correctly, was to speak differently from other <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>" But Caesar, who was guided by the principles of art, has <lb/>
            corrected the imperfections of a vicious custom, by adopting <lb/>
            the rules and improvements of a good one, as he found them <lb/>
            occasionally displayed in the course of polite conversation. <lb/>
            Accordingly, to the purest elegance of expression, (which is <lb/>
            equally necessary to every well-bred citizen, as to an orator,) <lb/>
            he has added all the various ornaments of elocution; so that <lb/>
            he seems to exhibit the finest painting in the most advan- <lb/>
            tageous poiut of view. As he has such extraordinary merit <lb/>
            even in the tenor of his language, I must confess that there <lb/>
            is no person I know of, to whom he should yield the prefer- <lb/>
            ence. Besides, his manner of speaking, both as to his voice <lb/>
            and gesture, is splendid and noble, without the least appear- <lb/>
            ance of artifice or affectation; and there is a dignity in his <lb/>
            very presence, which bespeaks a great and elevated mind." <lb/>
            " Indeed," said Brutus, “his orations please me highly; for <lb/>
            I have had the satisfaction to read several of them. He has <lb/>
            likewise written some commentaries, or short memoirs, of <lb/>
            his own transactions." " And such," said I, " as merit the <lb/>
            highest approbation; for they are plain, correct, and graceful, <lb/>
            and divested of all the ornaments of language, so as to appear <lb/>
            (if I may be allowed the expression) in a kind of undress. <lb/>
            But while he pretended only to furnish the loose materials, <lb/>
            for such as might be inclined to compose a regular history, <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original sputatilica, worthy to be spit upon. It appears, <lb/>
            from the connexion, to have been a word whimsically derived by this <lb/>
            author of ’t from sputa, spittle. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="481"/>
            he may, perhaps, have gratified the vanity of a few literary <lb/>
            frisseurs; but he has certainly prevented all sensible men <lb/>
            from attempting any improvement on his plan. For, in his- <lb/>
            tory, nothing is more pleasing than a correct and elegant <lb/>
            brevity of expression. With your leave, however, it is high <lb/>
            time to return to those orators who have quitted the stage <lb/>
            of life.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. “Caius Sicinius, then, who was a grandson of the <lb/>
            censor Quintus Pompey, by one of his daughters, died after <lb/>
            his advancement to the quæstorship. He was a speaker of <lb/>
            some merit and reputation, which he derived from the system <lb/>
            of Hermagoras; who, though he furnished but little assist- <lb/>
            ance for acquiring an ornamental style, gave many useful <lb/>
            precepts to expedite and improve the invention of an orator. <lb/>
            For in this system we have a collection of fixed and determi- <lb/>
            nate rules for public speaking; which are delivered indeed <lb/>
            without any show or parade, (and I might have added, in <lb/>
            a trivial and homely form,) but yet are so plain and me- <lb/>
            thodical, that it is almost impossible to mistake the road. <lb/>
            By keeping close to these, and always digesting his subject <lb/>
            before he ventured to speak upon it, (to which we may add, <lb/>
            that he had a tolerable fluency of expression,) he so far suc- <lb/>
            ceeded, without any other assistance, as to be ranked among <lb/>
            the pleaders of the day. As to Caius Visellius Varro, who <lb/>
            was my cousin, and a contemporary of Sicinius, he was a mau <lb/>
            of great learning. He died while he was a member of the <lb/>
            court of inquests, into which he had been admitted after the <lb/>
            expiration of his ædileship. The public, I confess, had not the <lb/>
            same opinion of his abilities that I have: for he never passed <lb/>
            as a man of sterling eloquence among the people. His speech <lb/>
            was excessively quick and rapid, and consequently indistinct; <lb/>
            for, in fact, it was embarrassed and obscured by the celerity <lb/>
            of its course ; and yet, after all, you will scarcely find a man <lb/>
            who had a better choice of words, or a richer vein of sen- <lb/>
            timent. He had besides, a complete fund of polite literature, <lb/>
            and a thorough knowledge of the principles of jurisprudence, <lb/>
            which be learned from his father Aculeo. To proceed in <lb/>
            our account of the dead, the next that presents himself is <lb/>
            Lucius Torquatus, whom you will not so readily pronounce <lb/>
            a proficient in the art of speaking (though he was by no <lb/>
            means destitute of elocution), as what is called by the <lb/>
            Greeks, a political adept. He had a plentiful stock of <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            learning, not indeed of the common sort, but of a more <lb/>
            abstruse and curious nature; he had likewise an admirable <lb/>
            memory, and a very sensible and elegant turn of expression ; <lb/>
            all which qualities derived an additional grace from the <lb/>
            dignity of his deportment, and the integrity of his manners. <lb/>
            I was also highly pleased with the style of his contemporary <lb/>
            Triarius, which expressed to perfection the character of a <lb/>
            worthy old gentleman, who had been thoroughly polished by <lb/>
            the refinements of literature. What a venerable severity <lb/>
            was there in his look! what forcible solemnity in his lan- <lb/>
            guage ! and how thoughtful and deliberate every word he <lb/>
            spoke !" At the mention of Torquatus and Triarius, for each <lb/>
            of whom he had the most affectionate veneration, " It fills <lb/>
            my heart with anguish," said Brutus, “(to omit a thousand <lb/>
            other circumstances,) when I reflect, as I cannot help doing, <lb/>
            on your mentioning the names of these worthy men, that <lb/>
            your long-respected authority was insufficient to procure <lb/>
            an accommodation of our differences. The republic would <lb/>
            not otherwise have been deprived of these, and. many other <lb/>
            excellent citizens." " Not a word more," said I, " on this <lb/>
            melancholy subject, which can only aggravate our sorrow; <lb/>
            for as the remembrance of what is already. past is painful <lb/>
            enough, the prospect of what is yet to come is still more <lb/>
            afflicting. Let us, therefore, drop our unavailing complaints, <lb/>
            and (agreeably to our plan) confine our attention to the <lb/>
            forensic merits of our deceased friends.</p>
          <p>LXXVII. " Among those, then, who lost their lives in this <lb/>
            unhappy war, was Marcus Bibulus, who, though not a pro- <lb/>
            fessed orator, was a very accurate writer, and a solid and <lb/>
            experienced advocate ; and Appius Claudius, your father-in- <lb/>
            law, and my colleague and intimate acquaintance, who was <lb/>
            not only a hard student, and a man of learning, but a prac- <lb/>
            tised orator, a skilful augurist and civilian, and a thorough <lb/>
            adept in the Roman history. As to Lucius Domitius, he <lb/>
            was totally unacquainted with any rules of art; but he spoke <lb/>
            his native language with purity, and had a great freedom of <lb/>
            address. We had likewise the two Lentuli, men of consular <lb/>
            dignity; one of whom, (I mean Publius,) the avenger of my <lb/>
            wrongs, and the author of my restoration, derived all his <lb/>
            powers and accomplishments from the assistance of art, and <lb/>
            not from the bounty of nature; but he had such a great and <lb/>
            noble disposition, that he claimed all the honours of the most <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            illustrious citizens, and supported them with the utmost <lb/>
            dignity of character. The other (Lucius Lentulus) was an <lb/>
            animated speaker, for it would be saying too much, perhaps, <lb/>
            to call him an orator; but, unhappily, he had an utter aver- <lb/>
            sion to the trouble of, thinking. His voice was sonorous; and <lb/>
            his language, though not absolutely harsh and forbidding, <lb/>
            was warm and vigorous, and carried in it a kind of terror.. <lb/>
            In a judicial trial, you would probably have wished for a <lb/>
            more agreeable and a keener advocate; but in a debate on <lb/>
            matters of government, you would have thought his abilities <lb/>
            sufficient. Even Titus Postumius had such powers of utter- <lb/>
            ance as were not to be despised; but in political matters, he <lb/>
            spoke with the same unbridled ardour he fought with ; in <lb/>
            short, he was much too warm; though it must be owned he <lb/>
            possessed an extensive knowledge of the laws and constitution <lb/>
            of his country."</p>
          <p>" Upon my word," cried Atticus, " if the persons you have <lb/>
            mentioned were still living, I should be apt to imagine that <lb/>
            you were endeavouring to solicit their favour. For you intro- <lb/>
            duce everybody who had the courage to stand up and speak <lb/>
            his mind; so that I almost begin to wonder how Marcus <lb/>
            Servilius has escaped your notice." LXXVIII. " I am, <lb/>
            indeed, very sensible," replied I, "that there have been <lb/>
            many who never spoke in public, that were much better <lb/>
            qualified for the task, than those orators I have taken the <lb/>
            pains to enumerate;1 but I have, at least, answered one pur- <lb/>
            pose by it, which is to show you, that in this populous city we <lb/>
            have not had very many who had the resolution to' speak at <lb/>
            all; and that even among these, there have been few who were <lb/>
            entitled to our applause. I cannot, therefore, neglect to take <lb/>
            some notice of those worthy knights, and my intimate friends, <lb/>
            very lately deceased, Publius Cominius Spoletinus, against <lb/>
            whom I pleaded in defence of Caius Cornelius, and who was <lb/>
            a methodical, spirited, and ready speaker; and Tiberius <lb/>
            Accius, of Pisaurum, to .whom I replied in behalf of Aulus <lb/>
            Cluentius, and who was an accurate, and a tolerably copious <lb/>
            advocate : he was also well instructed in the precepts of Her- <lb/>
            magoras, which, though of little service to embellish and <lb/>
            enrich our. elocution, furnish a variety of arguments, which, <lb/>
            like the weapons of the light infantry, may be readily <lb/>
            managed, and are adapted to every subject of debate. I must <note type="footnote"> 1 This was probably intended as an indirect compliment to Atticua </note> <note type="footnote">I I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            add, that I never knew a man of greater industry and appli- <lb/>
            cation. As to Caius Piso, my son-in-law, it is scarcely possible <lb/>
            to mention any one who was blessed with a finer capacity. <lb/>
            He was constantly employed either in public speaking, and <lb/>
            private declamatory exercises, or, at least, in writing and <lb/>
            thinking : and, consequently, he made such a rapid progress, <lb/>
            that he rather seemed to fly than to run. He had an elegant <lb/>
            choice of expression, and the structure of his periods was <lb/>
            perfectly neat and harmonious; he had an astonishing variety <lb/>
            and strength of argument, and a lively and agreeable turn of <lb/>
            thought; and his gesture was naturally so graceful, that it <lb/>
            appeared to have been formed (which it really was not) by <lb/>
            the nicest rules of art. I am rather fearful, indeed, that <lb/>
            I should be thought to have been prompted by my affection <lb/>
            for him to have given him a greater character than he <lb/>
            deserved; but this is so far from being the case, that I might <lb/>
            justly have ascribed to him many qualities of a different and <lb/>
            more valuable nature; for in continence, social ardour, and <lb/>
            every other kind of virtue, there was scarcely any of his <lb/>
            contemporaries who was worthy to be compared with him.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. " Marcus Cælius too must not pass unnoticed, <lb/>
            notwithstanding the unhappy change, either of his fortune or <lb/>
            disposition, which marked the latter part of his life. As long <lb/>
            as he was directed by my influence, he behaved himself so <lb/>
            well as a tribune of the people, that no man supported the <lb/>
            interests of the senate, and of all the good and virtuous, in <lb/>
            opposition to the factious and unruly madness of a set of <lb/>
            abandoned citizens, with more firmness than he did ; a part <lb/>
            in which he was enabled to exert himself to great advantage, <lb/>
            by the force and dignity of his language, and his lively <lb/>
            humour and polite address. He spoke several harangues in <lb/>
            a very sensible style, and three spirited invectives, which <lb/>
            originated from our political disputes; and his defensive <lb/>
            speeches, though not equal to the former, were yet tolerably <lb/>
            good, and had a degree of merit which was far from being <lb/>
            contemptible. After he had been advanced to the ædileship, <lb/>
            by the hearty approbation of all the better sort of citizens, as <lb/>
            he had lost my company (for I was then abroad in Cilicia) he <lb/>
            likewise lost himself; and entirely sunk his credit, by imitat- <lb/>
            ing the conduct of those very men, whom he had before so. <lb/>
            successfully opposed. But Marcus Calidius has a more parti <lb/>
            cuJar claim to cur notice for the singularity of his character <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            which cannot so properly be said to have entitled him <lb/>
            to a place among our other orators, as to distinguish him <lb/>
            from the whole fraternity; for in him we beheld the most <lb/>
            uncommon and the most delicate sentiments, arrayed in the <lb/>
            softest and finest language imaginable. Nothing could be <lb/>
            so easy as the turn and compass of his periods ; nothing so <lb/>
            ductile; nothing more pliable and obsequious to his will; so <lb/>
            that he had a greater command of words than any orator what- <lb/>
            ever. In short, the flow of his language was so pure and <lb/>
            limpid, that nothing could be clearer; and so free, that it <lb/>
            was never clogged or obstructed. Every word was exactly <lb/>
            in the place where it should be, and disposed (as Lucilius <lb/>
            expresses it) with as much nicety as in a curious piece of <lb/>
            mosaic work. We may add, that he had not a single expres- <lb/>
            sion which was either harsh, unnatural, abject, or far-fetched; <lb/>
            and yet he was so far from confining himself to the plain and <lb/>
            ordinary mode of speaking, that he abounded greatly in the <lb/>
            metaphor,-but such metaphors as did not appear to usurp a <lb/>
            post that belonged to another, but only to occupy their own. <lb/>
            These delicacies were displayed, not in a loose and effeminate <lb/>
            style, but in such a one as was strictly numerous, without <lb/>
            either appearing to be so, or running on with a dull uni- <lb/>
            formity of sound. He was likewise master of the various <lb/>
            ornaments of language and thought which the Greeks call <lb/>
            figures, whereby he enlivened and embellished his style as <lb/>
            with so many forensic decorations. We may add that he <lb/>
            readily discovered, upon all occasions, what was the real <lb/>
            point of debate, and where the stress of the argument lay ; <lb/>
            and that his method of ranging his ideas was extremely artful, <lb/>
            his action gentlemanly, and his whole manner very engaging <lb/>
            and very sensible. LXXX. In short, if to speak agreeably is <lb/>
            the chief merit of an orator, you will find no one who was <lb/>
            better qualified than Calidius.</p>
          <p>" But as we have observed a little before, that it is the <lb/>
            business of an orator to instruct, to please, and to move the <lb/>
            passions; he was, indeed, perfectly master of the first two; for <lb/>
            no one could better elucidate his subject, or charm the atten- <lb/>
            tion of his audience. But as to the third qualification, the <lb/>
            moving and alarming the passions, which is of much greater <lb/>
            efficacy than the former, he was wholly destitute of it. He <lb/>
            had no force, no exertion; either by his own choice, and <lb/>
            from an opinion that those who had a loftier turn of expres- <lb/>
             <pb n="486"/>
            sion, and a more warm and spirited action, were little better <lb/>
            than madmen; or because it was contrary to his natural <lb/>
            temper and habitual practice; or, lastly, because it was <lb/>
            beyond the strength of his abilities. If, indeed, it is a useless <lb/>
            quality, his want of it was a real excellence; but if otherwise, <lb/>
            it was certainly a defect. I particularly remember, that <lb/>
            when he prosecuted Quintus Gallius for an attempt to poison <lb/>
            him, and pretended that he had the plainest proofs of it, and <lb/>
            could produce many letters, witnesses, informations, and <lb/>
            other evidences to put the truth of his charge beyond a <lb/>
            doubt, interspersing many sensible and ingenious remarks on <lb/>
            the nature of the crime;—I remember, I say, that when it <lb/>
            tame to my turn to reply to him, after urging every argu- <lb/>
            ment which the case itself suggested, I insisted upon it as a <lb/>
            material circumstance in favour of my client, that the prose- <lb/>
            cutor, while he charged him with a design against his life, and <lb/>
            assured us that he had the most indubitable proofs of it then <lb/>
            in his hands, related his story with as much ease, and as <lb/>
            much calmness and indifference, as if nothing had happened. <lb/>
            ‘Would it have been possible,' said I, (addressing myself to <lb/>
            Calidius,) ‘that you should speak with this air of unconcern, <lb/>
            uuless the charge was purely an invention of your own ? And, <lb/>
            above all, that you, whose eloquence has often vindicated the <lb/>
            wrongs of other people with so much spirit, should speak so <lb/>
            coolly of a crime which threatened your life? Where was <lb/>
            that expression of resentment which is so natural to the in- <lb/>
            jured ? Where that ardour, that eagerness, which extorts the <lb/>
            most pathetic language even from men of the dullest capa- <lb/>
            cities? There was no visible disorder in your mind, no <lb/>
            emotion in your looks and gesture, no smiting of the thigh or <lb/>
            the forehead, nor even a single stamp of the foot. You were, <lb/>
            therefore, so far from interesting our feelings in your favour, <lb/>
            that we could scarcely keep our eyes open, while you were <lb/>
            relating the dangers you had so narrowly escaped.' Thus we <lb/>
            employed the natural defect, or, if you please, the sensible <lb/>
            calmness of an excellent orator, as an argument to invalidate <lb/>
            his charge." “But is it possible to doubt," cried Brutus, <lb/>
            “whether this was a sensible quality, or a defect? For as the <lb/>
            greatest merit of an orator is to be able to inflame the <lb/>
            passions, and give them such a bias as shall best answer his <lb/>
            purpose; he who is destitute of this must certainly be de- <lb/>
            ficient in the most capital part of his profession "</p><pb n="487"/>
            
          <p>LXXXI. “I am of the same opinion," said I; "but let us <lb/>
            aow proceed to him (Hortensius) who is the only remainin- <lb/>
            orator worth noticing; after which, as you seem to insist <lb/>
            upon it, I shall say something of myself. I must first, how <lb/>
            ever, do justice to the memory of two promising youths, <lb/>
            who, if they had lived to a riper age, would have acquired the <lb/>
            highest reputation for their eloquence." “ You mean, I <lb/>
            suppose," said Brutus, “Caius Curio, and Caius Licinius <lb/>
            Calvus." “The very same," replied I. “One of them, besides <lb/>
            his plausible manner, had such an easy and voluble flow <lb/>
            of expression, and such an inexhaustible variety, and some- <lb/>
            times accuracy of sentiment, that he was one of the most <lb/>
            ready and ornamental speakers of his time. Though he had <lb/>
            received but little instruction from the professed masters <lb/>
            of the art, nature had furnished him with an admirable capa- <lb/>
            city for the practice of it. I never, indeed, discovered in him <lb/>
            any great degree of application; but he was certainly very <lb/>
            ambitious to distinguish himself; and if he had continued to <lb/>
            listen to my advice, as he had begun to do, he would have <lb/>
            preferred the acquisition of real honour to that of untimely <lb/>
            grandeur.", " What do you mean ?” said Brutus; " or in what <lb/>
            manner are these two objects to be distinguished ?” " I dis- <lb/>
            tinguish them thus," replied I; “as honour is the reward of <lb/>
            virtue, conferred upon a man by the choice and affection of <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens, he who obtains it by their free votes and <lb/>
            suffrages is to be considered, in my opinion, as an honourable <lb/>
            member of the community. But he who acquires his power <lb/>
            and authority by taking advantage of every unhappy incident, <lb/>
            and without the consent of his fellow-citizens, as Curio aimed <lb/>
            to do, acquires only the name of honour, without the sub- <lb/>
            stance. Whereas, if he had hearkened to me, he would have <lb/>
            risen to the highest dignity, in an honourable manner, and <lb/>
            with the hearty approbation of all men, by a gradual advance- <lb/>
            ment to public offices, as his father and many other eminent <lb/>
            citizens had done before. I often gave the same advice to <lb/>
            Publius Crassus, the son of Marcus, who courted my friend- <lb/>
            ship in the early part of his life; and recommended it to him <lb/>
            very warmly, to consider that as the truest path to honour <lb/>
            which had been already marked out to him by the example <lb/>
            of his ancestors. For he had been extremely well educated, <lb/>
            and was perfectly versed in every branch of polite literature; <lb/>
            he had likewise a penetrating genius, and an elegant variety <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            of expression; and appeared grave and sententious without <lb/>
            arrogance, and modest and diffident without dejection. But, <lb/>
            like many other young men, he was carried away by the tide <lb/>
            of ambition; and after serving a short time with reputation <lb/>
            as a volunteer, nothing could satisfy him but to try his for- <lb/>
            tune as a general, an employment which was confined by the <lb/>
            wisdom of our ancestors to men who had arrived at a certain <lb/>
            age, and who, even then, were obliged to submit their pre- <lb/>
            tensions to the uncertain issue of a public decision. Thus, by <lb/>
            exposing himself to a fatal catastrophe, while he was endea- <lb/>
            vouring to rival the fame of Cyrus and Alexander, who lived to <lb/>
            finish their desperate career, he lost all resemblance of Lucius <lb/>
            Crassus, and his other worthy progenitors. LXXXII. But <lb/>
            let us return to Calvus, whom we have just mentioned, an <lb/>
            orator who had received more literary improvements than <lb/>
            Curio, and had a more accurate and delicate manner of speak- <lb/>
            ing, which he conducted with great taste and elegance ; but, <lb/>
            (by being too minute and nice a critic upon himself,) while <lb/>
            he was labouring to correct and refine his language, he suf- <lb/>
            fered all the force and spirit of it to evaporate. In short, it <lb/>
            was so exquisitely polished, as to charm the eye of every skilfu <lb/>
            observer; but it was little noticed by the common people in <lb/>
            a crowded forum, which is the proper theatre of eloquence." <lb/>
            " His aim," said Brutus, " was to be admired as an Attic <lb/>
            orator; and to this we must attribute that accurate exility of <lb/>
            style, which he constantly affected." “This, indeed, was his <lb/>
            professed character," replied I; " but he was deceived him- <lb/>
            self, and led others into the same mistake. It is true, who- <lb/>
            ever supposes that to speak in the Attic taste, is to avoid every <lb/>
            awkward, every harsh, every vicious expression, has, in this <lb/>
            sense, an undoubted right to refuse his approbation to every- <lb/>
            thing which is not strictly Attic. For he must naturally <lb/>
            detest whatever is insipid, disgusting, or incorrect; while <lb/>
            he considers correctness and propriety of language as the <lb/>
            religion and good-manners of an orator; and every one who <lb/>
            pretends to speak in public should adopt the same opinion. <lb/>
            But if he bestows the name of Atticism on a meagre, a dry, <lb/>
            and a niggardly turn of expression, provided it is neat, correct, <lb/>
            and polished, I cannot say, indeed, that he bestows it im- <lb/>
            properly ; as the Attic orators, however, had many qualities <lb/>
            of a more important nature, I would advise him to be careful <lb/>
            that he does not overlook their different kinds and degrees of <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            merit, and their great extent and variety of character. The <lb/>
            Attic speakers, he will tell me, are the models upon which he <lb/>
            wishes to form his eloquence. But which of them does he <lb/>
            mean to fix upon ? for they are not all of the same cast. <lb/>
            Who, for instance, could be more unlike each other than <lb/>
            Demosthenes and Lysias or than Demosthenes and Hy- <lb/>
            perides ? Or who more different from either of them, than <lb/>
            Æschines? Which of them, then, do you propose to imitate? <lb/>
            If only one, this will be a tacit implication, that none of the <lb/>
            rest were true masters of Atticism; if all, how can you <lb/>
            possibly succeed, when their characters are so opposite ? Let <lb/>
            me further ask you, whether Demetrius Phalereus spoke in <lb/>
            the Attic style ? In my opinion, his orations have the very <lb/>
            taste of Athens. But he is certainly more florid than either <lb/>
            Hyperides or Lysias; partly from the natural turn of his <lb/>
            genius, and partly by choice.</p>
          <p>LXXXIII. “There were likewise two others at the time <lb/>
            we are speaking of, whose characters were equally dissimilar; <lb/>
            and yet both of them were truly Attic. The first (Charisius) <lb/>
            was the author of a number of speeches, which he composed <lb/>
            for his friends, professedly in imitation of Lysias; and the <lb/>
            other (Demochares, the nephew of Demosthenes) wrote several <lb/>
            orations, and a regular history of what was transacted in <lb/>
            Athens under his own observation ; not so much, indeed, in <lb/>
            the style of an historian, as of an orator. Hegesias took the <lb/>
            former for his model, and was so vain of his own taste for <lb/>
            Atticism, that he considered his predecessors, who were really <lb/>
            masters of it, as mere rustics in comparison of himself. But <lb/>
            what can be more insipid, more frivolous, or more puerile, <lb/>
            than that very concinnity of expression which he actually <lb/>
            acquired ? ‘But still we wish to resemble the Attic speakers.' <lb/>
            Do so by all means. But were not those, then, true Attic <lb/>
            speakers, we have just been mentioning ? ‘Nobody denies <lb/>
            it ; and these are the men we imitate.' But how ? when <lb/>
            they are so very different, not only from each other, but from <lb/>
            all the rest of their contemporaries ? ‘True ; but Thucydides <lb/>
            is our leading pattern.' This, too, I can allow, if you design <lb/>
            to compose histories, instead of pleading causes. For Thu- <lb/>
            cydides was both an exact and a stately historian; but he <lb/>
            never intended to write models for conducting a judicial pro- <lb/>
            cess. I will even go so far as to add, that I have often com- <lb/>
            mended the speeches which he has inserted in his history <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            in great numbers; though I must frankly own, that I neither <lb/>
            could imitate them, if I would, nor indeed would, if I could; <lb/>
            like a man who would neither choose his wine so new as to <lb/>
            have been tunned off in the preceding vintage, nor so exces- <lb/>
            sively old as to date its age from the consulship of Opimius <lb/>
            or Anicius. ‘The latter,' you will say, 'bears the highest price.' <lb/>
            Very probably; but when it has too much age, it has lost <lb/>
            that delicious flavour which pleases the palate, and, in my <lb/>
            opinion, is scarcely tolerable. ‘Would you choose, then, <lb/>
            when you have a mind to regale yourself, to apply to a fresh, <lb/>
            unripened cask ?' By no means ; but still there is a certain <lb/>
            age, when good wine arrives at its utmost perfection. In the <lb/>
            same manner, I would recommend neither a raw, unmellowed <lb/>
            style, which (if I may so- express myself) has been newly <lb/>
            drawn off from the vat; nor the rough and antiquated lan- <lb/>
            guage of the grave and manly Thucydides. For even he, if <lb/>
            he had lived a few years later, would have acquired a much <lb/>
            softer and mellower turn of expression.</p>
          <p>" ‘Let us, then, imitate Demosthenes.' LXXXIV. Good <lb/>
            Gods! to what else do 1 direct all my endeavours, and my <lb/>
            wishes! But it is, perhaps, my misfortune not to succeed. <lb/>
            These Atticisers, however, acquire with ease the paltry cha- <lb/>
            racter they aim at; -not once recollecting that it is not only <lb/>
            recorded in history, but must have been the natural con- <lb/>
            sequence of his superior fame, that when Demosthenes, was to <lb/>
            speak in public, all Greece flocked in crowds to hear him. <lb/>
            But when our Attic orators venture to speak, they are pre- <lb/>
            sently deserted, not only by the little throng around them <lb/>
            who have no interest in the dispute, (which alone is a. morti- <lb/>
            fying proof of their insignificance,) but even by their associates <lb/>
            and fellow-advocates. If to speak, therefore, in a dry and <lb/>
            lifeless manner, is the true criterion of Atticism, they are <lb/>
            heartily welcome to enjoy the credit of it; but if they wish <lb/>
            to put their abilities to the trial, let them attend the Comitia, <lb/>
            or a judicial process of real importance.. The open forum <lb/>
            demands a fuller and more elevated tone; and he is the <lb/>
            orator for me, who is so universally admired, that when he <lb/>
            is to plead an interesting cause, all the benches are filled <lb/>
            beforehand, the tribunal crowded, the clerks and notaries <lb/>
            busy in adjusting their seats, the populace thronging about <lb/>
            the rostra, and the judge brisk and vigilant; he, who hail <lb/>
            such a commanding air, that when he rises up to speak, the <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            whole audience is hushed into a profound silence, which is <lb/>
            Boon interrupted by their repeated plaudits and acclamations, <lb/>
            or by those successive bursts of laughter, or violent transports <lb/>
            of passion, which he knows how to excite at his pleasure; sc <lb/>
            that even a distant observer, though unacquainted with the <lb/>
            subject he is speaking upon, can easily discover that his <lb/>
            hearers are pleased with him, and that a Roscius is perform- <lb/>
            ing his part on the stage. Whoever has the happiness to be <lb/>
            thus followed and applauded, is, beyond dispute, an Attic <lb/>
            speaker; for such was Pericles, such was Hyperides, and <lb/>
            Æschines,and such, in, the most eminent degree, was the <lb/>
            great Demosthenes! If, indeed, these connoisseurs, who have <lb/>
            so much dislike to everything bold and ornamental, only <lb/>
            mean to say that an accurate, a judicious, and a neat and <lb/>
            compact, but unembellished style, is really an Attic one, they <lb/>
            are not mistaken. For in an art of such wonderful extent <lb/>
            and variety as that of speaking, even this subtile and confined <lb/>
            character may claim a place; so that the conclusion will be, <lb/>
            that it is very possible to speak in the Attic taste without <lb/>
            deserving the name of an orator; but that all, in general, <lb/>
            who are truly eloquent, are likewise Attic speakers.</p>
          <p>" It is time, however, to return to Hortensius." LXXXV <lb/>
            "Indeed, I think so," cried Brutus; "though I must acknow- <lb/>
            ledge that this long digression of yours has entertained me <lb/>
            very agreeably." " But I made some remarks," said Atticus, <lb/>
            " which I was several times inclined to mention; only I was <lb/>
            loth to interrupt you. As your discourse, however, seems <lb/>
            to be drawing towards an end, I think I may venture to state <lb/>
            them." “By all means," replied I. " I readily grant, then," <lb/>
            said he, “that there is something very humorous and elegant <lb/>
            in that continued irony, which Socrates employs to so much <lb/>
            advantage in the dialogues of Plato, Xenophon, and Æschines. <lb/>
            For when a dispute commences on the nature of wisdom, he <lb/>
            professes, with a great deal of humour and ingenuity, to have <lb/>
            no pretensions to it himself; while, with a kind of concealed <lb/>
            raillery, he ascribes the highest degree of it to those who had <lb/>
            the arrogance to lay an open claim to it. Thus, in Plato, he <lb/>
            extols Protagoras, Hippias, Prodicus, Gorgias and several <lb/>
            others, to the skies; but represents himself as quite ignorant. <lb/>
            This in him was peculiarly becoming; nor can I agree with <lb/>
            Epicurus, who thinks it censurable. But in a professed <lb/>
            history, (for such, in fact, is the account you have been giving <pb n="492"/>
            <unclear/> <lb/>
            as of the Roman orators,) I shall leave you to judge, whethet <lb/>
            an application of the irony is not equally reprehensible, as <lb/>
            it would be in giving judicial evidence." " Pray, what are <lb/>
            you driving at?" said I; "for I cannot comprehend you." <lb/>
            " I mean," replied he, " in the first place, that the commen- <lb/>
            dations which you have bestowed upon some of our orators, <lb/>
            have a tendency to mislead the opinion of those who are <lb/>
            unacquainted with their true characters. There were like- <lb/>
            wise several parts of your account, at which I could scarcely <lb/>
            forbear laughing; as, for instance, when you compared old <lb/>
            Cato to Lysias. He was, indeed, a great, and a very extra- <lb/>
            ordinary man. Nobody, I believe, will say to the contrary. <lb/>
            But shall we call him an orator ? Shall we pronounce him <lb/>
            the rival of Lysias, who was the most finished character of the <lb/>
            kind? If we mean to jest, this comparison of yours would <lb/>
            form a pretty irony; but if we are talking in real earnest, <lb/>
            we should pay the same scrupulous regard to truth, as if we <lb/>
            were giving evidence upon oath. As a citizen, a senator, <lb/>
            a general, and, in short, a man who was distinguished by his <lb/>
            prudence, his activity, and every other virtue, your favourite <lb/>
            Cato has my highest approbation. I can likewise applaud <lb/>
            his speeches, considering the time he lived in. They exhibit <lb/>
            the outlines of a great genius; but such, however, as are <lb/>
            evidently rude and imperfect. In the same manner, when <lb/>
            you represented his Antiquities as replete with all the graces <lb/>
            of oratory, and compared Cato with Philistus and Thucydides, <lb/>
            did you really imagine, that you could persuade Brutus <lb/>
            and me to believe you ? or would you seriously degrade those, <lb/>
            whom none of the Greeks themselves have been able to equal, <lb/>
            into a comparison with a stiff country gentleman, who scarcely <lb/>
            suspected that there was any such thing in being as a copious <lb/>
            and ornamental style ?</p>
          <p>LXXXVI. " You have likewise said much in commenda- <lb/>
            tion of Galba;—if as the best speaker of his age, I can so far <lb/>
            agree with you, for such was the character he bore ;-but <lb/>
            if you meant to recommend him as an orator, produce his <lb/>
            orations (for they are still extant), and then tell me honestly, <lb/>
            whether you would wish your friend Brutus here to speak as <lb/>
            he did ? Lepidus, too, was the author of several speeches, <lb/>
            which have received your approbation; in which I can <lb/>
            partly join with you, if you consider them only as specimens <lb/>
            of our ancient eloquence. The same might be said of Afri- <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            canus and Lælius, than whose language (you tell us) nothing <lb/>
            in the world can be sweeter; nay, you have mentioned it <lb/>
            with a kind of veneration, and endeavoured to dazzle our <lb/>
            judgment by the great character they bore, and the uncom- <lb/>
            mon elegance of their manners. Divest it of these adven- <lb/>
            titious graces, and this sweet language of theirs will appear <lb/>
            so homely, as to be scarcely worth noticing. Carbo, too, <lb/>
            was mentioned as one of our capital orators; and for this <lb/>
            only reason,-that in speaking, as in all other professions, <lb/>
            whatever is the best of its kind, for the time being, how <lb/>
            deficient soever in reality, is always admired and applauded. <lb/>
            What I have said of Carbo, is equally true of the Gracchi; <lb/>
            though, in some particulars, the character you have given <lb/>
            them was no more than they deserved. But to say nothing <lb/>
            of the rest of your orators, let us proceed to Antonius and <lb/>
            Crassus, your two paragons of eloquence, whom I have heard <lb/>
            myself, and who were certainly very able speakers. To the <lb/>
            extraordinary commendation you have bestowed upon them, <lb/>
            I can readily give my assent; but not, however, in such an <lb/>
            unlimited manner as to persuade myself that you have <lb/>
            received as much improvement from the speech in support of <lb/>
            the Servilian law, as Lysippus said he had done by studying <lb/>
            the famous statue! of Polycletus. What you have said on <lb/>
            this occasion I consider as absolute irony; but I shall not <lb/>
            inform you why I think so, lest you should imagine I design <lb/>
            to flatter you. I shall therefore pass over the many fine <lb/>
            encomiums you have bestowed upon these; and what you <lb/>
            have said of Cotta and Sulpicius, and but very lately of your <lb/>
            pupil Cælius. I acknowledge, however, that we may call <lb/>
            them orators; but as to the nature and extent of their merit, <lb/>
            let your own judgment decide. It is scarcely worth observing, <lb/>
            that you have had the additional good-nature to crowd so <lb/>
            many daubers into your list, that there are some, I believe, <lb/>
            who will be ready to wish they had died long ago, that you <lb/>
            might have had an opportunity to insert their names among <lb/>
            the rest." LXXXVII. " You have opened a wide field of in- <lb/>
            quiry," said I, " and started a subject which deserves a separate <lb/>
            discussion; but we must defer it to a more convenient time. <lb/>
            For, to settle it, a great variety of authors must be examined, <lb/>
            and especially Cato; which could not fail to convince you, that <lb/>
            nothing was wanting to complete his pieces, but those rich <note type="footnote"> 1 Doryphorus. A spearman. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            and glowing colours which had not then been invented. As <lb/>
            to the above oration of Crassus, he himself, perhaps, could <lb/>
            have written better, if he had been willing to take the <lb/>
            trouble; but nobody else, I believe, could have mended it. <lb/>
            You have no reason, therefore, to think I spoke ironically, <lb/>
            when I mentioned it as the guide and tutoress of my eloquence; <lb/>
            for though you seem to have a higher opinion of my capacity, <lb/>
            in its present state, you must remember that, in our youth, <lb/>
            we could find nothing better to imitate among the Romans. <lb/>
            And as to my admitting so many into my list of orators, <lb/>
            I only did it (as I have already observed) to show how few <lb/>
            have succeeded in a profession, in which, all were desirous to <lb/>
            excel. I therefore insist upon it that you do not consider me <lb/>
            in the present case as a practiser of irony; though we are in- <lb/>
            formed by Caius Fannius, in his history, that Africanus was a <lb/>
            very excellent one." "As you please about that,” cried Atticus; <lb/>
            " though, by the bye, I did not imagine it would, have been <lb/>
            any disgrace to you, to be what Africanus and Socrates have <lb/>
            been before you." " We may settle this another time," in- <lb/>
            terrupted Brutus; “but will you be so obliging," said he, <lb/>
            (addressing himself to me,) “as to give us a critical analysis <lb/>
            of some of the old speeches you have mentioned ?” " Very <lb/>
            willingly," replied I; " but it must be at Cuma, or Tusculum, <lb/>
            when opportunity offers: for we are near neighbours,, you <lb/>
            know, in both places. LXXXVIII. At present, Jet us <lb/>
            return to Hortensius, from whom we have digressed a second <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>" Hortensius, then, who began to speak in public when he <lb/>
            was very young, was soon employed even in causes of the <lb/>
            greatest moment; and though he first appeared in the time of <lb/>
            Cotta and Sulpicius, (who were only ten years older,) and when <lb/>
            Crassus and Antonius, and afterwards Philippus and Julius, <lb/>
            were in the height of their reputation, he was thought worthy <lb/>
            to be compared with either of them in, point of eloquence. <lb/>
            He had such an excellent memory as I never knew in any <lb/>
            person; so that what he had composed in private, he, was <lb/>
            able to repeat, without notes, in the very same words he had <lb/>
            made use of at first. He employed this natural advantage <lb/>
            with so much readiness, that he not only recollected whatever <lb/>
            he had written or premeditated himself, but, remembered <lb/>
            everything that had been said by his opponents, without tho <lb/>
            help of a prompter. He was likewise inflamed with such <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            a passionate fondness for the profession, that I never saw any <lb/>
            one who took more pains to improve himself; for he would <lb/>
            not suffer a day to elapse without either speaking in the <lb/>
            forum, or composing something at home ; and very often he <lb/>
            did both in the same day. He had, besides, a turn of expres- <lb/>
            sion which was very far from being low and unelevated; and <lb/>
            possessed two other accomplishments, in which no, one could <lb/>
            equal him,—an uncommon clearness and accuracy in stating <lb/>
            the points he was to discuss; and a neat and easy manner of <lb/>
            collecting the substance of what had been said by his anta- <lb/>
            gonist, and by himself. He had likewise an elegant choice <lb/>
            of words, an agreeable flow in his periods, and a copious <lb/>
            elocution, for which he was partly indebted to a fine natural <lb/>
            capacity, and which was partly acquired by the most laborious <lb/>
            rhetorical exercises. In short, he bad a most retentive view of <lb/>
            his subject, and always divided and distributed it into distinct <lb/>
            parts with the greatest exactness; and he very seldom over- <lb/>
            looked anything which the case could suggest, that was proper <lb/>
            either to support his own allegations, or to refute those of his <lb/>
            opponent. Lastly, he had a sweet and sonorous voice ; but <lb/>
            his gesture had rather more art in it, and was managed with <lb/>
            more precision than is requisite in an orator.</p>
          <p>" While he was in the height of his glory, Crassus died, <lb/>
            Cotta was banished, our public trials were intermitted by the <lb/>
            Marsic war, and I myself made my first appearance in the <lb/>
            forum. LXXXIX. Hortensius joined the army, and served <lb/>
            the first campaign as a volunteer, and the second as a military <lb/>
            tribune; Sulpicius was made a lieutenant-general; and An- <lb/>
            tonius was absent on a similar account. The only trial we <lb/>
            had, was that upon the Varian law ; the rest, as I have just <lb/>
            observed, having been intermitted by the war. We had <lb/>
            scarcely anybody left at the bar but Lucius Memmius and <lb/>
            Quintus Pompeius, who spoke mostly on their own affairs; <lb/>
            and, though far from being orators of the first distinction, <lb/>
            were yet tolerable ones, (if we may credit Philippus, who was <lb/>
            himself a mau of some eloquence,) and, in supporting <lb/>
            evidence, displayed all the poignancy of a prosecutor, with a <lb/>
            moderate freedom of elocution. The rest, who were esteemed <lb/>
            our capital speakers, were then in the magistracy, and I had <lb/>
            the benefit of hearing their harangues almost every day. <lb/>
            Caius Curio was chosen a tribune of the people, though he <lb/>
            left off speaking after being once deserted by his whole <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            audience. To him I may add Quintus Metellus Celer, who <lb/>
            though certainly no orator, was far from being destitute of <lb/>
            utterance; but Quintus Varius, Caius Carbo, and Cnæus <lb/>
            Pomponius, were men of real elocution, and might almost be <lb/>
            said to have lived upon the rostra. Caius Julius too, who was <lb/>
            then a curule ædile, was daily employed in making speeches <lb/>
            to the people, which were composed with great neatness and <lb/>
            accuracy. But while I attended the forum with this eager <lb/>
            curiosity, my first disappointment was the banishment of <lb/>
            Cotta; after which I continued to hear the rest with the <lb/>
            same assiduity as before; and though I daily spent the re- <lb/>
            mainder of my time in reading, writing, and private decla- <lb/>
            mation, I cannot say that I much relished my confinement to <lb/>
            these preparatory exercises. The next year Quintus Varius <lb/>
            was condemned, and banished by his own law; and I, that I <lb/>
            might acquire a competent knowledge of the principles of <lb/>
            jurisprudence, then attached myself to Quintus Scævola, the <lb/>
            son of Publius, who, though he did not choose to undertake <lb/>
            the charge of a pupil, yet, by freely giving his advice to those <lb/>
            who consulted him, answered every purpose of instruction <lb/>
            to such as took the trouble to apply to him. In the suc- <lb/>
            ceeding year, in which Sylla and Pompey were consuls, as <lb/>
            Sulpicius, who was elected a tribune of the people, had <lb/>
            occasion to speak in public almost every day, I had oppor- <lb/>
            tunity to acquaint myself thoroughly with his manner of <lb/>
            speaking. At this time Philo, a philosopher of the first <lb/>
            name in the Academy, with many of the principal Athenians, <lb/>
            having deserted their native home, and fled to Rome, from <lb/>
            the fury of Mithridates, I immediately became his scholar, <lb/>
            and was exceedingly taken with his philosophy; and, besides <lb/>
            the pleasure I received from the great variety and sublimity <lb/>
            of his matter, I was still more inclined to confine my atten- <lb/>
            tion to that study; because there was reason to apprehend <lb/>
            that our laws and judicial proceedings would be wholly over- <lb/>
            turned by the continuance of the public disorders. In the <lb/>
            same year Sulpicius lost his life; and Quintus Catulus, <lb/>
            Marcus Antonius, and Caius Julius, three orators who were <lb/>
            partly contemporary with each other, were most inhumanly <lb/>
            put to death. Then also I attended the lectures of Molo the <lb/>
            Rhodian, who was newly come to Rome, and was both an <lb/>
            excellent pleader, and an able teacher of the art.</p>
          <p>XC. " I have mentioned these particulars, which, perhaps <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            may appear foreign to our purpose, that you, my Brutus, (for <lb/>
            Atticus is already acquainted with them,) may be able to <lb/>
            mark my progress, and observe how closely I trod upon the <lb/>
            heels of Hortensius. The three following years the city was <lb/>
            free from the tumult of arms; but either by the death, the <lb/>
            voluntary retirement, or the flight of our ablest orators, (for <lb/>
            even Marcus Crassus, and the two Lentuli, who were then in <lb/>
            the bloom of youth, had all left us,) Hortensius, of course, <lb/>
            was the first speaker in the forum. Antistius, too, was daily <lb/>
            rising into reputation ; Piso pleaded pretty often; Pomponius, <lb/>
            not so frequently; Carbo, very seldom; and Philippus, only <lb/>
            once or twice. In the meanwhile I pursued my studies of every <lb/>
            kind, day and night, with unremitting application. I lodged <lb/>
            and boarded at my own house (where he lately died) Diodotus <lb/>
            the Stoic; whom I employed as my preceptor in various other <lb/>
            parts of learning, but particularly in logic, which may be con- <lb/>
            sidered as a close and contracted species of eloquence ; and <lb/>
            without which, you yourself have declared it impossible to <lb/>
            acquire that full and perfect eloquence, which they suppose <lb/>
            to be an open and dilated kind of logic. Yet with all my atten- <lb/>
            tion to Diodotus, and the various arts he was master of, I <lb/>
            never suffered even a single day to escape me, without some <lb/>
            exercise of the oratorical kind. I constantly declaimed in <lb/>
            private with Marcus Piso, Quintus Pompeius, or some other <lb/>
            of my acquaintance; pretty often in Latin, but much oftener <lb/>
            in Greek; because the Greek furnishes a greater variety of <lb/>
            ornaments, and an opportunity of imitating and introducing <lb/>
            them into the Latin; and because the Greek masters, who <lb/>
            were far the best, could not correct and improve us, unless we <lb/>
            declaimed in that language. This time was distinguished by <lb/>
            a violent struggle to restore the liberty of the republic; the <lb/>
            barbarous slaughter of the three orators, Scævola, Carbo, and <lb/>
            Antistius; the return of Cotta, Curio, Crassus, Pompey, and <lb/>
            the Lentuli; the re-establishment of the laws and courts of <lb/>
            judicature, and the entire restoration of the commonwealth; <lb/>
            but we lost Pomponius, Censorinus, and Murena, from the <lb/>
            roll of orators. I now began, for the first time, to under- <lb/>
            take the management of causes, both private and public; not, <lb/>
            as most did, with a view to learn my profession, but to make <lb/>
            a trial of the abilities which I had taken so much pains to <lb/>
            acquire. I had then a second opportunity of attending the <lb/>
            instructions of Molo, who came to Rome while Sylla was <note type="footnote"> K K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            dictator, to solicit the payment of what was due to his <lb/>
            countrymen for their services in the Mithridatic war. My <lb/>
            defence of Sextus Roscius, which was the first cause I pleaded, <lb/>
            met with such a favourable reception, that, from that moment, <lb/>
            I was looked upon as an advocate of the first class, and equal <lb/>
            to the greatest and most important causes ; and after this I <lb/>
            pleaded many others, which I precomposed'with all the care <lb/>
            and accuracy I was master of</p>
          <p>XCI. " But as you seem desirous not so much to be ac- <lb/>
            quainted with any incidental marks of my character, or <lb/>
            the first sallies of my youth, as to know me thoroughly, <lb/>
            I shall mention some particulars, which otherwise might <lb/>
            have seemed unnecessary. At this time my body was ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly weak and emaciated; my neck long and slender; <lb/>
            a shape and habit which I thought to be liable to great risk <lb/>
            of life, if engaged in any violent fatigue, or labour of the <lb/>
            lungs. And it gave the greater alarm to those who had <lb/>
            a regard for me, that I used to speak without any remission <lb/>
            or variation, with the utmost stretch of my voice, and a <lb/>
            total agitation of my body. When my friends, therefore, and <lb/>
            physicians, advised me to meddle no more with forensic <lb/>
            causes, I resolved to run any hazard rather than quit the <lb/>
            hopes of glory which I had proposed to myself from plead- <lb/>
            ing; but when I considered, that by managing my voice, <lb/>
            and changing my way of speaking, I might both avoid all <lb/>
            future danger of that kind and speak with greater ease, <lb/>
            I took a resolution of travelling into Asia, merely for an op- <lb/>
            portunity to correct my manner of speaking; so that after <lb/>
            I had been two years at the bar, and acquired some reputa- <lb/>
            tion in the forum, I left Rome. When I came to Athens, I <lb/>
            spent six months with Antiochus, the principal and most <lb/>
            j udicious philosopher of the old Academy; and under this able <lb/>
            master, I renewed those philosophical studies which I had <lb/>
            laboriously cultivated and improved from my earliest youth. <lb/>
            At the same time, however, I continued my rhetorical exer- <lb/>
            cises under Demetrius the Syrian, an experienced and re- <lb/>
            putable master of the art of speaking. After leaving Athens, <lb/>
            I traversed every part of Asia, where I was voluntarily at- <lb/>
            tended by the principal orators of the country, with whom I re- <lb/>
            newed my rhetorical exercises. The chief of them was Menippus <lb/>
            of Stratonica, the most eloquent of all the Asiatics; and <lb/>
            if to be neither tedious nor impertinent is the characteristic <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            of an Attic orator, he may be justly ranked in that class. <lb/>
            Dionysius also of Magnesia, Æschylus of Cnidos, and Xenocles <lb/>
            of Adramyttium, who were esteemed the first- rhetoricians <lb/>
            of Asia, were continually with me. Not contented with these, <lb/>
            I went to Rhodes, and applied myself again to'Molo, whom <lb/>
            I had heard before at Rome; and who was'both an expe- <lb/>
            rienced pleader and a fine writer, and particularly judicious in <lb/>
            remarking the faults of his scholars, as well as in his method <lb/>
            of teaching and improving them. His principal trouble with <lb/>
            me was to restrain the luxuriancy of a juvenile imagination, <lb/>
            always ready to overflow its banks, within its due and proper <lb/>
            channel. Thus, after an excursion of two years, I returned to <lb/>
            Italy, not only much improved, but almost changed into <lb/>
            a new man. The vehemence of my voice and action was <lb/>
            considerably abated; the excessive ardour of my' language <lb/>
            was corrected; my lungs were strengthened; and my whole <lb/>
            constitution confirmed and settled.</p>
          <p>XCII. “Two orators then reigned in the forum (I mean <lb/>
            Cotta and Hortensius), whose glory fired my emulation. <lb/>
            Cotta's way of speaking was calm and easy, and distinguished <lb/>
            by the flowing elegance and propriety of his language. The <lb/>
            other was splendid, warm, and animated; not such as you, <lb/>
            my Brutus, have seen him, when he had shed the blossom of <lb/>
            his eloquence, but far more lively and pathetic both in <lb/>
            his style and action. As Hortensius, therefore, was nearer to <lb/>
            me in age, and his manner more agreeable to the natural <lb/>
            ardour of my temper, I considered him as the proper object <lb/>
            of my competition. For I observed that when they were <lb/>
            both engaged in the same cause, (as, for instance, when they <lb/>
            defended Marcus Canuleius, and Cneius Dolabella, a man of <lb/>
            consular dignity,) though Cotta was generally employed to <lb/>
            open the defence, the most important parts of it were left to <lb/>
            the management of Hortensius. For a crowded audience <lb/>
            and a clamorous forum require an orator who is lively, ani- <lb/>
            mated, full of action, and able to exert his voice to the <lb/>
            highest pitch. The first year, therefore, after my return <lb/>
            from Asia, I undertook several capital causes; and in the <lb/>
            interim I put up as a candidate for the quæstorship, Cotta <lb/>
            for the consulate, and Hortensius for the ædileship. After <lb/>
            I was chosen quæstor, I passed a year in Sicily, the province <lb/>
            assigned to me by lot; Cotta went as consul into Gaul; and <lb/>
            Hortensius, whose new office required his presence at Rome <note type="footnote"> K K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="500"/>
            was left of course the undisputed sovereign of the forum. In <lb/>
            the succeeding year, when I returned from Sicily, my ora- <lb/>
            torical talents, such as they were, displayed themselves in <lb/>
            their full perfection and maturity.</p>
          <p>" I have been saying too much, perhaps, concerning myself ; <lb/>
            but my design in it was not to make a parade of my <lb/>
            eloquence and ability, which I have no temptation to do, but <lb/>
            only to specify the pains and labour which I have taken <lb/>
            to improve it. After spending the five succeeding years in <lb/>
            pleading a variety of causes, and with the ablest advocates of <lb/>
            the time, I was declared an ædile, and undertook the patronage <lb/>
            of the Sicilians against Hortensius, who was then one of the <lb/>
            consuls elect. XCIII. But as the subject of our conversation <lb/>
            not only requires an historical detail of orators, but such <lb/>
            preceptive remarks as may be necessary to elucidate their <lb/>
            characters ; it will not be improper to make some observations <lb/>
            of this kind upon that of Hortensius. After his appointment <lb/>
            to the consulship (very probably, because he saw none of <lb/>
            consular dignity who were able to rival him, and despised the <lb/>
            competition of others of inferior rank) he began to remit that <lb/>
            intense application which he had hitherto persevered in from <lb/>
            his childhood; and having settled himself in very affluent <lb/>
            circumstances, he chose to live for the future what he thought <lb/>
            an easy life, but which, in truth, was rather an indolent one. <lb/>
            In the three succeeding years, the beauty of his colouring <lb/>
            was so much impaired as to be very perceptible to a skilful <lb/>
            connoisseur, though not to a common observer. After that, <lb/>
            he grew every day more unlike himself than before, not only <lb/>
            in other parts of eloquence, but by a gradual decay of the <lb/>
            former celerity and elegant texture of his language. I, at the <lb/>
            same time, spared no pains to improve and enlarge my <lb/>
            talents, such as they were by every exercise that was proper <lb/>
            for the purpose, but particularly by that of writing. Not to <lb/>
            mention several other advantages I derived from it, I shall <lb/>
            only observe, that about this time, and but a very few years <lb/>
            after my ædileship, I was declared the first prætor, by the <lb/>
            unanimous suffrages of my fellow-citizens. For, by my <lb/>
            diligence and assiduity as a pleader, and my accurate way of <lb/>
            speaking, which was rather superior to the ordinary style of <lb/>
            the bar, the novelty of my eloquence had engaged the atten- <lb/>
            tion and secured the good wishes of the public. But I will <lb/>
            say nothing of myself; I will confine my discourse to our <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            other speakers, among whom there is not one who has gained <lb/>
            more than a common acquaintance with those parts of litera- <lb/>
            ture which feed the springs of eloquence : not one who has <lb/>
            been thoroughly nurtured at the breast of Philosophy, which <lb/>
            is the mother of every excellence either in deed or speech; <lb/>
            not one who has acquired an accurate knowledge of the civil <lb/>
            law, which is so necessary for the management even of <lb/>
            private causes, and to direct the judgment of an orator; not <lb/>
            one who is a complete master of the Roman history, which <lb/>
            would enable us, on many occasions, to appeal to the venerable <lb/>
            evidence of the dead ; not one who can entangle his opponent <lb/>
            in such a neat and humorous manner, as to relax the severity <lb/>
            of the judges into a smile or an open laugh; not one who <lb/>
            knows how to dilate and expand his subject, by reducing <lb/>
            it from the limited considerations of time and person, to <lb/>
            some general and indefinite topic; not one who knows how to <lb/>
            enliven it by an agreeable digression; not one who can rouse <lb/>
            the indignation of the judge, or extort from him the tear of <lb/>
            compassion; or who can influence and bend his soul (which <lb/>
            is confessedly the capital perfection of an orator), in such a <lb/>
            manner as shall best suit his purpose.</p>
          <p>XCIV. “When Hortensius, therefore, the once eloquent <lb/>
            and admired Hortensius, had almost vanished from the forum, <lb/>
            my appointment to the consulship, which happened about six <lb/>
            years after his own promotion to that office, revived his dying <lb/>
            emulation; for he was unwilling that, after I had equalled <lb/>
            him in rank and dignity, I should become his superior in <lb/>
            any other respect. But in the twelve succeeding years, by <lb/>
            a mutual deference to each other's abilities, we united our <lb/>
            efforts at the bar in the most amicable manner; and my con- <lb/>
            sulship, which had at first given a short alarm to his jealousy, <lb/>
            afterwards cemented our friendship, by the generous candour <lb/>
            with which he applauded my conduct. But our emulous <lb/>
            efforts were exerted in the most conspicuous manner, just <lb/>
            before the commencement of that unhappy period, when <lb/>
            Eloquence herself was confounded and terrified by the din of <lb/>
            arms into a sudden and total silence; for after Pompey had <lb/>
            proposed and carried a law, which allowed even the party <lb/>
            accused but three hours to make his defence, I appeared <lb/>
            (though comparatively as a mere noviciate by this new regu- <lb/>
            lation) in a number of causes which, in fact, were become per- <lb/>
            fectly the same, or very nearly so; most of which, my Brutus, <lb/>
             <pb n="502"/>
            you'were present to hear, as having been my partner and <lb/>
            fellow-advocate in many of them, though you pleaded several <lb/>
            by yourself; and Hortensius, though he died a short time <lb/>
            afterwards, bore his share in these limited efforts. He began <lb/>
            to plead about ten years before the time of your birth ; and <lb/>
            in his sixty-fourth year, but a very few days before his death, <lb/>
            he was engaged with you in the defence of Appius, your <lb/>
            father-in-law. As to our respective talents, the orations we <lb/>
            have published will enable posterity to form a proper judg- <lb/>
            ment of them.</p>
          <p>XCV. " But if we mean to inquire, why Hortensius; was <lb/>
            more admired for his eloquence in the younger part of his <lb/>
            life than in his latter years, we shall find it owing to the fol- <lb/>
            lowing causes. The first was, that an Asiatic style is more <lb/>
            allowable in a young man than in an old one. Of this there <lb/>
            are two different kinds. The former is sententious and <lb/>
            sprightly, and abounds in those turns of thought which are <lb/>
            not so much distinguished by their weight and solidity as <lb/>
            by their neatness and elegance; of this cast was Timæus <lb/>
            the historian, and the two orators so much talked of in <lb/>
            our younger days, Hierocles of Alabanda, and his brother <lb/>
            Menecles, but particularly the latter; both whose orations <lb/>
            may be reckoned master-pieces of this kind. The other sort <lb/>
            is not so remarkable for the plenitude and richness of its <lb/>
            thoughts, as for its rapid volubility of expression, which at <lb/>
            present is the ruling taste in Asia; but, besides its uncom- <lb/>
            mon fluency, it is recommended by a choice of words which <lb/>
            are peculiarly delicate and ornamental; of this kind were <lb/>
            Æschylus the Cnidian, and my contemporary Æschines the <lb/>
            Milesian; for they had an admirable command of language, <lb/>
            with very little elegance of sentiment. These showy kinds <lb/>
            of eloquence are agreeable enough in young people; but they <lb/>
            are entirely destitute of that gravity and composure which <lb/>
            befits a riper age. As Hortensius therefore excelled in both, <lb/>
            he was heard with applause in the earlier part of his life. For <lb/>
            he had all that fertility and graceful variety of sentiment <lb/>
            which distinguished the character of Menecles: but, as in <lb/>
            Menecles, so in him, there were many turns of thought which <lb/>
            were more delicate and entertaining than really useful, <lb/>
            or indeed sometimes convenient. His language also was <lb/>
            brilliant and rapid, and yet perfectly neat and accurate; <lb/>
            but by no means agreeable to men cf riper years. I have <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            often seen it received by Philippus with the utmost derision, <lb/>
            and, upon some occasions, with a contemptuous indignation; <lb/>
            but the younger part of the audience admired it, and the <lb/>
            populace were highly pleased with it. In his youth, there- <lb/>
            fore, he met the warmest approbation of the public, and <lb/>
            maintained his post with ease as the first orator in the forum. <lb/>
            For the style he chose to speak in, though it has little weight <lb/>
            or authority, appeared very suitable to his age; and as it <lb/>
            discovered in him the most visible marks of genius and appli- <lb/>
            cation, and was recommended by the numerous cadence of <lb/>
            his periods, he was heard with universal applause. But <lb/>
            when the honours he afterwards rose to, and the dignity of <lb/>
            his years, required something more serious and composed, he <lb/>
            still continued to appear in the same character, though it no <lb/>
            longer became him; and as he had, for some considerable <lb/>
            time, intermitted those exercises, and relaxed that laborious <lb/>
            attention which had once distinguished him, though his <lb/>
            , former neatness of expression and luxuriancy of conception <lb/>
            still remained, they were stripped of those brilliant ornaments <lb/>
            they had been used to wear. For this reason, perhaps, my <lb/>
            Brutus, he appeared less pleasing to you than he would have <lb/>
            done, if you had been old enough to hear him, when he was <lb/>
            fired with emulation, and flourished in the full bloom of his <lb/>
            eloquence."</p>
          <p>XCVI. " I am perfectly sensible," said Brutus, " of the <lb/>
            justice of your remarks ; and yet I have always looked upon <lb/>
            Hortensius as a great orator, but especially when he pleaded <lb/>
            for Messala, in the time of your absence." " I have often heard <lb/>
            of it," replied I; " and his oration, which was afterwards pub- <lb/>
            lished, they say, in the very same words in which he delivered <lb/>
            it, is no way inferior to the character you give it. Upon the <lb/>
            whole, then, his reputation flourished from the time of Crassus <lb/>
            and Scævola (reckoning from the consulship of the former), <lb/>
            to the consulship of Paullus and Marcellus; and I held out <lb/>
            in the same career of glory from the dictatorship of Sylla, to <lb/>
            the period I have last mentioned. Thus the eloquence of <lb/>
            Hortensius was extinguished by his own death, and mine by <lb/>
            that of the commonwealth." “Presage more favourably, <lb/>
            I beg of you," cried Brutus. " As favourably as you please," <lb/>
            said I, “and that, not so much upon my own account as <lb/>
            yours. But his death was truly fortunate, who did not live <lb/>
            to behold the miseries which he had long foreseen; for we <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            often lamented, between ourselves, the misfortunes which <lb/>
            hung over the state, when we discovered the seeds of a civil <lb/>
            war in the insatiable ambition of a few private citizens, and <lb/>
            saw every hope of an accommodation excluded by the rash- <lb/>
            ness and precipitancy of our public counsels. But the <lb/>
            felicity which always marked his life seems to have exempted <lb/>
            him, by a seasonable death, from the calamities that followed. <lb/>
            But as, after the decease of Hortensius, we seem to have been <lb/>
            left, my Brutus, as the sole guardians of an orphan eloquence, <lb/>
            let us cherish her, within our own walls at least, with a gene- <lb/>
            rous fidelity; let us discourage the addresses of her worthless <lb/>
            and impertinent suitors; let us preserve her pure and un- <lb/>
            blemished in all her virgin charms, and secure her, to the <lb/>
            utmost of our ability, from the lawless violence of every armed <lb/>
            ruffian. I must own, however, though I am heartily grieved <lb/>
            that I entered so late upon the road of life as to be over- <lb/>
            taken by a gloomy night of public distress, before I had <lb/>
            finished my journey, that I am not a little relieved by the <lb/>
            tender consolation which you administered to me in your <lb/>
            very agreeable letters; in which you tell me I ought to <lb/>
            recollect my courage, since my past transactions are such as <lb/>
            will speak for me when I am silent, and survive my death ; <lb/>
            and Ench as, if the Gods permit, will bear an ample testimony <lb/>
            to the prudence and integrity of my public counsels, by the <lb/>
            final restoration of the republic; or, if otherwise, by burying <lb/>
            me in the ruins of my country.</p>
          <p>XCVII. “But when I look upon you, my Brutus, it fills <lb/>
            me with anguish to reflect that, in the vigour of your. youth, <lb/>
            and when you were making the most rapid progress in the <lb/>
            road to fame, your career was suddenly stopped by the fatal <lb/>
            overthrow of the commonwealth. This unhappy circum- <lb/>
            stance has stung me to the heart; and not me only, but my <lb/>
            worthy friend here, who has the same affection for you and <lb/>
            the same esteem for your merit which I have. We have the <lb/>
            warmest wishes for your happiness, and heartily pray that you <lb/>
            may reap the rewards of your excellent virtues, and live to <lb/>
            fiud a republic in which you will be able, not only to revive, <lb/>
            but even to add to the fame of your illustrious ancestors. <lb/>
            For the forum was your birthright, your native theatre of <lb/>
            action; and you were the only person that entered it, who had <lb/>
            not only formed his elocution by a rigorous course of private <lb/>
            practice, but enriched his oratory with the furniture of philo- <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            sophical science, and thus united the highest virtue to the <lb/>
            most consummate eloquence. Your situation, therefore, <lb/>
            wounds us with the double anxiety that you are deprived of <lb/>
            the republic, and the republic of you. But still continue, my <lb/>
            Brutus, (notwithstanding the career of your genius has been <lb/>
            checked by the rude shock of our public distresses,) continue <lb/>
            to pursue your favourite studies, and endeavour (what you <lb/>
            have almost, or rather entirely effected already) to distinguish <lb/>
            yourself from the promiscuous crowd of pleaders with which <lb/>
            I have loaded the little history I have been giving you. For <lb/>
            it would ill befit you (richly furnished as you are with <lb/>
            those liberal arts which, unable to acquire at home, you <lb/>
            imported from that celebrated city which has always been <lb/>
            revered as the seat of learning) to pass after all as an <lb/>
            ordinary pleader. For to what purposes have you studied <lb/>
            under Pammenes, the most eloquent man in Greece ? or what <lb/>
            advantage have you derived from the discipline of the old <lb/>
            Academy, and its hereditary master Aristus, (my guest and <lb/>
            very intimate acquaintance,) if you still rank yourself in the <lb/>
            common class of orators ? Have we not seen that a whole age <lb/>
            could scarcely furnish two speakers who really excelled in <lb/>
            their profession? Among a crowd of contemporaries, Galba, <lb/>
            for instance, was the only orator of distinction; for old Cato <lb/>
            (we are informed) was obliged to yield to his superior merit, <lb/>
            as were likewise his two juniors, Lepidus and Carbo. But, in <lb/>
            a public harangue, the style of his successors, the Gracchi, was <lb/>
            far more easy and lively; and yet, even in their time, the <lb/>
            Roman eloquence had not reached its perfection. Afterwards <lb/>
            came Antonius and Crassus; and then Cotta, Sulpicius, Hor- <lb/>
            tensius, and-but I say no more ; I can only add, that if I <lb/>
            had been so fortunate[The conclusion is lost.]</p><pb n="506"/>
