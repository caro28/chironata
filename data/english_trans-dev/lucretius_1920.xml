          <p>THOU mother of the Aenead race, delight <lb/>
            Of men and deities, bountiful Venus, thou <lb/>
            Who under the sky's gliding constellations <lb/>
            Fillest ship-carrying ocean with thy presence <lb/>
            And the corn-bearing lands, since through thy power <lb/>
            Each kind of living creature is conceived <lb/>
            Then riseth and beholdeth the sun's light: <lb/>
            Before thee and thine advent the winds and clouds <lb/>
            Of heaven take flight, 0 goddess : daedal earth <lb/>
            Puts forth sweet-scented flowers beneath thy feet : <lb/>
            Beholding thee the smooth deep laughs, the sky <lb/>
            Grows calm and shines with wide-outspreading light. <lb/>
            For soon as the day's vernal countenance <lb/>
            Has been revealed, and fresh from wintry bonds <lb/>
            Blows the birth-giving breeze of the West wind, <lb/>
            First do the birds of air give sign of thee, <lb/>
            Goddess, and thine approach, as through their hearts <lb/>
            Thine influence smites. Next the wild herds of beasts <lb/>
            Bound over the rich pastures and swim through <lb/>
            The rapid streams, as captured by thy charm <lb/>
            Each one with eager longing follows thee <lb/>
            Whithersoever thou wouldst lure them on. <lb/>
            And thus through seas, mountains and rushing rivers, <lb/>
            Through the birds' leafy homes and the green plains, <note type="footnote"> 7 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            Striking bland love into the hearts of all, <lb/>
            Thou art the cause that following his lust <lb/>
            Each should renew his race after his kind. <lb/>
            Therefore since thou alone art nature's mistress, <lb/>
            And since without thine aid naught can rise forth <lb/>
            Into the glorious regions of the light, <lb/>
            Nor aught grow to be gladsome and delectable, <lb/>
            Thee would I win to help me while I write <lb/>
            These verses, wherein I labour to describe <lb/>
            The nature of things in honour of my friend <lb/>
            This scion of the Memmian house, whom thou <lb/>
            Hast willed to be found peerless all his days <lb/>
            In every grace. - Therefore the more, great deity, <lb/>
            Grant to my words eternal loveliness : <lb/>
            Cause meanwhile that the savage works of warfare <lb/>
            Over all seas and lands sink hushed to rest. <lb/>
            For thou alone hast power to bless mankind <lb/>
            With tranquil peace ; since of war's savage works <lb/>
            Mavors mighty in battle hath control, <lb/>
            Who oft flings himself back upon thy lap, <lb/>
            Quite vanquished by love's never-healing wound ; <lb/>
            And so with upturned face and shapely neck <lb/>
            Thrown backward, feeds with love his hungry looks, <lb/>
            Gazing on thee, goddess, while thus he lies <lb/>
            Supine, and on thy lips his spirit hangs. <lb/>
            O'er him thus couched upon thy holy body <lb/>
            Do thou bend down to enfold him, and from thy lips <lb/>
            Pour tender speech, petitioning calm peace, <lb/>
            0 glorious divinity, for thy Romans. <lb/>
            For nor can we in our country's hour of trouble <lb/>
            Toil with a mind untroubled at our task, <lb/>
            Nor yet may the famed child of Memmius <lb/>
            Be spared from public service in such times.</p>
          <p>For the rest,l leisured ears and a keen mind <lb/>
            Withdrawn from cares, lend to true reasoning, <note type="footnote"> 1 A few lines seem to have been lost here. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>

            Lest my gifts, which with loving diligence <lb/>
            I set out for you, ere they be understood <lb/>
            You should reject disdainfully. For now <lb/>
            About the most high theory of the heavens <lb/>
            And of the deities, I will undertake <lb/>
            To tell you in my discourse, and will reveal <lb/>
            The first beginnings of existing things, <lb/>
            Out of which nature gives birth and increase <lb/>
            And nourishment to all things ; into which <lb/>
            Nature likewise, when they have been destroyed, <lb/>
            Resolves them back in turn. These we are wont, <lb/>
            In setting forth our argument, to call <lb/>
            Matter, or else begetting particles, <lb/>
            Or to name them the seeds of things : again <lb/>
            As primal atoms we shall speak of them, <lb/>
            Because from them first everything is formed.</p>
          <p>When prostrate upon earth lay human life <lb/>
            Visibly trampled down and foully crushed <lb/>
            Beneath religion's -cruelty, who meanwhile <lb/>
            Forth fromthe regionsof the heavens above <lb/>
            Showed forth her face, lowering down on men <lb/>
            With horrible aspect, first did a man of Greece <lb/>
            Dare to lift up his mortal eyes against her ; <lb/>
            The first was he to stand up and defy her. <lb/>
            Him neither stories of the gods, nor lightnings, <lb/>
            Nor heaven with muttering menaces could quell, <lb/>
            But all the more did they arouse his soul's <lb/>
            Keen valour, till he longed to be the first <lb/>
            To break through the fast-bolted doors of nature. <lb/>
            Therefore his fervent energy of mind <lb/>
            Prevailed, and he passed onward, voyaging far <lb/>
            Beyond the flaming ramparts of the world, <lb/>
            Ranging in mind and spirit far and wide <lb/>
            Throughout the unmeasured universe ; and thence <lb/>
            A conqueror he returns to us, bringing back <note type="footnote"> 1 Epicurus. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            Knowledge both of what can and what cannot <lb/>
            Rise into being, teaching us in fine <lb/>
            Upon what principle each thing has its powers <lb/>
            Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone. <lb/>
            Therefore now has religion been cast down <lb/>
            Beneath men's feet, and trampled on in turn : <lb/>
            Ourselves heaven-high his victory exalts.</p>
          <p>Herein this fear assails me, lest perchance <lb/>
            You should suppose I would initiate you <lb/>
            Into a school of reasoning unholy, <lb/>
            And set your feet upon a path of sin : <lb/>
            Whereas in truth often has this religion <lb/>
            Given birth to sinful and unholy deeds. <lb/>
            So once at Aulis did those chosen chiefs <lb/>
            Of Hellas, those most eminent among heros, <lb/>
            Foully defile the Trivian Virgin's altar <lb/>
            With Iphianassa's lifeblood. For so soon <lb/>
            As the fillet wreathed around her maiden locks <lb/>
            Streamed down in equal lengths from either cheek, <lb/>
            And soon as she was aware of her father standing <lb/>
            Sorrowful by the altar, and at his side <lb/>
            The priestly ministers hiding the knife, <lb/>
            And the folk shedding tears at sight of her, <lb/>
            Speechless in terror, dropping on her knees <lb/>
            To the earth she sank down. Nor in that hour <lb/>
            Of anguish might it avail her that she first <lb/>
            Had given the name of father to the king ; <lb/>
            For by the hands of men lifted on high <lb/>
            Shuddering to the altar she was borne, <lb/>
            Not that, when the due ceremonial rites <lb/>
            Had been accomplished, she might be escorted <lb/>
            By the clear-sounding hymenaeal song, <lb/>
            But that a stainless maiden foully stained, <lb/>
            In the very season of marriage she might fall <lb/>
            A sorrowful victim by a father's stroke, <lb/>
            That so there might be granted to the fleet <note type="footnote"> 10 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            A happy and hallowed sailing. Such the crimes <lb/>
            Whereto religion has had power to prompt-</p>
          <p>Yet there may come a time when you yourself, <lb/>
            Surrendering to the terror-breathing tales <lb/>
            Of seers and bards, will seek to abandon us. <lb/>
            Ay verily, how many dreams even now <lb/>
            May they be forging for you, which might well <lb/>
            Overturn your philosophy of life, <lb/>
            And trouble all your happiness with fear ! <lb/>
            And with good cause : for if men could perceive <lb/>
            That there was a fixed limit to their sorrows, <lb/>
            By some means they would find strength to withstand <lb/>
            The hallowed lies and threatenings of these seers. <lb/>
            But as it is, men have no means, no power <lb/>
            To make a stand, since everlasting seem <lb/>
            The penalties that they must fear in death. <lb/>
            For none knows what is the nature of the soul, <lb/>
            Whether 'tis born, or on the contrary <lb/>
            Enters into our bodies at their birth : <lb/>
            Whether, when torn from us by death, it perishes <lb/>
            Together with us, or thereafter goes <lb/>
            To visit Orcus' glooms and the vast chasms ; <lb/>
            Or penetrates by ordinance divine <lb/>
            Into brutes in man's stead, as sang our own <lb/>
            Ennius, who first from pleasant Helicon <lb/>
            Brought down a garland of unfading leaf, <lb/>
            Destined among Italian tribes of men <lb/>
            To win bright glory. And yet in spite of this <lb/>
            Ennius sets forth in immortal verse <lb/>
            That none the less there does exist a realm <lb/>
            Of Acheron, though neither do our souls <lb/>
            Nor bodies penetrate thither, but a kind <lb/>
            Of phantom images, pale in wondrous wise : <lb/>
            And thence it was, so he relates, that once <lb/>
            The ghost of ever-living Homer rose <lb/>
            Before him, shedding salt tears, and began <note type="footnote"> 11 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            To unfold in discourse the nature of things. <lb/>
            Therefore not only must we grasp the truth <lb/>
            Concerning things on high, what principle <lb/>
            Controls the courses of the sun and moon, <lb/>
            And by what force all that takes place on earth <lb/>
            Is governed, but above all by keen thought <lb/>
            We must investigate whereof consists <lb/>
            The soul and the mind's nature, and what it is <lb/>
            That comes before us when we wake, if then <lb/>
            We are preyed on by disease, or when we lie <lb/>
            Buried in sleep, and terrifies our minds, <lb/>
            So that we seem face to face to behold <lb/>
            And hear those speaking to us who are dead, <lb/>
            Whose bones the earth now holds in its embrace.</p>
          <p>Nor am I unaware how hard my task <lb/>
            In Latin verses to set clearly forth <lb/>
            The obscure truths discovered by the Greeks, <lb/>
            Chiefly because so much will need new terms <lb/>
            To deal with it, owing to our poverty <lb/>
            Of language, and the novelty of the themes. <lb/>
            Nevertheless your worth and the delight <lb/>
            Of your sweet friendship, which I hope to win, <lb/>
            Prompt me to bear the burden of any toil, <lb/>
            And lead me on to watch the calm nights through, <lb/>
            Seeking by means of what words and what measures <lb/>
            I may attain my end, and shed so clear <lb/>
            A light upon your spirit, that thereby <lb/>
            Yourgaze may search the depths of hidden things.</p>
          <p>This terror, then, and darkness of the mind <lb/>
            Must needs be scattered not by the sun's beams <lb/>
            And day's bright arrows, but by contemplation <lb/>
            Of nature's aspect and her inward law. <lb/>
            And this first principle of her design <lb/>
            Shall be our starting point: nothing is ever <lb/>
            By divine will begotten out of nothing. <note type="footnote"> 12 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            In truth the reason fear so dominates <lb/>
            All mortals, is that they behold on earth <lb/>
            And in the sky many things happening, <lb/>
            Yet of these operations by no means <lb/>
            Can they perceive the causes, and so fancy <lb/>
            That they must come to pass by power divine. <lb/>
            Therefore when we have understood that nothing <lb/>
            Can be born out of nothing, we shall then <lb/>
            Win juster knowledge of the truth we seek, <lb/>
            Both from what elements each thing can be formed, <lb/>
            And in what way all things can come to pass <lb/>
            Without the intervention of the gods.</p>
          <p>For if things came from nothing, any kind <lb/>
            Might be born out of anything ; naught then <lb/>
            Would require seed, Thus men might rise from ocean <lb/>
            The scaly race out of the land, while birds <lb/>
            Might suddenly be hatched forth from the sky : <lb/>
            Cattle and other herds and every kind <lb/>
            Of wild beast, bred by no fixed law of birth, <lb/>
            Would roam o'er tilth and wilderness alike. <lb/>
            No fruit would remain constant to its tree, <lb/>
            But would change ; every tree would bear all kinds. <lb/>
            For if there were not for each thing its own <lb/>
            Begetting particles, how could they have <lb/>
            A fixed unvarying mother ? But in fact <lb/>
            Since all are formed from fixed seeds, each is born <lb/>
            And issues into the borders of the light <lb/>
            From that alone wherein resides its substance <lb/>
            And its first bodies. And for this cause all things <lb/>
            Cannot be generated out of all, <lb/>
            Since in each dwells its own particular power. <lb/>
            Again why do we see in spring the rose, <lb/>
            Corn in the summers heat, vines bursting forth <lb/>
            When autumn summons them, if not because <lb/>
            When in their own time the fixed seeds of things <lb/>
            Have flowed together, there is then revealed <note type="footnote"> 13 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            Whatever has been born, while the due seasons <lb/>
            Are present, and the quickened earth brings forth <lb/>
            Safely into the borders of the light <lb/>
            ^ Its tender nurslings ? But if they were formed <lb/>
            L From nothing, they would suddenly spring up <lb/>
            At unfixed periods and hostile times, <lb/>
            Since there would then be no fixed particles <lb/>
            To be kept from a begetting union <lb/>
            By the unpropitious season of the year. <lb/>
            Nor yet after the meeting of the seed <lb/>
            Would lapse of time be, needed for their increase, <lb/>
            If they could grow from nothing. Suddenly <lb/>
            Small babes would become youths ; trees would arise <lb/>
            Shooting up in a moment from the ground. <lb/>
            But nothing of the kind, 'tis plain, takes place, <lb/>
            Seeing that all things grow little by little, <lb/>
            As befits, from determined seed, and growing <lb/>
            Preserve their kind : so that you may perceive <lb/>
            That all things become greater and are nourished <lb/>
            Out of their own material. Furthermore <lb/>
            Without fixed annual seasons for the rain <lb/>
            Earth could not put her gladdening produce forth, <lb/>
            Nor yet, if kept apart from nourishment, <lb/>
            Could living creatures propagate their kind <lb/>
            Or sustain life : so that with greater reason <lb/>
            You may think many things have many atoms <lb/>
            In common, as we see that different words <lb/>
            Have common letters, than that anything <lb/>
            Can come to being without first elements. <lb/>
            Again, why could not nature have produced <lb/>
            Men of such mighty bulk, that they could wade <lb/>
            Through the deep places of the sea, or rend <lb/>
            Huge mountains with their hands, or in one life <lb/>
            Overpass many living generations, <lb/>
            If not because there has been set apart <lb/>
            A changeless substance for begetting things, <lb/>
            And what can thence arise is predetermined ? <note type="footnote"> 14 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Therefore we must confess this truth, that nothing <lb/>
            Can come from nothing, since seed is required <lb/>
            For each thing, out of which it may be born <lb/>
            And lift itself into the air's soft breezes. <lb/>
            Lastly, since it is evident that tilled lands <lb/>
            Excel the untilled, and yield to labouring hands <lb/>
            A richer harvest, we may thence infer <lb/>
            That in the earth there must be primal atoms, <lb/>
            And these, labouring its soil, we stimulate <lb/>
            To rise, when with the coulter we turn up <lb/>
            The fertile clods. But if none such existed, <lb/>
            We should see all things without toil of ours {' <lb/>
            Spring forth far richer of their own accord.</p>
          <p>Furthermore nature dissolves each form back <lb/>
            Into its own first particles, norever <lb/>
            Annihilates things. For if aught could be mortal <lb/>
            In all its parts, then it might from our eyes <lb/>
            Be snatched away to perish suddenly. <lb/>
            For there would be no need of any force <lb/>
            To cause disruption of its parts, and loosen <lb/>
            Their fastenings. But in fact each is composed <lb/>
            Of everlasting seeds ; so till some force <lb/>
            Arrives that with a blow can shatter things <lb/>
            To pieces, or can penetrate within <lb/>
            Their empty spaces, and so break them up, <lb/>
            Nature will not permit the dissolution <lb/>
            Of anything to be seen. Again, if time <lb/>
            Utterly destroys, consuming all the substance <lb/>
            Of whatsoever it removes from sight t ' <lb/>
            Through lapse of ages, out of what does Venus <lb/>
            Bring back into the light of life the race <lb/>
            Of living creatures each after its kind ? <lb/>
            Or, once brought back, whence does the daedal earth <lb/>
            Feed and increase them, giving nourishment <lb/>
            To each after its kind ? Whence do its own <lb/>
            Fountains and far-drawn rivers from without <note type="footnote"> 15 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            Keep full the sea ? Whence does the ether feed <lb/>
            The stars ? For infinite time and lapse of days <lb/>
            Surely must long since have devoured all things <lb/>
            Formed of a body that must die. But if <lb/>
            Throughout that period of time long past <lb/>
            Those atoms have existed out of which <lb/>
            This universe of things has been composed <lb/>
            And recomposed, 'tis plain they are possessed <lb/>
            Of an immortal nature : none of them <lb/>
            Therefore can turn to nothing. Then again <lb/>
            The same force and the same cause would destroy <lb/>
            All things without distinction, were it not <lb/>
            That an eternal substance held them fast, <lb/>
            A substance interwoven part with part <lb/>
            By bonds more or less close. For without doubt <lb/>
            A mere touch would be cause enough for death, <lb/>
            Seeing that any least amount of force <lb/>
            Must needs dissolve the texture of such things, <lb/>
            No one of which had an eternal body. <lb/>
            But in fact since the mutual fastenings <lb/>
            Between first elements are dissimilar, <lb/>
            And their substance eternal, things endure <lb/>
            With body uninjured, till some force arrives <lb/>
            Strong enough to dissolve the texture of each. <lb/>
            Therefore no single thing ever returns <lb/>
            To nothing, but at their disruption all <lb/>
            Pass back into the elements of matter. <lb/>
            Lastly the rain showers perish, when the sky father <lb/>
            Has flung them into the lap of mother earth. <lb/>
            But then bright crops spring up luxuriantly; <lb/>
            Boughs on the trees are green ; the trees themselves <lb/>
            Grow, and with fruits are laden : from this source <lb/>
            Moreover both our own race and the race <lb/>
            Of beasts are nourished ; for this cause we see <lb/>
            Glad towns teeming with children, leafy woods <lb/>
            With young birds' voices singing on all sides ; <lb/>
            For this cause cattle about the fertile meadows <note type="footnote"> 16 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            Wearied with fatness lay their bodies down, <lb/>
            And from their swollen udders oozing falls <lb/>
            The white milk stream ; for this cause a new brood <lb/>
            Bounds on weak limbs over the soft grass, frisking <lb/>
            And gamboling, their young hearts with pure milk thrilled. <lb/>
            None therefore of those things that seem to perish <lb/>
            Utterly perishes, since nature forms <lb/>
            One thing out of another, and permits <lb/>
            Nothing to be begotten, unless first <lb/>
            She has been recruited by another's death.</p>
          <p>Now listen : since I have proved to you that things <lb/>
            Cannot be formed from nothing, lest you yet <lb/>
            Should tend in any way to doubt my words, <lb/>
            Because the primal particles of things <lb/>
            Can never be distinguished by the eyes, <lb/>
            I will proceed to give you instances <lb/>
            Of bodies which yourself you must admit <lb/>
            Are real things, yet cannot be, perceived. <lb/>
            First the wind's wakened force scourges the sea, <lb/>
            Whelming huge ships and scattering the clouds ; <lb/>
            And sometimes with impetuous hurricane <lb/>
            Scouring the plains, it strews them with great trees, <lb/>
            And ravages with forest-rending blasts <lb/>
            The mountain-tops : with such rude savagery <lb/>
            Does the wind howl and bluster and wreak its rage <lb/>
            With menacing uproar. Therefore past all doubt <lb/>
            Winds must be formed of unseen particles <lb/>
            That sweep the seas, the lands, the clouds of heaven, <lb/>
            Ravaging and dishevelling them all <lb/>
            With fitful hurricane gusts. Onward they stream <lb/>
            Multiplying destruction, just as when <lb/>
            The soft nature of water suddenly <lb/>
            Swoops forward in one overwhelming flood <lb/>
            Swelled with abundant rains by a mighty spate <lb/>
            Of water rushing down from the high hills, <lb/>
            Hurtling together broken forest boughs <note type="footnote"> 17 </note><note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            And entire trees : nor can the sturdy bridges <lb/>
            Sustain the oncoming water's sudden force : <lb/>
            In such wise turbulent with much rain the river <lb/>
            Flings its whole mighty strength against the piles. <lb/>
            With a loud crashing roar it then deals havoc, <lb/>
            And rolls the huge stones on beneath its waves, <lb/>
            Sweeping before it all that stems its flood. <lb/>
            In this way then wind-blasts must likewise move ; <lb/>
            And when like a strong stream they have hurled themselves <lb/>
            Towards any quarter, they thrust things along <lb/>
            And with repeated onslaughts overwhelm them, <lb/>
            Often in writhing eddy seizing them <lb/>
            To bear them away in swiftly circling swirl. <lb/>
            Therefore beyond all doubt winds are composed <lb/>
            Of unseen atoms, since in their works and ways <lb/>
            We find that they resemble mighty rivers <lb/>
            Which are of visible substance. Then again <lb/>
            We can perceive the various scents of things, <lb/>
            Yet never see them coming to our nostrils : <lb/>
            Heat too we see not, nor can we observe <lb/>
            Cold with our eyes, nor ever behold words : <lb/>
            Yet must all these be of a bodily nature, <lb/>
            Since they are able to act upon our senses. <lb/>
            For naught can touch or be touched except body. <lb/>
            Clothes also, hung up on a shore where waves <lb/>
            Are breaking, become moist, and then grow dry <lb/>
            If spread out in the sun. Yet in what way <lb/>
            The water's moisture has soaked into them, <lb/>
            Has not been seen, nor again in what way <lb/>
            The heat has driven it out. The moisture therefore <lb/>
            Is dispersed into tiny particles, <lb/>
            Which our eyes have no power to see at all. <lb/>
            Furthermore after many revolutions <lb/>
            Of the sun's year, a finger-ring is thinned <lb/>
            On the under side by being worn : the fall <lb/>
            Of dripping eave-drops hollows out a stone : <lb/>
            The bent ploughshare of iron insensibly <note type="footnote"> 18 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            Grows smaller in the fields ; and we behold <lb/>
            The paving stones of roads worn down at length <lb/>
            By the footsteps of the people. Then again <lb/>
            The brazen statues at the city gates <lb/>
            Show right hands wearing thinner by the touch <lb/>
            Of those who greet them ever as they pass by. <lb/>
            Thus we perceive that all such things grow less <lb/>
            Because they have been worn down : and yet what atoms <lb/>
            Are leaving them each moment, that the jealous <lb/>
            Nature of vision has quite shut us out <lb/>
            From seeing. Finally whatever time <lb/>
            And nature gradually add to things, <lb/>
            Obliging them to grow in due proportion, <lb/>
            No effort of our eyesight can behold. <lb/>
            So too whenever things grow old by age <lb/>
            Or through corruption, and wherever rocks <lb/>
            That overhang the sea are gnawed away <lb/>
            By the corroding brine, you cannot discern - <lb/>
            What they are losing at any single moment. <lb/>
            Thus nature operates by unseen atoms. <note type="footnote"> 19 </note></p><pb n="20"/>

          </ab>
          <p>MOREOVER we are sprung, all we that live, <lb/>
            From heavenly seed : there is, for all, that same <lb/>
            One father 1; from whom when the bounteous Earth, <lb/>
            Our mother, has drunk in the liquid drops <lb/>
            Of moisture, then by him impregnated <lb/>
            She bears bright crops and glad trees and the race <lb/>
            Of men, bears every species of wild beast, <lb/>
            Furnishing food with which all feed their bodies, <lb/>
            And lead a pleasant life, and propagate <lb/>
            Their offspring. Wherefore justly she has won <lb/>
            The name of mother. Also that which once <lb/>
            Came from the earth, sinks back into the earth, <lb/>
            And what was sent down from the coasts of aether, <lb/>
            Returning thither, is received once more <lb/>
            Into the mansions of the sky. So death <lb/>
            Does not demolish things in such a way <lb/>
            As to destroy the particles of matter, <lb/>
            But only dissipates their union, <lb/>
            Then recombines one element with another, <lb/>
            And so brings it to pass that all things change <lb/>
            Their shapes, alter their colours, and receive <lb/>
            Sensations, then in a moment yield them up. <lb/>
            Thus you may learn how greatly it signifies <lb/>
            Both with what others and in what positions <lb/>
            The same primordial atoms are held bound ; <lb/>
            Also what motions they are mutually <lb/>
            Imparting and receiving : and thus too <lb/>
            You need no more suppose that what we see <lb/>
            Hovering upon the surfaces of things, <lb/>
            Or now being born, then suddenly perishing,2 <note type="footnote"> 1 The aether. </note><note type="footnote">2 Colour, sensation, etc. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            Can be inherent qualities in atoms <lb/>
            That are eternal. Nay, in my verses even <lb/>
            It is of moment with what other letters <lb/>
            And in what order each one has been placed. <lb/>
            If not all, yet by far the greater part <lb/>
            Are similar letters : but as their position <lb/>
            Varies, so do the words sound different. <lb/>
            Thus too with actual things, whenever change <lb/>
            Takes place in the collisions motions order <lb/>
            Shape and position of their material atoms, <lb/>
            Then also must the things themselves be changed.</p>
          <p>Now to true reasoning turn your mind, I pray ; <lb/>
            For a new theme is struggling urgently <lb/>
            To reach your ears, a new aspect of things <lb/>
            Would now reveal itself. But there is naught <lb/>
            So easy, that at first it will not seem <lb/>
            Difficult of belief, and likewise naught <lb/>
            So mighty, naught so wondrous, but that all <lb/>
            Little by little abate their wonder at it. <lb/>
            Consider first the colour of the heavens, <lb/>
            So bright and pure, and all that they contain, <lb/>
            The stars wandering everywhere, the moon <lb/>
            And the surpassing radiance of the sun ; <lb/>
            If all these sights were now for the first time <lb/>
            To be revealed to mortals suddenly <lb/>
            And without warning, what could have been described <lb/>
            That would have seemed more marvellous than such <lb/>
            things, <lb/>
            Or that humanity could less have dared <lb/>
            Beforehand to believe might come to pass ? <lb/>
            Nothing, I think : so wonderful had been <lb/>
            This spectacle. Yet think how no one now, <lb/>
            Wearied to satiety at the sight, <lb/>
            Deigns to look up at the sky's shining quarters. <lb/>
            Cease therefore to cast reason from your mind <lb/>
            Terrified by mere novelty, but rather <note type="footnote"> 21 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            Weigh facts with eager judgment; and if then <lb/>
            They appear true, surrender ; if they seem <lb/>
            A falsehood, gird yourself to prove them so. <lb/>
            For since the sum of space outside, beyond <lb/>
            This world's walls, must be infinite, the mind seeks <lb/>
            To reason as to what may else exist <lb/>
            Yonder in regions whither the intellect <lb/>
            Is constantly desiring to prospect, <lb/>
            And whither the projection of our thought <lb/>
            Reaches in free flight of its own accord.</p>
          <p>Now first of all we find that everywhere <lb/>
            In all directions, horizontally, <lb/>
            Below and above throughout the universe <lb/>
            There is no limit, as I have demonstrated. <lb/>
            Indeed the facts themselves proclaim the truth, <lb/>
            And the deep void reveals its nature clearly. <lb/>
            Since then on all sides vacant space extends <lb/>
            Illimitably, and seeds in countless number <lb/>
            And sum immeasurable flit to and fro <lb/>
            Eternally driven on in manifold modes <lb/>
            Of motion, we must deem it in no wise <lb/>
            Probable that this single globe of earth <lb/>
            And this one heaven alone have been created, <lb/>
            While outside all those particles of matter <lb/>
            Are doing nothing : the more so that this world <lb/>
            Was formed by nature, as the seeds of things, <lb/>
            Casually colliding of their own <lb/>
            Spontaneous motion, flocked in manifold ways <lb/>
            Together, vainly, without aim or result, <lb/>
            Until at last such particles combined <lb/>
            As, suddenly thrown together, might become <lb/>
            From time to time the rudiments of great things, <lb/>
            Earth, sea, sky, and the race of living creatures. <lb/>
            Therefore beyond all question we are bound <lb/>
            To admit that elsewhere other aggregates <lb/>
            Of matter must exist, resembling this <note type="footnote"> 22 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            Which in its greedy embrace our aether holds. <lb/>
            Moreover, when much matter is at hand, <lb/>
            And space is there, nor any obstacle <lb/>
            Nor cause of hindrance, then you may be sure <lb/>
            Things must be forming and dissolving there. <lb/>
            Now if there be so vast a store of seeds <lb/>
            That the whole lifetime of all conscious beings <lb/>
            Would fail to count them, and if likewise nature <lb/>
            Abides the same, and so can throw together <lb/>
            The seeds of things each into its own place, <lb/>
            In the same manner as they were thrown together <lb/>
            Into our world, then you must needs admit <lb/>
            That in other regions there are other earths, <lb/>
            And diverse stocks of men and kinds of beasts.</p>
          <p>Besides in the whole universe there exists <lb/>
            No one thing that is born unique, and grows <lb/>
            Unique and sole ; but it must needs belong <lb/>
            To one class, and there must be many others <lb/>
            Of the same kind. Consider first of all <lb/>
            Live creatures : you will find that thus are born <lb/>
            The mountain-ranging breeds of savage beasts, <lb/>
            Thus the human race, thus also the dumb shoals <lb/>
            Of scaly fish and every flying fowl. <lb/>
            Therefore by a like reasoning you must grant <lb/>
            That sky and earth and sun, moon, sea and all <lb/>
            That else exists, are not unique, but rather <lb/>
            Of number innumerable ; since life's deep-fixed <lb/>
            Boundary stone as surely awaits these, <lb/>
            And they are of a body that has birth <lb/>
            As much as any species here on earth <lb/>
            Abounding in examples of its kind.</p>
          <p>If you learn well and keep these truths in mind, <lb/>
            Nature, forthwith enfranchised and released <lb/>
            From her proud lords, is seen then to be acting <lb/>
            In all things of herself spontaneously <note type="footnote"> 23 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            Without the interference of the gods. <lb/>
            For by the holy breasts of those divinities, <lb/>
            Who in calm peace are passing tranquil days <lb/>
            Of life untroubled, who, I ask, has power <lb/>
            To rule the sum of space immeasurable ? <lb/>
            Or who to hold in his controlling hand <lb/>
            The strong reins of the deep ? Who can at once <lb/>
            Make all those various firmaments revolve <lb/>
            And with the fires of aether warm each one <lb/>
            Of all those fruitful earths, or at all times <lb/>
            Be present in all places, so to cause <lb/>
            Darkness by clouds, and shake the calms of heaven <lb/>
            With thunder, to hurl lightnings, and ofttimes <lb/>
            Shatter down his own temples, or withdraw <lb/>
            To desert regions, there to spend his fury <lb/>
            And exercise his bolt, which often indeed <lb/>
            Passes the guilty by, and strikes with death <lb/>
            The unoffending who deserve it least.</p>
          <p>Now since the birth-time of the world, since sea <lb/>
            And earth's first natal day and the sun's origin, <lb/>
            Many atoms have been added from without, <lb/>
            Many seeds from all round, which, shooting them <lb/>
            Hither and thither, the great universe <lb/>
            Has brought together : and by means of these <lb/>
            Sea and land have been able to increase ; <lb/>
            Thus too the mansion of the sky has gained <lb/>
            New spaciousness, and lifted its high roof <lb/>
            Far above earth, and the air has risen with it. <lb/>
            For to each thing its own appropriate atoms <lb/>
            Are all distributed by blows from all <lb/>
            Regions of space, so that they separate <lb/>
            Into their proper elements. Moisture joins <lb/>
            With moisture : earth from earthy substance grows ; <lb/>
            Fires generate fire, and ether ether, <lb/>
            Till Nature, the creatress, consummating <lb/>
            Her labour, has brought all things to their last <note type="footnote"> 24 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            Limit of growth ; as happens, when at length <lb/>
            That which is entering the veins of life <lb/>
            Is now no more than what is flowing away <lb/>
            And ebbing thence. In all things at this point <lb/>
            The age of growth must halt : at this point nature <lb/>
            Curbs increase by her powers. For all such things <lb/>
            As you may see waxing with joyous growth, <lb/>
            And climbing step by step to matured age <lb/>
            Receive into themselves more particles <lb/>
            Than they discharge, so long as food is passing <lb/>
            Easily into all their veins, and while <lb/>
            They are not so widely spread as to throw off <lb/>
            Too many atoms and to cause more waste <lb/>
            Than what their life requires for nourishment. <lb/>
            For we must surely grant that many atoms <lb/>
            Are flowing away from things and leaving them : <lb/>
            But still more must be added, till at length <lb/>
            They have attained the highest pitch of growth. <lb/>
            Then age little by little breaks their powers <lb/>
            And their mature strength, as it wastes away <lb/>
            On the worse side of life. And out of doubt <lb/>
            The bulkier and the wider a thing is, <lb/>
            Once its growth ceases, the more particles <lb/>
            Does it now shed around it and discharge <lb/>
            On all sides : nor is food distributed <lb/>
            Easily into all its veins, nor yet <lb/>
            In quantity sufficient that therefrom <lb/>
            A supply may continually rise up <lb/>
            To compensate the copious emanations <lb/>
            Which it exhales. For there is need of food <lb/>
            To preserve all things by renewing them : <lb/>
            Food must uphold, food sustain everything : <lb/>
            Yet all is to no purpose, since the veins <lb/>
            Fail to convey what should suffice, nor yet <lb/>
            Does nature furnish all that is required. <lb/>
            There is good reason therefore why all forms <lb/>
            Should perish, when they are rarefied by flux <note type="footnote"> 25 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            Of atoms, and succumb to external blows, <lb/>
            Since food must fail advanced age in the end, <lb/>
            And atoms cease not ever from outside <lb/>
            To buffet each thing till they wear it out <lb/>
            And overpower it by beleaguering blows. <lb/>
            In this way then it is that the walls too <lb/>
            Of the great world from all sides shall be stormed <lb/>
            And so collapsing crumble away to ruins. <lb/>
            And even now already this world's age <lb/>
            Is broken, and the worn-out earth can scarce <lb/>
            Create the tiniest animals, she who once <lb/>
            Created every kind, and brought to birth <lb/>
            The huge shapes of wild beasts. For, as I think, <lb/>
            Neither did any golden rope let down <lb/>
            The tribes of mortal creatures from the heights <lb/>
            Of heaven on to the fields, nor did the sea <lb/>
            Nor its waves beating on the rocks create them, <lb/>
            But the same earth gave birth to them, which now <lb/>
            Feeds them from her own breast. At first moreover <lb/>
            Herself spontaneously did she create <lb/>
            Flourishing crops and rich vines for mankind, <lb/>
            Herself gave them sweet fruits and joyous pastures ; <lb/>
            Which now, though aided by our toil, scarce grow <lb/>
            To any size. Thus we wear out our oxen <lb/>
            And the strength of our peasants : we use up <lb/>
            Our iron tools ; yet hardly do we win <lb/>
            A sustenance from the fields, so niggardly <lb/>
            They grudge their produce and increase our toil. <lb/>
            And now shaking his head the aged ploughman <lb/>
            Sighs ever and anon, when he beholds <lb/>
            The labours of his hands all spent in vain ; <lb/>
            And when with times past he compares the present, <lb/>
            He praises often the fortune of his sire, <lb/>
            Harping upon that ancient race of men <lb/>
            Who rich in piety supported life <lb/>
            Upon their narrow plots contentedly, <lb/>
            Seeing the land allotted to each man <note type="footnote"> 26 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            Was far less in those days than now. So too <lb/>
            The planter of the worn-out shrivelled vine <lb/>
            Disconsolately inveighs against the march <lb/>
            Of time, wearying heaven with complaints, <lb/>
            And understands not how all things are wasting <lb/>
            Little by little, and passing to the grave <lb/>
            Tired out by lengthening age and lapse of days. <note type="footnote"> 27 </note></p><pb n="28"/>

          <p>THOU, who from out such darkness first could'st lift <lb/>
            A torch so bright, illumining thereby <lb/>
            The benefits of life, thee do I follow, <lb/>
            0 thou bright glory of the Grecian race, <lb/>
            And in thy deepset footprints firmly now <lb/>
            I plant my steps, not so much through desire <lb/>
            To rival thee, rather because I love <lb/>
            And therefore long to imitate thee : for how <lb/>
            Should a mere swallow strive with swans ; or what <lb/>
            Might kids with tottering limbs, matched in a race, <lb/>
            Achieve against a horse's stalwart strength ? <lb/>
            Thou, father, art discoverer of truth ; <lb/>
            Thou dost enrich us with a fathers precepts ; <lb/>
            And from thy pages, glorious sage, as bees <lb/>
            In flowery glades sip from all plants, so we <lb/>
            Feed likewise upon all thy golden words, <lb/>
            Golden words, ever worthy of endless life. <lb/>
            For soon as, issuing from thy godlike mind, <lb/>
            Thy doctrine has begun to voice abroad <lb/>
            The nature of things, straightway the soul's terrors <lb/>
            Take flight; the world's walls open ; I behold <lb/>
            Things being formed and changed throughout all space. <lb/>
            Revealed is the divinity of the gods, <lb/>
            And their serene abodes, which neither winds <lb/>
            Buffet, nor clouds drench them with showers, nor <lb/>
            snow <lb/>
            Congealed by sharp frost, falling in white flakes, <lb/>
            Violates, but an ever-cloudless sky <lb/>
            Invests them, laughing with wide-spreading light. <lb/>
            Moreover all their wants nature provides, <lb/>
            And there is nothing that at any time <note type="footnote"> 28 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            Can minish their tranquillity of soul. <lb/>
            But on the other hand nowhere are visible <lb/>
            The Acherusian quarters ; and yet earth <lb/>
            In no wise can obstruct our contemplation <lb/>
            Of all those operations that take place <lb/>
            Beneath our feet throughout the nether void. <lb/>
            At such thoughts there comes over me a kind <lb/>
            Of godlike pleasure mixed with thrilling awe, <lb/>
            That nature by thy power should be thus clearly <lb/>
            , Made manifest and unveiled on every side.</p>
          <p>Now since I have demonstrated of what kind <lb/>
            Are the beginnings of all things, and how <lb/>
            Varying are the divers shapes wherein <lb/>
            They are flying onward of their own free will, <lb/>
            Driven in eternal motion, and in what way <lb/>
            Out of these can be formed each several thing, <lb/>
            After these themes it would seem best that now <lb/>
            The nature of the mind and of the soul <lb/>
            Should be elucidated in my verses, <lb/>
            And fear of Acheron driven headlong forth, <lb/>
            That dread which troubles from its lowest depths <lb/>
            The life of man, and brooding over all <lb/>
            With the blackness of death, will not allow <lb/>
            Any pleasure to be unalloyed and pure. <lb/>
            For though men often tell us that diseases <lb/>
            And a life of public shame are to be feared <lb/>
            Far more than Tartarus, the house of death, <lb/>
            And that they know the nature of the soul <lb/>
            To be of blood, or even perhaps of wind, <lb/>
            D If such should be their fancy, and that so <lb/>
            They have no need of our philosophy, <lb/>
            Yet from the following proof you may perceive <lb/>
            That all these boasts are uttered to win praise <lb/>
            Rather than from conviction of the truth. <lb/>
            These same men, exiled from their fatherland, <lb/>
            And banished far from human sight, disgraced <note type="footnote"> 29 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            By foul crime, and beset by every kind <lb/>
            Of wretchedness, none the less still live on, <lb/>
            And to whatever place they bear their misery, <lb/>
            In spite of all make offerings to the dead, <lb/>
            Slaughter black sheep, and to the nether powers <lb/>
            Do sacrifice, and in their bitter plight <lb/>
            Turn their thoughts to religion far more zealously. <lb/>
            Thus you can better judge a man in stress <lb/>
            Of peril, and amidst adversities <lb/>
            Discover what he is ; for then at last <lb/>
            The language of sincerity and truth <lb/>
            Is wrung forth from the bottom of his heart; <lb/>
            The mask is torn off ; what is real remains. <lb/>
            Moreover avarice and blinding lust <lb/>
            For honours, which compel unhappy men <lb/>
            To overpass the bounds of right, and sometimes, <lb/>
            As partners and accomplices of crime, <lb/>
            To struggle with vast effort night and day <lb/>
            Till they emerge upon the heights of power- <lb/>
            These sores of life are in no small degree <lb/>
            Fostered by fear of death. For foul contempt <lb/>
            And biting penury are mostly thought <lb/>
            To be quite different from a pleasurable <lb/>
            And secure life : rather they seem to be <lb/>
            Already but a kind of lingering <lb/>
            Before the gates of death. And so while men, <lb/>
            Urged by an unreal terror, long to escape <lb/>
            Far from these ills and drive them far away, <lb/>
            They pile up wealth by shedding civil blood, <lb/>
            Doubling their riches greedily, while they heap <lb/>
            Massacre upon massacre, rejoice <lb/>
            Ruthlessly in the sad death of a brother, <lb/>
            And shun their kinsmen's board in hate and dread. <lb/>
            Often likewise owing to this same fear <lb/>
            They pine with envy because some other man <lb/>
            In the world's eyes is powerful, some other <lb/>
            Is gazed at, as he walks robed in bright honours, <note type="footnote"> 30 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            While they complain that they themselves are <lb/>
            wallowing <lb/>
            In darkness and in filth. Some sink their lives <lb/>
            In ruin to win statues and a name, <lb/>
            And often with such force, through dread of death, <lb/>
            Does hatred of life and of the sight of day <lb/>
            Seize upon mortals, that with anguished heart <lb/>
            They will destroy themselves, forgetting quite <lb/>
            How this fear is the well-spring of their cares, <lb/>
            This it is that enfeebles honour, this <lb/>
            That bursts the bonds of friendship, and in. fine <lb/>
            Prompts them to cast all duty to the ground. <lb/>
            Since often ere now men have betrayed their country <lb/>
            And beloved parents, seeking so to shun <lb/>
            The realms of Acheron. For just as children <lb/>
            In the blind darkness tremble and are afraid <lb/>
            Of all things, so we sometimes in the light <lb/>
            Fear things that are no whit more to be dreaded <lb/>
            Than those which children shudder at in the dark <lb/>
            Imagining that they will come to pass. <lb/>
            This terror, then, and darkness of the mind <lb/>
            Must needs be scattered not by the sun's beams <lb/>
            And day's bright arrows, but by contemplation <lb/>
            Of nature's aspect and her inward law.</p>
          <p>First then the mind, which we shall often call <lb/>
            The intellect, wherein is placed the council <lb/>
            And government of life, I assert to be <lb/>
            No less a part of man than feet and hands <lb/>
            And eyes are part of the whole living creature. <lb/>
            Yet some would have it that the sense of the mind <lb/>
            Resides in no fixed part, but deem it rather <lb/>
            A kind of vital habit of the body, <lb/>
            Which by the Greeks is called a harmony, <lb/>
            Something that causes us to live with sense, <lb/>
            Although the intellect is in no one part. <lb/>
            Just as good health is often spoken of <note type="footnote"> 31 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            As though belonging to the body, and yet <lb/>
            It is no one part of a healthy man. <lb/>
            Thus they refuse to place the sense of the mind <lb/>
            In one fixed part : and here to me they seem <lb/>
            To wander far indeed astray from truth. <lb/>
            For often the body, which is visible, <lb/>
            Is sick, while in some other hidden part <lb/>
            We experience pleasure ; and ofttimes again <lb/>
            The contrary will happen, when a man <lb/>
            Who is distressed in mind, through his whole body <lb/>
            Feels pleasure : in the same way as the foot <lb/>
            Of a sick man may suffer pain, and yet <lb/>
            His head meanwhile is in no pain at all. <lb/>
            Moreover when the limbs are given up <lb/>
            To soft sleep, and the wearied body lies <lb/>
            Diffused without sensation, there is yet <lb/>
            Something else in us which at that same time <lb/>
            Is stirred in many ways, and into itself <lb/>
            Receives all the emotions of delight, <lb/>
            And all the empty troubles of the heart. <lb/>
            Now, that the soul too dwells within the limbs, <lb/>
            And that it is no harmony whereby <lb/>
            The body is wont to feel, this main proof shows. <lb/>
            When from the body much has been removed, <lb/>
            Yet often life still lingers in our limbs : <lb/>
            Whereas, when a few particles of heat <lb/>
            Have been dispersed, and through the mouth some air <lb/>
            Has been forced out, suddenly that same life <lb/>
            Deserts the arteries and quits the bones : <lb/>
            Whence you may learn that not all particles <lb/>
            Have functions of like moment, nor alike <lb/>
            Support existence ; but that rather those <lb/>
            Which are the seeds of wind and warming heat <lb/>
            Are the cause that life stays within the limbs. <lb/>
            Therefore this vital heat and wind, residing <lb/>
            Within the body itself, is that which quits <lb/>
            Our dying frame. So now that we have found <note type="footnote"> 32 </note><lb/>

            The nature of the mind and of the soul <lb/>
            To be a part in some sense of the man, <lb/>
            Let us give up the name of harmony, <lb/>
            Which was brought down from lofty Helicon <lb/>
            To the musicians, or else they themselves, <lb/>
            Taking it from some other source, transferred it <lb/>
            To what was then without a name of its own. <lb/>
            However that may be, why, let them keep it. <lb/>
            Do you give heed to the rest of my discourse.</p>
          <p>Now I maintain that mind and soul are bound <lb/>
            In union with each other, forming so <lb/>
            A single substance, but that the lord that rules <lb/>
            Throughout the body is the reasoning power <lb/>
            Which we call mind and intellect. Its seat <lb/>
            Is fixed in the middle region of the breast. <lb/>
            For here it is that fear and panic throb : <lb/>
            Around these parts dwell joys that soothe. Here then <lb/>
            Is the intellect or mind. The rest of the soul <lb/>
            Dispersed through the whole body, obeys and moves <lb/>
            At the will and propulsion of the mind, <lb/>
            Which for itself and by itself alone <lb/>
            Has knowledge and rejoices for itself, <lb/>
            When nothing at that time moves soul or body. <lb/>
            And just as, when we are attacked by pain <lb/>
            In head or eye, we do not feel distress <lb/>
            Through our whole body too, so often the mind <lb/>
            Suffers pain by itself, or is envigoured <lb/>
            By happiness, when all the rest of the soul <lb/>
            Throughout the limbs and frame remains unstirred <lb/>
            By any new sensation. But when the mind <lb/>
            Has been perturbed by some more vehement fear, <lb/>
            We see the whole soul feel with it in unison <lb/>
            Through all the limbs ; sweating and paleness then <lb/>
            Spread over the whole body ; the tongue halts, <lb/>
            Speech dies away, the eyes grow dark with mist, <lb/>
            The ears ring and the limbs sink under us. <note type="footnote"> 33 </note><note type="footnote"> 3 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            And indeed often we see men drop down <lb/>
            From terror of mind. Hence easily we may learn <lb/>
            That the soul is united with the mind ; <lb/>
            For when it has been struck by the mind's force, <lb/>
            Straightway it pushes and propels the body. <note type="footnote"> 34 </note></p><pb n="35"/>

          </ab>
          <p>DEATH then is nothing to us, nor one jot <lb/>
            Does it concern us, since the nature of mind <lb/>
            Is thus proved mortal. And as in times long past <lb/>
            We felt no unhappiness when from every side <lb/>
            Gathering for conflict came the Punic hosts, <lb/>
            And all that was beneath the height of heaven, <lb/>
            Shaken by the tumult and dismay of war, <lb/>
            Shuddered and quaked, and mortals were in doubt <lb/>
            To whose empire all human things would fall <lb/>
            By land and sea, so when we are no more, <lb/>
            When body and soul, whereof we were composed <lb/>
            Into one being shall have been divorced, <lb/>
            'Tis plain nothing whatever shall have power <lb/>
            To trouble us, who then shall be no more, <lb/>
            Or stir our senses, no, not if earth with sea <lb/>
            In ruin shall be mingled, and sea with sky. <lb/>
            And even though the powers of mind and soul <lb/>
            After they have been severed from the body <lb/>
            Were still to feel, yet that to us is nothing, <lb/>
            Who by the binding marriage tie between <lb/>
            Body and soul are formed into one being. <lb/>
            Nor if Time should collect our scattered atoms <lb/>
            After our death, and should restore them back <lb/>
            To where they now are placed, and if once more <lb/>
            The light of light were given us, not even that <lb/>
            Would in the least concern us, once the chain <lb/>
            Of self-awareness had been snapped asunder. <lb/>
            So too now what we may have been before <lb/>
            Concerns us not, nor causes us distress. <lb/>
            For when you look back on the whole past course <lb/>
            Of infinite time, and think how manifold <note type="footnote"> 35 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            Must be the modes of matters flux, then easily <lb/>
            May you believe this too, that these same atoms <lb/>
            Of which we now are formed, have often before <lb/>
            Been placed in the same order as they are now. <lb/>
            Yet this can no remembrance bring us back. <lb/>
            For a break in life has since been interposed, <lb/>
            And all our atoms wandering dispersed <lb/>
            Have strayed far from that former consciousness. <lb/>
            For if a man be destined to endure <lb/>
            Misery and suffering, he must first exist <lb/>
            In his own person at that very time <lb/>
            When evil should befall him. But since death <lb/>
            Precludes this, and forbids him to exist <lb/>
            Who was to endure distress, we may be sure <lb/>
            That in death there is nothing we need dread, <lb/>
            That he who exists not cannot become miserable, <lb/>
            And that it makes no difference at all <lb/>
            Whether he shall already have been born <lb/>
            In some past time, when once he has been robbed <lb/>
            By death that dies not of his life that dies.</p>
          <p>Therefore if you should chance to hear some man <lb/>
            Pitying his own lot, that after death <lb/>
            Either his body must decay in the earth, <lb/>
            Or be consumed by flames or jaws of beasts, <lb/>
            Then may you know that his words ring not true, <lb/>
            That in his heart there lurks some secret sting, <lb/>
            Though he himself deny that he believes <lb/>
            Any sense will remain with him in death. <lb/>
            For in fact he grants not all that he professes, <lb/>
            Nor by the roots does he expel and thrust <lb/>
            Self forth from life, but all unwittingly <lb/>
            Assumes that of self something will survive. <lb/>
            For when a living man forbodes that birds <lb/>
            And beasts may rend his body after death, <lb/>
            Then does he pity himself, nor can he quite <lb/>
            Separate and withdraw from the outcast body, <note type="footnote"> 36 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            But fancying that that other is himself, <lb/>
            With his own sense imagines it endued. <lb/>
            So he complains because he was born mortal, <lb/>
            Nor sees that there will be in real death <lb/>
            No other self which living can lament <lb/>
            That he has perished, none that will stand by <lb/>
            And grieve over his burnt and mangled corpse. <lb/>
            For if it be an evil after death <lb/>
            To be mauled by teeth of beasts, why should it seem <lb/>
            Less cruel to be laid out on a pyre <lb/>
            And scorched with hot flames, or to be embalmed <lb/>
            In stifling honey, or to lie stiff and cold <lb/>
            Couched on the cool slab of a chilly stone, <lb/>
            Or to be crushed down under a weight of earth ?</p>
          <p>“Now no more shall thy home, nor thy chaste wife <lb/>
            Receive thee in gladness, nor shall thy sweet children <lb/>
            Run forth to meet thee and snatch kisses from thee, <lb/>
            And touch thee to the heart with silent joy. <lb/>
            No more canst thou be prosperous in thy doings, <lb/>
            A bulwark to thy friends. Poor wretch ! " men cry, <lb/>
            " How wretchedly has one disastrous day <lb/>
            Stript thee of all life's many benefits ! " <lb/>
            Yet this withal they add not : " Nor henceforth <lb/>
            Does craving for these things beset thee more." <lb/>
            This truth, could men but grasp it once in thought <lb/>
            And follow thought with words, would forthwith set <lb/>
            Their spirits free from a huge ache and dread. <lb/>
            " Thou, as thou art, sunk in the sleep of death, <lb/>
            Shalt so continue through all time to come, <lb/>
            Delivered from all feverish miseries : <lb/>
            But we who watched thee on thy dreadful pyre <lb/>
            Change into ashes, we insatiably <lb/>
            Bewept thee ; nor shall any lapse of days <lb/>
            Remove that lifelong sorrow from our hearts." <lb/>
            Of him who spoke thus, well might we inquire, <lb/>
            What grief so exceeding bitter is there here, <note type="footnote"> 37 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            If in the end all comes to sleep and rest, <lb/>
            That one should therefore pine with lifelong misery.</p>
          <p>This too is oft men's wont, when they lie feasting <lb/>
            Wine-cup in hand with garland-shaded brows : <lb/>
            Thus from the heart they speak : " Brief is life's joy <lb/>
            For poor frail men. Soon will it be no more, <lb/>
            Nor ever afterwards may it be called back." <lb/>
            As though a foremost evil to be feared <lb/>
            After their death were this, that parching thirst <lb/>
            Would burn and scorch them in their misery, <lb/>
            Or craving for aught else would then beset them. <lb/>
            No, for none feels the want of self and life, <lb/>
            When mind and body are sunk in sleep together. <lb/>
            For all we care, such sleep might be eternal : <lb/>
            No craving for ourselves moves us at all. <lb/>
            And yet, when starting up from sleep a man <lb/>
            Collects himself, then the atoms of his soul <lb/>
            Throughout his frame cannot be wandering far <lb/>
            From their sense-stirring motions. Therefore death <lb/>
            Must needs be thought far less to us than sleep, <lb/>
            If less can be than what we see is nothing. <lb/>
            For the dispersion of the crowded atoms, <lb/>
            That comes with death, is greater ; nor has ever <lb/>
            Anyone yet awakened, upon whom <lb/>
            Has once fallen the chill arrest of death.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, if Nature suddenly found voice, <lb/>
            And thus in person upbraided one of us : <lb/>
            " What is it, mortal, can afflict thee so, <lb/>
            That thou to such exceeding bitter grief <lb/>
            Shouldst yield ? Why thus bemoan and bewail death ? <lb/>
            For if the life thou hast lived hitherto <lb/>
            Was pleasant to thee, and not all thy blessings, <lb/>
            As though poured into a perforated jar, <lb/>
            Have flowed through and gone thanklessly to waste, <lb/>
            Why not then, like a guest replete with life, <note type="footnote"> 38 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            Take thy departure, and resignedly <lb/>
            Enter, thou fool, upon secure repose ? <lb/>
            But if all that thou hast enjoyed has perished <lb/>
            Squandered away, and life is a mere grievance, <lb/>
            Why seek to add thereto, what in its turn <lb/>
            Must all come to destruction and be lost <lb/>
            Unprofitably ? Why both of life and travail <lb/>
            Dost thou not rather make an end at once ? <lb/>
            For there is nothing more I can contrive <lb/>
            Or find to please thee. All things are the same <lb/>
            At all times. Though thy body be not yet <lb/>
            Decayed with years, nor have thy worn-out limbs <lb/>
            Grown feeble, yet all things remain the same ; <lb/>
            Though thou shouldst overlive all generations, <lb/>
            Nay, even more if thou shouldst never die." <lb/>
            What could we answer, save that Nature's claim <lb/>
            Was just, and her indictment a true plea ? <lb/>
            But if some other more advanced in years <lb/>
            Should miserably complain and lament death <lb/>
            Beyond all reason, would she not yet more justly <lb/>
            Lift up her voice and chide him with sharp speech ? <lb/>
            " Hence with thy tears, buffoon. Cease thy complaints. <lb/>
            After thou hast enjoyed all life's best gifts <lb/>
            Thou now decayest. But because thou hast yearned <lb/>
            Always for what was absent, and despised <lb/>
            That which was present, life has glided from thee <lb/>
            Incomplete and unprofitable. So now <lb/>
            Ere thou didst look for it, at thy pillow Death <lb/>
            Has taken his stand, before thou canst depart <lb/>
            Satisfied with existence and replete. <lb/>
            But now resign all vanities that so ill <lb/>
            Befit thine age : come then, with a good grace <lb/>
            Rise and make room for others ; for thou must." <lb/>
            Justly, I think, would she so plead with him, <lb/>
            Justly reproach and chide : for things grown old <lb/>
            Yield place and are supplanted evermore <lb/>
            By new, and each thing out of something else <note type="footnote"> 39 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            Must be replenished ; nor to the black pit <lb/>
            Of Tartarus was yet any man consigned. <lb/>
            Matter is needed, that therefrom may grow <lb/>
            Succeeding generations : which yet all, <lb/>
            When they have lived their life, shall follow thee. <lb/>
            Thus it is all have perished in past times <lb/>
            No less than thou, and shall hereafter perish. <lb/>
            So one thing out of another shall not cease <lb/>
            For ever to arise ; and life is given <lb/>
            To none in fee, to all in usufruct. <lb/>
            Consider likewise how eternal Time's <lb/>
            Bygone antiquity before our birth <lb/>
            Was nothing to us. In such wise does Nature <lb/>
            Show us the time to come after our death <lb/>
            As in a mirror. Is aught visible <lb/>
            Therein so appalling ? aught that seems like gloom ? <lb/>
            Is it not more secure than any sleep ?</p>
          <p>Moreover all those things which people say <lb/>
            Are found in Acheron's gulf, assuredly <lb/>
            Exist for us in life. No wretched Tantalus, <lb/>
            Numbed by vain terror, quakes, as the tale tells, <lb/>
            Beneath a huge rock hanging in the air; <lb/>
            But in life rather an empty fear of gods <lb/>
            Oppresses mortals ; and the fall they dread <lb/>
            Is fortune's fall, which chance may bring to each. <lb/>
            Nor verily entering the large breast of Tityos, <lb/>
            As he lies stretched in Acheron, do vultures <lb/>
            Find food there for their beaks perpetually. <lb/>
            How'vast soever his body's bulk extends, <lb/>
            Though not nine acres merely with outspread limbs <lb/>
            He cover, but the round of the whole earth, <lb/>
            Yet would he not be able to endure <lb/>
            Eternal pain, nor out of his whole body <lb/>
            For ever provide food. But here for us <lb/>
            He is a Tityos, whom, while'he lies <lb/>
            In bonds of love, fretful anxieties <note type="footnote"> 40 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            Devour like rending birds of prey, or cares, <lb/>
            Sprung from some other craving, lacerate. <lb/>
            A living Sisyphus also we behold <lb/>
            In him who from the people fain would beg <lb/>
            The rods and cruel axes, and each time <lb/>
            Defeated and disconsolate must retire. <lb/>
            For to beg power, which, empty as it is, <lb/>
            Is never given, and in pursuit thereof <lb/>
            To endure grievous toil continually, <lb/>
            Is but to thrust uphill mightily straining <lb/>
            A stone, which from the summit after all <lb/>
            Rolls bounding back down to the level plain. <lb/>
            Moreover to be feeding evermore <lb/>
            The thankless nature of the mind, yet never <lb/>
            To fill it full and sate it with good things, <lb/>
            As do the seasons for us, when each year <lb/>
            They return bringing fruits and varied charms, <lb/>
            Yet never are we filled with lifers delights, <lb/>
            This surely is what is told of those young brides, <lb/>
            Who must pour water into a punctured vessel, <lb/>
            Though they can have no hope to fill it full. <lb/>
            Cerberus and the Furies in like manner <lb/>
            Are fables, and that world deprived of day <lb/>
            Where from its throat Tartarus belches forth <lb/>
            Horrible flames : which things in truth are not, <lb/>
            Nor can be anywhere. But there is in life <lb/>
            A dread of punishment for things ill done, <lb/>
            Terrible as the deeds are terrible ; <lb/>
            And to expiate men's guilt there is the dungeon, <lb/>
            The awful hurling downward from the rock, <lb/>
            Scourgings, mutilations and impalings, <lb/>
            The pitch, the torches and the metal plate. <lb/>
            And even if these be wanting, yet the mind <lb/>
            Conscious of guilt torments itself with goads <lb/>
            And scorching whips, nor in its boding fear <lb/>
            Perceives what end of misery there can be, <lb/>
            Nor what limit at length to punishment, <note type="footnote"> 41 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            Nay fears lest these same evils after death <lb/>
            Should prove more grievous. Thus does the life of <lb/>
            fools <lb/>
            Become at last an Acheron here on earth.</p>
          <p>This too thou may'st say sometimes to thyself: <lb/>
            " Even the good king Ancus closed his eyes <lb/>
            To the light of day, who was so many times <lb/>
            Worthier than thou, unconscionable man. <lb/>
            And since then many others who bore rule <lb/>
            O'er mighty nations, princes and potentates, <lb/>
            Have perished : and he too, even he, who once <lb/>
            Across the great sea paved a path whereby <lb/>
            His legions might pass over, bidding them <lb/>
            Cross dry-shod the salt deeps, and to show scorn <lb/>
            Trampled upon the roarings of the waves <lb/>
            With horses, even he, bereft of light, <lb/>
            Forth from his dying body gasped his soul. <lb/>
            The Scipios' offspring, thunderbolt of war, <lb/>
            Terror of Carthage, gave his bones to the earth, <lb/>
            As though he were the meanest household slave. <lb/>
            Consider too the inventors of wise thoughts <lb/>
            And arts that charm, consider the companions <lb/>
            Of the Heliconian Maidens, among whom <lb/>
            Homer still bears the sceptre without peer ; <lb/>
            Yet he now sleeps the same sleep as they all. <lb/>
            Likewise Democritus, when a ripe old age <lb/>
            Had warned him that the memory-stirring motions <lb/>
            Were waning in his mind, by his own act <lb/>
            Willingly offered up his head to death. <lb/>
            Even Epicurus died, when his life's light <lb/>
            Had run its course, he who in intellect <lb/>
            Surpassed the race of men, quenching the glory <lb/>
            Of all else, as the sun in heaven arising <lb/>
            Quenches the stars. Then wilt thou hesitate <lb/>
            And feel aggrieved to die ? thou for whom life <lb/>
            Is well nigh dead, whilst yet thou art alive <note type="footnote"> 42 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            And lookest on the light; thou who dost waste <lb/>
            Most of thy time in sleep, and waking snorest, <lb/>
            Nor ceasest to see dreams ; who hast a mind <lb/>
            Troubled with empty terror, and ofttimes <lb/>
            Canst not discover what it is that ails thee, <lb/>
            When, poor besotted wretch, from every side <lb/>
            Cares crowd upon thee, and thou goest astray <lb/>
            Drifting in blind perplexity of soul."</p>
          <p><lb/>
            If men not only were to feel this load <lb/>
            That weighs upon their mind and wears them out, <lb/>
            But might have knowledge also of its cause <lb/>
            And whence comes this great pile of misery <lb/>
            Crushing their breasts, they would not spend their lives,! <lb/>
            As now so oft we see them, ignorant <lb/>
            Each of his life's true ends, and seeking ever <lb/>
            By change of place to lay his burden down. <lb/>
            Often, issuing forth from his great mansion, he <lb/>
            Who is weary of home will suddenly return <lb/>
            Perceiving that abroad he is none the happier. <lb/>
            He posts to his villa galloping his ponies, <lb/>
            As though hurrying with help to a house on fire, <lb/>
            Yawns on the very threshold, nay sinks down <lb/>
            Heavily into sleep to seek oblivion, <lb/>
            Or even perhaps starts headlong back to town. <lb/>
            In this way each man flies from his own self, <lb/>
            Yet from that self in fact he has no power <lb/>
            To escape. He clings to it in his own despite, <lb/>
            Although he loathes it, seeing that he is sick, <lb/>
            Yet perceives not the cause of his disease : <lb/>
            Which if he could but comprehend aright, <lb/>
            Relinquishing all else, each man would study <lb/>
            To learn the Nature of Reality, <lb/>
            Since 'tis our state during eternal time, <lb/>
            Not for one hour merely, that is in doubt, <lb/>
            That state wherein mortals must pass the whole <lb/>
            Of what may still await them after death. <note type="footnote"> 43 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            And in conclusion, what base lust of life <lb/>
            Is this, that can so potently compel us <lb/>
            In dubious perils to feel such dismay ? <lb/>
            For indeed certain is the end of life <lb/>
            That awaits mortals, nor can death be shunned. <lb/>
            Meet it we must. Furthermore in the same <lb/>
            Pursuits and actions do we pass our days <lb/>
            For ever, nor may we by living on <lb/>
            Forge for ourselves any new form of pleasure. <lb/>
            But what we crave, while it is absent, seems <lb/>
            To excel all things else ; then, when 'tis ours, <lb/>
            We crave some other thing, gaping wide-mouthed, <lb/>
            Always possessed by the same thirst of life. <lb/>
            What fortune future time may bring, we know not, <lb/>
            Nor what chance has in store for us, nor yet <lb/>
            What end awaits us. By prolonging life <lb/>
            No least jot may we take from death's duration ; <lb/>
            Nought may we steal away therefrom, that so <lb/>
            Haply a less long while we may be dead. <lb/>
            Therefore as many ages as you please <lb/>
            Add to your life's account, yet none the less <lb/>
            Will that eternal death be waiting for you. <lb/>
            And not less long will that man be no more, <lb/>
            Who from to-day has ceased to live, than he <lb/>
            Who has died many months and years ago. <note type="footnote"> 44 </note></p><pb n="45"/>

          <p>AND generally to what pursuits soever <lb/>
            Each of us is attached and closely tied, <lb/>
            Or on whatever tasks we have been used <lb/>
            To spend much time, so that therein the mind <lb/>
            Has borne unwonted strain, in those same tasks <lb/>
            We mostly seem in sleep to be engaged. <lb/>
            Lawyers imagine they are pleading causes, <lb/>
            Or drafting deeds ; generals that they are fighting <lb/>
            In some pitched battle ; mariners that they still <lb/>
            Are waging with the winds their lifelong war ; <lb/>
            And we that we are toiling at our task, <lb/>
            Questioning ever the nature of all things, <lb/>
            And setting our discoveries forth in books <lb/>
            Written in our native tongue. And thus in general <lb/>
            Do all other pursuits and arts appear <lb/>
            To fill men's minds and mock them during sleep. <lb/>
            And with those who for many days together <lb/>
            Have watched stage shows with unremitting zeal, <lb/>
            We generally find that when they have ceased <lb/>
            To apprehend them with their senses, yet <lb/>
            Passages remain open in the mind <lb/>
            Through which the same images of things may enter. <lb/>
            Thus the same sights for many days keep passing <lb/>
            Before their eyes, so that even when awake <lb/>
            They seem to be beholding figures dancing <lb/>
            And moving supple limbs ; also their ears <lb/>
            Seem to be listening clear-toned melodies <lb/>
            Of the lyre's eloquent strings, while they behold <lb/>
            In fancy the same audience, the stage too, <lb/>
            Glowing with all its varied scenery. <lb/>
            So great the influence of zeal and pleasure, <note type="footnote"> 45 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            And of those tasks whereon not only men <lb/>
            Are wont to spend their energies, but even <lb/>
            All living animals. Thus you will see <lb/>
            Strong horses, when their limbs are lying at rest, <lb/>
            Nevertheless in slumber sweat and pant <lb/>
            Continually, and as though to win some prize <lb/>
            Strain their strength to the utmost, or else struggle <lb/>
            To start, as if the barriers were thrown open. <lb/>
            And often hunters' dogs while softly slumbering <lb/>
            Will yet suddenly toss their legs about <lb/>
            And utter hurried yelps, sniffing the air <lb/>
            Again and again, as though following the trail <lb/>
            Of wild beasts they have scented : and roused from sleep <lb/>
            They often chase the empty images <lb/>
            Of stags, as if they saw them in full flight, <lb/>
            Till having shaken their delusions off <lb/>
            They come back to themselves. But the tame brood <lb/>
            Of dogs reared in the house, will shake themselves <lb/>
            And start up from the ground, as if they saw <lb/>
            Unknown figures and faces : and the more savage <lb/>
            Each breed is, the more fierce must be its dreams. <lb/>
            And in the night-time birds of various kinds, <lb/>
            Suddenly taking flight, trouble with their wings <lb/>
            The groves of deities, when in gentle sleep <lb/>
            Hawks have appeared threatening them with havoc <lb/>
            Of battle, flying after them in pursuit. <lb/>
            Again the minds of men, which greatly labouring <lb/>
            Achieve great aims, will often during sleep <lb/>
            Act and perform the same. Kings take by storm, <lb/>
            Are made captive, join battle, cry aloud <lb/>
            As though assassinated then and there. <lb/>
            Many men struggle and utter groans in pain, <lb/>
            And as though mangled by a panther's fangs <lb/>
            Or savage lion's, fill the whole neighbourhood <lb/>
            With vehement clamourings. Many in their sleep <lb/>
            Discourse of great affairs, and often so <lb/>
            Have revealed their own guilt. Many meet death : <note type="footnote"> 46 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            Many, as though falling with all their weight <lb/>
            From high cliffs to the ground, are scared with terror, <lb/>
            And like men reft of reason, hardly from sleep <lb/>
            Come to themselves again, being quite distraught <lb/>
            By the body's tumult. Likewise a man will sit <lb/>
            Thirsting beside a river or pleasant spring <lb/>
            And gulp almost the whole stream down his throat. <lb/>
            Innocent children also, slumber-bound, <lb/>
            Often believe they are lifting up their dress <lb/>
            By a tank or broken vessel, and so pour <lb/>
            The liquid, drained from their whole body, forth, <lb/>
            Soaking the gorgeous-hued magnificence <lb/>
            Of Babylonian coverlets. Then too <lb/>
            To those into the currents of whose age <lb/>
            For the first time seed is entering, when the ripe <lb/>
            Fulness of time has formed it in their limbs, <lb/>
            From without there come images emanating <lb/>
            From some chance body, announcing a glorious face <lb/>
            And beautiful colouring, that excites and stirs <lb/>
            Those parts that have grown turgid with much seed, <lb/>
            So that, as if all things had been performed, <lb/>
            The full tide overflows and stains their vesture.</p>
          <p>This seed whereof we spoke is stirred in us <lb/>
            When first ripening age confirms our frame. <lb/>
            For different causes move and stimulate <lb/>
            Different things. From man the influence <lb/>
            Of man alone rouses forth human seed. <lb/>
            So soon as, thus dislodged, it has retired <lb/>
            From its abodes throughout the limbs and frame, <lb/>
            It withdraws from the whole body, and assembling <lb/>
            At certain places in the system, straightway <lb/>
            Rouses at last the body's genital parts. <lb/>
            These places, irritated, swell with seed ; <lb/>
            And so the wish arises to eject it <lb/>
            Towards that whereto the fell desire tends; <lb/>
            While the body seeks that by which the mind <note type="footnote"> 47 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            Is smitten by love. For all men generally <lb/>
            Fall towards the wound, and the blood glistens <lb/>
            forth <lb/>
            In that direction whence the stroke was dealt us. <lb/>
            And if he is at close quarters, the red drops <lb/>
            Sprinkle the foe. Thus he who has been struck <lb/>
            By the missiles of Venus, whether a boy <lb/>
            With womanish limbs launches the shaft, or else <lb/>
            Some woman darting love from her whole body, <lb/>
            Yearns towards that whereby he has been wounded, <lb/>
            And longs to unite with it, and shoot the stream <lb/>
            Drawn from the one into the other body. <lb/>
            For dumb desire gives presage of the pleasure.</p>
          <p>This desire we call Venus : from it came <lb/>
            The Latin name for love 1 ; and from this source <lb/>
            There trickled first into the heart that drop <lb/>
            Of Venus' honeyed sweetness, followed soon <lb/>
            By chilling care. For though that which you love <lb/>
            Be absent, yet are images of it present, <lb/>
            And its sweet name still haunts within your ears. <lb/>
            But it is wise to shun such images, <lb/>
            And scare off from you all that feeds your love, <lb/>
            Turning your mind elsewhere, and vent instead <lb/>
            Your gathering humours on some other body, <lb/>
            Rather than hold them back, set once for all <lb/>
            Upon the love of one, and so lay up <lb/>
            Care and unfailing anguish for yourself. <lb/>
            For the wound gathers strength and grows in­ <lb/>
            veterate <lb/>
            By feeding, while the madness day by day <lb/>
            Increases, and the misery becomes heavier, <lb/>
            Unless you heal the first wounds by new blows, <lb/>
            And roving in the steps of vagrant Venus <lb/>
            So cure them while yet fresh, or can divert <lb/>
            To something else the movements of your mind. <note type="footnote"> 1 Cupido. </note><note type="footnote"> 48 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
             <lb/>
            kNor does the man who shuns love go without <lb/>
            The fruits of Venus ; rather he makes choice <lb/>
            Of joys that bring no after-pain : for surely <lb/>
            The pleasure of intercourse must be more pure <lb/>
            For those that are heart-whole than for the love-sick. <lb/>
            For in the very moment of possession <lb/>
            The passion of lovers fluctuates to and fro, <lb/>
            Wandering undecidedly, nor know they <lb/>
            What first they would enjoy with eyes and hands. <lb/>
            What they have sought, they tightly press, and cause <lb/>
            Pain to the body, and often print their teeth <lb/>
            Upon the lips, and kiss with bruising mouths, <lb/>
            Because the pleasure is not unalloyed, <lb/>
            And there are secret stings which stimulate <lb/>
            To hurt that very thing, whatever it be, <lb/>
            From which those germs of madness emanate. <lb/>
            But easily, while love lasts, Venus allays <lb/>
            Such pains ; and soft delight, mingled therein, <lb/>
            Bridles their bites. For in this there is hope <lb/>
            That from that very body whence proceeds <lb/>
            Their burning lust, the flame may in turn be quenched, <lb/>
            Although Nature protests the opposite <lb/>
            Must happen, since this is the one sole thing <lb/>
            Whereof the more we have, so much the more <lb/>
            Must the heart be consumed by fell desire. <lb/>
            For food and drink are taken within the body; <lb/>
            And since they are wont to settle in fixed parts, <lb/>
            In this way the desire for water and bread <lb/>
            Is easily satisfied : but from the face <lb/>
            And beautiful colouring of a man there enters <lb/>
            Nothing into the body to enjoy <lb/>
            Save tenuous images, a love-sick hope <lb/>
            Often snatched off by the wind. As when in sleep <lb/>
            A thirsty man seeks to drink, and no liquid <lb/>
            Is given to quench the burning in his limbs, <lb/>
            Yet he pursues the images of water, <lb/>
            Toiling in vain, and still thirsts, though he drink <note type="footnote"> 49 </note><note type="footnote"> 4 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            In a rushing rivers midst; even so in love <lb/>
            Venus deludes lovers with images : <lb/>
            For neither, gaze intently as they may, <lb/>
            Can bodies satiate them, nor with their hands <lb/>
            Can they pluck anything off from the soft limbs, <lb/>
            Aimlessly wandering over the whole body. <lb/>
            And when at last with limbs knit they enjoy <lb/>
            The flower of their age, when now the body <lb/>
            Presages rapture, and Venus is in act <lb/>
            To sow the fields of woman, eagerly <lb/>
            They clasp bodies and join moist mouth to mouth <lb/>
            With panted breath, imprinting lips with teeth ; <lb/>
            In vain, for naught thence can they pluck away, <lb/>
            Nor each with the whole body entering pass <lb/>
            Into the other's body ; for at times <lb/>
            They seem to wish and struggle so to do. <lb/>
            So greedily do they hug the bonds of Venus, <lb/>
            While their limbs melt, enfeebled by the might <lb/>
            Of pleasure. Finally, when the gathered lust <lb/>
            Has burst forth from the frame, awhile there comes <lb/>
            A brief pause in their passion's violent heat. <lb/>
            Then returns the same madness : the old frenzy <lb/>
            Revisits them, when they would fain discover <lb/>
            What verily they desire to attain ; <lb/>
            Yet never can they find out what device <lb/>
            May conquer their disease : in such blind doubt <lb/>
            They waste away, pined by a secret wound.</p>
          <p>Consider too how they consume their strength <lb/>
            And are worn out with toiling ; 'and consider <lb/>
            How at another's beck their life is passed. <lb/>
            Meantime their substance vanishes and is changed <lb/>
            To Babylonian stuffs ; their duties languish ; <lb/>
            Their reputation totters and grows sick. <lb/>
            While at her lover's cost she anoints herself <lb/>
            With precious unguents, and upon her feet <lb/>
            Beautiful Sicyonian slippers laugh. <note type="footnote"> 50 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            Then doubtless she has set for her in gold <lb/>
            Big green-lit emeralds ; and the sea-purple dress, <lb/>
            Worn out by constant use, imbibes the sweat <lb/>
            Of love's encounters. The wealth which their fathers <lb/>
            Had nobly gathered, becomes hair-ribbons <lb/>
            And head-dresses, or else may be is turned <lb/>
            Into a long Greek gown, or stuffs of Alinda <lb/>
            And Ceos. Feasts with goodly broideries <lb/>
            And viands are prepared, games, numerous cups, <lb/>
            Unguents, crowns and festoons ; but all in vain ; <lb/>
            Since from the well-spring of delights some touch <lb/>
            Of bitter rises, to give pain amidst <lb/>
            The very flowers ; either when the mind <lb/>
            Perchance grows conscience-stricken, and remorse <lb/>
            Gnaws it, thus to be spending a life of sloth, <lb/>
            And ruining itself in wanton haunts ; <lb/>
            Or else because she has launched forth some word <lb/>
            And left its sense in doubt, some word that clings <lb/>
            To the hungry heart, and quickens there like fire ; <lb/>
            Or that he fancies she is casting round <lb/>
            Her eyes too freely, or looks upon some other, <lb/>
            And on her face sees traces of a smile.</p>
          <p>When love is permanent and fully prosperous, <lb/>
            These evils are experienced ; but if love <lb/>
            Be crossed and hopeless, there are evils such <lb/>
            That you might apprehend them with closed eyes, <lb/>
            Beyond numbering ; so that it is wiser, <lb/>
            As I have taught you, to be vigilant <lb/>
            Beforehand, and watch well lest you be snared. <lb/>
            For to avoid being tripped up in love's toils <lb/>
            Is not so difficult as, once you are caught, <lb/>
            To issue from the nets and to break through <lb/>
            The strong meshes of Venus. None the less <lb/>
            Even when you are tangled and involved, <lb/>
            You may escape the peril, unless you stand <lb/>
            In your own way, and always overlook <note type="footnote"> 51 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            Every defect whether of mind or body <lb/>
            In her whom your pursue and long to win. <lb/>
            For this is how men generally behave <lb/>
            Blinded by lust, and assign to those they love <lb/>
            Good qualities which are not truly theirs. <lb/>
            So we see women in various ways misformed <lb/>
            And ugly, to be fondly loved and held <lb/>
            In highest favour. And a man will mock <lb/>
            His fellows, urging them to placate Venus, <lb/>
            Because they are troubled by a degrading love, <lb/>
            Yet often the poor fool will have no eyes <lb/>
            For his own far worse plight. The tawny is called <lb/>
            A honey brown ; the filthy and unclean, <lb/>
            Reckless of order ; the green-eyed, a Pallas ; <lb/>
            The sinewy and angular, a gazelle ; <lb/>
            The tiny and dwarfish is a very Grace, <lb/>
            Nothing but sparkle ; the monstrous and ungainly, <lb/>
            A marvel, and composed of majesty. <lb/>
            She stammers, cannot talk, why then she lisps ; <lb/>
            The mute is bashful; but the fiery-tongued <lb/>
            Malicious gossip becomes a brilliant torch. <lb/>
            One is a slender darling, when she scarce <lb/>
            Can live for lack of flesh ; and one half dead <lb/>
            With cough, is merely frail and delicate. <lb/>
            Then the fat and full-bosomed is Ceres' self <lb/>
            Suckling Iacchus ; the snub-nosed, a female <lb/>
            Silenus, or a Satyress ; the thick-lipped, <lb/>
            A kiss incarnate. But more of this sort <lb/>
            It were a tedious labour to recite. <lb/>
            Yet be she noble of feature as you will, <lb/>
            And let the might of Venus emanate <lb/>
            From every limb ; still there are others too ; <lb/>
            Still we have lived without her until now ; <lb/>
            Still she does, and we know she does, the same <lb/>
            In all things as the ugly, and, poor wretch, <lb/>
            Perfumes herself with evil-smelling scents, <lb/>
            While her maids run and hide to giggle in secret. <note type="footnote"> 52 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            But the excluded lover many a time <lb/>
            With flowers and garlands covers tearfully <lb/>
            The threshold, and anoints the haughty posts <lb/>
            With oil of marjoram, and imprints, poor man, <lb/>
            Kisses upon the doors. Yet when at last <lb/>
            He has been admitted, if but a single breath <lb/>
            Should meet him as he enters, he would seek <lb/>
            Specious excuses to be gone, and so <lb/>
            The long-studied, deep-drawn complaint would fall <lb/>
            To the ground, and he would then convict himself <lb/>
            Of folly, now he sees he had attributed <lb/>
            More to her than is right to grant a mortal. <lb/>
            Nor to our Venuses is this unknown : <lb/>
            Wherefore the more are they at pains to hide <lb/>
            All that takes place behind the scenes of life <lb/>
            From those they would keep fettered in love's chains ; <lb/>
            But all in vain, since in imagination <lb/>
            You yet may draw forth all these things to light, <lb/>
            Discovering every cause for ridicule : <lb/>
            And if she be of a mind that still can charm, <lb/>
            And not malicious, you may in your turn <lb/>
            Overlook faults and pardon human frailty.</p>
          <p>Nor always with feigned love does the woman sigh, <lb/>
            When with her own uniting the man's body <lb/>
            She holds him clasped, with moistened kisses sucking <lb/>
            His lips into her lips. Nay, from the heart <lb/>
            She often does it, and seeking mutual joys <lb/>
            Woos him to run to the utmost goal of love. <lb/>
            And nowise else could birds, cattle, wild beasts, <lb/>
            And sheep and mares submit to males, except <lb/>
            That their exuberant nature is in heat, <lb/>
            And burning draws towards them joyously <lb/>
            The lust of the covering mates. See you not also <lb/>
            That those whom mutual pleasure has enchained <lb/>
            Are often tormented in their common chains ? <lb/>
            How often on the highroads dogs desiring <note type="footnote"> 53 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            To separate, will strain in opposite ways <lb/>
            Eagerly with all their might, yet the whole time <lb/>
            They are held fast in the strong bonds of Venus ! <lb/>
            Thus they would never act, unless they had <lb/>
            Experience of mutual joys, enough <lb/>
            To thrust them into the snare and hold them bound. <lb/>
            Therefore I assert, the pleasure must be common.</p>
          <p>Often when, mingling her seed with the man's, <lb/>
            The woman with sudden force has overwhelmed <lb/>
            And mastered the man's force, then children are <lb/>
            borne <lb/>
            Like to the mother from the mother's seed, <lb/>
            As from the father's seed like to the father. <lb/>
            But those whom you see sharing the form of both, <lb/>
            Mingling their parents' features side by side, <lb/>
            Grow from the father's body and mother's blood, <lb/>
            When mutual ardour has conspired to fling <lb/>
            The seeds together, roused by the goads of Venus <lb/>
            Throughout the frame, and neither of the two <lb/>
            Has gained the mastery nor yet been mastered. <lb/>
            Moreover sometimes children may be born <lb/>
            Like their grandparents, and will often recall <lb/>
            The forms of their remoter ancestors, <lb/>
            Because the parents often hold concealed <lb/>
            Within their bodies many primal atoms <lb/>
            Mingled in many ways, which, handed down <lb/>
            From the first stock, father transmits to father. <lb/>
            And out of these Venus produces forms <lb/>
            With ever-varying chances, and recalls <lb/>
            The look and voice and hair of ancestors : <lb/>
            Since truly these things are no more derived <lb/>
            From a determined seed, than are our faces <lb/>
            Bodies and limbs. Also the female sex <lb/>
            May spring from a father's seed, and males come <lb/>
            forth <lb/>
            Formed from a mother's body : for the birth <note type="footnote"> 54 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            Is always fashioned out of the two seeds. <lb/>
            Whichever of the two that which is born <lb/>
            Is most like, of that parent it will have <lb/>
            More than an equal share ; as you may observe, <lb/>
            Whether it be a male or female offspring.</p>
          <p>Nor do divine powers thwart in any man <lb/>
            A fruitful sowing, so that he may never <lb/>
            Receive from sweet children the name of father, <lb/>
            But in sterile wedlock must live out his days ; <lb/>
            As men in general fancy, and so sprinkle <lb/>
            The altars sorrowfully with much blood, <lb/>
            And heap the shrine-tables with offerings, <lb/>
            To make their wives pregnant with copious seed. <lb/>
            But vainly they importune the divinity <lb/>
            And sortilege of the gods. For they are sterile <lb/>
            Sometimes from too great thickness of the seed, <lb/>
            Or else it is unduly thin and fluid. <lb/>
            Because the thin cannot adhere and cleave <lb/>
            To the right spots, it forthwith flows away <lb/>
            Defeated, and departs abortively. <lb/>
            Others again discharge a seed too thick, <lb/>
            More solid than is suitable, which either <lb/>
            Does not shoot forth with so far-flung a stroke, <lb/>
            Or cannot so well penetrate where it should, <lb/>
            Or having penetrated, does not easily <lb/>
            Mix with the woman's seed. For harmonies <lb/>
            Seem to be most important in lovers rites. <lb/>
            And some men will more readily fertilise <lb/>
            Some women, and other women will conceive <lb/>
            More readily and grow pregnant from other men. <lb/>
            And many women, sterile hitherto <lb/>
            In several marriages, have yet at last <lb/>
            Found mates from whom they could conceive <lb/>
            children, <lb/>
            And so become enriched with a sweet offspring. <lb/>
            And even for those to whom their household ,'Vives, <note type="footnote"> 55 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            However fruitful, had failed so far to bear, <lb/>
            A well-matched nature has been often found <lb/>
            That they might fortify their age with children. <lb/>
            So important is it, if seeds are to agree <lb/>
            And blend with seeds for purposes of birth, <lb/>
            Whether the thick encounters with the fluid, <lb/>
            And the fluid with the thick. Also herein <lb/>
            It is of moment on what diet life <lb/>
            Is nourished ; for the seed within the limbs <lb/>
            By some foods is made solid, and by others <lb/>
            Is thinned and dwindled. Also in what modes <lb/>
            Lovers bland delight is dealt with, that likewise <lb/>
            Is of the highest moment. [Tor in general <lb/>
            Women are thought more readily to conceive <lb/>
            After the manner of wild beasts and quadrupeds, <lb/>
            Since so the seeds can find the proper spots, <lb/>
            The breasts being bent downward, the loins raised. <lb/>
            Nor have wives the least need of wanton movements. <lb/>
            For a woman thwarts conception and frustrates it, <lb/>
            If with her loins she joyously lures on <lb/>
            The man's love, and, with her whole bosom relaxed <lb/>
            And limp, provokes lust's tide to overflow. <lb/>
            For then she thrusts the furrow from the share's <lb/>
            Direct path, turning the seed's stroke aside <lb/>
            From its right goal. And thus for their own ends <lb/>
            Harlots are wont to move, because they wish „ v <lb/>
            Not to conceive nor lie in childbed often, f <lb/>
            Likewise that Venus may give men more pleasure <lb/>
            But of this surely our wives should have no need.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, by no divine interposition <lb/>
            Nor through the shafts of Venus, a plain woman, <lb/>
            Though of inferior beauty, may be loved. <lb/>
            For sometimes she herself by her behaviour, <lb/>
            Her gentle ways and personal daintiness <lb/>
            Will easily accustom you to spend <lb/>
            Your whole life with her. And indeed 'tis custom <note type="footnote"> 56 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            That harmonises love. For what is struck <lb/>
            However lightly by repeated blows, <lb/>
            Yet after a long lapse of time is conquered <lb/>
            And must dissolve. Do you not likewise see <lb/>
            That drops of water falling upon stones <lb/>
            After long lapse of time will pierce them through ? <note type="footnote"> 57 </note></p><pb n="58"/>

          <p>WHO is there that by energy of mind <lb/>
            Could build a poem worthy of our theme's <lb/>
            Majesty and of these discoveries ? <lb/>
            Or who has such a mastery of words <lb/>
            As to devise praises proportionate <lb/>
            To his deserts, who to us has bequeathed <lb/>
            Such prizes, earned by his own intellect ? <lb/>
            No man, I think, formed of a mortal body. <lb/>
            For if we are to speak as the acknowledged <lb/>
            Majesty of our theme demands, a god <lb/>
            Was he, most noble Memmius, a god, <lb/>
            Who first found out that discipline of life <lb/>
            Which now is called philosophy, and whose skill <lb/>
            From such great billows and a gloom so dark <lb/>
            Delivered life, and steered it into a calm <lb/>
            So peaceful and beneath so bright a light. <lb/>
            For compare the divine discoveries <lb/>
            Of others in old times. 'Tis told that Ceres <lb/>
            First revealed corn to men, Liber the juice <lb/>
            Of grape-born wine ; though life without these things <lb/>
            Might well have been sustained ; and even now <lb/>
            'Tis said there are some people that live so. <lb/>
            But to live happily was not possible <lb/>
            Without a serene mind. Therefore more justly <lb/>
            Is this man deemed by us a god, from whom <lb/>
            Came those sweet solaces of life, which now <lb/>
            Already through great nations spread abroad <lb/>
            Have power to soothe men's minds. Should you suppose <lb/>
            Moreover that the deeds of Hercules <lb/>
            Surpass his, then yet further will you drift <lb/>
            Out of true reason's course. For what harm now <note type="footnote"> 58 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            Would those great gaping jaws of Nemea's lion <lb/>
            Do to us, and the bristly Arcadian boar ? <lb/>
            What could the bull of Crete, or Lerna's pest <lb/>
            The Hydra fenced around with venomous snakes, <lb/>
            And threefold Gerion's triple-breasted might, <lb/>
            Or those brazen-plumed birds inhabiting <lb/>
            Stymphalian swamps, what injury so great <lb/>
            Could they inflict upon us, or the steeds <lb/>
            Of Thracian Diomede, with fire-breathing nostrils <lb/>
            Ranging Bistonia's wilds and Ismarus ? <lb/>
            Also the serpent, guardian of the bright <lb/>
            Gold-gleaming apples of the Hesperides, <lb/>
            Fierce and grim-glancing, with huge body coiled <lb/>
            Round the tree's stem, how were it possible <lb/>
            He could molest us by the Atlantic shore <lb/>
            And those lone seas, where none of us sets foot, <lb/>
            And no barbarian ventures to draw near ? <lb/>
            And all those other monsters which likewise <lb/>
            Have been destroyed, if they had not been vanquished, <lb/>
            What harm, pray, could they do, though now alive ? <lb/>
            None, I presume : for the earth even now abounds <lb/>
            With wild beasts to repletion, and is filled <lb/>
            With shuddering terror throughout its woods, great <lb/>
            mountains <lb/>
            And deep forests, regions which we have power <lb/>
            For the most part to avoid. But if the heart <lb/>
            Has not been purged, what tumults then, what dangers <lb/>
            Must needs invade us in our own despite ! <lb/>
            What fierce anxieties, offspring of desire, <lb/>
            Rend the distracted man, what mastering fears ! <lb/>
            Pride also, sordid avarice, and violence, <lb/>
            Of what calamities are not they the cause ! <lb/>
            Luxury too, and slothfulness ! He therefore <lb/>
            Who could subdue all these, and banish them <lb/>
            Out of our minds by force of words, not arms, <lb/>
            Is it not right we should deem such a man <lb/>
            Worthy to be numbered among the gods ? <note type="footnote"> 59 </note><lb/>

            The more that he was wont in beautiful <lb/>
            And godlike speech to utter many truths <lb/>
            About the immortal gods themselves, and set <lb/>
            The whole nature of things in clear words forth.</p>
          <p>I, in his footsteps treading, follow out <lb/>
            His reasonings and expound in my discourse <lb/>
            By what law all things are created, how <lb/>
            They are compelled to abide within that law, <lb/>
            Without power to annul the immutable <lb/>
            Decrees of time ; and first above all else <lb/>
            The mind's nature was found to be composed <lb/>
            Of a body that had birth, without the power <lb/>
            To endure through a long period unscathed : <lb/>
            For it was found to be mere images <lb/>
            That are wont to deceive the mind in sleep, <lb/>
            Whenever we appear to behold one <lb/>
            Whom life has abandoned. Now, for what remains, <lb/>
            The order of my argument has brought me <lb/>
            To the point where I must show both how the world <lb/>
            Is composed of a body which must die, <lb/>
            Also that it was born ; and in what way <lb/>
            Matter once congregating and uniting <lb/>
            Established earth sky sea, the stars, the sun, <lb/>
            And the moon's globe : also what living creatures <lb/>
            Rose from the earth, and which were those that never <lb/>
            At any time were born : next in what way <lb/>
            Mankind began to employ varied speech <lb/>
            One with another by giving names to things : <lb/>
            Then for what causes that fear of the gods <lb/>
            Entered their breasts, and now through the whole world <lb/>
            Gives sanctity to shrines, lakes and groves, <lb/>
            Altars and images of gods. Moreover <lb/>
            I will make plain by what force and control <lb/>
            Nature pilots the courses of the sun <lb/>
            And the wanderings of the moon, lest we perchance <lb/>
            Deem that they traverse of their own free will <note type="footnote"> 60 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            Their yearly orbits between heaven and earth, <lb/>
            Obsequiously furthering the increase <lb/>
            Of crops and living things, or should suppose <lb/>
            That they roll onwards by the gods' design. <lb/>
            For those who have learnt rightly that the gods <lb/>
            Lead a life free from care, if yet they wonder <lb/>
            By what means all things can be carried on, <lb/>
            Such above all as are perceived to happen <lb/>
            In the ethereal regions overhead, <lb/>
            They are borne back again into their old <lb/>
            Religious fears, and adopt pitiless lords, <lb/>
            Whom in their misery they believe to be <lb/>
            Almighty ; for they are ignorant of what can <lb/>
            And what cannot exist ; in fine they know not <lb/>
            Upon what principle each thing has its powers <lb/>
            Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone.</p>
          <p>But now, lest I detain you with more promises, <lb/>
            In the first place consider, Memmius, <lb/>
            The seas, the land, the sky, whose threefold nature, <lb/>
            Three bodies, three forms so dissimilar, <lb/>
            And three such wondrous textures, a single day <lb/>
            Shall give to destruction, and the world's vast mass <lb/>
            And fabric, for so many years upheld, <lb/>
            Shall fall to ruin. Nor am I unaware <lb/>
            How novel and strange, when first it strikes the mind, <lb/>
            Must appear this destruction of earth and heaven <lb/>
            That is to be, and for myself how difficult <lb/>
            It will prove to convince you by mere words, <lb/>
            As happens when one brings to a man's ears <lb/>
            Some notion unfamiliar hitherto, <lb/>
            If yet one cannot thrust it visibly <lb/>
            Beneath his eyes, or place it in his hands ; <lb/>
            For the paved highway of belief through touch <lb/>
            And sight leads straightest into the human heart <lb/>
            And the precincts of the mind. Yet none the less <lb/>
            I will speak out. Reality itself <note type="footnote"> 61 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            It may be will bring credence to my words, <lb/>
            And in a little while you will behold <lb/>
            The earth terribly quaking, and all things <lb/>
            Shattered to ruins. But may pilot fortune <lb/>
            Steer far from us such disaster, and may reason <lb/>
            Convince us rather than reality <lb/>
            That the whole universe may well collapse, <lb/>
            Tumbling together with a dread crash and roar.</p>
          <p>But before I attempt concerning this <lb/>
            To announce fate's oracles in more holy wise, <lb/>
            And with assurance far more rational <lb/>
            Than doth the Pythoness, when from the tripod <lb/>
            And laurel wreath of Phoebus her voice sounds, <lb/>
            Many consolatories will I first <lb/>
            Expound to you in learned words, lest haply <lb/>
            Curbed by religion's bit you should suppose <lb/>
            That earth and sun and sky, sea, stars and moon, <lb/>
            Their substance being divine, must needs abide <lb/>
            Eternally, and should therefore think it just <lb/>
            That all, after the manner of the giants, <lb/>
            Should suffer penance for their monstrous guilt <lb/>
            Who by their reasoning shake the world's firm walls, <lb/>
            And fain would quench the glorious sun in heaven, <lb/>
            Shaming with mortal speech immortal things ; <lb/>
            Though in fact such objects are so far removed <lb/>
            From any share in divine energy, <lb/>
            And so unworthy to be accounted gods, <lb/>
            That they may be considered with more reason <lb/>
            To afford us the conception of what is quite <lb/>
            Devoid of vital motion and of sense. <lb/>
            For truly by no means can we suppose <lb/>
            That the nature and judgment of the mind <lb/>
            Can exist linked with every kind of body, <lb/>
            Even as in the sky trees cannot exist, <lb/>
            Nor clouds in the salt waters, nor can fish <lb/>
            Live in the fields, neither can blood be found <note type="footnote"> 62 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            In wood, nor sap in stones : but where each thing <lb/>
            Can dwell and grow, is determined and ordained. <lb/>
            Even so the nature of mind cannot be born <lb/>
            Alone without a body, nor exist <lb/>
            Separated from sinews and from blood. <lb/>
            But if (for this is likelier by far) <lb/>
            The mind's force might reside within the head <lb/>
            Or shoulders, or be born down in the heels, <lb/>
            Or in any part you will, it would at least <lb/>
            Inhabit the same man and the same vessel. <lb/>
            But since even in our body it is seen <lb/>
            To be determined and ordained where soul <lb/>
            And mind can separately dwell and grow, <lb/>
            All the more must it be denied that mind <lb/>
            Cannot have being quite outside a body <lb/>
            And a living form, in crumbling clods of earth, <lb/>
            In the sun's fire, or water, or aloft <lb/>
            In the domains of ether. Such things therefore <lb/>
            Are not endowed with divine consciousness, <lb/>
            Because they cannot be quickened into life.</p>
          <p>This too you cannot possibly believe, <lb/>
            That there are holy abodes of deities <lb/>
            Anywhere in the world. For so tenuous <lb/>
            Is the nature of gods, and from our senses <lb/>
            So far withdrawn, that hardly can the mind <lb/>
            Imagine it. And seeing that hitherto <lb/>
            It has eluded touch or blow of hands, <lb/>
            It must touch nothing which for us is tangible : <lb/>
            For naught can touch that may not itself be touched. <lb/>
            So even their abodes must be unlike <lb/>
            Our own, tenuous as their bodies are. <lb/>
            All this hereafter I will prove to you <lb/>
            By plentiful argument. Further, to say <lb/>
            That for the sake of mankind the gods willed <lb/>
            To frame the wondrous nature of the world, <lb/>
            And that on this account we ought to extol <note type="footnote"> 63 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            Their handiwork as worthy of all praise, <lb/>
            And to believe that it will prove eternal <lb/>
            And indestructible, and to think it sin <lb/>
            Ever by any effort to disturb <lb/>
            What by the ancient wisdom of the gods <lb/>
            Has been established everlastingly <lb/>
            For mankind's benefit, or by argument <lb/>
            To assail and overthrow it utterly <lb/>
            From top to bottom, and to invent besides <lb/>
            Other such errors-all this, Memmius, <lb/>
            Is folly. For what advantage could our thanks <lb/>
            Bestow upon immortal and blessed beings <lb/>
            That for our sakes they should bestir themselves <lb/>
            To perform any task ? Or what new fact <lb/>
            Could have induced them, tranquil hitherto, <lb/>
            After so long to change their former life ? <lb/>
            For it seems fitting he should take delight <lb/>
            In a new state of things, to whom the old <lb/>
            Was painful : but for him whom in past times, <lb/>
            While he was living in felicity, <lb/>
            No evil had befallen, for such a one <lb/>
            What could have kindled a desire for change ? <lb/>
            Must we imagine that their life lay prostrate <lb/>
            In darkness and in misery, till the birth <lb/>
            And origin of things first dawned upon them ? <lb/>
            Besides, what evil had it been to us <lb/>
            Not to have been created ? For whoever <lb/>
            Has once been born, must wish to abide in life <lb/>
            So long as luring pleasure bids him stay : <lb/>
            But one who has never tasted the love of life, <lb/>
            Nor even been numbered in life's ranks, what harm <lb/>
            Were it for him not to have been created ? <lb/>
            Again whence first was implanted in the gods <lb/>
            A pattern for begetting things ? Whence too <lb/>
            The preconception of what men should be, <lb/>
            So that they knew and imaged in their minds <lb/>
            What they desired to make ? And by what means <note type="footnote"> 64 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            Could they have ever ascertained the energy <lb/>
            Latent in primal atoms, or what forms <lb/>
            Might be produced by changes in their order, <lb/>
            Unless Nature herself had given them first <lb/>
            A sample of creation ? For indeed <lb/>
            These primal atoms in such multitudes <lb/>
            And in so many ways, through infinite time <lb/>
            Impelled by blows and moved by their own weight, <lb/>
            Have been borne onward so incessantly, <lb/>
            Uniting in every way and making trial <lb/>
            Of every shape they could combine to form, <lb/>
            That 'tis not strange if they have also fallen <lb/>
            Into such grouping, and acquired such motions <lb/>
            As those whereby the present sum of things <lb/>
            Is carried on and ceaselessly renewed.</p>
          <p>But even were I ignorant how things <lb/>
            Were formed of primal elements, yet this <lb/>
            Would I have ventured to affirm, and prove <lb/>
            Not only from the system of the heavens, <lb/>
            But from much other evidence, that nature <lb/>
            Has by no means been fashioned for our benefit <lb/>
            By divine power ; so great are the defects <lb/>
            Which are its bane. First, of the whole space <lb/>
            Covered by the enormous reach of heaven, <lb/>
            A greedy portion mountains occupy <lb/>
            And forests of wild beasts ; rocks and waste swamps <lb/>
            Possess it, or the wide land-sundering sea. <lb/>
            Besides, well nigh two-thirds are stolen from men <lb/>
            By burning heat and frost ceaselessly falling. <lb/>
            All that is left for husbandry, even that <lb/>
            The force of Nature soon would overspread <lb/>
            With thorns, unless resisted by man's force, <lb/>
            Ever wont for his livelihood to groan <lb/>
            Over the strong hoe, and with down-pressed plough <lb/>
            To cleave the earth. For if we do not turn <lb/>
            The fertile clods with coulters, and subduing <note type="footnote"> 65 </note><note type="footnote"> 5 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            The soil of earth, summon the crops to birth, <lb/>
            They could not of their own accord spring up <lb/>
            Into the bright air. Even then sometimes, <lb/>
            When answering our long toil throughout the land <lb/>
            Every bud puts forth its leaves and flowers, <lb/>
            Either the sun in heaven scorches them <lb/>
            With too much heat, or sudden gusts of rain <lb/>
            Or nipping frosts destroy them, or wind-storms <lb/>
            Shatter them with impetuous whirling blasts. <lb/>
            Furthermore why does Nature multiply <lb/>
            And nourish terrible tribes of savage beasts <lb/>
            By land and sea, dangerous to mankind ? <lb/>
            Why does untimely death range to and fro ? <lb/>
            Then again, like a mariner cast ashore <lb/>
            By raging waves, the human infant lies <lb/>
            Naked upon the ground, speechless, in want <lb/>
            Of every help needful for life, when first <lb/>
            Nature by birth-throes from his mothers womb <lb/>
            Thrusts him into the borders of the light, <lb/>
            So that he fills the room with piteous wailing, <lb/>
            As well he may, whose fate in life will be <lb/>
            To pass through so much misery. But flocks <lb/>
            And herds of divers kind, and the wild beasts, <lb/>
            These, as they grow up, have no need of rattles : <lb/>
            To none of them a foster-nurse must utter <lb/>
            Fond broken speech : they seek not different dresses <lb/>
            To suit each season : no, nor do they need <lb/>
            Weapons nor lofty walls whereby to guard <lb/>
            What is their own, since all things for them all <lb/>
            The Earth herself brings forth abundantly, <lb/>
            And Nature, the creatress manifold.</p>
          <p>First of all, since the substance of the earth, <lb/>
            Moisture, and the light breathings of the air, <lb/>
            And burning heats, of which this sum of things <lb/>
            Is seen to be composed, have all been formed <lb/>
            Of a body that was born and that will die, <note type="footnote"> 66 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            Of such a body must we likewise deem <lb/>
            That the whole nature of the world was made. <lb/>
            For things whose parts and members we see-formed <lb/>
            Of a body that had birth and shapes that die, <lb/>
            These we perceive are themselves always mortal, <lb/>
            And likewise have been born. Since then we see <lb/>
            That the chief parts and members of the world <lb/>
            Decay and are reborn, it is no less certain <lb/>
            That once for heaven and earth there was a time <lb/>
            Of origin, and will be of destruction.</p>
          <p>Herein lest you should think that without proof <lb/>
            I have seized this vantage, in that I have assumed <lb/>
            Earth and fire to be mortal, and have not doubted <lb/>
            That moisture and air perish, but maintained <lb/>
            That these too are reborn and grow afresh, <lb/>
            Consider first how no small part of the earth <lb/>
            Ceaselessly baked by the sun's rays and trampled <lb/>
            By innumerable feet, gives off a mist <lb/>
            And flying clouds of dust, which the strong winds <lb/>
            Disperse through the whole atmosphere. Part too <lb/>
            Of the earth's soil is turned to swamp by rains, <lb/>
            While scouring rivers gnaw their banks away. <lb/>
            Furthermore whatsoever goes to augment <lb/>
            Some other thing, is in its turn restored ; <lb/>
            And since beyond all doubt the all-mother Earth <lb/>
            Is seen to be no less the general tomb, <lb/>
            You thus may see how she is ever lessened, <lb/>
            Yet with new growth increases evermore.</p>
          <p>Next, that the sea, the rivers and the springs <lb/>
            Are always amply fed by new supplies <lb/>
            Of moisture oozing up perennially, <lb/>
            It needs no words to explain. The vast down-flow <lb/>
            Of waters from all sides is proof of this. <lb/>
            But as the water that is uppermost <lb/>
            Is always taken away, it comes to pass <note type="footnote"> 67 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            That on the whole there is no overflow; <lb/>
            Partly because strong winds, sweeping the seas, <lb/>
            Diminish them, and the sun in heaven unweaves <lb/>
            Their fabric with his rays ; partly because <lb/>
            The water is distributed below <lb/>
            Throughout all lands. For the salt is strained off, <lb/>
            And the pure fluid matter, oozing back, <lb/>
            Gathers together at the river-heads, <lb/>
            Thence in fresh current streams over the land, <lb/>
            Wherever it finds a channel ready scooped <lb/>
            To carry down its waves with liquid foot.</p>
          <p>Now must I speak of air, which every hour <lb/>
            Is changed through its whole body in countless ways. <lb/>
            For always whatsoever flows from things <lb/>
            Is all borne into the vast sea of air : <lb/>
            And if it were not in its turn to give <lb/>
            Particles back to things, recruiting them <lb/>
            As they dissolve, all would have been long since <lb/>
            Disintegrated, and so changed to air. <lb/>
            Therefore it never ceases to be born <lb/>
            Out of things, and to pass back into things, <lb/>
            Since, as we know, all are in constant flux.</p>
          <p>Likewise that bounteous fountain of clear light, <lb/>
            The sun in heaven, ceaselessly floods the sky <lb/>
            With fresh brightness, and momently supplies <lb/>
            The place of light with new light : for each former <lb/>
            Emission of his radiance perishes, <lb/>
            On whatsoever spot it falls. This truth <lb/>
            You may thus learn. So soon as clouds begin <lb/>
            To pass below the sun, and as it were <lb/>
            To break off the light's rays, their lower part <lb/>
            Forthwith perishes wholly, and the earth <lb/>
            Is shadow-swept, wherever the clouds move. <lb/>
            Thus you may know that things have ever need <lb/>
            Of fresh illumination, and that each <note type="footnote"> 68 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            Former discharge of radiance perishes, <lb/>
            Nor in any other way could things be seen <lb/>
            In sunlight, if the fountain-head itself <lb/>
            Did not send forth a perpetual supply. <lb/>
            Also those lights we use here upon earth <lb/>
            At night-time, hanging lamps, and torches bright <lb/>
            With darting beams, rich with abundant smoke, <lb/>
            Are in haste in like fashion to supply <lb/>
            New radiance with ministering fire ; <lb/>
            The very flames seem eager, eager to flicker ; c <lb/>
            Nor does the still unbroken stream of light <lb/>
            One instant quit the spots whereon it played, <lb/>
            So suddenly is its perishing concealed <lb/>
            By the swift birth of flame from all these fires. <lb/>
            It is thus then you must think sun moon and stars <lb/>
            Shoot forth their light from ever fresh supplies, <lb/>
            And that they always lose whatever beams <lb/>
            Come foremost; lest perchance you should believe <lb/>
            Their energy to be indestructible.</p>
          <p>Again, is it not seen that even stones <lb/>
            By time are vanquished, that tall towers fall <lb/>
            And rocks crumble away, that shrines and idols <lb/>
            Of gods grow worn out and dilapidate, <lb/>
            Nor may the indwelling holiness prolong <lb/>
            The bounds of destiny, or strive against <lb/>
            The laws of Nature ? Then do we not see <lb/>
            The monuments of men, fallen to ruin, <lb/>
            Ask for themselves whether you would believe <lb/>
            That they also grow old ? 1 See we not rocks <lb/>
            Split off from mountain heights fall crashing down <lb/>
            Unable more to endure the powerful stress <lb/>
            Of finite years ? Surely they would not fall <lb/>
            Thus suddenly split off, if through the lapse <lb/>
            Of infinite past years they had withstood <lb/>
            All the assaults of time, without being shattered. <note type="footnote">1 The text is corrupt and the meaning obscure. </note><note type="footnote"> 69 </note> <lb/>

            Now contemplate that which around and above <lb/>
            Compasses the whole earth with its embrace. <lb/>
            If it begets all things out of itself, <lb/>
            As some have told us, and receives them back <lb/>
            When they have perished, then the whole sky is made <lb/>
            Of a body that had birth and that must die. <lb/>
            For whatsoever nourishes and augments <lb/>
            Other things from itself, must needs be minished, <lb/>
            And be replenished, when it receives them back.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if there never was a time <lb/>
            Of origin when earth and heaven were born, <lb/>
            If they have always been from everlasting, <lb/>
            Why then before the Theban war and Troy's <lb/>
            Destruction, have not other poets sung <lb/>
            Of other deeds as well ? Whither have vanished <lb/>
            So many exploits of so many men ? <lb/>
            Why are they nowhere blossoming engrafted <lb/>
            On the eternal monuments of fame ? <lb/>
            But in truth, as I think, this sum of things <lb/>
            Is in its youth : the nature of the world <lb/>
            Is recent, and began not long ago. <lb/>
            Wherefore even now some arts are being wrought <lb/>
            To their last polish, some are still in growth. <lb/>
            Of late many improvements have been made <lb/>
            In navigation, and musicians too <lb/>
            Have given birth to new melodious sounds. <lb/>
            Also this theory of the nature of things <lb/>
            Has been discovered lately, and I myself <lb/>
            Have only now been found the very first <lb/>
            Able to turn it into our native words. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, if you perchance believe <lb/>
            That long ago these things were just the same, <lb/>
            But that the generations of mankind <lb/>
            Perished by scorching heat, or that their cities <lb/>
            Fell in some great convulsion of the world, <lb/>
            Or else that flooded by incessant rains <note type="footnote"> 70 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            Devouring rivers broke forth over the earth <lb/>
            And swallowed up whole towns, so much the more <lb/>
            Must you admit that there will come to pass <lb/>
            A like destruction of earth and heaven too. <lb/>
            For when things were assailed by such great maladies <lb/>
            And dangers, if some yet more fatal cause <lb/>
            Had whelmed them, they would then have been dissolved <lb/>
            In havoc and vast ruin far and wide. <lb/>
            And in no other way do we perceive <lb/>
            That we are mortal, save that we all alike <lb/>
            In turn fall sick of the same maladies <lb/>
            As those whom Nature has withdrawn from life.</p>
          <p>Again, whatever things abide eternally, <lb/>
            Must either, because they are of solid body, <lb/>
            Repulse assaults, nor suffer anything <lb/>
            To penetrate them, which might have the power <lb/>
            To disunite the close-locked parts within : <lb/>
            (Such are those bodies whereof matter is made, <lb/>
            Whose nature we have shown before:) or else <lb/>
            They must be able to endure throughout <lb/>
            All time, because they are exempt from blows, <lb/>
            As void is, which abides untouched, nor suffers <lb/>
            One whit from any stroke : or else because <lb/>
            There is no further space surrounding them, <lb/>
            Into which things might as it were depart <lb/>
            And be dissolved ; even as the sum of sums <lb/>
            Is eternal, nor is there any space <lb/>
            Outside it, into which its particles <lb/>
            Might spring asunder, nor are there other bodies <lb/>
            That could strike and dissolve them with strong blows. <lb/>
            But neither, as I have shown, is this world's nature <lb/>
            Solid, since there is void mixed up in things ; <lb/>
            Nor yet is it like void ; nor verily <lb/>
            Are atoms lacking that might well collect <lb/>
            Out of the infinite, and overwhelm <lb/>
            This sum of things with violent hurricane, <note type="footnote"> 71 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            Or threaten it with some other form of ruin ; <lb/>
            Nor further is there any want of room <lb/>
            And of deep space, into which the world's walls <lb/>
            Might be dispersed abroad ; or they may perish <lb/>
            Shattered by any other force you will. <lb/>
            Therefore the gates of death are never closed <lb/>
            Against sky, sun or earth, or the deep seas ; <lb/>
            But they stand open, awaiting them with huge <lb/>
            Vast-gaping jaws. So you must needs admit <lb/>
            That all these likewise once were born : for things <lb/>
            Of mortal body could not until now <lb/>
            Through infinite past ages have defied <lb/>
            The strong powers of immeasurable time.</p>
          <p>Again, since the chief members of the world <lb/>
            So mightily contend together, stirred <lb/>
            By unhallowed civil warfare, see you not <lb/>
            That some end may be set to their long strife ? <lb/>
            It may be when the sun and every kind <lb/>
            Of heat shall have drunk all the moisture up, <lb/>
            And gained the mastery they were struggling for, <lb/>
            Though they have failed as yet to achieve their aim : <lb/>
            So vast are the supplies the rivers bring, <lb/>
            Threatening in turn to deluge every land <lb/>
            From out the deep abysses of the ocean ; <lb/>
            All in vain, since the winds, sweeping the seas, <lb/>
            Diminish them, and the sun in heaven unweaves <lb/>
            Their fabric with his rays ; and 'tis their boast <lb/>
            That they are able to dry all things up, <lb/>
            Before moisture can achieve its end. <lb/>
            So terrible a war do they breathe out <lb/>
            On equal terms, striving one with another <lb/>
            For mighty issues : though indeed fire once <lb/>
            Obtained the mastery, so the fable tells, <lb/>
            And water once reigned supreme in the fields. <lb/>
            For fire prevailing licked up and consumed <lb/>
            Many things, when the ungovernable might <note type="footnote"> 72 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            Of the Sun's horses, swerving from their course, <lb/>
            Through the whole sky and over every land <lb/>
            Whirled Phaëthon. But then the almighty Father, <lb/>
            Stirred to fierce wrath, with sudden thunder-stroke <lb/>
            Dashed great-souled Phaethon from his team to the earth, <lb/>
            And as he fell the Sun-god meeting him <lb/>
            Caught from him the world's everlasting lamp, <lb/>
            And brought back tamed and trembling to the yoke <lb/>
            The scattered steeds ; then on their wonted course <lb/>
            Guiding them, unto all things gave fresh life. <lb/>
            Thus verily the old Greek poets sang, <lb/>
            Though straying from true reason all too far. <lb/>
            For fire can only gain the mastery <lb/>
            When an excess of fiery particles <lb/>
            Have flocked together out of infinite space ; <lb/>
            And then its strength fails, vanquished in some way, <lb/>
            Or else things perish, utterly consumed <lb/>
            By scorching gusts. Likewise moisture once <lb/>
            Gathering together, as the story tells, <lb/>
            Strove for the mastery, when it overwhelmed <lb/>
            Many cities of mankind. But afterwards, <lb/>
            When all that force, which out of infinite space <lb/>
            Had gathered itself up, was by some means <lb/>
            Diverted and withdrew, the rains ceased then, <lb/>
            And the violence of the rivers was abated.</p>
          <p>But in what ways matter converging once <lb/>
            Established earth and heaven and the sea's deeps, <lb/>
            The sun's course and the moon's, I will set forth <lb/>
            In order. For in truth not by design <lb/>
            Did the primordial particles of things <lb/>
            Arrange themselves each in its own right place <lb/>
            With provident mind, nor verily have they bargained <lb/>
            What motions each should follow ; but because <lb/>
            These primal atoms in such multitudes <lb/>
            And in so many ways through infinite time <lb/>
            Impelled by blows and moved by their own weight, <note type="footnote"> 73 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            Have been borne onward so incessantly, <lb/>
            Uniting in every way and making trial <lb/>
            Of every shape they could combine to form, <lb/>
            Therefore it is that after wandering wide <lb/>
            Through vast periods, attempting every kind <lb/>
            Of union and of motion, they at last <lb/>
            Collect into such groups as, suddenly <lb/>
            Flocking together, often times become <lb/>
            The rudiments of mighty things, of earth, <lb/>
            Sea and sky, and the race of living creatures.</p>
          <p>At that time neither could the disk of the sun <lb/>
            Be seen flying aloft with bounteous light, <lb/>
            Nor the stars of great heaven, nor sea, nor sky, <lb/>
            Nor yet earth nor the air, nor anything <lb/>
            Resembling those things which we now behold, <lb/>
            But only a sort of strange tempest, a mass <lb/>
            Gathered together out of primal atoms <lb/>
            Of all kinds, which discordantly waged war <lb/>
            Disordering so their interspaces, paths, <lb/>
            Connections, weights, collisions, meetings, motions, <lb/>
            Since with their unlike forms and varied shapes, <lb/>
            They could not therefore all remain united, <lb/>
            Nor move among themselves harmoniously. <lb/>
            Thereupon parts began to fly asunder, <lb/>
            And like things to unite with like, and so <lb/>
            To separate off the world, and to divide <lb/>
            Its members, portioning out its mighty parts ; <lb/>
            That is, to mark off the high heaven from earth, <lb/>
            And the sea by itself, that it might spread <lb/>
            With unmixed waters, and likewise the fires <lb/>
            Of aether by themselves, pure and unmixed.</p>
          <p>Now first the several particles of earth, <lb/>
            Since they were heavy and close-packed, all met <lb/>
            Together in the middle, and took up <lb/>
            The lowest places : and the more they met <note type="footnote"> 74 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            In close-packed throngs, the more did they squeeze out <lb/>
            Those particles which were to form sea, stars, <lb/>
            Sun and moon, and the walls of the great world. <lb/>
            For all these are of smoother rounder seeds, <lb/>
            And of much smaller elements than earth. <lb/>
            So first through porous openings in the soil <lb/>
            The fire-laden aether here and there <lb/>
            Bursting forth rose and lightly carried off <lb/>
            Many fires with it, much in the same way <lb/>
            As often we may see when first the beams <lb/>
            Of the radiant sun with golden morning light <lb/>
            Blush through the grasses gemmed with dew, and lakes <lb/>
            And ever-flowing rivers exhale mist, <lb/>
            While earth itself is sometimes seen to smoke ; <lb/>
            And when floating aloft these vapours all <lb/>
            Unite on high, then taking bodily shape <lb/>
            As clouds, they weave a veil beneath the heavens. <lb/>
            Thus then the light diffusive aether once <lb/>
            Took bodily shape, and, arched round on all sides, <lb/>
            Far into every quarter spreading out, <lb/>
            So with its greedy embrace hemmed in all else. <lb/>
            Next came the rudiments of sun and moon, <lb/>
            Whose globes turn in the air midway between <lb/>
            Aether and earth ; for neither did the earth <lb/>
            Nor the great aether claim them for itself, <lb/>
            Since they were not so heavy as to sink <lb/>
            And settle down, nor so light as to glide <lb/>
            Along the topmost borders : yet their course <lb/>
            Between the two is such, that as they roll <lb/>
            Their lifelike bodies onward, they are still <lb/>
            Parts of the whole world ; even as with us <lb/>
            Some of our members may remain at rest, <lb/>
            While at the same time others may be in motion. <lb/>
            So when these things had been withdrawn, the earth, <lb/>
            Where now the ocean's vast blue region spreads, <lb/>
            Sank suddenly down, and flooded with salt surge <lb/>
            Its hollow parts. And day by day the more <note type="footnote"> 75 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            The encircling aether's heats and the sun's rays <lb/>
            Compressed the earth into a closer mass <lb/>
            By constant blows upon its outer surface <lb/>
            From every side, so that thus beaten upon <lb/>
            It shrank and drew together round its centre, <lb/>
            The more did the salt sweat squeezed from its body <lb/>
            Increase by its oozings the sea's floating plains, <lb/>
            And the more did those many particles <lb/>
            Of heat and air escaping fly abroad, <lb/>
            And far away from the earth condensing, form <lb/>
            The lofty glittering mansions of the sky. <lb/>
            The plains sank lower, the high mountains grew <lb/>
            Yet steeper ; for the rocks could not sink down, <lb/>
            Nor could all parts subside to one same level.</p>
          <p>Thus then the earth's ponderous mass was formed <lb/>
            With close-packed body, and all the slime of the world <lb/>
            Slid to the lowest plane by its own weight, <lb/>
            And at the bottom settled down like dregs. <lb/>
            Then the sea, then the air, then the fire-laden <lb/>
            Aether itself, all these were now left pure <lb/>
            With liquid bodies. Some indeed are lighter <lb/>
            Than others, and most liquid and light of all <lb/>
            Over the airy currents aether floats, <lb/>
            Not blending with the turbulent atmosphere <lb/>
            Its liquid substance. All below, it suffers <lb/>
            To be embroiled by violent hurricanes, <lb/>
            Suffers all to be tossed with wayward storms, <lb/>
            While itself gliding on with changeless sweep <lb/>
            Bears its own fires along. For, that the aether <lb/>
            May stream on steadily with one impulse, <lb/>
            The Pontos demonstrates, that sea which streams <lb/>
            With an unchanging tide, unceasingly <lb/>
            Preserving as it glides one constant pace.</p>
          <p>Now let us sing what cause could set the stars <lb/>
            In motion. First, if the great globe of heaven <note type="footnote"> 76 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            Revolves, then we must needs maintain that air <lb/>
            Presses upon the axis at each end, <lb/>
            And holds it from outside, closing it in <lb/>
            At both poles ; also that there streams above <lb/>
            Another current, moving the same way, <lb/>
            In which the stars of the eternal world <lb/>
            Roll glittering onward ; or else that beneath <lb/>
            There is another stream, that drives the sphere <lb/>
            Upwards the opposite way, just as we see <lb/>
            Rivers turn mill-wheels with their water-scoops. <lb/>
            It likewise may well be that the whole sky <lb/>
            Remains at rest, yet that the shining signs <lb/>
            Are carried onwards ; either because within them <lb/>
            Are shut swift tides of aether, that whirl round <lb/>
            Seeking a way out, and so roll their fires <lb/>
            On all sides through the sky's nocturnal mansions ; <lb/>
            Or else that from some other source outside <lb/>
            An air-stream whirls and drives the fires along; <lb/>
            Or else they may be gliding of themselves, <lb/>
            Moving whithersoever the food of each <lb/>
            Calls and invites them, nourishing everywhere <lb/>
            Their flaming bodies throughout the whole sky. <lb/>
            For it is hard to affirm with certainty <lb/>
            Which of these causes operates in this world : <lb/>
            But what throughout the universe both can <lb/>
            And does take place in various worlds, created <lb/>
            On various plans, this I teach, and proceed <lb/>
            To expound what divers causes may exist <lb/>
            Through the universe for the motion of the stars : <lb/>
            And one of these in our world too must be <lb/>
            The cause which to the heavenly signs imparts <lb/>
            Their motive vigour : but dogmatically <lb/>
            To assert which this may be, is in no wise <lb/>
            The function of those advancing step by step.</p>
          <p>Now in order that the earth should be at rest <lb/>
            In the world's midst, it would seem probable <note type="footnote"> 77 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            That its weight gradually diminishing <lb/>
            Should disappear, and that the earth should have <lb/>
            Another nature underneath, conjoined <lb/>
            And blent in union from its earliest age <lb/>
            With those aerial portions of the world <lb/>
            Wherein it lives embodied. For this cause <lb/>
            It is no burden, nor weighs down the air, <lb/>
            Just as to a man his own limbs are no weight, <lb/>
            Nor is the head a burden to the neck, <lb/>
            Nor do we feel that the whole body's weight <lb/>
            Rests on the feet: yet a much smaller burden <lb/>
            Laid on us from outside, will often hurt us. <lb/>
            Of such great moment is it what each thing's <lb/>
            Function may be. Thus then the earth is not <lb/>
            An alien body intruded suddenly, <lb/>
            Nor thrust from elsewhere into an alien air, <lb/>
            But was conceived together with the world <lb/>
            At its first birth as a fixed portion of it, <lb/>
            Just as our limbs are seen to be of us. <lb/>
            Moreover the earth, when shaken suddenly <lb/>
            With violent thunder, by its trembling shakes <lb/>
            All that is over it; which in no wise <lb/>
            Could happen, if it were not closely bound <lb/>
            With the world's airy parts, and with the sky. <lb/>
            For they all, as though by common roots, cohere <lb/>
            One with another, from their earliest age <lb/>
            Conjoined and blent in union. See you not too <lb/>
            That heavy as our body's weight may be, <lb/>
            Yet the soul's force, though subtle exceedingly, <lb/>
            Sustains it, being so closely joined and blent <lb/>
            In union with it ? Also what has power <lb/>
            To lift the body with a nimble leap, <lb/>
            Except the mind's force that controls the limbs ? <lb/>
            Do you not now perceive how great the power <lb/>
            May be of a subtle nature, when 'tis joined <lb/>
            With a heavy body, even as with the earth <lb/>
            The air is joined, and the mind's force with us ? <note type="footnote"> 78 </note><lb/>

            Also the sun's disk cannot be much larger, <lb/>
            Nor its heat be much less, than to our sense <lb/>
            They appear to be. For from whatever distance <lb/>
            Fires can fling light, and breathe upon our limbs <lb/>
            Their warming heat, these intervening spaces <lb/>
            Take away nothing from the body of flame; <lb/>
            The fire is not shrunken visibly. <lb/>
            So since the sun's heat and the light it sheds <lb/>
            Both reach our senses and caress our limbs, <lb/>
            The form also and contour of the sun <lb/>
            Must needs be seen from the earth in their true scale, <lb/>
            With neither addition nor diminishment. <lb/>
            Also the moon, whether it moves along <lb/>
            Illuminating earth with borrowed light, <lb/>
            Or throws out its own rays from its own body, <lb/>
            However that be, moves with a shape no larger <lb/>
            Than seems that shape which our eyes contemplate. <lb/>
            For all things which we look at from far off <lb/>
            Through much air, seem to our vision to grow dim <lb/>
            Before their contours lessen. Therefore the moon, <lb/>
            Seeing that it presents a clear aspect <lb/>
            And definite shape, must needs by us on earth <lb/>
            Be seen on high in its defining outline <lb/>
            Just as it is, and of its actual size. <lb/>
            Lastly consider all those fires of aether <lb/>
            You see from the earth. Since fires, which here below <lb/>
            We observe, for so long as their flickering <lb/>
            Remains distinct, and their heat is perceived, <lb/>
            Are sometimes seen to change their size to less <lb/>
            Or greater to some very slight extent <lb/>
            According to their distance, you may thence <lb/>
            Know that the fires of aether can be smaller <lb/>
            Only by infinitesimal degrees, <lb/>
            Or larger by the tiniest minute fraction.</p>
          <p>This also is not wonderful, how the sun <lb/>
            Small as it is, can ihed so great a light, <note type="footnote"> 79 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            As with its flood to fill all seas and lands <lb/>
            And sky, with warm heat bathing everything. <lb/>
            For from this spot perhaps a single well <lb/>
            For the whole world may open and gush out, <lb/>
            Shooting forth an abundant stream of light, <lb/>
            Because from everywhere throughout the world <lb/>
            In such wise do the particles of heat <lb/>
            Gather together, and their united mass <lb/>
            Converges in such wise, that blazing fire <lb/>
            Streams forth here from a single fountain-head. <lb/>
            See you not too how wide a meadow-land <lb/>
            One little spring of water sometimes floods, <lb/>
            Overflowing whole fields ? It may be also <lb/>
            That from the sun's flame, though it be not great, <lb/>
            Heat pervades the whole air with scorching fires, <lb/>
            Should the air chance to be susceptible <lb/>
            And ready to be kindled, when it is struck <lb/>
            By tiny heat-rays. Then we sometimes see <lb/>
            A wide-spread conflagration from one spark <lb/>
            Catch fields of corn or stubble. Perhaps too <lb/>
            The sun shining on high with ruddy torch <lb/>
            May be surrounded by much fire and heats <lb/>
            Invisible, fire which no radiance <lb/>
            Reveals, but laden with heat it does no more <lb/>
            Than reinforce the stroke of the sun's rays.</p>
          <p>Nor is there any single theory, <lb/>
            Certain and obvious, of how the sun <lb/>
            Out of his summer stations passing forth <lb/>
            Approaches the midwinter turning-point <lb/>
            Of Capricorn, and how coming back thence <lb/>
            He bends his course to the solstitial goal <lb/>
            Of Cancer ; then too how the moon is seen <lb/>
            To traverse every month that space, whereon <lb/>
            The journeying sun spends a year's period. <lb/>
            For these events, I say, no single cause <lb/>
            Can be assigned. It seems most probable <note type="footnote"> 80 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            That the august opinion of Democritus <lb/>
            Should be the truth ; the nearer to the earth <lb/>
            The several constellations move, the less <lb/>
            Can they be borne on with the whirl of heaven : <lb/>
            For in the lower portions of this whirl <lb/>
            He says its speed and energy diminish <lb/>
            And disappear; so that little by little <lb/>
            The sun is outstripped by the signs that follow, <lb/>
            Since he is far beneath the burning stars. <lb/>
            And the moon, so he says, more than the sun. <lb/>
            The lower and the further from the sky <lb/>
            Her course is, and the nearer to the earth, <lb/>
            The less can she keep even with the signs. <lb/>
            For the more languid is the whirl whereby <lb/>
            She is borne along, being lower than the sun, <lb/>
            The more do all the signs around her path <lb/>
            Overtake and pass by her. Thus it is <lb/>
            That she seems to move backward to each sign <lb/>
            More quickly, because the signs come up to her. <lb/>
            It may be also that two streams of air <lb/>
            Cross the sun's path at fixed times, each in turn <lb/>
            Flowing from opposite quarters of the world, <lb/>
            Whereof the first may thrust the sun away <lb/>
            Out of the summer signs, until he comes <lb/>
            To his winter turning-point and the icy frost; <lb/>
            While the other from the freezing shades of cold <lb/>
            Sweeps him right back to the heat-laden regions <lb/>
            And the torrid constellations. And just so <lb/>
            We must suppose that the moon and the planets, <lb/>
            Which roll in their huge orbits through huge years, <lb/>
            May move on streams of air alternately <lb/>
            From opposite quarters. Do you not also see <lb/>
            How clouds are shifted by opposing winds, <lb/>
            The lower in directions contrary <lb/>
            To those above ? Why should not yonder stars <lb/>
            Be likewise carried by opposing currents <lb/>
            Upon their mighty orbits through the sky ? <note type="footnote"> 81 </note><note type="footnote"> 6 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            But night covers the earth with vast darkness <lb/>
            Either when after his long course the sun <lb/>
            Has entered on the uttermost parts of heaven, <lb/>
            And now grown languid has breathed forth his fires, <lb/>
            Exhausted by their journey, and worn out <lb/>
            By traversing much air ; or else because <lb/>
            That same force which has borne his orb along <lb/>
            Above the earth, compels him now to turn <lb/>
            Backward his course and pass beneath the earth.</p>
          <p>Likewise at a fixed time Matuta spreads <lb/>
            The rosy dawn abroad through the sky's borders, <lb/>
            And opens out her light; either because <lb/>
            The same sun, travelling back below the earth, <lb/>
            Seizes the sky beforehand, and is fain <lb/>
            To kindle it with his rays ; or else because <lb/>
            Fires meet together, and many seeds of heat <lb/>
            Are wont at a fixed time to stream together <lb/>
            Causing new sunlight each day to be born. <lb/>
            Even so 'tis told that from the mountain heights <lb/>
            Of Ida at daybreak scattered fires are seen ; <lb/>
            These then unite as if into one globe <lb/>
            And make up the sun's orb. Nor yet herein <lb/>
            Should it cause wonder that these seeds of fire <lb/>
            Can stream together at a time so fixed, <lb/>
            Repairing thus the radiance of the sun. <lb/>
            For everywhere we see many events <lb/>
            Happening at fixed times. Thus trees both flower <lb/>
            And shed their blossoms at fixed times ; and age <lb/>
            At a time no less fixed bids the teeth drop, <lb/>
            And the boy clothe his features with the down <lb/>
            Of puberty, and let a soft beard fall <lb/>
            From either cheek. Lastly lightning and snow, <lb/>
            Rains, clouds and winds happen at more or less <lb/>
            Regular yearly seasons. For where causes <lb/>
            From the beginning have remained the same, <lb/>
            And things from the first origin of the world <note type="footnote"> 82 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            Have so fallen out, they still repeat themselves <lb/>
            In regular sequence after a fixed order.</p>
          <p>The cause too why days lengthen and nights wane, <lb/>
            While daylight shortens as the nights increase, <lb/>
            May either be because the same sun, journeying <lb/>
            Underneath and above the earth in curves <lb/>
            Of unlike length, parts the celestial regions <lb/>
            And into unequal halves divides his orbit: <lb/>
            Whatever he has subtracted from one half, <lb/>
            Just so much does he add, when he comes round, <lb/>
            On to the other half, till he has reached <lb/>
            That sign of heaven where the year's node makes <lb/>
            The night's shade equal to the light of day. <lb/>
            For in the sun's mid course between the blasts <lb/>
            Of south wind and of north, the heaven holds <lb/>
            His turning-points apart at distances <lb/>
            Now equalised, since such is the position <lb/>
            Of the whole starry circle, to glide through which <lb/>
            The sun takes up the period of a year, <lb/>
            Lighting the earth and sky with slanting rays, <lb/>
            As is shown by the arguments of those <lb/>
            Who have mapped out all the quarters of the sky, <lb/>
            Adorned with their twelve signs spaced out in order. <lb/>
            Or else because the air in certain parts <lb/>
            Is thicker, therefore the trembling lamp of fire <lb/>
            Is hindered in its course beneath the earth, <lb/>
            And cannot easily force a passage through <lb/>
            And emerge at the place where it should rise. <lb/>
            So in winter-time the nights are long and lingering, <lb/>
            Ere the day's radiant oriflamme comes forth. <lb/>
            Or else again those fires which cause the sun <lb/>
            To rise from a fixed point, for a like reason <lb/>
            Are wont to stream together slower or quicker <lb/>
            In alternating periods of the year. <lb/>
            So those would seem to speak the truth who hold <lb/>
            That every morning a new sun is born. <note type="footnote"> 83 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            It may be the moon shines because she is struck <lb/>
            By the sun's rays, and turns towards our eyes <lb/>
            A larger portion of this light each day, <lb/>
            The further she recedes from the sun's orb, <lb/>
            Until over against him with full light <lb/>
            She has shone forth, and as she rises up <lb/>
            Has looked upon his setting from on high. <lb/>
            Thereafter in her gradual backward course <lb/>
            In the same manner she must hide her light, <lb/>
            The nearer she now glides to the sun's fire <lb/>
            Travelling through the circle of the signs <lb/>
            From an opposite direction : as those hold <lb/>
            Who fancy that the moon is like a ball, <lb/>
            And moves along a course below the sun. <lb/>
            It is also possible that she revolves <lb/>
            With her own light, and yet shows varying <lb/>
            Phases of brightness : for there may well be <lb/>
            Another body which glides on beside her, <lb/>
            Obstructing and occulting her continually, <lb/>
            And yet cannot be seen, because it moves <lb/>
            Without light. Or perhaps she may turn round <lb/>
            Like a ball, let us say, whose sphere is tinged <lb/>
            With glowing light over one-half its surface ; <lb/>
            And as she turns her sphere, she may present <lb/>
            Varying phases, till she has turned that side <lb/>
            Which glows with fire towards our gazing eyes ; <lb/>
            Then she twists gradually back once more <lb/>
            And hides the luminous half of her round ball: <lb/>
            As the Chaldean sages seek to prove, <lb/>
            Refuting with their Babylonian doctrine <lb/>
            The opposing science of the astronomers ; <lb/>
            Just as though what each sect is fighting for <lb/>
            Might not be true, or there were any reason <lb/>
            Why you should risk embracing the one creed <lb/>
            Less than the other. Again why every time <lb/>
            There should not be created a fresh moon, <lb/>
            With fixed succession of phases and fixed shapes, <note type="footnote"> 84 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            So that each day this new-created moon <lb/>
            Would perish, and another in its stead <lb/>
            Be reproduced, this were no easy task <lb/>
            To prove by argument convincingly, <lb/>
            Since there can be so many things created <lb/>
            In fixed succession. Thus Spring goes its way, <lb/>
            And Venus, and the winged harbinger <lb/>
            Of Venus leads them on ; while treading close <lb/>
            On Zephyrs footsteps, mother Flora strews <lb/>
            The path before them, covering it all over <lb/>
            With every loveliest colour and rich scent. <lb/>
            Next in procession follows parching heat, <lb/>
            With dusty Ceres in its company, <lb/>
            And the Etesian blasts of the North winds. <lb/>
            After these Autumn comes, and by its side <lb/>
            Advances Euhius Euan,l following whom <lb/>
            The other Seasons with their winds appear, <lb/>
            Volturnus thundering on high, and Auster <lb/>
            Terrible with its lightnings. Then at length <lb/>
            December brings snow and renews numb frost. <lb/>
            Winter follows with teeth chattering for cold. <lb/>
            Wherefore it seems less wonderful that the moon <lb/>
            Should be begotten and destroyed again <lb/>
            At fixed times, seeing that so many things <lb/>
            Can come to pass at times so surely fixed.</p>
          <p>Likewise the occultations of the sun <lb/>
            And the moon's vanishings you must suppose <lb/>
            May be produced by many different causes. <lb/>
            For why should the moon be able to shut out <lb/>
            The earth from the sun's light, and lift her head <lb/>
            On high to obstruct him from the earthward side, <lb/>
            Blocking his fiery beams with her dark orb, <lb/>
            And yet at the same time some other body <lb/>
            Gliding on without light continually <lb/>
            Should be supposed unable to do this ? <note type="footnote">1 Bacchus. </note><note type="footnote"> 85 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            Why too should not the sun at a fixed time <lb/>
            Grow faint and lose his fires, and then again <lb/>
            Revive his light, when he has had to pass <lb/>
            Through tracts of air so hostile to his flames <lb/>
            That awhile his fires are quenched by them and perish ? <lb/>
            And why should the earth have power in turn to rob <lb/>
            The moon of light, and likewise keep the sun <lb/>
            Suppressed, while in her monthly course the moon <lb/>
            Glides through the clear-cut shadows of the cone, <lb/>
            And yet at the same time some other body <lb/>
            Should not have power to pass under the moon, <lb/>
            Or glide above the sun's orb, breaking off <lb/>
            The beams of light he sheds ? And furthermore, <lb/>
            If the moon shines with her own radiance, <lb/>
            Why in a certain region of the world <lb/>
            Might she not grow faint, while she makes her way <lb/>
            Through tracts that are unfriendly to her light ?</p>
          <p>Now since I have demonstrated how each thing <lb/>
            Might come to pass throughout the azure spaces <lb/>
            Of the great heaven, how we may know what force <lb/>
            Can cause the varying motions of the sun, <lb/>
            And wanderings of the moon, and in what way <lb/>
            Their light being intercepted they might vanish <lb/>
            Covering with darkness the astonished earth, <lb/>
            When as it were they close their eye of light, <lb/>
            And opening it again, survey all places <lb/>
            Radiant with shining brightness,—therefore now <lb/>
            I will go back to the world's infancy <lb/>
            And the tender age of the world's fields, and show <lb/>
            What in their first fecundity they resolved <lb/>
            To raise into the borders of the light <lb/>
            And give in charge unto the wayward winds.</p>
          <p>In the beginning the Earth brought forth all kinds <lb/>
            Of plants and growing verdure on hillsides <lb/>
            And over all the plains : the flowering meadows <note type="footnote"> 86 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Shone with green colour : next to the various trees <lb/>
            Was given a mighty emulous impulse <lb/>
            To shoot up into the air with unchecked growth. <lb/>
            As feathers, hairs and bristles first are born <lb/>
            On limbs of quadrupeds and on the bodies <lb/>
            Of winged fowl, so the new Earth then put forth <lb/>
            Grasses and brushwood first, and afterwards <lb/>
            Gave birth to all the breeds of mortal things, <lb/>
            That sprang up many in number, in many modes <lb/>
            And divers fashions. For no animals <lb/>
            Can have dropped from the sky, nor can land-creatures <lb/>
            Have issued from the salt pools. Hence it is <lb/>
            That with good reason the Earth has won the name <lb/>
            Of Mother, since from the Earth all things are born. <lb/>
            And many living creatures even now <lb/>
            Rise from the soil, formed by rains, and the sun's <lb/>
            Fierce heat. Therefore the less strange it appears <lb/>
            If then they arose more numerous and more large <lb/>
            Fostered by a new earth and atmosphere. <lb/>
            So first of all the varied families <lb/>
            And tribes of birds would leave their eggs, hatched out <lb/>
            In the spring season, as now the cicadas <lb/>
            In summer-time leave of their own accord <lb/>
            Their filmy skins in search of food and life. <lb/>
            Then was the time when first the Earth produced <lb/>
            The race of mortal men. For in the fields <lb/>
            Plenteous heat and moisture would abound, <lb/>
            So that wherever a fit place occurred, <lb/>
            Wombs would grow, fastened to the earth by roots : <lb/>
            And when the warmth of the infants in due time, <lb/>
            Avoiding moisture and demanding air, <lb/>
            Had broken these wombs open, then would Nature <lb/>
            Turn to that place the porous ducts of the Earth, <lb/>
            Compelling it to exude through open veins <lb/>
            A milk-like liquid, just as nowadays <lb/>
            After child-bearing every woman is filled <lb/>
            With sweet milk ; for with her too the whole flow <note type="footnote"> 87 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            Of nutriment sets streaming towards her breasts. <lb/>
            Earth to these children furnished food, the heat <lb/>
            Clothing, the grass a bed, well lined with rich <lb/>
            Luxuriance of soft down. Moreover then <lb/>
            The world in its fresh newness would give rise <lb/>
            Neither to rigorous cold nor extreme heat, <lb/>
            Nor violent storms of wind, for in a like <lb/>
            Proportion all things grow and gather strength.</p>
          <p>Therefore again and yet again I say <lb/>
            That with good reason the Earth has won and keeps <lb/>
            The name of Mother, since she of herself <lb/>
            Gave birth to humankind, and at a period <lb/>
            Well nigh determined shed forth every beast <lb/>
            That roams o'er the great mountains far and wide, <lb/>
            Likewise the birds of air, many in shape. <lb/>
            But because she must have some limit set <lb/>
            To her time of bearing, she ceased, like a woman <lb/>
            Worn out by lapse of years. For Time transforms <lb/>
            The whole world's nature, and all things must pass <lb/>
            From one condition to another : nothing <lb/>
            Continues like itself. All is in flux : <lb/>
            Nature is ever changing and compelling <lb/>
            All that exists to alter. For one thing <lb/>
            Moulders and wastes away grown weak with age, <lb/>
            And then another comes forth into light, <lb/>
            Issuing from obscurity. So thus Time <lb/>
            Changes the whole world's nature, and the Earth <lb/>
            Passes from one condition to another : <lb/>
            So that what once it bore it can no longer, <lb/>
            And now can bear what it did not before.</p>
          <p>And many monsters too did the Earth essay <lb/>
            To produce in those days, creatures arising <lb/>
            With marvellous face and limbs, the Hermaphrodite, <lb/>
            A thing of neither sex, between the two, <lb/>
            Differing from both : some things deprived of feet; <note type="footnote"> 88 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            Others again with no hands ; others dumb <lb/>
            Without mouths, or else blind for lack of eyes, <lb/>
            Or bound by limbs that everywhere adhered <lb/>
            Fast to their bodies, so that they could perform <lb/>
            No function, nor go anywhere, nor shun <lb/>
            Danger, nor take what their need might require. <lb/>
            Many such monstrous prodigies did Earth <lb/>
            Produce, in vain, since Nature banned their increase, <lb/>
            Nor could they reach the coveted flower of age, <lb/>
            Nor find food, nor be joined in bonds of love. <lb/>
            For we see numerous conditions first <lb/>
            Must meet together, before living things <lb/>
            Can beget and perpetuate their kind. <lb/>
            First they must have food, then a means by which <lb/>
            The seeds of birth may stream throughout the frame <lb/>
            From the relaxed limbs ; also that the male <lb/>
            And female may unite, they must have that <lb/>
            Whereby each may exchange mutual joys.</p>
          <p>And many breeds of creatures in those days <lb/>
            Must have died out, being powerless to beget <lb/>
            And perpetuate their kind. For those which now <lb/>
            You see breathing the breath of life, 'tis craft, <lb/>
            Or courage, or else speed, that from its origin <lb/>
            Must have protected and preserved each race. <lb/>
            Moreover many by their usefulness <lb/>
            Commended to us, continue to exist <lb/>
            Favoured by our protection. The fierce breed <lb/>
            Of lions first, and the other savage beasts, <lb/>
            Their courage has preserved, foxes their craft, <lb/>
            Stags their swift flight. But the light-slumbering hearts <lb/>
            Of faithful dogs, and the whole family <lb/>
            Born from the seed of burden-bearing beasts, <lb/>
            Also the woolly flocks and horned herds, <lb/>
            All these by man's protection are preserved. <lb/>
            For their desire has always been to shun <lb/>
            Wild beasts and to live peaceably, supplied <note type="footnote"> 89 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            Without toil of their own with food in plenty, <lb/>
            Which to reward their services we give them. <lb/>
            But those whom Nature has not thus endowed <lb/>
            With power either to live by their own means <lb/>
            Or else to render us such useful service <lb/>
            That in return we allow their race to feed <lb/>
            And dwell in safety beneath our guardianship, <lb/>
            All these, 'tis plain, would lie exposed a prey <lb/>
            To others, trammelled in their own fatal bonds, <lb/>
            Till Nature had extinguished that whole kind.</p>
          <p>But Centaurs there have never been, nor yet <lb/>
            Ever can things exist of twofold nature <lb/>
            And double body moulded into one <lb/>
            From limbs of alien kind, whose faculties <lb/>
            And functions cannot be on either side <lb/>
            Sufficiently alike. That this is so, <lb/>
            The dullest intellect may be thus convinced. <lb/>
            Consider first that a horse after three years <lb/>
            Is in his flower of vigour, but a boy <lb/>
            By no means so : for often in sleep even then <lb/>
            Will he seek milk still from his mothers breasts <lb/>
            Afterwards, when the horse's lusty strength <lb/>
            Fails him in old age, and his limbs grow languid <lb/>
            As life ebbs, then first for a boy begins <lb/>
            The flowering time of youth, and clothes his cheeks <lb/>
            With soft down. Do not then believe that ever <lb/>
            From man's and burden-bearing horse's seed <lb/>
            Centaurs can be compounded and have being; <lb/>
            Nor yet Scyllas with half-fish bodies girdled <lb/>
            With raging dogs, and other suchlike things, <lb/>
            Whose limbs we see discordant with themselves, <lb/>
            Since neither do they reach their flower together, <lb/>
            Nor acquire bodily strength, nor in old age <lb/>
            Lose it at the same time : dissimilar <lb/>
            In each the love that burns them, and their modes <lb/>
            Of life incongruous : nor do the same things give <note type="footnote"> 90 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
             <lb/>
            Their bodies pleasure. Thus we may often see <lb/>
            Bearded goats thrive on hemlock, which for man <lb/>
            Is virulent poison. Since moreover flame <lb/>
            Is wont to scorch and burn the tawny bodies <lb/>
            Of lions no less than every other kind <lb/>
            Of flesh and blood on earth, how could it be <lb/>
            That one, yet with a triple body, in front <lb/>
            A lion, behind a serpent, in the midst <lb/>
            Its goat's self, a Chimaera should breathe forth <lb/>
            From such a body fierce flame at the mouth ? <lb/>
            Therefore he who can fable that when earth <lb/>
            Was new and the sky young, such animals <lb/>
            Could have been propagated, resting alone <lb/>
            Upon this vain term, newness, he no doubt <lb/>
            Will babble out many follies in like fashion, <lb/>
            Will say that rivers then throughout the earth <lb/>
            Commonly flowed with gold, that trees were wont <lb/>
            To bloom with jewels, or that man was born <lb/>
            Of such huge bulk and force that he could wade <lb/>
            With giant strides across deep seas and turn <lb/>
            The whole heaven round about him with his hands. <lb/>
            For the fact that there were many seeds of things <lb/>
            Within the earth at that time when it first <lb/>
            Shed living creatures forth, is yet no proof <lb/>
            That beasts could have been born of mingled kinds, <lb/>
            Or limbs of different animals joined together; <lb/>
            Because the various families of plants, <lb/>
            The crops and thriving trees, which even now <lb/>
            Teem upward from the soil luxuriantly, <lb/>
            Can yet never be born woven together; <lb/>
            But each thing has its own process of growth : <lb/>
            All must preserve their mutual differences, <lb/>
            Governed by Nature's irreversible law.</p>
          <p>But that first race of men in the open fields <lb/>
            Was hardier far, (small wonder, since hard Earth <lb/>
            Had brought it forth,) built too around a frame <note type="footnote"> 91 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            Of bones more large and solid, knit together <lb/>
            By powerful sinews ; nor was it easily <lb/>
            Impaired by heat or cold, nor by strange foods, <lb/>
            Nor yet by any bodily disease. <lb/>
            And during many revolving periods <lb/>
            Of the sun through the sky, they lived their lives <lb/>
            After the roving habit of wild beasts. <lb/>
            No one was then the bent ploughs stalwart guide, <lb/>
            None yet had knowledge how to till the fields <lb/>
            With iron, or plant young saplings in the soil, <lb/>
            Nor how to lop old boughs from the tall trees <lb/>
            With pruning-hooks. What suns and rains had given, <lb/>
            What of her own free will Earth had brought forth, <lb/>
            Was enough bounty to content their hearts. <lb/>
            'Neath acorn-bearing oak-trees their wont was <lb/>
            To alleviate their hunger ; and those berries <lb/>
            Which now upon the arbutus you see <lb/>
            Ripening to scarlet hues in winter-time, <lb/>
            The Earth then bore more plentifully and larger <lb/>
            Than in these days. Moreover then the world's <lb/>
            Luxuriant youth gave birth to many kinds <lb/>
            Of coarse food, ample enough for wretched men. <lb/>
            But to allay their thirst rivers and springs <lb/>
            Invited, as now waters, tumbling down <lb/>
            From the great mountains with clear-sounding plash, <lb/>
            Summon from far the thirsting tribes of beasts. <lb/>
            Furthermore in their roamings they would visit <lb/>
            Those renowned silvan precincts of the Nymphs, <lb/>
            Caverns wherefrom they knew that copious streams, <lb/>
            Gushing forth smoothly, bathed the dripping rocks, <lb/>
            (The dripping rocks, o'er green moss trickling down,) <lb/>
            Or sometimes welled up over the level plain. <lb/>
            As yet they knew not how to employ fire, <lb/>
            Or to make use of skins, and clothe their bodies <lb/>
            With spoils of wild beasts ; but inhabiting <lb/>
            Woods, mountains, caves and forests, they would shelter <lb/>
            Their squalid limbs in thickets, when compelled <note type="footnote"> 92 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            To shun the buffeting of winds and rains. <lb/>
            No regard could they have to a general good, <lb/>
            Nor did they know how to make use in common <lb/>
            Of any laws or customs. Whatsoever <lb/>
            Fortune might set before him, that would each <lb/>
            Take as his prize, cunning to thrive and live <lb/>
            As best might please him, each one for himself. <lb/>
            And in the woods Venus would join the bodies <lb/>
            Of lovers, whether a mutual desire, <lb/>
            Or the man's violence and vehement lust <lb/>
            Had won the woman over, or a bribe <lb/>
            Of acorns, arbute-berries or choice pears. <lb/>
            Endowed with marvellous strength of hands and feet <lb/>
            They chased the forest-roaming tribes of beasts ; <lb/>
            And many with flung stones and ponderous club <lb/>
            They overcame, some few they would avoid <lb/>
            In hiding-places. And like bristly swine <lb/>
            Just as they were they flung their savage limbs <lb/>
            Naked upon the ground, when night overtook them, <lb/>
            Enveloping themselves with leaves and boughs. <lb/>
            Nor did they call for daylight and the sun <lb/>
            Wandering terror-stricken about the fields <lb/>
            With loud wails through the shadows of the night, <lb/>
            But silently, buried in sleep they lay <lb/>
            Waiting until the sun with rosy torch <lb/>
            Brought light into the sky. For since from childhood <lb/>
            They had been wont to see darkness and light <lb/>
            Alternately begotten without fail, <lb/>
            Never could they feel wonder or misgiving <lb/>
            Lest night eternal should possess the earth <lb/>
            And the sun's light for ever be withdrawn. <lb/>
            But 'twas a worse anxiety that wild beasts <lb/>
            Often made sleep unsafe for these poor wretches. <lb/>
            For driven from their homes in sheltering rocks <lb/>
            They fled at the entrance of a foaming boar <lb/>
            Or strong lion, yielding up at dead of night <lb/>
            Their leaf-strewn beds in panic to fierce guests. <note type="footnote"> 93 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            Yet no more often in those days than now <lb/>
            Would mortal men leave the sweet light of life <lb/>
            With lamentation. Each one by himself <lb/>
            Would doubtless be more likely then than now <lb/>
            To be seized and devoured by wild beasts' teeth, <lb/>
            A living food, and with his groans would fill <lb/>
            Mountains and forests, while he saw his own <lb/>
            Live flesh in a live monument entombed. <lb/>
            But those whom flight had saved with mangled body, <lb/>
            From that time forth would hold their trembling hands <lb/>
            Over their noisome scars, with dreadful cries <lb/>
            Invoking death, till agonising throes <lb/>
            Rid them of life, with none to give them aid, <lb/>
            Ignorant of what wounds required. But then <lb/>
            A single day did not consign to death <lb/>
            Thousands on thousands, marshalled beneath standards, <lb/>
            Nor did the turbulent waters of the deep <lb/>
            Shatter upon the rocks both ships and men. <lb/>
            At that time vainly, without aim or result <lb/>
            The sea would often rise up and turmoil ; <lb/>
            Nor could the winsome wiles of the calm deep <lb/>
            Lure men on treacherously with laughing waves, <lb/>
            While reckless seamanship was yet unknown. <lb/>
            Moreover lack of food would then consign <lb/>
            Their fainting limbs to death : now rather plenty <lb/>
            Sinks men to ruin. Often for themselves <lb/>
            Would they pour poison out unwittingly : <lb/>
            To others now with subtler skill they give it.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, when they had learnt the use of huts, <lb/>
            And skins, and fire ; when woman, joined with man <lb/>
            In wedlock, dwelt apart in one abode, <lb/>
            And they saw offspring born out of themselves, <lb/>
            Then first the human race began to soften. <lb/>
            For fire made their chilly bodies now <lb/>
            Less able to endure the cold beneath <lb/>
            The roof of heaven : Venus impaired their strength : <note type="footnote"> 94 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            And children easily by their blandishments <lb/>
            Broke down the haughty temper of their parents. <lb/>
            Then too neighbours began to join in bonds <lb/>
            Of friendship, wishing neither to inflict <lb/>
            Nor suffer violence : and for womankind <lb/>
            And children they would claim kind treatment, pleading <lb/>
            With cries and gestures inarticulately <lb/>
            That all men ought to have pity on the weak. <lb/>
            And though harmony could not everywhere <lb/>
            Be established, yet the most part faithfully <lb/>
            Observed their covenants, or man's whole race <lb/>
            Would even then have perished, nor till now <lb/>
            Could propagation have preserved their kind.</p>
          <p>But it was Nature that constrained their tongues <lb/>
            To utter various sounds ; and need struck out <lb/>
            The names of things, in the same way almost <lb/>
            As impotence of tongue is itself seen <lb/>
            To teach gesture to infants, prompting them <lb/>
            To point at things around them. For all creatures <lb/>
            Divine by instinct how far they can use <lb/>
            Their natural powers. Thus before horns are born <lb/>
            And stand out on the forehead of a calf, <lb/>
            When he is angry, he butts and charges with it. <lb/>
            Then panther cubs and lion whelps will fight <lb/>
            With claws and feet and teeth, even at a time <lb/>
            When teeth and claws have hardly yet been formed. <lb/>
            Also we see how the whole race of birds <lb/>
            Trusting their wings, will seek a fluttering succour <lb/>
            From new-fledged pinions. Therefore to suppose <lb/>
            That somebody once apportioned names to things, <lb/>
            And that from him men learnt to use words first, <lb/>
            Is mere folly. For why should this one man <lb/>
            Be able to denote all things by words <lb/>
            And with his tongue form varied sounds, yet others <lb/>
            At the same time be deemed incapable <lb/>
            To have done the like ? Besides, if others too <note type="footnote"> 95 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            Had not made use of words among themselves, <lb/>
            Whence was the preconception of their usefulness <lb/>
            Implanted in this man, and whence was given him <lb/>
            The primal power to know and comprehend <lb/>
            What he desired to do ? Again, one man <lb/>
            Could not subdue by force the wills of many <lb/>
            And compel them to learn the names of things. <lb/>
            It is no easy labour to convince <lb/>
            Deaf men, and teach them what they ought to do ; <lb/>
            Since not for long would they endure his voice, <lb/>
            Nor suffer unintelligible sounds <lb/>
            Fruitlessly to be dinned into their ears. <lb/>
            Lastly what should there be to wonder at <lb/>
            So much in this, that mankind, when their voice <lb/>
            And tongue were in full vigour, should name things <lb/>
            By different sounds as different feelings bade them, <lb/>
            Since dumb cattle, and even the wild beasts, <lb/>
            Are wont to emit distinct and varied sounds, <lb/>
            When they feel fear or pain, or when joy moves them. <lb/>
            This indeed may be learnt from manifest facts. <lb/>
            When the large soft mouths of Molossian dogs <lb/>
            Begin to growl, angrily laying bare <lb/>
            Their hard teeth, then far different is the tone <lb/>
            In which they threaten, savagely thus drawn back, <lb/>
            From the clear sound which, when they bark outright, <lb/>
            Fills the whole neighbourhood. And when they essay <lb/>
            In gentle mood to lick their cubs, or when <lb/>
            They toss them with their paws, and snapping at them <lb/>
            Tenderly make as though they would devour them <lb/>
            With half-closed teeth, thus fondling them they yelp <lb/>
            With a quite different sound from their deep bay <lb/>
            When left alone in houses, or from the whimper <lb/>
            With which crouching they shrink away from blows. <lb/>
            Furthermore does not a young stallion's neigh <lb/>
            Seem different, when he rages among the mares <lb/>
            Pierced in his flower of age by winged love's goads, <lb/>
            From when with wide-stretched nostrils he snorts out <note type="footnote"> 96 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            The battle signal, or when at other times <lb/>
            Perchance he whinnies trembling in all his limbs ? <lb/>
            Lastly the race of fowl and varied birds, <lb/>
            Hawks and ospreys and gulls that seek their living <lb/>
            In the salt waters of the ocean waves, <lb/>
            Utter at different times quite different cries <lb/>
            From those they make when they fight over food, <lb/>
            Or struggle with their prey. And some will change <lb/>
            Their harsh notes in accordance with the weather, <lb/>
            As do the long-lived tribes of crows, and flocks <lb/>
            Of rooks, when they are said to call for rain, <lb/>
            Or sometimes to be summoning wind-storms. <lb/>
            Since therefore various feelings can compel <lb/>
            Animals, speechless though they be, to utter <lb/>
            Such varying sounds, how much more natural <lb/>
            Is it that in those days men could denote <lb/>
            Dissimilar things by many different sounds !</p>
          <p>In answer to your silent questioning here, <lb/>
            I say it was the lightning first brought fire <lb/>
            Down to the earth for men ; and from that flame <lb/>
            All other flames have spread. Thus we behold <lb/>
            Many things blaze forth, lit by fire from heaven, <lb/>
            When the sky's stroke has charged them with its heat. <lb/>
            Yet when a branching tree, tossed by the wind, <lb/>
            Chafing the branches of another tree, <lb/>
            Sways to and fro, then fire may be forced out <lb/>
            By violent stress of friction ; and at times <lb/>
            Hot flames are kindled and flash forth from boughs <lb/>
            And stems rubbing together. Of these two chances <lb/>
            Either may first have given fire to men. <lb/>
            Next the sun taught them to cook food, heating <lb/>
            And softening it with flame; since they would note <lb/>
            Many things mellowing about the fields <lb/>
            Smitten and conquered by his scorching rays.</p>
          <p>And more and more each day men who excelled <note type="footnote"> 97 </note><note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            In subtlety and power of mind, would show them <lb/>
            How by new methods and by using fire <lb/>
            To improve their former means of livelihood. <lb/>
            Kings began to found cities and build forts <lb/>
            As refuges and strongholds for themselves, <lb/>
            Dividing cattle and lands, and portioning <lb/>
            To each his share according to his beauty, <lb/>
            His strength and intellect; for comeliness <lb/>
            Was much esteemed, and strength was paramount. <lb/>
            Afterwards property was devised, and gold <lb/>
            Discovered, which with ease robbed both the strong <lb/>
            And beautiful of their honours : for most men, <lb/>
            However brave and beautiful by birth, <lb/>
            Follow the fortunes of the richer man. <lb/>
            But whosoever by true reason's rule <lb/>
            Governs his days, for him plain frugal living <lb/>
            And a contented spirit is mighty wealth ; <lb/>
            For of a little never is there lack. <lb/>
            Yet men wished to become renowned and powerful, <lb/>
            That so their fortunes on a stable base <lb/>
            Might rest, and they, being wealthy, might have power <lb/>
            To lead a tranquil life : in vain ! For while <lb/>
            They strove to mount to the highest pitch of honour <lb/>
            Their path was perilous : and even although <lb/>
            They have reached the summit, envy will sometimes <lb/>
            Strike like a thunderbolt and hurl men down <lb/>
            Contemptuously to noisome Tartarus : <lb/>
            Since highest things, lifted above all else, <lb/>
            Are most wont as by lightning to be blasted <lb/>
            By envy ; so that quietly to obey <lb/>
            Is better than to crave sovereign power <lb/>
            And lordship over realms. Therefore let men <lb/>
            Sweat drops of blood, wearying themselves in vain, <lb/>
            Struggling along ambition's narrow road ; <lb/>
            Since from the mouths of others comes their wisdom, <lb/>
            And 'tis from hearsay rather than their own <lb/>
            Authentic feelings, they pursue such aims : <note type="footnote"> 98 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            Nor does this happen now, nor will it happen <lb/>
            Hereafter any more than once it did.</p>
          <p>Kings therefore being slain, the ancient majesty <lb/>
            Of thrones and haughty sceptres was laid low. <lb/>
            The glorious symbol of the sovereign head, <lb/>
            Trodden bloodstained beneath the people's feet, <lb/>
            Mourned its proud honour lost; for that is greedily <lb/>
            Trampled down which before was too much feared. <lb/>
            Thus to the very lees of anarchy <lb/>
            The whole state was reduced, while each man <lb/>
            grasped <lb/>
            At lordship and dominion for himself. <lb/>
            Then some among them taught how to create <lb/>
            Magistrates, and established codes, that all <lb/>
            Might learn to obey laws. For now mankind, <lb/>
            Utterly wearied of a violent life, <lb/>
            Lay languishing by reason of its feuds. <lb/>
            Therefore the sooner of its own free will <lb/>
            Did'it submit to laws and stringent codes. <lb/>
            For seeing that each, when anger prompted him, <lb/>
            Strove more severely to avenge himself <lb/>
            Than just laws now permit, for this cause men <lb/>
            Grew tired of a life of violence. <lb/>
            Thenceforward fear of punishment infects <lb/>
            The enjoyment of lifers prizes : for the nets <lb/>
            Of violence and wrong entangle all those <lb/>
            Who inflict them, and most often they recoil <lb/>
            On such as used them first : nor is it easy <lb/>
            For him to pass a quiet and peaceful life, <lb/>
            Whose deeds transgress the bonds of public peace. <lb/>
            For though he should elude both gods and men, <lb/>
            Yet he must needs mistrust whether his guilt <lb/>
            Will remain veiled for ever, since 'tis said <lb/>
            That many often by talking in their dreams, <lb/>
            Or in delirious sickness have betrayed <lb/>
            Their secrets, and revealed long-hidden crimes. ; <note type="footnote"> 99 </note><lb/>

            Now what may be the cause that has spread wide <lb/>
            The cult of deities over mighty nations, <lb/>
            And filled cities with altars, and prescribed <lb/>
            The observance of such sacred rites as now <lb/>
            At solemn times and places are performed, <lb/>
            Whence even now is implanted in men's minds <lb/>
            Religious awe, that over the whole earth <lb/>
            Raises new temples to the gods, and prompts <lb/>
            Worshippers to frequent them on feast-days- <lb/>
            Why this should be, 'tis easy to explain. <lb/>
            For in those early times mortals would see <lb/>
            With waking mind the glorious images <lb/>
            Of deities and behold them in their sleep <lb/>
            Of size yet more gigantic. To these then <lb/>
            They would attribute sense, because they seemed <lb/>
            To move their limbs and utter stately speech <lb/>
            Worthy of their noble aspect and great powers. <lb/>
            Also they deemed eternal life was theirs, <lb/>
            Because their images continually <lb/>
            Would reappear, and their form did not change, <lb/>
            But most because they could not well conceive <lb/>
            How beings who seemed gifted with such powers <lb/>
            Could lightly be subdued by any force. <lb/>
            And they believed that their felicity <lb/>
            Must be beyond compare, since none of them <lb/>
            Was ever troubled by the fear of death, <lb/>
            Because moreover in sleep they beheld them <lb/>
            Performing without effort many miracles. <lb/>
            Again they saw how the orderings of heaven <lb/>
            And the year's varying seasons would return <lb/>
            According to fixed law, yet could they not <lb/>
            Discover from what causes this took place. <lb/>
            Therefore they found a'refuge from such doubts <lb/>
            In handing all things over to the deities <lb/>
            And deeming all to be guided by their nod. <lb/>
            The abodes of their divinities they placed <lb/>
            In heaven, because they saw night and the moon <note type="footnote"> 100 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            Progressing through the sky, moon day and night, <lb/>
            The severe constellations of the night, <lb/>
            The sky's night-wandering meteors and gliding fires, <lb/>
            Clouds sun and snow, lightning and winds and hail, <lb/>
            Thunder's swift crash and mightily threatening murmurs.</p>
          <p>0 unhappy race of men, that could assign <lb/>
            Such functions to the deities, and thereto <lb/>
            Add cruel wrath ! What groans then for themselves <lb/>
            Did they beget, what wounds for us, what tears <lb/>
            For our children's children ! 'Tis no piety <lb/>
            To be seen often with veiled head to turn <lb/>
            Towards a stone, visiting every altar, <lb/>
            Nor to fall grovelling with outspread palms <lb/>
            Prostrate before the temples of the gods, <lb/>
            Nor sprinkling altars with much blood of beasts <lb/>
            To add to votive offering votive offering ; <lb/>
            But this rather is piety, to have power <lb/>
            To survey all things with a tranquil mind. <lb/>
            For when we lift our eyes to the celestial <lb/>
            Temples of the great universe, and the aether <lb/>
            Studded with glittering stars, and contemplate <lb/>
            The paths of sun and moon, then in our breasts, <lb/>
            Burdened with other evils, this fear too <lb/>
            Begins to lift its reawakened head, <lb/>
            Lest perchance it be true that with the gods <lb/>
            Resides a boundless power, which can move <lb/>
            Upon their various courses the bright stars. <lb/>
            Tor ignorance of cause troubles the mind, <lb/>
            So that it doubts whether there ever was <lb/>
            A birth-time and beginning for the world, <lb/>
            And likewise whether there shall be an end ; <lb/>
            How far the world's walls can endure this strain <lb/>
            Of restless motion, or whether by the gods <lb/>
            With eternal stability endowed <lb/>
            They may glide on through endless lapse of time, <lb/>
            Defying the strong powers of infinite age. <note type="footnote"> 101 </note><lb/>

            Again whose mind shrinks not with awe of gods, <lb/>
            Whose limbs creep not for terror, when beneath <lb/>
            The appalling stroke of thunder the parched earth <lb/>
            Shudders, and mutterings run through the vast sky ? <lb/>
            Do not the peoples and the nations quake, <lb/>
            And proud kings, stricken with religious dread <lb/>
            Sit quailing, lest for any wicked deed <lb/>
            Or overweening word, the heavy time <lb/>
            Of reckoning and punishment be ripe ? <lb/>
            Also when the full violence of a wind <lb/>
            Raging across the sea, sweeps o'er the waves <lb/>
            The high commander of a fleet, with all <lb/>
            His powerful legions and his elephants, <lb/>
            Does he not supplicate the gods with vows <lb/>
            For mercy, and with craven prayers entreat them <lb/>
            To lull the storm and grant propitious gales ? <lb/>
            But all in vain ; since often none the less, <lb/>
            Seized by the violent hurricane, he is whirled <lb/>
            Onto the shoals of death. Thus evermore <lb/>
            Some hidden power treads human grandeur down, <lb/>
            And seems to make its sport of the proud rods <lb/>
            And cruel axes, crushed beneath its heel. <lb/>
            Lastly, when the whole earth rocks under them, <lb/>
            And cities tumble with the shock, or stand <lb/>
            In doubt, threatening to fall, what wonder is it <lb/>
            That mortal creatures should abase themselves, <lb/>
            Assigning vast dominion to the gods, <lb/>
            And wondrous powers to govern all below ?</p>
          <p>Now must be told how copper gold and iron, <lb/>
            And weighty silver also, and solid lead <lb/>
            Were first discovered when on the great hills <lb/>
            Fire had consumed huge forests with its heat, <lb/>
            Kindled either by lightning from the sky, <lb/>
            Or because men waging some forest war <lb/>
            Had carried fire among their enemies <lb/>
            For terrors sake ; or else because, drawn on <note type="footnote"> 102 </note><lb/>

            By the soil's goodness, they would wish to clear <lb/>
            Fat lands and turn them unto pasturage, <lb/>
            Or to kill beasts and grow rich with the spoils. <lb/>
            For hunting with the pitfall and with fire <lb/>
            Came into use before woods were enclosed <lb/>
            With nets or drawn by dogs. However that be, <lb/>
            From whatsoever cause the heat of flame <lb/>
            With terrible crackling had devoured whole forests <lb/>
            Down to their deepest roots, and throughly baked <lb/>
            The soil with fire, forth from the burning veins <lb/>
            There would ooze and collect in cavities <lb/>
            Streams of silver and gold, of copper too, <lb/>
            And lead. When afterwards men found these metals <lb/>
            Cooled into masses glittering on the ground <lb/>
            With brilliant colours, they would pick them up, <lb/>
            Attracted by their bright smooth loveliness ; <lb/>
            And they would then observe how each was formed <lb/>
            Into a shape similar to the imprint <lb/>
            Of the hole where it lay. Next it would strike them <lb/>
            That, melted down by heat, these could be made <lb/>
            To run into any form and mould they pleased, <lb/>
            And further could by hammering be wrought <lb/>
            Into points tapering as sharp and fine <lb/>
            As they might need, so furnishing themselves <lb/>
            With tools wherewith to cut down woods, hew timber <lb/>
            And plane planks smooth, to drill and pierce and bore. <lb/>
            And this they would attempt with silver and gold <lb/>
            No less than with stout copper's mighty strength. <lb/>
            But in vain, since their yielding force would fail, <lb/>
            Being proved less fit to endure toil and strain. <lb/>
            In those days copper was more highly esteemed ; <lb/>
            Gold lay despised as useless with its dull <lb/>
            And blunted edge : now copper lies neglected, <lb/>
            Whereas gold has attained the pitch of honour. <lb/>
            Thus Time as it revolves is ever changing <lb/>
            The seasons of things. What was once esteemed <lb/>
            Becomes at length of no repute ; whereon <note type="footnote"> 103 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            Some other thing, issuing from contempt, <lb/>
            Mounts up and daily is coveted more and more, <lb/>
            And, once discovered, blossoms out in praises, <lb/>
            Rising to wondrous honour among men.</p>
          <p>Now, Memmius, you will easily of yourself <lb/>
            Understand in what way were first discovered <lb/>
            The properties of iron. Man's earliest weapons <lb/>
            Were hands nails teeth and stones, and boughs torn off <lb/>
            From forest trees, and flame and fire, as each <lb/>
            Became known. Afterwards the force of iron <lb/>
            And copper was discovered. And the use <lb/>
            Of copper was known earlier than of iron, <lb/>
            Since it was easier to be worked, and found <lb/>
            More copiously. With copper they would till <lb/>
            The soil of earth, with copper they stirred up <lb/>
            The waves of war, and dealt wide-gaping wounds, <lb/>
            And seized on lands and cattle : for all else, <lb/>
            Being naked and unarmed, would yield to those <lb/>
            Who carried weapons. Then by slow degrees <lb/>
            The sword of iron made progress, while the type <lb/>
            Of the copper sickle came to be despised. <lb/>
            With iron they began to cleave the soil, <lb/>
            And through its use wavering war's conflicts <lb/>
            Were rendered equal. Earlier was the custom <lb/>
            Of mounting armed upon a horse's back <lb/>
            And guiding it with reins, and dealing blows <lb/>
            With the right arm, long before men dared tempt <lb/>
            The risks of battle in the two-horsed car. <lb/>
            And they would learn the art to yoke two steeds <lb/>
            Earlier than to yoke four, or to mount armed <lb/>
            Upon scythed chariots. Next the Poeni taught <lb/>
            The uncouth Lucanian kine,l with towered backs <lb/>
            And snake-like hands, to endure the wounds of war, <lb/>
            And rout great troops of martial chivalry. <lb/>
            Thus miserable discord brought to birth <note type="footnote">1 Elephants. </note><note type="footnote"> 104 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            One thing after another, to appal <lb/>
            Mankind's embattled nations, every day <lb/>
            Making addition to war's frightfulness.</p>
          <p>Also in warfare they made trial of bulls, <lb/>
            And sought to drive fierce boars against the foe. <lb/>
            And some sent mighty lions in their van <lb/>
            With armed trainers and savage guardians <lb/>
            To govern them and hold them in with chains ; <lb/>
            In vain, for heated with promiscuous carnage <lb/>
            They put to flight could the horsemen calm <lb/>
            Their horses, panic-stricken by the roaring, <lb/>
            Or turn them by the bridle against their foes. <lb/>
            The she-lions would spring fiercely on all sides <lb/>
            Right in the faces of their adversaries, <lb/>
            Or from behind seizing them off their guard <lb/>
            Would clasp and tear them wounded down to the earth, <lb/>
            Gripping them with their strong teeth and hooked claws. <lb/>
            The bulls would toss and trample underfoot <lb/>
            Their own friends, goring the horses from beneath <lb/>
            In belly and flank, tearing the soil up savagely. <lb/>
            Fierce boars would rend their allies with strong tusks. <lb/>
            Staining the broken weapons with their blood, <lb/>
            And put to rout both horse and foot together. <lb/>
            The steeds, to escape from the tusk's cruel push, <lb/>
            Would swerve aside or rearing paw the air, <lb/>
            In vain, for with severed tendons they would crash <lb/>
            Heavily down to the earth and lie stretched out. <lb/>
            Beasts, by the keepers deemed to have been tamed <lb/>
            Sufficiently at home, they now would see <lb/>
            Heated to madness in the hour of battle, <lb/>
            By wounds and shouts, flight panic and uproar. <lb/>
            No portion of all the different kinds of beasts, <lb/>
            Once scattered in wild flight, could they recall. <lb/>
            So often nowadays the Lucanian kine, <note type="footnote"> 105 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            Gashed cruelly with the steel, will fly dispersed, <lb/>
            Inflicting ruinous havoc on their friends. <lb/>
            Thus might these men have acted : yet I scarce <lb/>
            Can think they were not able to foresee <lb/>
            And calculate how horrible a disaster <lb/>
            Was certain to befall both sides alike. <lb/>
            But men chose to act thus, not in the hope <lb/>
            Of victory so much, as from the wish, <lb/>
            Though they themselves perished, to give their foes <lb/>
            Cause to lament, being desperate through mistrust <lb/>
            Of their own numbers, or through lack of arms.</p>
          <p>The plaited garment came before the dress <lb/>
            Of woven stuff. Weaving comes after iron, <lb/>
            Since weaving tools need iron to fashion them. <lb/>
            By no means else can such smooth things be made <lb/>
            As heddles, spindles, shuttles and clattering yarn-beams. <lb/>
            Men before womankind did Nature prompt <lb/>
            To work wool; for in general the male sex <lb/>
            Is by far the more skilful and ingenious : <lb/>
            Till the rough peasants chided them so sternly <lb/>
            That at length they consented to resign <lb/>
            Such lighter tasks into the hands of women, <lb/>
            And themselves took their share in heavier toils, <lb/>
            Hardening with hard labour limbs and hands.</p>
          <p>But Nature, the creatress, herself first <lb/>
            Taught men to sow and prompted them to graft. <lb/>
            For berries and acorns dropping from the trees <lb/>
            Would put forth in due season underneath <lb/>
            Swarms of seedlings : and hence the fancy came <lb/>
            To insert grafts upon the boughs, and plant <lb/>
            Young saplings in the soil about the fields. <lb/>
            Next they would try another and yet another <lb/>
            Method of tilling their loved piece of land, <lb/>
            And so could watch how kindly fostering culture <lb/>
            Helped the earth to improve its own wild fruits. <note type="footnote"> 106 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            And they would force the forests day by day <lb/>
            To retreat higher up the mountain-sides <lb/>
            And yield the ground below to husbandry, <lb/>
            That so meadows and ponds, rivulets, crops, <lb/>
            And glad vineyards might cover hill and plain, <lb/>
            While grey-green boundary strips of olive trees <lb/>
            Might run between the fields, stretching far out <lb/>
            O'er hillock, valley and plain ; as now we see <lb/>
            Whole countrysides glowing with varied beauty, <lb/>
            Adorned with rows of sweet fruit-bearing trees, <lb/>
            And enclosed round about with joyous groves.</p>
          <p>But the art of imitating with their mouths <lb/>
            The liquid notes of birds, came long before <lb/>
            Men could delight their ears by singing words <lb/>
            To smooth tunes ; and the whistlings of the zephyr <lb/>
            In hollow reeds first taught the husbandman <lb/>
            To blow through hollow stalks. Then by degrees <lb/>
            They learnt those sweet sad ditties, which the pipe, <lb/>
            Touched by the fingers of the melodist, <lb/>
            Pours forth, such as are heard 'mid pathless woods, <lb/>
            Forests and glades, or in the lonely haunts <lb/>
            Of shepherds, and the abodes of magic calm. <lb/>
            Thus would they soothe and gratify their minds, <lb/>
            When satiate with food ; for all such things <lb/>
            Give pleasure then. So often, couched together <lb/>
            On the soft grass, beside a waterbrook <lb/>
            Beneath a tall tree's boughs, at no great cost <lb/>
            They would regale their bodies joyously, <lb/>
            At those times chiefly when the weather smiled, <lb/>
            And the year's seasons painted the green herbage <lb/>
            With flowers. Then went round the jest, the tale, <lb/>
            The merry laugh, for then the rustic muse <lb/>
            Was in full force : then frolick jollity <lb/>
            Would prompt them to enwreathe their heads and <lb/>
            shoulders <lb/>
            With plaited garlands woven of flowers and leaves, <note type="footnote"> 107 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            Or dancing out of measure to move their limbs <lb/>
            Clumsily, and with clumsy foot to beat <lb/>
            Their mother earth; whence smiles and jovial <lb/>
            laughter <lb/>
            Would rise ; since the more novel then and strange <lb/>
            All such sports seemed, the more they were admired. <lb/>
            And they would find a salve for wakefulness <lb/>
            In giving voice to many varied tones <lb/>
            Of winding melody, running with curved lip <lb/>
            Over the reed-pipes : and from them this custom <lb/>
            Is handed down to watchmen nowadays, <lb/>
            Who, though they have better learnt to observe time, <lb/>
            Yet not one whit more pleasure do they enjoy <lb/>
            Than once that silvan race of earth-born men. <lb/>
            For what is present, if we have never known <lb/>
            Anything more delightful, gives us pleasure <lb/>
            Beyond all else, and seems to be the best; <lb/>
            But if some better thing be afterwards <lb/>
            Discovered, this will often spoil for us all <lb/>
            That pleased us once, and change our feelings <lb/>
            towards it. <lb/>
            Thus it was acorns came to be disliked : <lb/>
            Thus were abandoned those beds of strewn grass <lb/>
            And heaped leaves : the dress too of wild beast's skin <lb/>
            Fell thus into contempt. Yet I suppose <lb/>
            That when it was invented it would rouse <lb/>
            Such envy, that the man who wore it first <lb/>
            Would be waylaid and slain : yet after all <lb/>
            It would be torn to pieces among the thieves <lb/>
            And with much bloodshed utterly destroyed, <lb/>
            So that it never could be turned to use. <lb/>
            Therefore skins then, now gold and purple vex <lb/>
            Men's lives with cares and wear them out with war. <lb/>
            And here, I think, the greater guilt is ours ; <lb/>
            For the cold would torment these earth-born men <lb/>
            Naked without their skins ; but us no harm <lb/>
            Whatever can it cause to go without <note type="footnote"> 108 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            A purple robe broidered with large designs <lb/>
            In gold thread, so we have but on our backs <lb/>
            A plain plebeian cloak to keep us warm. <lb/>
            Therefore mankind is always toiling vainly, <lb/>
            Fruitlessly wasting life in empty cares, <lb/>
            Doubtless because they will not recognise <lb/>
            The limits of possession, nor the bounds <lb/>
            Beyond which no true pleasure can increase. <lb/>
            And so by slow degrees this ignorance <lb/>
            Has carried life out into the deep seas, <lb/>
            And from the bottom stirred up war's huge waves.</p>
          <p>But those vigilant watchers, sun and moon, <lb/>
            That circling round illumine with their light <lb/>
            The vast revolving temple of the sky, <lb/>
            Taught mankind how the seasons of the year <lb/>
            Return, and how all things are brought to pass <lb/>
            According to fixed system and fixed law.</p>
          <p>And now men dwelt securely fenced about <lb/>
            By strong towers, and the land was portioned out <lb/>
            And marked off to be tilled. Already now <lb/>
            The sea was white with flitting sails, and towns <lb/>
            Were joined in league of friendship and alliance. <lb/>
            Then first poets made record in their songs <lb/>
            Of men's deeds : for not long before this time <lb/>
            Letters had been invented. For which cause <lb/>
            Our age cannot look backward to things past, <lb/>
            Save where reason reveals some evidence.</p>
          <p>Shipping and agriculture, city-walls, <lb/>
            Laws, arms, roads, robes and other suchlike things, <lb/>
            Moreover all lifers prizes and refinements, <lb/>
            Poems and pictures, and the chiselling <lb/>
            Of fine-wrought statues, every one of these <lb/>
            Long practice and the untiring mind's experience <lb/>
            Taught men by slow degrees, as they progressed <note type="footnote"> 109 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            Step after step. Thus time little by little <lb/>
            Brings forth each several thing, and reason lifts it <lb/>
            Into the borders of the light; for first <lb/>
            One thing and then another must in turn <lb/>
            Rise from obscurity, until each art <lb/>
            Attains its highest pitch of excellence. <note type="footnote"> 110 </note></p><pb n="111"/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK VI, lines 1-95</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN ancient days Athens of glorious name <lb/>
            Was first to spread abroad corn-bearing crops <lb/>
            Among unhappy mortals, and to frame <lb/>
            Their lives in a new mould and give them laws. <lb/>
            She also first bestowed a kindly solace <lb/>
            For life, when she gave birth to one endowed <lb/>
            With so great intellect, that man who once <lb/>
            Poured forth all wisdom from truth-telling lips ; <lb/>
            Whose glory, even when his light was quenched, <lb/>
            Because of his divine discoveries <lb/>
            Undimmed by time was noised abroad, and now <lb/>
            Is lifted high as heaven. For when he saw <lb/>
            That well nigh all those things which need demands <lb/>
            For man's subsistence had been now provided, <lb/>
            And that so far as it seemed possible <lb/>
            Life was established in security, <lb/>
            That men through wealth and honours and renown <lb/>
            Had attained power and affluence, and grown proud <lb/>
            In their children's good name, yet that not one <lb/>
            At home possessed a heart the less care-stricken, <lb/>
            But ceaselessly despite his wiser mind <lb/>
            Tormenting all his days, could not refrain <lb/>
            From petulant rage and wearisome complaint; <lb/>
            Then did he understand it was the vessel <lb/>
            Itself that was the cause of imperfection, <lb/>
            And by its imperfection all those things <lb/>
            That came within it, gathered from outside, <lb/>
            Though ne'er so excellent, were spoiled therein ; <lb/>
            In part because he saw that there were holes <lb/>
            Through which it leaked, so that by no means ever <lb/>
            Might it be filled full; partly that he perceived <note type="footnote"> 111 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            How as with a foul savour it defiled <lb/>
            All things within it which had entered there. <lb/>
            And so with truthful words he purged men's hearts, <lb/>
            And fixed a limit to desire and fear; <lb/>
            Then setting forth what was the highest good <lb/>
            Which we all strive to attain, he pointed out <lb/>
            The path along which by a slender track <lb/>
            We might in a straight course arrive at it; <lb/>
            Likewise he showed what evils there must be <lb/>
            In mortal affairs on every side, arising <lb/>
            And flying this way and that, whether it were <lb/>
            By natural chance or force, since it was Nature <lb/>
            Which has ordained it so ; and by what gates <lb/>
            To meet each evil men must sally forth : <lb/>
            Also he proved how mostly without cause <lb/>
            Mankind set darkly tossing in their hearts <lb/>
            The sad billows of care. For just as children <lb/>
            In the blind darkness tremble and are afraid <lb/>
            Of all things, so we sometimes in the light <lb/>
            Fear things that are no whit more to be dreaded <lb/>
            Than those which children shudder at in the dark, <lb/>
            Imagining that they will come to pass. <lb/>
            This terror then and darkness of the mind <lb/>
            Must needs be scattered not by the sun's beams <lb/>
            And day's bright arrows, but by contemplation <lb/>
            Of Nature's aspect and her inward laws.</p>
          <p>And now that I have shown you how the sky's <lb/>
            Mansions are mortal, and that heaven is formed <lb/>
            Of a body that had birth, and since of all <lb/>
            That takes place and must needs take place therein <lb/>
            I have unravelled most, give further heed <lb/>
            To what remains. Since once I have made bold <lb/>
            To mount the glorious chariot of the Muses,l <lb/>
            I will now tell how in the upper air <lb/>
            Tempests of wind arise ; how all sinks down <note type="footnote">1 The text is here corrupt, and several lines are probably lost. </note> <note type="footnote"> 112 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            To rest once more : the turmoil that has been <lb/>
            Vanishes, when its fury is appeased. <lb/>
            And I will explain all else that mortals see <lb/>
            Coming to pass on earth and in the sky, <lb/>
            Such sights as often hold them in terrified <lb/>
            Suspense of mind, humiliating themselves <lb/>
            With fear of gods, and bow them grovelling <lb/>
            Down to the ground, because they are compelled <lb/>
            Through ignorance of the causes to assign <lb/>
            All such things to the empire of the gods, <lb/>
            Acknowledging their power to be supreme. <lb/>
            For those who have learnt rightly that the gods <lb/>
            Lead a life free from care, if yet they wonder <lb/>
            By what means all things can be carried on, <lb/>
            Such above all as are perceived to happen <lb/>
            In the ethereal regions overhead, <lb/>
            They are borne back again into their old <lb/>
            Religious fears, and adopt pitiless lords, <lb/>
            Whom in their misery they believe to be <lb/>
            Almighty ; for they are ignorant of what can <lb/>
            And what cannot exist ; in fine they know not <lb/>
            Upon what principle each thing has its powers <lb/>
            Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone. <lb/>
            And therefore all the more they are led astray <lb/>
            By blind reasoning. So that if you cannot <lb/>
            Fling from your mind and banish far away <lb/>
            All such belief in falsehoods that degrade <lb/>
            The deities, and consist not with their peace, <lb/>
            Then, thus by you disparaged and profaned, <lb/>
            Oft will their holy godheads do you hurt; <lb/>
            Not that their sovereign power can be impaired, <lb/>
            So that in anger they should stoop to exact <lb/>
            Fierce penalties, but because you yourself <lb/>
            Will fancy that those placid beings throned <lb/>
            In serene peace, can verily be tossed <lb/>
            By great billows of wrath : nor will you enter <lb/>
            With a calm breast the temples of the cods, <note type="footnote"> 113 </note><note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
            Nor yet will you be able to receive <lb/>
            In tranquil peace of spirit those images <lb/>
            Which from their holy bodies, heralding <lb/>
            Their divine beauty, float into men's minds. <lb/>
            And to what kind of life these errors lead <lb/>
            May be imagined. Such credulity <lb/>
            The most veracious reasoning alone <lb/>
            Can drive far from us. And though to that end <lb/>
            I have set forth much already, yet more still <lb/>
            Remains for me to adorn in polished verses. <lb/>
            The inward law and aspect of the heavens <lb/>
            Must now be grasped : tempests and vivid lightnings, <lb/>
            Their action and what cause sets them in motion, <lb/>
            Must be described ; lest, when you have mapped the sky <lb/>
            Into augural divisions, you should then <lb/>
            Quake in dismay, beholding from what quarter <lb/>
            The flash sped in its flight, or on which side <lb/>
            It vanished ; in what manner it pierced through <lb/>
            Into walled places, and how, having played <lb/>
            The tyrant there, it leapt forth and was gone. <lb/>
            Yet of these operations by no means <lb/>
            Can men perceive the causes, and so fancy <lb/>
            That they must come to pass by power divine. <lb/>
            O Muse of knowledge, solace of mankind <lb/>
            And the delight of gods, Calliope, <lb/>
            Point the track out before me as I speed <lb/>
            Towards the white line of my final goal, <lb/>
            That so with thee to guide me I may win <lb/>
            The glorious crown of victory and its praise. <note type="footnote"> PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY NEILL AND CO., LTD., EDINBURGM</note> </p>
