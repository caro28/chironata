          </ab>
          <p>1. MANY writers have very naturally conceived that the <lb/>
            myth of Ixion, who is fabled to have embraced a cloud <lb/>
            instead of Hera, and so to have begotten the centaurs, is <lb/>
            really typical of ambitious men ; for, although they aim at <lb/>
            obtaining glory, and set before themselves a lofty ideal of <lb/>
            virtue, yet they never succeed in producing any very <lb/>
            distinct result, because all their actions are coloured by <lb/>
            various human passions and prejudices, just as the herds­ <lb/>
            men with their flocks say in Sophokles's play:— <lb/>
            "We needs must serve them, though their lords we be, <lb/>
            And to their mute commands obedience pay."</p>
          <p>These verses really represent the state of those who, <lb/>
            in order to obtain the empty title of statesmen and <lb/>
            popular leaders, govern a country by following the <lb/>
            caprices and impulses of the people. Just as the men <lb/>
            stationed in the bows of a ship see what is coming before <lb/>
            the steersmen, but yet look up to them as their chiefs and <lb/>
            execute their orders; so they who govern with a view <lb/>
            solely to their own popularity, although they may be <lb/>
            called rulers, are, in truth, nothing more than slaves of <lb/>
            the people.</p>
          <p>II. An absolutely perfect man would not even wish for <lb/>
            popularity, except so far as it enabled him to take part in <lb/>
            politics, and caused him to be trusted by the people; yet a <lb/>
            young and ambitious man must be excused if he feels <lb/>
            pride in the glory and reputation which he gains by <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            brilliant exploits. For, as Theophrastus says, the virtue <lb/>
            which buds and sprouts in youthful minds is confirmed by <lb/>
            praise, and the high spirit thus formed leads it to attempt <lb/>
            greater things. On the other hand, an excessive love of <lb/>
            praise is dangerous in all cases, but, in statesmen, utterly <lb/>
            ruinous; for when it takes hold of men in the possession of <lb/>
            great power it drives them to commit acts of sheer mad­ <lb/>
            ness, because they forget that honourable conduct must <lb/>
            increase their popularity, and think that any measure <lb/>
            that increases their popularity must necessarily be a good <lb/>
            one. We ought to tell the people that they cannot have <lb/>
            the same man to lead them and to follow them, just as <lb/>
            Phokion is said to have replied to Antipater, when he <lb/>
            demanded some disgraceful service from him, " I cannot <lb/>
            be Antipater's friend and his toady at the same time." <lb/>
            One might also quote the fable of the serpent'is tail which <lb/>
            murmured against the head and desired sometimes to take <lb/>
            the lead, and not always follow the head, but which when <lb/>
            allowed to lead the way took the wrong path and caused <lb/>
            the head to be miserably crushed, because it allowed itself <lb/>
            to be guided by that which could neither see nor hear. <lb/>
            This has been the fate of many of those politicians who <lb/>
            court the favour of the people; for, after they have once <lb/>
            shared their blind impulses, they lose the power of check­ <lb/>
            ing their folly, and of restoring good discipline and order. <lb/>
            These reflections upon the favour of the people occurred <lb/>
            to me when I thought of its power, as shown in the case <lb/>
            of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, men who were well born, <lb/>
            well educated, and began their political career with great <lb/>
            promise, and yet were ruined, not so much by an excessive <lb/>
            craving for popular applause as by a very pardonable fear <lb/>
            of disgrace. They both received at the outset great proofs <lb/>
            of their countrymen's good-will, but felt ashamed to remain <lb/>
            as it were in their debt, and they ever strove to wipe out <lb/>
            their obligations to the people by legislation on their behalf, <lb/>
            and by their beneficent measures continually increased <lb/>
            their popularity, until, in the heat of the rivalry thus <lb/>
            created, they found themselves pledged to a line of policy <lb/>
            in which they could not even pause with honour, and <lb/>
            which they could not desist from without disgrace. The <lb/>
            reader, however, will be able to form his own opinion <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            about them from their history, and I shall now write, as a <lb/>
            parallel to them, the lives of that pair of Laconian re­ <lb/>
            formers, Agis and Kleomenes, kings of Sparta, who, like <lb/>
            the Gracchi, increased the power of the people, and <lb/>
            endeavoured to restore an admirable and just constitution <lb/>
            which had fallen into desuetude; but who, like them, <lb/>
            incurred the hatred of the governing class, who were un­ <lb/>
            willing to relinquish their encroachments and privileges. <lb/>
            These Lacedæmonians were not indeed brothers, yet <lb/>
            they pursued a kindred policy, with the same objects in <lb/>
            view.</p>
          <p>III. After the desire for silver and gold had penetrated <lb/>
            into Sparta, the acquisition of wealth produced greed and <lb/>
            meanness, while the use and enjoyment of riches was <lb/>
            followed by luxury, effeminacy, and extravagance. Thus <lb/>
            it fell out that Sparta lost her high and honoured position <lb/>
            in Greece, and remained in obscurity and disgrace until the <lb/>
            reign of Agis and Leonida. Agis was of the Eurypontid <lb/>
            line, the son of Eudamidas, and the sixth in descent from <lb/>
            king Agesilaus, who invaded Asia, and became the most <lb/>
            powerful man in Greece. This Agesilaus had a son named <lb/>
            Archidamus, who fell in battle against the Messapians at <lb/>
            the battle of Mandurium* in Italy. He was succeeded by <lb/>
            his eldest son Agis, who, being killed by Antipater near <lb/>
            Megalopolis, and leaving no issue, was succeeded by his <lb/>
            brother, Eudamidas; he, by a son named Archidamus; <lb/>
            and Archidamus by another Eudamidas, the father of Agis, <lb/>
            the subject of this memoir.</p>
          <p>Leonidas, the son of Kleonymus, was of the other royal <lb/>
            family, that of the Agiadæ, and was eighth in descent from <lb/>
            Pausanias who conquered Mardonius at the battle of <lb/>
            Plataea. Pausanias had a son named Pleistoanax, whose <note type="footnote"> *More properly Mangyria. This battle was fought in August <lb/>
            B.C. 338, the same day as that of Chæronea. " Not long before the <lb/>
            battle of Chæronea, the Tarentines found themselves so hard pressed <lb/>
            the Messapians, that they sent to Sparta, their mother city, to entreat <lb/>
            assistance. The Spartan king, Archidamus, son of Agesilaus, perhaps <lb/>
            ashamed of the nullity of his country since the Sacred War, complied <lb/>
            with their prayer, and sailed at the head of a mercenary force to Italy. <lb/>
            How long his operations there lasted we do not know; but they ended <lb/>
            by his being defeated and killed, near the time of the battle of Chærones. <lb/>
            B.C. 338."—-Grote, ' History of Greece,' part ii. chap. xcvii. </note> <note type="footnote">B2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            son was again named Pausanias. This Pausanias * fled for <lb/>
            his life from Sparta to Tegea, and was succeeded by his <lb/>
            eldest son Agesipolis; and he, dying childless, by his <lb/>
            younger brother Kleombrotus. Kleombrotus left two sons, <lb/>
            Agesipolis and Kleomenes, of whom Agesipolis reigned <lb/>
            but a short time, and left no children. Kleomenes sun­ <lb/>
            ceeded his brother Agesipolis on the throne. Of his two <lb/>
            sons, the elder, Akrotatus, died during his fathers lifetime, <lb/>
            and the younger, Kleonymus, never reigned, as the throne <lb/>
            was occupied by Areus t the grandson of Kleomenes, and <lb/>
            the son of Akrotatus. Areus perished in battle before <lb/>
            Corinth, and was succeeded by his son Akrotatus. This <lb/>
            Akrotatus was defeated and slain near the city of Megalo­ <lb/>
            pulis by the despot Aristodemus, leaving his wife preg. <lb/>
            nant. When she bore a son, Leonidas the son of <lb/>
            Kleonymus was appointed his guardian, and, as the child <lb/>
            died before reaching manhood, he succeeded to the <lb/>
            throne although he was far from being an acceptable <lb/>
            personage to his countrymen; for, though the Spartans <lb/>
            at this period had all abandoned their original severe <lb/>
            simplicity of living, yet they found the manners of <lb/>
            Leonidas in offensive contrast to their own. Indeed, <lb/>
            Leonidas, who had spent much of his life at the courts <lb/>
            of Asiatic potentates, and had been especially attached <lb/>
            to that of Seleukus, seemed inclined to outrage the political <lb/>
            feeling of the Greeks by introducing the arrogant tone <lb/>
            of an Oriental despot into the constitutional monarchy <lb/>
            of Sparta.</p>
          <p>IV. On the other hand, the goodness of heart and in­ <lb/>
            tcllectual power of Agis proved so greatly superior not <lb/>
            only to that of Leonidas, but of every king since Agesilaus <lb/>
            the Great, that before he arrived at his twentieth year, <lb/>
            in spite of his having been brought up in the greatest <lb/>
            luxury by his mother Agesistrata and his grandmother <lb/>
            Archidamia, the two richest women in Sparta, he abjured <lb/>
            all frivolous indulgence, laid aside all personal ornament, <lb/>
            avoided extravagance of every kind, prided himself on <lb/>
            practising the old Laconian habits of dress, food, and <lb/>
            bathing, and was wont to say that he would not care to <note type="footnote"> * See vol. ii., Life of Lysander, chap. xxx. </note><note type="footnote"> t See vol. ii., Life of Pyrrhus, chap. XXVI. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            be king unless he could use his position to restore the <lb/>
            ancient customs and discipline of his country.</p>
          <p>V. The corruption of the Lacedæmonians began at <lb/>
            the time when, after having overthrown the Athenian <lb/>
            empire, they were able to satiate themselves with the <lb/>
            possession of gold and silver. Nevertheless, as the number <lb/>
            of houses instituted by Lykurgus was still maintained, <lb/>
            and each father still transmitted his estate to his son, the <lb/>
            original equal division of property continued to exist <lb/>
            and preserved the state from disorder. But a certain <lb/>
            powerful and self-willed man, named Epitadeus, who was <lb/>
            one of the Ephors, having quarrelled with his son, pro­ <lb/>
            posed a rhetra permitting a man to give his house and <lb/>
            land to whomsoever he pleased, either during his life, <lb/>
            or by his will after his death. This man proposed the <lb/>
            law in order to gratify his own private grudge; but the <lb/>
            other Spartans through covetousness eagerly confirmed it, <lb/>
            and ruined the admirable constitution of Lykurgus. <lb/>
            They now began to acquire land without limit, as the <lb/>
            powerful men kept their relatives out of their rightful <lb/>
            inheritance; and as the wealth of the country soon got <lb/>
            into the hands of a few, the city became impoverished, <lb/>
            and the rich began to be viewed with dislike and hatred. <lb/>
            There were left at that time no more than seven <lb/>
            hundred Spartans, and of these about one hundred pos­ <lb/>
            sessed an inheritance in land, while the rest, without <lb/>
            money, and excluded from all the privileges of citizenship, <lb/>
            fought in a languid and spiritless fashion in the wars, <lb/>
            and were ever on the watch for some oppotunity to subvert <lb/>
            the existing condition of affairs at home.</p>
          <p>VI. Agis, therefore, thinking that it would be an <lb/>
            honourable enterprise, as indeed it was, to restore these citi­ <lb/>
            zens to the state and to re-establish equality for all, began <lb/>
            to sound the people themselves as to their opinion about <lb/>
            such a measure. The younger men quickly rallied round <lb/>
            him, and, with an enthusiasm which he had hardly counted <lb/>
            upon, began to make ready for the contest; but most of <lb/>
            the elder men, who had become more thoroughly tainted <lb/>
            by the prevailing corruption, feared to be brought back <lb/>
            to the discipline of Lykurgus as much as a runaway <lb/>
            slave fears to be brought back to his master, and they <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            bitterly reviled Agis when he lamented over the con­ <lb/>
            dition of affairs and sighed for the ancient glories of <lb/>
            Sparta. His enthusiastic aspirations, however, were <lb/>
            sympathised with by Lysander the son of Libys, Man­ <lb/>
            drokleidas the son of Ekphanes, and Agesilaus. Lysander <lb/>
            was the most influential of all the Spartans, while <lb/>
            Mandrokleidas was thought to be the ablest politician in <lb/>
            Greece, as he could both plot with subtlety and execute <lb/>
            with boldness. Agesilaus was the uncle of King Agis and <lb/>
            a fluent speaker, but of a weak and covetous disposition. <lb/>
            It was commonly supposed that he was stirred to action <lb/>
            by the influence of his son Hippomedon, who had gained <lb/>
            great glory in the wars and was exceedingly popular <lb/>
            among the younger citizens; but what really determined <lb/>
            him to join the reformers was the amount of his debts, <lb/>
            which he hoped would be wiped out by a revolution. <lb/>
            As soon as Agis had won over this important adherent, he <lb/>
            began to try to bring over his mother to his views, who <lb/>
            was Agesilaus's sister, and who, from the number of her <lb/>
            friends, debtors, and dependants, was very powerful in <lb/>
            the state, and took a large share in the management of <lb/>
            public affairs.</p>
          <p>VII. When she first heard of Agis's designs she was <lb/>
            much startled, and dissuaded the youth from an enterprise <lb/>
            which she thought neither practicable nor desirable. <lb/>
            However, when Agesilaus pointed out to her what a notable <lb/>
            design it was, and how greatly to the advantage of all, <lb/>
            while the young king himself besought his mother to <lb/>
            part with her wealth in order to gain him glory, <lb/>
            arguing that he could not vie with other kings in riches, <lb/>
            as the servants of Persian satraps, and the very slaves of <lb/>
            the intendants of Ptolemy and Seleukus possessed more <lb/>
            money than all the kings that ever reigned in Sparta; <lb/>
            but that, if he could prove himself superior to those <lb/>
            vanities by his temperance, simplicity of life, and true <lb/>
            greatness of mind, and could succeed in restoring equality <lb/>
            among his follow-countrymen, he would be honoured and <lb/>
            renowned as a truly great king. By this means the <lb/>
            youth entirely changed his mother's mind, and so fired <lb/>
            her with his own ambition, as if by an inspiration from <lb/>
            heaven, that she began to encourage Agis and urge him <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            on, and invited her friends to join them, while she also <lb/>
            communicated their design to the other women, because <lb/>
            she knew that the Lacedæmonians were in all things <lb/>
            ruled by their women, and that they had more power <lb/>
            in the state than the men possessed in their private house- <lb/>
            holds. Most of the wealth of Lacedæmon had fallen into <lb/>
            female hands at this time, and this fact proved a great hind­ <lb/>
            rance to the accomplishment of Agis's schemes of reform; <lb/>
            for the women offered a vehement opposition to him, net <lb/>
            merely through a vulgar love for their idolised luxury, but <lb/>
            also because they saw that they would lose all the influence <lb/>
            and power which they derived from their wealth. They <lb/>
            betook themselves to Leonidas, and besought him, as being <lb/>
            the elder man, to restrain Agis, and check the development <lb/>
            of his designs. Leonidas was willing enough to assist <lb/>
            the richer class, but he feared the people, who were eager <lb/>
            for reform, and would not openly oppose Agis, although <lb/>
            he endeavoured secretly to ruin his scheme, and to prejudice <lb/>
            the Ephors against him, by imputing to him the design <lb/>
            of hiring the poor to make him despot with the plunder of <lb/>
            the rich, and insinuating that by his redistribution of lands <lb/>
            and remission of debts he meant to obtain more adherents <lb/>
            for himself instead of more citizens for Sparta.</p>
          <p>VIII. In spite of all this, Agis contrived to get Lysan­ <lb/>
            der appointed one of the Ephors, and immediately brought <lb/>
            him to propose a rhetra before the Gerusia, or Senate, the <lb/>
            main points of which were that all debts should be cancelled; <lb/>
            that the land- should be divided, that between the valley <lb/>
            of Pellene and Mount Taygetus, Matea, and Sellasia into <lb/>
            four thousand five hundred lots, and the outlying <lb/>
            districts into fifteen thousand: that the latter district <lb/>
            should be distributed among the Periœki of military age, <lb/>
            and the former among the pure Spartans: that the number <lb/>
            of these should be made up by an extension of the <lb/>
            franchise to Periœki or even foreigners of free birth, <lb/>
            liberal education, and fitting personal qualifications : and <lb/>
            that these citizens should be divided into fifteen companies <lb/>
            some of four hundred, and some of two hundred, for the <lb/>
            public meals, and should conform in every respect to the <lb/>
            discipline of their forefathers. <note type="footnote"> * See voL i, Life of Lykurgus, chap. viii. </note></p><pb n="8"/>
            
          <p>IX. When this rhetra was proposed, as the Senate <lb/>
            could not agree whether it should become law, Lysander <lb/>
            convoked a popular assembly and himself addressed the <lb/>
            people. Mandrokleidas and Agesilaus also besought them <lb/>
            not to allow a few selfish voluptuaries to destroy the <lb/>
            glorious name of Sparta, but to remember the ancient <lb/>
            oracles, warning them against the sin of covetousness, <lb/>
            which would prove the ruin of Sparta, and also of the <lb/>
            responses which they had recently received from the <lb/>
            oracle of Pasiphae. The temple and oracle of Pasiphæ <lb/>
            at Thalamae was of peculiar sanctity. Pasiphae is said by <lb/>
            some writers to have been one of the daughters of Atlas, <lb/>
            and to have become the mother of Ammon by Zeus, while <lb/>
            others say that Kassandra the daughter of Priam died there, <lb/>
            and was called Pasiphae because her prophecies were plain <lb/>
            to all men. Phylarchus again tells us that Daphne the <lb/>
            daughter of Amyklas, while endeavouring to escape from <lb/>
            the violence of Apollo, was transformed into the laurel, • <lb/>
            which bears her name, and was honoured by the god and <lb/>
            endowed by him with the gift of prophecy. Be this as it <lb/>
            may, the oracular responses which were brought from <lb/>
            this shrine bade the Spartans all become equal according <lb/>
            as Lykurgus had originally ordained. After these speeches <lb/>
            had been delivered, King Agis himself came forward, and, <lb/>
            after a few introductory words, said that he was giving <lb/>
            the strongest possible pledges of his loyalty to the new <lb/>
            constitution; for he declared his intention of surrendering <lb/>
            to the state, before any one else, his own property, <lb/>
            consisting of a vast extent of land, both arable and <lb/>
            pasture, besides six thousand talents of money; and he <lb/>
            assured the people that his mother and her friends, the <lb/>
            richest people in Sparta, would do the same.</p>
          <p>X. The people were astounded at the magnanimity of <lb/>
            the youth, and were filled with joy, thinking that at last, <lb/>
            after an interval of three hundred years, there had appeared <lb/>
            a king worthy of Sparta. Lesnidas, on the other hand, <lb/>
            opposed him as vigorously as he could, reflecting that he <lb/>
            would be forced to follow his example, and divest himself <lb/>
            of all his property, and that Agis, not he, would get the <lb/>
            credit of the act. He therefore inquired of Agis whether <note type="footnote">* CL note, vol. ii. Life of Luculius chap. xxxvi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            he thought Lykurgus to have been a just and well-meaning <lb/>
            man. Receiving an affirmative reply, he again demanded, <lb/>
            " Where, then, do we find that Lykurgus approved of the <lb/>
            cancelling of debts, or of the admission of foreigners to <lb/>
            the franchise, seeing that he did not think that the state <lb/>
            could prosper without a periodical expulsion of foreigners ?" <lb/>
            To this Agis answered, that it was not to be wondered at <lb/>
            if Leonidas, who had lived in a foreign country, and had <lb/>
            a family by the daughter of a Persian satrap, should be <lb/>
            ignorant that Lykurgus, together with coined money, had <lb/>
            banished borrowing and lending from Sparta, and that he <lb/>
            had no hatred for foreigners, but only for those whose <lb/>
            profession and mode of life made them unfit to associate <lb/>
            with his countrymen. These men Lykurgus expelled, not <lb/>
            from any hatred of their persons, but because he feared <lb/>
            that their manners and habits would infect the citizens <lb/>
            with a love of luxury, effeminacy, and avarice. Terpander, <lb/>
            Thales, and Pherekydes were all foreigners, but, since they <lb/>
            sang and taught what Lykurgus approved, they lived in <lb/>
            Sparta, and were treated with especial honour. " Do you," <lb/>
            asked he, " praise Ekprepus, who when Ephor cut off with <lb/>
            a hatchet the two additional strings which Phrynis the <lb/>
            musician had added to the original seven strings of the lyre, <lb/>
            and those who cut the same strings off the harp of Timo­ <lb/>
            theus, and yet do you blame us when we are endeavouring <lb/>
            to get rid of luxury, extravagance, and frivolity, just as if <lb/>
            those great men did not merely mean thereby to guard <lb/>
            against vain refinements of music, which would lead to <lb/>
            the introduction of extravagant and licentious manners, <lb/>
            and cause the city to be at discord and variance with <lb/>
            itself?"</p>
          <p>XI. After this the people espoused the cause of Agis, <lb/>
            while the rich begged Leonidas not to desert them, and <lb/>
            by their entreaties prevailed upon the senators, who had <lb/>
            the power of originating all laws, to throw out the rhetra <lb/>
            by a majority of only one vote. Lysander, who was still <lb/>
            one of the Ephors, now proceeded to attack Leonidas, by <lb/>
            means of a certain ancient law, which forbade any de­ <lb/>
            scendant of Herakles to beget children by a foreign wife, <lb/>
            and which bade the Spartans put to death any citizen <lb/>
            who left his country to dwell in a foreign land. Ho <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            instructed his adherents to revive the memory of this law, <lb/>
            and threaten Leonidas with its penalties, while he himself <lb/>
            with the other Ephors watched fur the sign from heaven. <lb/>
            This ceremony is conducted as follows:—Every ninth year <lb/>
            the Ephors choose a clear moonless night, and sit in silence <lb/>
            watching the heavens. If a star shoots across the sky, <lb/>
            they conclude that the kings must have committed some <lb/>
            act of impiety, and they suspend them from their office, <lb/>
            until they were absolved by a favourable oracle from <lb/>
            Delphi or Olympia. Lysander now declared that he had <lb/>
            beheld this sign, and impeached Leonidas, bringing for­ <lb/>
            ward witnesses to prove that he had two children born to <lb/>
            him by an Asiatic wife, the daughter of one of the lieu­ <lb/>
            tenants of Seleukus, and that having quarrelled with his <lb/>
            wife and become hated by her he had unexpectedly returned <lb/>
            home, and in default of a direct heir, had succeeded to the <lb/>
            throne. At the same time Lysander urged Kleombrotus, <lb/>
            the son-in-law of Leonidas, who was also of the royal <lb/>
            family, to claim the throne for himself. Leonidas, terrified <lb/>
            at this, took sanctuary in the temple of Athena of the <lb/>
            Brazen House, and was joined there by his daughter, <lb/>
            who left her husband Kleombrotus. When the trial <lb/>
            came on, Leonidas did not appear in court, he was re­ <lb/>
            moved from the throne, and Kleombrotus was appointed <lb/>
            in his stead.</p>
          <p>XII. At this crisis Lysander was forced to lay down his <lb/>
            office, as the year for which he had been elected had <lb/>
            expired. The Ephors at once took Leonidas under their <lb/>
            protection, restored him to the throne, and impeached <lb/>
            Lysander and Mandrokleidas as the authors of illegal <lb/>
            measures in the cancelling of debts and the redistribution <lb/>
            of the land. As these men were now in danger of their <lb/>
            lives, they prevailed upon the two kings to act together <lb/>
            and overrule the decision of the Ephors; for this, they <lb/>
            declared, was the ancient rule of the constitution, that if <lb/>
            the kings were at variance, the Ephois were entitled to <lb/>
            support the one whom they judged to be in the right <lb/>
            against the other, but their function was merely to act as <lb/>
            arbitrators and judges between the kings when they dis­ <lb/>
            agreed, and not to interfere with them when they were of <lb/>
            one mind. Both the kings agreed to act upon this advice, <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            and came with theis friends into the assembly, turned the <lb/>
            Ephors out of their chairs of office, and elected others in <lb/>
            their room, one of whom was Agesilaus. They now armed <lb/>
            many of the younger citizens, released the prisoners, <lb/>
            and terrified their opponents by threatening a general <lb/>
            massacre. No one, however, was killed by them; for <lb/>
            although Agesilaus desired to kill Leonidas, and when he <lb/>
            withdrew from Sparta to Tegea, sent men to waylay and <lb/>
            murder him on the road, Agis, hearing of his intention, <lb/>
            sent others on whom he could rely, who escorted Leonidas <lb/>
            safely as far as Tegea.</p>
          <p>XIII. Thus far all had gone well, and no one remained <lb/>
            to hinder the accomplishment of the reforms; but now <lb/>
            Agesilaus alone upset and ruined the whole of this noble <lb/>
            and truly Spartan scheme by his detestable vice of covet­ <lb/>
            ousness. He possessed a large quantity of the best land <lb/>
            in the country, and also owed a great sum of money, and <lb/>
            as he desired neither to pay his debts nor to part with his <lb/>
            land, he persuaded Agis that it would be too revolutionary <lb/>
            a proci eding to carry both measures at once, and that, if <lb/>
            the moneyed class were first propitiated by the cancelling <lb/>
            of debts, they would afterwards be inclined to submit <lb/>
            quietly to the redistribution of lands. Lysander and the <lb/>
            rest were deceived by Agesilaus into consenting to this, <lb/>
            and they brought all the written securities for money <lb/>
            which had been given by debtors, which are called by <lb/>
            them klaria, into the market-place, collected them into one <lb/>
            heap, and burned them. As the flames rose up, the rich <lb/>
            and those who had lent money went away in great distress, <lb/>
            but Agesilaus, as if exulting at their misfortune, declared <lb/>
            that he had never seen a brighter blaze or a purer fire. <lb/>
            As the people at once demanded the division of the land, <lb/>
            and called upon the kings to distribute it among them, <lb/>
            Agesilaus put them off with various excuses, and managed <lb/>
            to spin out the time till Agis was sent out of the country <lb/>
            on military service, as the Achæans, who were allies, had <lb/>
            demanded a reinforcement from Sparta, because the Æto­ <lb/>
            lians threatened to invade Peloponnesus through the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Megara, and Aratus, the general of the Achæans, <lb/>
            who was collecting an army to resist them, sent to Sparts. <lb/>
            demanding assistance.</p><pb n="12"/>
            
          <p>XIV. The Spartans at once despatched Agis at the head <lb/>
            of an army, whose high spirits and devotion to his person <lb/>
            filled him with delight. The men were nearly all young <lb/>
            and poor; and as they were now relieved from the pressure <lb/>
            of their debts, and expected that on their return the land <lb/>
            would be distributed amongst them, they behaved with <lb/>
            the most admirable discipline. They marched through <lb/>
            Peloponnesus without doing the least damage, without <lb/>
            offending any one, almost without noise; so that all the <lb/>
            cities were astonished at the spectacle thus afforded them, <lb/>
            and men began to wonder what a Lacedæmonian army <lb/>
            must have been like when led by Agesilaus or Lysander <lb/>
            the Great, or by the ancient hero Leonidas, if such awe <lb/>
            and reverence was paid by the soldiers to one who was <lb/>
            nearly the youngest of them all. Their youthful leader <lb/>
            himself was worthy of admiration, and was looked up to <lb/>
            by the men because of his simple hard-working habits, <lb/>
            and the pride which he took in wearing the same dress <lb/>
            and using the same arms as the common soldiers. The <lb/>
            revolution which he had effected, however, was very dis­ <lb/>
            tasteful to the rich, who feared lest it might be taken <lb/>
            as an example by the people in other states and lead to <lb/>
            further disturbances.</p>
          <p>XV. Agis joined Aratus at Corinth, while the question <lb/>
            of how to repel the invasion was still being debated. His <lb/>
            advice was spirited, without being rash or foolhardy. He <lb/>
            gave it as his opinion that it was their duty to fight, and <lb/>
            not abandon the gate of Peloponnesus and let the enemy <lb/>
            into the country, but that he would defer to the decision <lb/>
            of Aratus, who was an older man than himself, and was <lb/>
            the general of the Achæans, and that he had not come to <lb/>
            give them advice or to take the command of them, but to <lb/>
            reinforce them and serve as their ally. The historian <lb/>
            Baton of Sinope declares that Agis declined to fight although <lb/>
            Aratus wished him to do so; but he is mistaken, and clearly <lb/>
            has not read the justification which Aratus has written of <lb/>
            his conduct, namely, that as the farmers had nearly all <lb/>
            finished gathering in their harvest, he thought it better <lb/>
            to allow the enemy to enter the country than to hazard <lb/>
            everything upon the issue of a single battle. As Aratus <lb/>
            decided not to fight, and dismissed his allies with thanks, <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            Agis returned heme, greatly honoured by those under his <lb/>
            orders, and found the internal affairs of Sparta in great <lb/>
            turmoil and confusion.</p>
          <p>XVI. Agesilaus, who was now Ephor, and who was no <lb/>
            longer restrained by the presence of those of whom he had <lb/>
            formerly stood in awe, was using the most disgraceful <lb/>
            expedients to extort money from the people, and had even <lb/>
            intercalated a thirteenth month in the year, although the <lb/>
            state of the calendar did not require it, and caused taxes <lb/>
            to be paid for it. As he feared those whom he had wronged, <lb/>
            and was an object of universal hatred, he had taken a <lb/>
            body-guard of swordsmen into his pay, and walked through <lb/>
            the city accompanied by them. As for the kings, he re­ <lb/>
            garded Kleombrotus with contempt, and though he still <lb/>
            paid some respect to Agis, he wished it to be thought that <lb/>
            he did so because he was nearly related to himself, not <lb/>
            because he was king. He also gave out that he intended <lb/>
            to remain in office as Ephor for the next year as well. <lb/>
            In consequence of this his enemies determined to bring <lb/>
            matters to a crisis. They assembled in force, brought <lb/>
            back Leonidas publicly from Tegea, and reinstated him <lb/>
            as king, to the great joy of most of the citizens, who were <lb/>
            angry with the other party because they had been deceived <lb/>
            by them about the redistribution of the land. Agesilaus <lb/>
            was able to leave the country in safety, owing to the <lb/>
            intercession of his son Hippomedon, who was very popular <lb/>
            with all classes on account of his bravery. Of the two <lb/>
            kings, Agis fled to the temple of Athena of the Brazen <lb/>
            House, while Kleombrotus took sanctuary in the temple of <lb/>
            Poseidon.* It appeared that Leonidas hated Kleombrotus <lb/>
            most of the two; for he passed by Agis, but marched in <lb/>
            pursuit of Kleombrotus with an armed force, and angrily <lb/>
            reproached him that being his own son-in-law he had <lb/>
            conspired against him, dethroned him, and driven him <lb/>
            into exile.</p>
          <p>XVII. Kleombrotus could find nothing to say in his <lb/>
            defence, and sat silent and helpless; but Chilonis, the <lb/>
            daughter of Leonidas, who formerly had taken offence at <lb/>
            her father's injurious treatment, and when Kleombrotus <note type="footnote"> *Probably the celebrated temple of Foseidon at Tænarus. [Cape <lb/>
            Matapan.] </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            usurped the throne had left him, and showed her sym­ <lb/>
            pathy with Leonidas in his misfortune by accompanying <lb/>
            him in the temple where he took sanctuary, and after he <lb/>
            left the country by mourning for him and remaining at <lb/>
            variance with her husband Kleombrotus, now changed <lb/>
            aides with his changing fortunes, and appeared sitting by <lb/>
            her husband's side as a suppliant to the god with him, <lb/>
            with her arms cast round him, and her two children on <lb/>
            each side of her. All stood amazed and were moved to <lb/>
            tears by her noble and affectionate conduct, and she, <lb/>
            pointing to her mean dress and dishevelled hair, said, <lb/>
            " Father, I have not adopted this posture and this dress <lb/>
            out of pity for Kleombrotus, but I have so long been in <lb/>
            mourning for your misfortunes and your banishment that <lb/>
            it has become customary with me. Am I now to remain <lb/>
            in mourning while you are victorious and reign in Sparta, <lb/>
            or am I to dress myself in fine clothes as becomes a prin­ <lb/>
            cess, while I see my husband murdered by your hand? <lb/>
            Unless he can move you to compassion, and obtain your <lb/>
            pity by the tears of his wife and children, he will suffer a <lb/>
            more terrible penalty for his misconduct than you wish to <lb/>
            impose, by seeing me his dearest wife die before him ; for <lb/>
            how can I endure to live among other women, if I prove <lb/>
            unable to move either my husband or my father to com­ <lb/>
            passion ? Both as a wife and as a daughter I have been <lb/>
            fated to suffer with my own kin and to be despised with <lb/>
            them. If there is anything which can be urged on behalf <lb/>
            of my husband's conduct, I have made it impossible to <lb/>
            plead it for him by the part which I have taken in pro­ <lb/>
            testing against his conduct to you; but you yourself sug­ <lb/>
            gest a sufficient apology for his crime, by showing that <lb/>
            you think royalty so great and precious a thing, that to <lb/>
            obtain it you are willing to murder your son-in-law and <lb/>
            neglect your own child."</p>
          <p>XVIII. Chilonis, after speaking thus, nestled her face <lb/>
            against that of her husband, and glanced round at the <lb/>
            spectators with red and tearful eyes. Leonidas, after a <lb/>
            short consultation with his friends, bade Kleombrotus rise <lb/>
            and leave the country, but besought his daughter to remain <lb/>
            with him, and not to leave him who loved her so dearly, <lb/>
            and had just spared her husband's life in consequence of <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            her entreaties. He could not, however, prevail upon her <lb/>
            to stay, but she rose up with her husband, took one child <lb/>
            in her arms, and led the other, and so, after kneeling <lb/>
            before the altar, followed her husband, who, if his mind <lb/>
            was not entirely corrupted by vain ambition, must have <lb/>
            thought exile with such a wife preferable to royalty. <lb/>
            After driving Kleombrotus from the throne, ejecting the <lb/>
            Ephors from office and substituting others chosen by <lb/>
            himself, Leonidas addressed himself to Agis. At first he <lb/>
            tried to persuade him to come out of sanctuary and reign <lb/>
            as his colleague, saying that the citizens had forgiven <lb/>
            him, because they knew that he was young and impe­ <lb/>
            tuous, and had been deceived by Agesilaus. However, as <lb/>
            Agis saw through these devices and remained where he <lb/>
            was, Leonidas left off making these hypocritical offers. <lb/>
            Amphares, Damochares, and Arkesilaus were in the habit <lb/>
            of going to the temple and conversing with him; and once <lb/>
            he came out of the temple in their company to take a <lb/>
            bath, and after bathing was conducted back again by <lb/>
            them in safety. All three were on intimate terms <lb/>
            with him, but Amphares, who had lately borrowed <lb/>
            some rich clothing and valuable plate from Agesistrata, <lb/>
            was inclined to plot against the king and the royal <lb/>
            ladies, that he might not be obliged to restore them. <lb/>
            He, therefore, we are told, lent a ready ear to Leonidas's <lb/>
            plans, and excited the zeal of the Ephors, one of whom <lb/>
            he was.</p>
          <p>XIX. Since Agis lived entirely in the temple, and only <lb/>
            left it in order to bathe, they determined to seize him <lb/>
            when he came out for this purpose. Having one day <lb/>
            watched him bathing they came up and greeted him in a <lb/>
            friendly way, and walked along with him talking and <lb/>
            jesting as young men who are on intimate terms are wont <lb/>
            to do. When they reached the place where a road <lb/>
            branches off to the public prison, Amphares, in virtue of <lb/>
            his Ephorship, laid hold of Agis and said : " Agis, I must <lb/>
            lead you before the Ephors to give an account of your <lb/>
            conduct." At the same time Damochares, a tall and strong <lb/>
            man, threw his cloak round Agis's neck and dragged him <lb/>
            along by it. Others now appeared by previous arrange­ <lb/>
            went, and pushed him from behind, and as no one came to <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            nelp him, he was forced into the prison. Hereupon, <lb/>
            Leonidas appeared with a band of mercenaries, and sur­ <lb/>
            rounded the prison. The Ephors now went in to Agis, <lb/>
            and sent for all the senators of their way of thinking to <lb/>
            come to the prison in order to go through the form of a <lb/>
            trial. Agis laughed at their hypocrisy, but Amphares <lb/>
            told him that it was no laughing matter, and that he <lb/>
            would soon pay a bitter penalty for his rashness. <lb/>
            Another of the Ephors, wishing to offer a means of escape <lb/>
            to Agis, inquired of him whether he had acted on his own <lb/>
            responsibility, or had been compelled to do so by Agesilaus <lb/>
            and Lysander. Agis answered that no man had compelled <lb/>
            him, but that he admired and imitated Lykurgus, and had <lb/>
            aimed at reviving his institutions. Upon this the same <lb/>
            Ephor asked him whether he repented of what he had <lb/>
            done. When the brave youth answered that he never <lb/>
            would repent of his glorious designs, whatever tortures he <lb/>
            might have to suffer for them, the assembly at once con­ <lb/>
            demned him to death, and bade the prison officials at once <lb/>
            remove him to the place called Dec has, which is a part <lb/>
            of the prison in which criminals are strangled. Seeing <lb/>
            that the servants would not lay hands upon Agis, and <lb/>
            that even those mercenaries who were present shrunk <lb/>
            from such work, because it was held to be unlawful and <lb/>
            impious to lay hands upon the person of the king, Damo­ <lb/>
            chares, after threatening and abusing them, dragged Agis <lb/>
            with his own hands to the place of execution. Many of <lb/>
            the citizens had by this time heard of his arrest, and <lb/>
            many men had assembled with torches in their hands and <lb/>
            were clamouring at the gate of the prison. The mother <lb/>
            and grandmother of Agis were also present, and loudly <lb/>
            demanded that the king of Sparta should have a fair <lb/>
            trial in the presence of his countrymen. For this reason <lb/>
            they within hurried on the execution, as they feared that <lb/>
            if a larger crowd collected Agis would be rescued during <lb/>
            the night.</p>
          <p>XX. While Agis was being led to execution, he saw <lb/>
            one of the servants of the prison weeping and in great <lb/>
            distress. " My man," said he, " do not weep for me, for I <lb/>
            am a better man than those who are murdering me in <lb/>
            this cruel and illegal fashion." With these words he, of <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            his own accord, put the noose round his neck. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Amphares proceeded to the prison gate. Here Agesis­ <lb/>
            trata fell at his feet, believing him still to be her friend. <lb/>
            Amphares raised her, saying that Agis would suffer no <lb/>
            violent treatment, and bade her, if she wished, go in and <lb/>
            see her SOIL. As she asked to be accompanied by her <lb/>
            mother, Amphares said that there was no objection to that, <lb/>
            and after receiving them both within the walls, ordered <lb/>
            the prison gates to be closed. He first sent Archidamia, <lb/>
            who was now very old, and greatly respected by her <lb/>
            country women, to the place of execution, and when she <lb/>
            was dead, bade Agesi strata enter. When she saw the <lb/>
            corpse of her son lying on the ground, and her mother <lb/>
            banging by a halter, she herself assisted the servants to <lb/>
            take her down, laid her body beside that of Agis, and <lb/>
            arranged and covered up the two corpses. She then <lb/>
            knelt and kissed the face of her son, saying, " My child, <lb/>
            thy great piety, goodness, and clemency has brought <lb/>
            thee and us to this death." Upon this Amphares, who <lb/>
            was watching and listening at the door, came into the <lb/>
            room, and said angrily to Agesistrata, " If you approve <lb/>
            of your son's deeds, you shall suffer with him." At these <lb/>
            words Agesistrata rose and offered her neck to the halter, <lb/>
            saving, "I only pray that this may be for the good of <lb/>
            Sparta."</p>
          <p>XXI. When the sad news was known throughout the <lb/>
            city, and the three corpses brought out of the prison, the <lb/>
            terror which was inspired did not prevent the citizens <lb/>
            from manifesting their sorrow at the deed, and their <lb/>
            hatred of Leonidas and Amphares. No such wicked or <lb/>
            cruel deed, they declared, had been committed in Sparta <lb/>
            since the Dorians settled in Peloponnesus. The very <lb/>
            enemies of the Lacedæmonians generally seemed unwilling <lb/>
            to lay violent hands on their kings when they met them <lb/>
            in battle, and turned aside through reverence of their <lb/>
            exalted position. For this reason, in all the battles which <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians had fought against the Greeks before <lb/>
            the era of Philip of Macedon, only one king, Kleombrotus, <lb/>
            had fallen on the field of Leuktra; for though the <lb/>
            Messenians aver that Theopompus, a king of Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            was slain by Aristomenes, the Lacedæmonians deny it, <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            and say that he was only wounded. This matter is <lb/>
            doubtful, but Agis was the first king who was put to <lb/>
            death by the Ephors in Lacedæmon, because he had con­ <lb/>
            ceived a noble design and one which was worthy of <lb/>
            Sparta. He was of an age when men's shortcomings <lb/>
            deserve to be pardoned; and deserves to be blamed by his <lb/>
            friends more than by his enemies, because with an ill- <lb/>
            judged clemency he spared the life of Leonidas, and <lb/>
            trusted in the professions of the rest of his political <lb/>
            enemies</p><pb n="19"/>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF KLEOMENES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. AFTER the death of Agis, as has been related, Leonida. <lb/>
            was not able to seize the person of his brother Archidamus, <lb/>
            who at once fled out of the country, but he brought the <lb/>
            wife of Agis with her newly-born child out of her house, <lb/>
            and forcibly married her to his own son Kleomenes, who <lb/>
            was scarcely come to an age for marriage, because he was <lb/>
            unwilling for her to marry any one else. Indeed Agiatis <lb/>
            was the daughter of Gylippus, and heiress to a great <lb/>
            estate. She was thought to be the most beautiful woman <lb/>
            of her time in all Greece, and was of a noble disposition. <lb/>
            It is said that she made many entreaties not to be forced <lb/>
            into a second marriage, but that after her union with <lb/>
            Kleomenes, although she continued to hate his father <lb/>
            Leonidas, she made a good and affectionate wife to the <lb/>
            young man, who became passionately fond of her, and <lb/>
            sympathised with her loving remembrance of Agis, so <lb/>
            that he would often ask her to tell him about her late <lb/>
            husband, and used to listen with rapt attention while <lb/>
            she explained the designs and projects of Agis. For <lb/>
            Kleomenes was as eager for honour, and had as noble a <lb/>
            mind as Agis himself, and was equally moderate and <lb/>
            simple in his way of life; but he lacked the other'is <lb/>
            discreet and gentle temper, and was of a stirring and <lb/>
            vehement nature, eager to embark on any honourable <lb/>
            enterprise. He thought it the most glorious position of <lb/>
            all to rule over an obedient people; but he took pride also <lb/>
            in bending disobedient subjects to his will, and forcibly <lb/>
            compelling them to move in the path of honour.</p>
          <p>II. He was far from satisfied with the state of things <lb/>
            at Sparta, where the citizens had given themselves up to <lb/>
            luxuric us repose, while the king Leonidas cared nothing <note type="footnote">c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            for public affairs, so long as he was able to gratify his own <lb/>
            love of extravagance and self-indulgence. Public virtue <lb/>
            was entirely gone, and no man cared to profit his country, <lb/>
            but only himself. As for discipline, orderly training of <lb/>
            the young, hardiness of body, and equality, all these <lb/>
            things had perished with Agis, and it was not safe even <lb/>
            to speak of them. We are told that while yet a lad <lb/>
            Kleomenes was instructed in the principles of the Stoic <lb/>
            philosophy by Sphærus of Borysthenes,* who visited <lb/>
            Lacedæmon and gave excellent instruction there to the <lb/>
            young. This Sphærus was one of the aptest pupils of <lb/>
            Zono of Kitium,t and he seems to have admired the <lb/>
            manly spirit of Kleomenes and to have encouraged him in <lb/>
            the pursuit of honour. The ancient hero Leonidas, when <lb/>
            asked what he thought of Tyrtaeus, is said to have <lb/>
            answered, "He is good at exciting the minds of the <lb/>
            youth." Indeed they became filled with enthusiasm by <lb/>
            the poems of Tyrtæus, and fought with reckless daring <lb/>
            in battle: and so also the Stoic philosophy often renders <lb/>
            brave and fiery natures over-daring and venturesome, and <lb/>
            yields the best fruit when applied to a grave and gentle <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>III. When after the death of Leonidas, Kleomenes <lb/>
            succeeded to the throne, he found the state utterly dis­ <lb/>
            organised, for the rich took no part in politics, and cared <lb/>
            for nothing but their own pleasure and profit, while the <lb/>
            miserable condition of the poor caused them to fight <lb/>
            without spirit in the wars, and to neglect the proper <lb/>
            training of their children. He himself was a king only <lb/>
            in name, as the Ephors had engrossed all real power. <lb/>
            Under these circumstances he at once began to revolve <lb/>
            schemes of reform in his mind, and began to sound the <lb/>
            opinion of his intimate friend Xenares, by enquiring of <lb/>
            him what sort of a king Agis had been, and in what <lb/>
            manner, and with what associates he had made his <lb/>
            attempts at reform. Xenares at first very willingly gave <note type="footnote">* Borysthenes, also called Olbia, Olbiopolis, and Miletopolis, was a <lb/>
            town situated at the junction of the Borysthenes and Hypanis, pear <lb/>

            him a complete narrative of the whole transaction; but <lb/>
            as he saw that Kleomenes listened with intense interest, <lb/>
            and was deeply excited by the recital of Agis's designs, <lb/>
            to which he was never weary of listening, Xenares at last <lb/>
            angrily reproached him with not being in his right mind, <lb/>
            and at last broke off all intercourse with him. He did <lb/>
            not, however, tell any one the reason of their being at <lb/>
            variance, but declared that Kleomenes knew well what it <lb/>
            was. Kleomenes, after meeting with this rebuff from <lb/>
            Xenares, imagining that every one else would be of the <lb/>
            same mind, determined to concert his own measures <lb/>
            alone. As he thought that there was more chance of <lb/>
            effecting reforms during war than in time of peace, he <lb/>
            involved Sparta in a war with the Achæans, for which <lb/>
            they themselves furnished the pretext. Aratus, the chief <lb/>
            of the Achæans, had always desired to unite the whole of <lb/>
            the Peloponnesus in one confederacy, and in all his long <lb/>
            political career had steadily kept this object in view, as <lb/>
            he thought that thus, and thus alone, the people of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus would be able to defend themselves against <lb/>
            external foes. Nearly all the tribes of Peloponnesus <lb/>
            joined his confederacy except the Lacedæmonians, the <lb/>
            people of Elis, and such of the Arcadians as were under <lb/>
            J acedæmonian influence. On the death of Leonidas, <lb/>
            Aratus began to make plundering expeditions into the <lb/>
            territory of the Arcadians, especially those near the <lb/>
            Achæan frontier, in order to see what steps the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians would take; for he despised Kleomenes as a <lb/>
            young and inexperienced man.</p>
          <p>IV. Upon this the Ephors first sent Kleomenes to <lb/>
            occupy the temple of Athena, near Belbina. This place <lb/>
            was situated in a mountain pass leading into Laconia, <lb/>
            and it was claimed by the citizens of Megalopolis as be­ <lb/>
            longing to their territory. Kleomenes seized the pass <lb/>
            and fortified it, to which Aratus offered no objection, but <lb/>
            endeavoured by a night march to surprise the cities of <lb/>
            Tegea and Orchomenes. However, the hearts of the <lb/>
            traitors within the walls failed them, and so Aratus led <lb/>
            his army back, hoping that his object had not been dis­ <lb/>
            covered. Kleomenes, by way of jest, now wrote him a <lb/>
            letter affecting to enquire of him in the most friendly <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            terms where he had been to in the night. He answered <lb/>
            that he had heard that Kleomenes was about to erect <lb/>
            fortifications at Belbina, and had marched to prevent his <lb/>
            doing so. To this Kleomenes answered that he was satis­ <lb/>
            fled that this had been Aratus's intention. " But," he <lb/>
            continued, " if you do not mind, please tell me why you <lb/>
            brought scaling ladders and torches with you." Aratus <lb/>
            laughed at this home-thrust, and enquired what sort of a <lb/>
            youth Kleomenes might be. Damochares, the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nian exile, answered, " If you mean to do anything against <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, you must make haste and do it before <lb/>
            this young gamecock's spurs are grown." After this the <lb/>
            Ephors ordered Kleomenes, who was encamped in Arcadia <lb/>
            with a few horsemen and three hundred foot, to retire, <lb/>
            as they feared to go to war. But since, as soon as he had <lb/>
            withdrawn, Aratus captured the city of Kaphyæ, they <lb/>
            sent him back again. He captured Methydrium, and <lb/>
            overran Argolis, upon which the Achaeans sent an army <lb/>
            of twenty thousand foot and a thousand horse, under the <lb/>
            command of Aristomachus, to attack him. Kleomenes <lb/>
            met them near Pallantium, and was eager to fight, but <lb/>
            Aratus, alarmed at his daring, would not permit the <lb/>
            Achæan general to fight, and drew off his forces, incurring <lb/>
            thereby the anger of the Achæans, and the ridicule and <lb/>
            contempt of the Lacedæmonians, who only amounted to <lb/>
            one-fifth of the enemy's numbers. This affair gave <lb/>
            Kleomenes great self-confidence, and parodying a saying <lb/>
            of one of the ancient kings, he said to his countrymen <lb/>
            that it was useless nowadays for the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            ask either how many their enemies were, or where they <lb/>
            were.*</p>
          <p>V. Shortly after, as the Achæans were making war <lb/>
            against the Eleans, Kleomenes was sent to aid the latter, <lb/>
            and met with the army of the Achæans returning home, <lb/>
            near the mountain called Lykæum. He attacked their <lb/>
            forces, and utterly routed them, killing many and capturing <lb/>
            numbers of prisoners, so that a report spread throughout <lb/>
            Greece that Aratus himself had perished. But Aratus, <lb/>
            turning the disaster to good account, immediately after <note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to a saying of Agis II., that " The Lace æmonians <lb/>
            never ask how many their enemies are, but where they are.'' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            the defeat marched to Mantinoa, and as no one expected <lb/>
            him, captured the city and placed a strong garrison in it. <lb/>
            This completely disheartened the Lacedæmonians, who <lb/>
            desired to recall Kleomenes and put an end to the war. <lb/>
            Kleomenes now sent to Messene and invited back Archi­ <lb/>
            damus, the brother of Agis, who ought to have been on <lb/>
            the throne as the representative of the other royal family, <lb/>
            imagining that if there were two kings reigning at Sparta <lb/>
            at the same time, the power of the Ephors would be <lb/>
            weakened. However, the party who had previously <lb/>
            murdered Agis perceived this, and as they feared that if <lb/>
            Archidamus returned to Sparta he would make them pay <lb/>
            the penalty of their crimes, they welcomed him back and <lb/>
            assisted him to make a secret entry into the city, but <lb/>
            immediately afterwards assassinated him, either against <lb/>
            the will of Kleomenes, as we are told by Phylarchus, or <lb/>
            else with his connivance, in consequence of the represen­ <lb/>
            tations of his friends. They indeed bore the chief blame <lb/>
            in the matter, as they were thought to have forced <lb/>
            Kleomenes into consenting to the murder.</p>
          <p>VI. Kleomenes, determined to carry out his designs of <lb/>
            reform, now proceeded to bribe the Ephors into sending <lb/>
            him out on a new military expedition. He also won over <lb/>
            a considerable number of suppliers among the citizens <lb/>
            by means of the lavish expenditure and influence of his <lb/>
            mother Kratesiklea, who, though averse to a second mar­ <lb/>
            riage, is said to have married one of the leading men in <lb/>
            Sparta in order to further her son's interests.</p>
          <p>Kleomenes now took the field at the head of his army, <lb/>
            and captured a small town within the territory of Megalo­ <lb/>
            polis, named Leuktra.* The Achæans under Aratus <lb/>
            promptly came up, and a battle was fought under the <lb/>
            walls of the town, in which part of the army of Kleomenes <lb/>
            was defeated. Aratus however refused to follow up his <lb/>
            advantage, and kept the main body of the Achæans <lb/>
            motionless behind the bed of a torrent. Enraged at his <lb/>
            inaction, Lydiades of Megalopolis charged at the head of <lb/>
            the cavalry under his own command, but got entangled in <lb/>
            the pursuit of the enemy in ground which was cut up by <lb/>
            walls and watercourses. Seeing him thrown into dis­ <note type="footnote"> *Called Ladokea by Polybius, ii. chap. 3; and Pausunias viii. 44. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            order, Kleomenes sent his Tarentine and Cretan troops to <lb/>
            attack him. by whom Lydiades, fighting bravely, was <lb/>
            overpowered and slain. The Lacedæmonians now re­ <lb/>
            covered their spirits, and with loud shouts attacked the <lb/>
            Achæans and completely defeated them. Many were <lb/>
            slain, and their corpses were given up to the enemy for <lb/>
            burial, with the exception of that of Lydiades, which <lb/>
            Kleomenes ordered to be brought to himself. He then <lb/>
            attired it in a purple robe, placed a garland upon its head, <lb/>
            and sent it to the city of Megalopolis. This was that <lb/>
            Lydiades who had been despot of Megalopolis, but who <lb/>
            abdicated his throne, restored liberty to his countrymen, <lb/>
            and brought the city to join the Achæan league.</p>
          <p>VII. After this victory Kleomenes became inspired <lb/>
            with fresh confidence, and was convinced that if he only <lb/>
            were allowed undisputed management he would easily <lb/>
            conquer the Achæans. He explained to his step-father <lb/>
            Megistonous that the time had at length come for the <lb/>
            abolition of the Ephors, the redistribution of property, <lb/>
            and the establishment of equality among the citizens, <lb/>
            after which Sparta might again aspire to recover her <lb/>
            ancient ascendancy in Greece. Megistonous agreed, and <lb/>
            communicated his intentions to two or three of his friends. <lb/>
            It chanced that at this time one of the Ephors who was <lb/>
            sleeping in the temple of Pasiphæ dreamed an extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary dream, that in the place where the Ephors sat for the <lb/>
            dispatch of business he saw four chairs removed, and one <lb/>
            alone remaining, while as he wondered he heard a voice <lb/>
            from the shrine say " This is best for Sparta." When the <lb/>
            Ephor related this dream to Kleomenes, he was at first <lb/>
            much alarmed, and feared that the man had conceived <lb/>
            some suspicion of his designs, but finding that he was <lb/>
            really in earnest recovered his confidence. Taking with <lb/>
            him all those citizens whom he suspected to be opposed to <lb/>
            his enterprise, he captured Heræa and Alsæa, cities <lb/>
            belonging to the Achaean league, revictualled Orchomenus, <lb/>
            and threatened Mantinea. By long marches and counter- <lb/>
            marches he so wearied the Lacedæmonians that at last at <lb/>
            their own request he left the greater part of them in <lb/>
            Arcadia, while he with the mercenaries returned to Sparta. <lb/>
            During his homeward march he revealed his intentions to <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            those whom he considered to be most devoted to his <lb/>
            person, and regulated his march so as to be able to fall <lb/>
            upon the Ephors while they were at their evening <lb/>
            meal.</p>
          <p>VIII. When he drew near to the city, he sent Eury­ <lb/>
            kleidas into the dining-room of the Ephors, on the pretence <lb/>
            of bringing a message from the army. After Eurykleidas <lb/>
            followed Phœbis and Therukion, two of the foster-brothers <lb/>
            of Kleomenes, called mothakes * by the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            with a few soldiers. While Eurykleidas was parleying <lb/>
            with the Ephors, these men rushed in with drawn swords <lb/>
            and out them down. The president, Agylæus, fell at the <lb/>
            first blow and appeared to be dead, but contrived to crawl <lb/>
            out of the building unobserved into a small temple, sacred <lb/>
            to Fear, the door of which was usually closed, but which <lb/>
            then chanced to be open. In this he took refuge and shut <lb/>
            the door. The other four were slain, and some few per­ <lb/>
            sons, not more than ten, who came to assist them. No one <lb/>
            who remained quiet was put to death, nor was any one <lb/>
            prevented from leaving the city. Even Agylæus, when <lb/>
            he came out of his sanctuary on the following day, was <lb/>
            not molested.</p>
          <p>IX. The Lacedæmonians have temples dedicated not <lb/>
            only to Fear, but to Death, and Laughter, and the like. <lb/>
            They honour Fear, not as a malevolent divinity to be <lb/>
            shunned, but because they think that the constitutions <lb/>
            of states are mainly upheld by Fear. For this reason, <lb/>
            Aristotle tells us that the Ephors, when they enter upon <lb/>
            their office, issue a proclamation ordering the citizens to <lb/>
            shave the moustache and obey the laws, that the laws <lb/>
            might not be hard upon them. The injunction about <lb/>
            shaving the moustache is inserted, I imagine, in order to <lb/>
            accustom the young to obedience even in the most trivial <lb/>
            matters. It seems to me that the ancient Spartans did <lb/>
            not regard bravery as consisting in the absence of fear, <lb/>
            but in the fear of shame and dread of dishonour; for those <lb/>
            who fear the laws most are the bravest in battle; and <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόθακες</foreign> seem to have been children of Helots brought up as <lb/>

             <pb n="26"/>
            those who most fear disgrace care least for their own <lb/>
            personal safety. The poet was right who said <lb/>
            "Where there is fear, is reverence too :" <lb/>
            and Homer makes Helen call Priam <lb/>
            "My father-in-law dear, <lb/>
            Whom most of all I reverence and fear, <lb/>
            while he speaks of the Greek army as obeying <lb/>
            " Its chief's commanda in silence and with fear." <lb/>
            Human nature, indeed, leads most men to reverence <lb/>
            those whom they fear; and this is why the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians placed the temple of Fear close to the dining-hall <lb/>
            of the Ephors, because they invested that office with almost <lb/>
            royal authority.</p>
          <p>X. On the following morning Kleomenes published a <lb/>
            list containing the names of eighty citizens, whom he <lb/>
            required to leave the country, and removed the chairs of <lb/>
            the Ephors, except one, which he intended to occupy him­ <lb/>
            self. He now convoked an assembly, and made a speech <lb/>
            justifying his recent acts. In the time of Lykurgus, he <lb/>
            said, the kings and the senate shared between them the <lb/>
            supreme authority in the State; and for a long time the <lb/>
            government was carried on in this manner without any <lb/>
            alteration being required, until, during the long wars <lb/>
            with Messene, as the kings had no leisure to attend to <lb/>
            public affairs, they chose some of their friends to sit as <lb/>
            judges in their stead, and these persons acted at first <lb/>
            merely as the servants of the kings, but gradually got all <lb/>
            power into their own hands, and thus insensibly established <lb/>
            a new power in the State. A proof of the truth of this is <lb/>
            to be found in the custom which still prevails, that when <lb/>
            the Ephors send for the king, he refuses to attend at the <lb/>
            first and second summons, but rises and goes to them at <lb/>
            the third. Asteropus, who first consolidated the power of <lb/>
            the Ephors, and raised it to the highest point, flourished <lb/>
            in comparatively recent times, many generations after the <lb/>
            original establishment of the office. If, he went on to say, <lb/>
            the Ephors would have behaved with moderation, it would <lb/>
            have been better to allow them to remain in existence; <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            but when they began to use their ill-gotten power to <lb/>
            destroy the constitution of Sparta, when they banished <lb/>
            one king, put another to death without trial, and kept <lb/>
            down by terror all those who wished for the introduction <lb/>
            of the noblest and most admirable reforms, they could no <lb/>
            longer be borne. Had he been able without shedding a <lb/>
            drop of blood to drive out of Lacedæmon all those foreign <lb/>
            pests of luxury, extravagance, debt, money-lending, and <lb/>
            those two more ancient evils, poverty and riches, he should <lb/>
            have accounted himself the most fortunate of kings, be­ <lb/>
            cause, like a skilful physician, he had painlessly performed <lb/>
            so important an operation upon his country: as it was, <lb/>
            the use of force was sanctioned by the example of Lykurgus, <lb/>
            who, though only a private man, appeared in arms in the <lb/>
            market-place, and so terrified King Charilaus, that he fled <lb/>
            for refuge to the altar of Athena. He, however, being an <lb/>
            honest and patriotic man, soon joined Lykurgus, and <lb/>
            acquiesced in the reforms which he introduced, while the <lb/>
            acts of Lykurgus prove that it is hard to effect a revolu­ <lb/>
            tion without armed force, of which he declared that he <lb/>
            had made a most sparing use, and had only put out of the <lb/>
            way those who were opposed to the best interests of Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon. He announced to the rest of the citizens that <lb/>
            the land should be divided among them, that they should <lb/>
            be relieved from all their debts, and that all resident <lb/>
            aliens should be submitted to an examination, in order <lb/>
            that the best of them might be selected to become full <lb/>
            citizens of Sparta, and help to defend the city from falling <lb/>
            a prey to Ætolians and Illyrians for want of men to <lb/>
            defend her.</p>
          <p>XI. After this he himself first threw his inheritance <lb/>
            into the common stock, and his example was followed <lb/>
            by his father-in-law Megistonous, his friends, and the <lb/>
            rest of the citizens. The land was now divided, and one <lb/>
            lot was assigned to each of those whom he had Vanished, <lb/>
            all of whom he said it was his intention to bring back as <lb/>
            soon as order was restored. He recruited the numbers of <lb/>
            the citizens by the admission of the most eligible of the <lb/>
            Periœki to the franchise, and organised them into a body <lb/>
            of four thousand heavy armed infantry, whom he taught <lb/>
            to use the sarissa, or Macedonian pike which was grasped <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            with both hands, instead of the spear, and to sling their <lb/>
            shields by a strap instead of using a handle. He next <lb/>
            turned his attention to the education and discipline of the <lb/>
            youth, in which task he was assisted by Sphærus. The <lb/>
            gymnasia and the common meals were soon re-established, <lb/>
            and the citizens, for the most part willingly, resumed <lb/>
            their simple Laconian habits of living. Kleomenes, <lb/>
            fearing to be called a despot, appointed his own brother, <lb/>
            Eukleidas, as his colleague. Then for the first time <lb/>
            were two kings of the same family seen at once in <lb/>
            Sparta.</p>
          <p>XII. As Kleomenes perceived that Aratus and the <lb/>
            Achæans thought that while Sparta was passing through so <lb/>
            perilous a crisis her troops were not likely to leave the <lb/>
            country, he thought that it would be both a spirited and <lb/>
            a useful act to displ ay the enthusiasm of his army to the <lb/>
            enemy. He invaded the territory of Megalopolis, carried <lb/>
            off a large booty, and laid waste a large extent of country. <lb/>
            Finding a company of players on their road from <lb/>
            Messene, he took them prisoners, caused a theatre to <lb/>
            be erected in the enemy's country, and offered them forty <lb/>
            minæ for a performance for one day, at which he himself <lb/>
            attended as a spectator, not that he cared for the per­ <lb/>
            formance, but because he wished to mock at his enemies, <lb/>
            and to show by this studied insult the enormous supe­ <lb/>
            riority of which he was conscious. At this period his <lb/>
            was the only army, Greek or foreign, which was not <lb/>
            attended by actors, jugglers, dancing-girls, and singers; <lb/>
            but he kept it free from all licentiousness and buffoon­ <lb/>
            ery, as the younger men were nearly always being <lb/>
            practised in martial exercises, while the elders acted <lb/>
            as their instructors; and when they were at leisure <lb/>
            they amused themselves with witty retorts and senten­ <lb/>
            tious Laconian pleasantries. The great value of this <lb/>
            kind of discipline is described at greater length in the <lb/>
            life of Lykurgus.</p>
          <p>XIII. In everything Kleomenes himself acttd as their <lb/>
            teacher, and example, offering his own simple, frugal life, <lb/>
            so entirely free from vulgar superfluities, as a model of <lb/>
            sobriety for them all to copy; and this added greatly to <lb/>
            his influence in Greece. For when men attended the <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            courts of the other kings of that period they were not so <lb/>
            much impressed by their wealth and lavish expenditure <lb/>
            as they were disgusted by their arrogant, overbearing <lb/>
            manners ; but when they met Kleomenes, who was every <lb/>
            inch a king, and saw that he wore no purple robes, did not <lb/>
            lounge on couches and litters, and was not surrounded by <lb/>
            a crowd of messengers, door-keepers, and secretaries, so <lb/>
            as to be difficult of access, but that he himself, dressed <lb/>
            in plain clothes, came and shook them by the hand, and <lb/>
            conversed with them in a kindly and encouraging tone, <lb/>
            they were completely fascinated and charmed by him, <lb/>
            and declared that he alone was a true descendant of <lb/>
            Herakles. His dinner was usually served upon a very <lb/>
            small Laconian table with three couches,. but if he were <lb/>
            entertaining ambassadors or foreigners two additional <lb/>
            couches were added, and his servants somewhat improved <lb/>
            his dinner, not by adding to it made-dishes and pastry, <lb/>
            but by serving a greater abundance of food and a more <lb/>
            liberal allowance of wine. Indeed he blamed one of his <lb/>
            friends, when he heard that when entertaining foreigners <lb/>
            at dinner he had placed before them black broth and <lb/>
            barley cakes : for he said that in such matters, and when <lb/>
            entertaining strangers, it was not well to be too rigidly <lb/>
            Spartan. After the table was removed a tripod was <lb/>
            brought in which supported a bronze bowl full of wine, <lb/>
            two silver pateræ, that held each about a pint, and a <lb/>
            number of very small silver cups, from which any one <lb/>
            drank who wished, for Kleomenes never forced men to <lb/>
            drink against their will. No recitations were performed <lb/>
            for the amusement of the guests; for he himself would <lb/>
            lead the conversation and entertain them over their wine, <lb/>
            partly by asking questions of them and partly by relating <lb/>
            anecdotes to them: for he well knew both how to make <lb/>
            serious subjects interesting, and to be pleasant and witty <lb/>
            without giving offence. He was of opinion that the <lb/>
            habit of other princes, of tempting men into their service <lb/>
            by presents and bribes, was both clumsy and wicked ; <lb/>
            but he thought it peculiarly befitting a king to influence <lb/>
            and captivate men's minds by the charm of his conversa­ <note type="footnote">* The ancients always reclined at meals. Seethe article Triclinium <lb/>
            In Smith's, ' Dictionary of Autiquities.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            tion, and was wont to say that a friend differed only <lb/>
            from a mercenary soldier in that a man wins the one by <lb/>
            the influence of his character and his conversation, and <lb/>
            the other by his money.</p>
          <p>XIV. First of all the people of Mantinea made overtures <lb/>
            to him. They admitted him to their city by night, aided <lb/>
            him to drive out the Achæan garrison, and placed them­ <lb/>
            selves unreservedly in his hands. He, however, restored <lb/>
            them to the enjoyment of their own laws and original <lb/>
            constitution, and marched away the same day to Tegea. <lb/>
            Shortly afterwards by a circuitous march through Arcadia <lb/>
            he arrived before the Achæan city of Pheræ, desiring either <lb/>
            to fight a battle with the Achæans, or to make Aratus <lb/>
            incur the disgrace of retreating and leaving him in <lb/>
            possession of the country: for although Hyperbates was <lb/>
            nominally in command, all real power over the Achæans <lb/>
            was in the hands of Aratus. The Achæans took the field <lb/>
            with their entire force, and encamped at Dymæ, near the <lb/>
            temple called Hekatombæon. When Kleomenes arrived <lb/>
            here he was unwilling to establish himself between the <lb/>
            hostile city of Dymæ and the army of the Achæans, and <lb/>
            challenged them, forced them to fight, and completely <lb/>
            routed their phalanx. He killed many, took a large <lb/>
            number of prisoners, and then, marching to Langon, drove <lb/>
            out the Achaean garrison, and restored the city to the <lb/>
            Eleans.</p>
          <p>XV. As the Achæan power was now quite broken, <lb/>
            Aratus, who was usually elected general every other year, <lb/>
            refused to take office, and excused himself when they <lb/>
            besought him to do so: a dishonourable act, when the <lb/>
            times became more stormy, to desert the helm, and give <lb/>
            up his power to another. Kleomenes at first used very <lb/>
            moderate language to the Achæan ambassadors, but sent <lb/>
            others ordering them to acknowledge him for their <lb/>
            sovereign, and promising that if they did so he would do <lb/>
            them no further hurt, and would at once restore the <lb/>
            prisoners and fortresses which he had taken. As the <lb/>
            Achaeans were willing to accept these terms they invited <lb/>
            Kleomenes to a conference at Lema. It happened, however, <lb/>
            that Kleomenes, after a long march, drank a quantity of <lb/>
            cold water, which caused him to bring up much blood, <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            and to lose his voice. In consequence of this, although <lb/>
            he sent back the most distinguished of his prisoners, he <lb/>
            was obliged to postpone the conference, and went home <lb/>
            to Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>XVI. This mischance ruined Greece, which even now <lb/>
            might have recovered herself, and avoided falling into <lb/>
            the hands of the insolent and rapacious Macedonians. <lb/>
            For Aratus, either because he distrusted and feared <lb/>
            Kleomenes, or else because he grudged him his success, and <lb/>
            thought that after he had for thirty-three years been chief <lb/>
            of the Achæans, it was not to be endured that a young <lb/>
            man should overthrow him, and enter into the fruit of his <lb/>
            labours, at first tried to oppose the Achæans when they <lb/>
            offered to come to terms with the Lacedæmonians; but <lb/>
            as they would not listen to him, because they were cowed <lb/>
            by the boldness of Kleomenes, and also admitted the <lb/>
            justice of the Lacedæmonian claim to be the leading state <lb/>
            in Peloponnesus, as their ancestral right, he adopted a <lb/>
            course which was a disgraceful one for any Greek, but <lb/>
            especially so for him, and one which was most unworthy <lb/>
            of his former political life. He determined to invite Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus into Greece, and to fill the Pelopennesus with those <lb/>
            very Macedonians whom he himself when a lad had chased <lb/>
            out of the country by his capture of the Acro-Corinthus, <lb/>
            although he was regarded with suspicion by all the kings, <lb/>
            and was at variance with them all, and though he had <lb/>
            already accused this very Antigonus himself of every con­ <lb/>
            ceivable crime in his “Memoirs,” which are still extant. <lb/>
            Yet he himself has stated that he suffered much, and risked <lb/>
            much to free Athens from a Macedonian garrison; though <lb/>
            now he led these very men with arms in their hands into <lb/>
            his own native country, and up to his own paternal <lb/>
            hearth. He thought that Kleomenes, a descendant of <lb/>
            Herakles, a king of Sparta, who had restored the simple <lb/>
            ancient Dorian constitution of Lykurgus, as one tightens <lb/>
            the relaxed strings of a lyre, to bring it into tune, was <lb/>
            unworthy to be accounted the ruler of Sikyon and Tritaea; <lb/>
            and in his eagerness to avoid the rough Spartan cloak, <lb/>
            and the Spartan barley bread, and that with which he <lb/>
            especially charged Kleomenes, the destruction of wealth <lb/>
            and the encouragement of poverty, threw himself and <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            all Achæa with him, into the arms of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            with all their diadems and their purple robes and their <lb/>
            habits of oriental despotism. That he might avoid acting <lb/>
            under the orders of Kleomenes, he was content to offer <lb/>
            sacrifice at festivals in honour of Antigonus, and himself <lb/>
            to place a garland upon his head, and to lead the paean <lb/>
            in praise of a man wasted and emaciated by consump­ <lb/>
            tion. And this I write, not from any desire to depreciate <lb/>
            Aratus, for in many respects he proved himself a truly <lb/>
            great and patriotic man, but rather out of pity for the <lb/>
            weakness of human nature, which will not allow even <lb/>
            the most eminent persons to present us with the spectacle <lb/>
            of an entirely unblemished virtue.</p>
          <p>XVII. When the Achæans again assembled at Argos to <lb/>
            hold a conference there, and Kleomenes started to go <lb/>
            thither from Tegea, men's minds were full of hope that <lb/>
            peace would be finally established. But Aratus, who had <lb/>
            already settled the main points of his treaty with Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus, and feared that Kleomenes would either by per­ <lb/>
            suasion or force bring the assembly over to his views, <lb/>
            sent to him demanding either that he should take three <lb/>
            hundred hostages for his safety and come to the conference <lb/>
            alone, or else meet them with his army outside the walls <lb/>
            at the gymnasium called the Kyllarabium. Kleomenes <lb/>
            on hearing this said that he had not been properly <lb/>
            treated ; for Aratus ought to have warned him of this at <lb/>
            once, not have waited till he was almost at the gates of <lb/>
            Argos and then expressed suspicions of his honesty of <lb/>
            purpose and driven him away. He sent a letter to the <lb/>
            assembled Achæans, containing bitter invectives against <lb/>
            Aratus, and as Aratus replied by maligning him in a <lb/>
            public oration, he broke up his camp and sent a herald <lb/>
            with a declaration of war, not to Argos, according to <lb/>
            Aratus, but to Ægium, in order to take the Achæans by <lb/>
            surprise. The Achæan cities were all ripe for revolt, as <lb/>
            the populace hoped for a redistribution of the land and <lb/>
            cancelling of debts if they joined the Spartans, while the <lb/>
            leading men were all jealous of the power and influence <lb/>
            of Aratus, and some of them hated him as the traitor who <lb/>
            was bringing the Macedonians into Peloponnesus. Rely­ <lb/>
            ing upon the prevalence of this feeling Kleomenes invaded <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            Achaia, took Pellene by surprise, and drove out the <lb/>
            garrison and the Achæan inhabitants. Soon afterwards <lb/>
            he captured the cities of Pheneus and Penteleum.</p>
          <p>The Achaeans of Corinth and Sikyon now began to fear <lb/>
            that his partisans were plotting to deliver up those cities <lb/>
            to him, and in consequence sent their cavalry and foreign <lb/>
            mercenaries away from Argos to guard those towns, while <lb/>
            they themselves proceeded to Argos to hold the Nemean <lb/>
            festival there. Kleomenes, rightly judging that his ap­ <lb/>
            pearance at a time when the city was full of a disorderly <lb/>
            crowd of people who were come to attend the feasts and <lb/>
            games would produce great confusion, marched up to the <lb/>
            walls by night, seized the place called the ‘Shield,’ which <lb/>
            is just above the theatre, and is very difficult of access, <lb/>
            and so terrified the citizens that no one attempted to offer <lb/>
            any resistance. They willingly agreed to admit a Spartan <lb/>
            garrison, to give twenty of their chief men as hostages <lb/>
            for their loyalty, and to become the allies of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, acknowledging their supremacy.</p>
          <p>XVIII. This exploit added not a little to the reputation <lb/>
            and power of Kleomenes. None of the ancient kings of <lb/>
            Sparta could ever make themselves masters of Argos, <lb/>
            although they often attempted to do so; and even that <lb/>
            most brilliant general King Pyrrhus, though he forced his <lb/>
            way into the city, could not take it, but perished, and <lb/>
            with him a great part of his army. For these reasons, <lb/>
            the skill and audacity of Kleomenes were the more <lb/>
            admired: and those who had before ridiculed his attempts <lb/>
            to bring back the days of Solon and Lykurgus by the <lb/>
            cancelling of debts and redistribution of land, now became <lb/>
            entirely convinced that these measures had been the <lb/>
            cause of the revival of Sparta. The Spartans before this <lb/>
            had been so feeble and helpless, that the Ætolians invaded <lb/>
            Laconia and carried off a booty of fifty thousand slaves, <lb/>
            on which occasion it is said that an old Spartan observed <lb/>
            that the enemy had greatly benefited Laconia by relieving <lb/>
            it from its burdens. Yet a short time after this, by the <lb/>
            restoration of their former constitution, and by re-esta­ <lb/>
            blishing the ancient system of training, they made as <lb/>
            magnificent a display of discipline and valour as if <lb/>
            Lykurgus himself were alive and at the head of affairs, <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            for they gained for Sparta the first place in Greece, and <lb/>
            won the whole of Peloponnesus by the sword.</p>
          <p>XIX. The submission of Argos to Kleomenes was soon <lb/>
            followed by that of Phlius and Kleonæ. During these <lb/>
            events Aratus was at Corinth, busily engaged in search­ <lb/>
            ing for the partisans of the Lacedæmonians. When the <lb/>
            news of the fall of these cities reached Corinth, as he <lb/>
            observed that the city of Corinth was eager to join <lb/>
            Kleomenes and leave the Achæan league, he summoned the <lb/>
            citizens to meet in the public assembly, and himself made <lb/>
            his way unperceived to the gate. He had already sent <lb/>
            his horse thither, and mounting, fled to Sikyon. The <lb/>
            Corinthians now hurried to Argos to surrender their city <lb/>
            to Kleomenes; in such haste, writes Aratus in his ‘Me­ <lb/>
            moirs,' that they foundered all their horses. Kleomenes <lb/>
            reproached them for allowing Aratus to escape, but shortly <lb/>
            afterwards sent Megistonous to him, asking him to hand <lb/>
            over the citadel of Corinth, which was in possession of an <lb/>
            Achaean garrison, and offering him a large sum of money. <lb/>
            He answered that the course of affairs was not in his <lb/>
            power, but that he was rather in theirs. These parti­ <lb/>
            culars we have extracted from Aratus's own writings. <lb/>
            Kleomenes now marched from Argos to Corinth, receiving <lb/>
            on the way the submission of Trœzene, Epidaurus, and <lb/>
            Hermione. As the garrison refused to surrender the <lb/>
            citadel, he built a rampart round it, and sending for the <lb/>
            friends and representatives of Aratus, bade them take <lb/>
            charge of his house and property during his absence. He <lb/>
            now sent the Messenian Tritymallus to Aratus, with <lb/>
            instructions to propose to him that the garrison of Acro- <lb/>
            Corinthus should be composed partly of Spartan and <lb/>
            partly of Achæan troops, while he himself privately <lb/>
            offered him double the amount of the pension which he <lb/>
            received from King Ptolemy of Egypt. However, as <lb/>
            Aratus refused to listen to his overtures, but sent his own <lb/>
            son with the other hostages to Antigonus, and persuaded <lb/>
            the Achæans to pass a decree to hand over the Acro- <lb/>
            Corinthus to Antigonus, Kleomenes invaded the territory <lb/>
            of Sikyon and laid it waste, and also took the property of <lb/>
            Aratus when it was publicly presented to him by the <lb/>
            people of Corinth.</p><pb n="35"/>
            
          <p>XX. When Antigonus crossed the Geranean mountains <lb/>
            with a large force, Kleomenes did not think it necessary <lb/>
            to guard the isthmus, but determined to fortify the <lb/>
            mountains called Onea, and by holding that strong <lb/>
            position, to protract the war and wear out the Macedonian <lb/>
            force, rather than fight a pitched battle with their <lb/>
            phalanx. By this line of policy he reduced Antigonus to <lb/>
            great straits; for he had made no preparations for feeding <lb/>
            his troops for more than a short time, and yet to force his <lb/>
            way in over the isthmus was a difficult operation while <lb/>
            Kleomenes barred the way. An attempt which he made <lb/>
            to steal through by Lechæum * at night was repulsed with <lb/>
            considerable loss; so that Kleomenes and his friends, <lb/>
            elated by their victory, supped merrily together, while <lb/>
            Antigonus was at his wit's end to know what to do. He <lb/>
            even began to meditate matching to the promontory of <lb/>
            Heræum, and conveying his forces over the Corinthian <lb/>
            gulf to Sikyon, an operation which would have required <lb/>
            much time and many ships. However, late in the <lb/>
            evening there arrived certain friends of Aratus by sea <lb/>
            from Argos, inviting him to come thither, as the Argives <lb/>
            intended to revolt from Kleomenes. The prime mover in <lb/>
            this revolt was one Aristoteles, who easily prevailed upon <lb/>
            the people to rise, because they were disappointed with <lb/>
            Kleomenes, who had not cancelled all their debts as they <lb/>
            hoped he would. Aratus now took fifteen hundred of <lb/>
            Antigonus's soldiers and proceeded by sea to Epidaurus. <lb/>
            Aristoteles however did not wait for his arrival, but led <lb/>
            the citizens to attack the garrison in the citadel, assisted <lb/>
            by Timoxenus with a body of Achæans from Sikyon.</p>
          <p>XXI. Intelligence of this movement reached Kleomenes <lb/>
            about the second watch of the night. He at once sent for <lb/>
            Megistonous, and angrily ordered him at once to go to the <lb/>
            assistance of the garrison of Argos; for it was he who had <lb/>
            so confidently assured Kleomenes of the loyalty of the <lb/>
            Argives, and had dissuaded him from banishing those <lb/>
            whom he suspected from the city. Having detached <lb/>
            Megistonous with two thousand men on this service, he <lb/>
            himself turned his attention to Antigonus, and pacified the <lb/>
            people of Corinth by assuring them that nothing had <note type="footnote"> * The western harbour of Corinth. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            happened at Argos except a slight disturbance which would <lb/>
            be easily suppressed. However, as Megistonous was killed <lb/>
            while forcing his way into the city, and the garrison were <lb/>
            hard pressed, and kept sending messengers to Kleomenes <lb/>
            begging for assistance, he, fearing that if the enemy <lb/>
            gained Argos they might cut him off from Laconia, and <lb/>
            sack the defenceless city of Sparta, withdrew his army <lb/>
            from Corinth. He lost this city at once, for Antigonus <lb/>
            instantly entered it and placed a garrison in it. He now <lb/>
            proceeded to assault the city wall of Argos, and concen­ <lb/>
            trated his troops for this purpose. He broke through the <lb/>
            vaults supporting the part of the city called the ‘Shield,' <lb/>
            forced his way in, and joined his garrison, who were still <lb/>
            holding out against the Achæans. He now, by the use of <lb/>
            scaling ladders, captured some of the strong places in the <lb/>
            city, and cleared the streets of the enemy by means of his <lb/>
            Cretan archers. When however he saw Antigonus march­ <lb/>
            ing down from the mountains to the plain with his <lb/>
            phalanx in battle array, and saw the Macedonian cavalry <lb/>
            pouring along towards the city, he despaired of success, <lb/>
            and collecting all his troops into one mass, led them safely <lb/>
            out of the city. He had in a wonderfully short time <lb/>
            effected great things, and had all but made himself master <lb/>
            of the whole of Peloponnesus: but now he lost it all as <lb/>
            quickly as he had won it, for some of his allies at once <lb/>
            deserted him, and many shortly afterwards surrendered <lb/>
            their cities to Antigonus.</p>
          <p>XXII. As Kleomenes was marching into the city of <lb/>
            Tegea at night-fall, on his return from this disastrous <lb/>
            campaign, he was met by messengers bearing the news of <lb/>
            a still greater calamity, the death of his wife Agiatis, of <lb/>
            whom he was so fond that even when in the full tide of <lb/>
            success he never would remain continuously with his army, <lb/>
            but used constantly to return to Sparta to see her. He <lb/>
            was terribly grieved and cast down, as one would expect <lb/>
            a young man to be on losing so beautiful and excellent a <lb/>
            wife, yet he did not allow his noble spirit to be crushed <lb/>
            by his sorrow, but without showing any outward signs of <lb/>
            grief in his voice or countenance, continued to give his <lb/>
            orders to his officers, and to take measures for placing <lb/>
            Tegea in a posture of defence. At daybreak next morn­ <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            ing he returned to Lacedæmon, and after lamenting his <lb/>
            misfortune with his mother and his children, began to <lb/>
            consider by what policy he might save his country.</p>
          <p>Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, now offered him assistance <lb/>
            on the condition of receiving his mother and children as <lb/>
            hostages. For a long time he shrank from mentioning <lb/>
            this proposal to his mother, and often conversed with her <lb/>
            without having the courage to allude to it, until she sus­ <lb/>
            pected that he had something on his mind, and inquired <lb/>
            of his friends whether there was not some subject about <lb/>
            which he hesitated to speak to her. At last Kleomenes <lb/>
            brought himself to mention Ptolemy's proposal to her. <lb/>
            On hearing it, she laughed loudly, and said, “This, then, <lb/>
            is that which you have so long been fearing to tell me. <lb/>
            Pray place me and the children on board ship as soon as <lb/>
            possible, and send us to any place where this body of <lb/>
            mine may be useful to Sparta, before it be uselessly con­ <lb/>
            sumed by old age at home."</p>
          <p>When all was prepared for hei voyage, Kratesiklea pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Tænarus escorted by Kleomenes with all his <lb/>
            troops under arms. Before embarking she retired alone <lb/>
            with him into the temple of Poseidon, where, after em­ <lb/>
            bracing him as he sorrowed at her departure, she said, <lb/>
            “Now, king of the Lacedæmonians, take care when we <lb/>
            come out that no one sees us weeping or doing anything <lb/>
            unworthy of Sparta. This lies in our own power; but good <lb/>
            or evil fortune befalls us according to the will of Heaven."</p>
          <p>Saying thus, she fixed her eyes upon the ship, walked <lb/>
            swiftly to it carrying the child, and bade the pilot start <lb/>
            at once. When she reached Egypt, as she heard that <lb/>
            Ptolemy had received an embassy from Antigonus, and <lb/>
            was told that although the Achæans wished to come to <lb/>
            terms with him, he had feared on her account to make <lb/>
            peace with them without consulting Ptolemy, she wrote <lb/>
            to him bidding him act worthily of Sparta, and consult <lb/>
            her interests, and not fear to displease Ptolemy because <lb/>
            of what he might do to an old woman and an infant. So <lb/>
            great a spirit is she said to have shown in her misfortunes.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Antigonus now advanced, took Tegea, and <lb/>
            allowed his troops to plunder Orchomenus and Mantinea. <lb/>
            Kleomenes, who was confined to the territory of Lace­ <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            daemon, proceeded to emancipate all helots who could pay <lb/>
            a sum of five Attic minæ for their freedom, by which <lb/>
            means he raised a sum of five hundred talents. He also <lb/>
            organised a special corps of two thousand men, armed <lb/>
            after the Macedonian fashion, with which he hoped to be <lb/>
            able to meet the Leukaspids,* or white-shielded troops of <lb/>
            Antigonus, and proceeded to attempt a wonderful and <lb/>
            surprising feat of arms.</p>
          <p>The city of Megalopolis at that time was itself quite as <lb/>
            large and as powerful as Sparta, and had close at hand <lb/>
            the army of the Achæans, and that of Antigonus himself, <lb/>
            whom the people of Megalopolis had been especially eager <lb/>
            to invite into Peloponnesus. This city Kleomenes <lb/>
            determined to pounce upon : (no other word expresses the <lb/>
            speed with which he surprised it). He ordered his troops <lb/>
            to provision themselves for five days, and led them to <lb/>
            Sellasia, as though he intended to invade Argolis. From <lb/>
            Sellasia he marched into the territory of Megalopolis, <lb/>
            halted at Rhœteum for supper, and thence proceeded <lb/>
            along the road by Helikus straight towards Megalopolis. <lb/>
            When he was close to it he detached Panteus with two <lb/>
            regiments to attack a part of the wall lying between two <lb/>
            towers, which he had heard was often left unguarded, <lb/>
            while he moved slowly forward with the main body. <lb/>
            Panteus not only found that spot, but a great extent of <lb/>
            the city wall unguarded. While he was engaged in <lb/>
            throwing down the wall and killing those who attempted <lb/>
            to defend it, Kleomenes came up, and was within the city <lb/>
            with his army before the people of Megalopolis knew of <lb/>
            his arrival.</p>
          <p>XXIV. When at last the inhabitants discovered the <lb/>
            extent of their misfortune, some snatched up what they <lb/>
            could and fled at once, while others got under arms and <lb/>
            endeavoured to drive out the enemy. In this they could <lb/>
            not succeed, but they enabled the fugitives to escape <note type="footnote"> * Who these Leukaspids were I do not know. White was the <lb/>
            Arrive colour, and in earlier times men with white shields are always <lb/>
            spoken of as Argives. The celebrated Argyraspids, the silver-shielded <lb/>
            regiment of Alexander, was destroyed by Antigonus I. after their <lb/>
            betrayal of Eumenes; but this may have been a corps raised by <lb/>
            Antigonus Doson in imitation of them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            unmolested, so that no more than a thousand souls <lb/>
            remained in the city, as all the rest got safe with their <lb/>
            wives and children to Messene. Of those who offered <lb/>
            resistance but a few were slain, and a very small number <lb/>
            were taken prisoners, amongst whom were Lysandridas <lb/>
            and Thearidas, the two most important persons in <lb/>
            Megalopolis. On this account the soldiers who took them <lb/>
            brought them at once to Kleomenes. Lysandridas, as <lb/>
            soon as he saw Kleomenes at a distance, called out loudly <lb/>
            to him, “King of the Lacedæmonians, now you have an <lb/>
            opportunity to add to your glory by a deed even more <lb/>
            noble and more worthy of a king than that which you <lb/>
            have achieved! ” Kleomenes, suspecting what he meant, <lb/>
            asked, " What do you mean, Lysandridas ? do you bid me <lb/>
            give you back your city ? " “That is what I bid you to <lb/>
            do," answered Lysandridas; “and I advise you not to <lb/>
            ruin so great a city, but to fill it with friends and trusty <lb/>
            allies, by restoring it to the people of Megalopolis, and <lb/>
            becoming their saviour." To this Kleomenes, after a short <lb/>
            silence, replied, "It is hard to believe this; but let us <lb/>
            ever prefer honour to profit." Saying this he sent his <lb/>
            prisoners to Messene, and a herald with them, who offered <lb/>
            to restore the city to the people of Megalopolis, on the <lb/>
            condition that they should desert the Achæans and <lb/>
            become the friends and allies of the Spartans. However, <lb/>
            Philopœmen would not allow his countrymen to break <lb/>
            their faith with the Achæans and accept this wise and <lb/>
            generous offer. He declared that Kleomenes did not <lb/>
            intend to give them back their city, but wanted to get <lb/>
            possession of them as well as of their city, and with <lb/>
            violent abuse drove Thearidas and Lysandridas out of <lb/>
            the Messenian country. This was that Philopoemen who <lb/>
            afterwards became the general of the Achaeans and won <lb/>
            great distinction, as will be found in the life of him <lb/>
            which I have written.</p>
          <p>XXV. When this answer was brought back to Kleo­ <lb/>
            menes, who had hitherto carefully kept the city un­ <lb/>
            harmed, and had not allowed any one to appropriate the <lb/>
            most trifling article, be became furious with disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment. He plundered the city, sent all the statues and <lb/>
            pictures to Sparta, utterly destroyed all the best part of <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            the city, and returned home, for he feared Antigonus and <lb/>
            the Achæans. They, however, did not offer to attack <lb/>
            him: for they were engaged in holding a conference at <lb/>
            Ægium. Here Aratus ascended the tribune, and for a <lb/>
            long time wept with his face hidden in his gown. At <lb/>
            last, as the others in wonder bade him tell them the cause <lb/>
            of his grief, he said that Megalopolis had been ruined by <lb/>
            Kleomenes. On hearing this the assembly at once broke <lb/>
            up. The Achæans were terror-stricken at the sudden­ <lb/>
            ness and importance of the blow, and Antigonus deter­ <lb/>
            mined to proceed to the assistance of the people of <lb/>
            Megalopolis, but as it took a long time to assemble his <lb/>
            troops from their winter-quarters, he ordered them to stay <lb/>
            where they were, and himself with a small force marched <lb/>
            to Argos. Kleomenes now engaged in a second enterprise, <lb/>
            which appeared completely insane, but which is said by <lb/>
            the historian Polybius to show consummate generalship. <lb/>
            As he knew that all the Macedonian troops were scattered <lb/>
            over the country in winter-quarters, and that Antigonus <lb/>
            with a few mercenary troops was spending the winter at <lb/>
            Argos with his friends, he invaded the Argive territory, <lb/>
            thinking that either he should shame Antigonus into a <lb/>
            battle, and beat him, or else that if he did not dare to <lb/>
            fight, the Argives would be disgusted with him. And <lb/>
            so it fell out. The Argives, seeing their country spoiled <lb/>
            by Kleomenes, were greatly enraged, and gathering to­ <lb/>
            gether before the house in which Antigonus was lodging, <lb/>
            excitedly called upon him either to fight or to resign his <lb/>
            post as commander in-chief in favour of a better man. <lb/>
            But Antigonus, like a prudent general as he was, thought <lb/>
            it more disgraceful to run foolish risks and incur unneces­ <lb/>
            sary danger than to hear himself called hard names by <lb/>
            the mob, and refused to leave the city, but stood constant <lb/>
            in his original policy. Kleomenes, after marching up to <lb/>
            the gates of Argos, ostentatiously ravaged the country, <lb/>
            and returned home unmolested.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Shortly afterwards, hearing that Antigonus <lb/>
            had again advanced to Tegea, intending to invade Laconia <lb/>
            by that route, Kleomenes quickly assembled his army, <lb/>
            marched by a different road, avoiding Antigonus, and at <lb/>
            day-break appeared near the city of Argus, where he <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            ravaged the plain country, not reaping the corn, an <lb/>
            invaders usually do, with sickles and swords, but beating <lb/>
            down with great clubs, so that his soldiers in sheer sport <lb/>
            as they marched along were able to destroy the whole <lb/>
            crop without trouble. When they reached the gymna­ <lb/>
            sium of Kyllarabis some of the officers proposed to set it <lb/>
            on fire; but Kleomenes forbade it, saying that even in <lb/>
            destroying Megalopolis he had been guided by anger <lb/>
            rather than by honour. Antigonus at first retired directly <lb/>
            towards Argos, but afterwards occupied all the passes by <lb/>
            which the Lacedæmonians could retreat. Kleomenes <lb/>
            affected to set him at defiance, and sent a herald to Argos <lb/>
            to demand the keys of the temple of Hera (between <lb/>
            Argos and Mycenæ), in order that he might offer sacrifice <lb/>
            there before retiring. After insulting the Argives by <lb/>
            this ironical request, he offered sacrifice outside the <lb/>
            temple, for the doors remained locked, and led away his <lb/>
            army to Phlius. From thence he marched to Mount <lb/>
            Oligyrtus. where he defeated the Macedonian troops who <lb/>
            guarded the pass, and returned home by way of Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus, having inspired his countrymen with hope and <lb/>
            confidence, and having proved to his enemies that he was <lb/>
            a consummate general, capable of conducting the most im­ <lb/>
            portant operations. It was indeed no small feat for him, <lb/>
            with only the resources of one small state at his disposal, <lb/>
            to make war against the power of Macedonia and all <lb/>
            the cities of the Peloponnesus, with Antigonus for their <lb/>
            paymaster, and not only to prevent the enemy's setting <lb/>
            foot in Laconia, but to lay waste their country, and take <lb/>
            such large and important cities from them.</p>
          <p>XXVII. However, he who first called money the <lb/>
            sinews of war must have had this war in his mind. So <lb/>
            also Demades, when the Athenians wished to man a fleet <lb/>
            at a time when they had no money, observed that they <lb/>
            must make bread before they could make a voyage. <lb/>
            Archidamus, too, who was king of Sparta at the opening <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian war, when his allies asked him to <lb/>
            fix the limit of their several contributions, answered that <lb/>
            the consumption of war is unlimited. For just as trained <lb/>
            athletes in time overpower their antagonist in spite of <lb/>
            his strength and skill, so Antigonus, having vast resource <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            to draw upon, wearied out and overpowered Kleomenes, <lb/>
            who had the greatest difficulty in paying his mercenary <lb/>
            troops and feeding his countrymen. In other respects the <lb/>
            long duration of the contest was in Kleomenes's favour, <lb/>
            as Antigonus had troubles at home which made the <lb/>
            contest a more equal one. The barbarians, in his absence, <lb/>
            always overran and plundered the outskirts of the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Macedonia, and at this period an army of Illyrians <lb/>
            had invaded the country from the north, against whose <lb/>
            depredations the Macedonians besought Antigonus to <lb/>
            return and protect them. The letter calling upon him to <lb/>
            return was very nearly delivered to him before the <lb/>
            decisive battle of the war; and had he received it, he <lb/>
            would no doubt have returned home at once and taken a <lb/>
            long farewell of the Achaeans. However, fortune, who <lb/>
            delights to show that the most important events are <lb/>
            decided by the merest trifles, caused the embassy with <lb/>
            the letters for the recall of Antigonus to reach him just <lb/>
            after the battle of Sellasia, in which Kleomenes lost his <lb/>
            army and his country. This makes the misfortune of <lb/>
            Kleomenes yet more pitiable; for if he had avoided a <lb/>
            battle for two days longer, he never need have fought at <lb/>
            all, as the Macedonians would have retreated, and left <lb/>
            him to make what terms he pleased with the Achæans: <lb/>
            whereas, as has been explained, his want of money forced <lb/>
            him to fight, and that too when, according to Polybius, <lb/>
            he had only twenty thousand men to oppose to thirty <lb/>
            thousand.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. In the battle he acted like a great general, <lb/>
            and the Spartans fought with desperate courage, while <lb/>
            the mercenary troops also behaved well; but he was <lb/>
            overpowered by the Macedonian armament and by the <lb/>
            irresistible weight of their phalanx. The historian <lb/>
            Phylarchus says that Kleomenes was ruined by treachery, <lb/>
            for Antigonus sent his Illyrians and Akarnanians to make <lb/>
            a flank march and attack one of the enemy's wings, which <lb/>
            was commanded by Eukleidas, the brother of Kleomenes, <lb/>
            and there placed the rest of his army in battle array. <lb/>
            Kleomenes, who was watching the enemy from an emi. <lb/>
            nence, could not see the Illyrian and Akarnanian troops, <lb/>
            and suspected some manoeuvre of the kind. He sent for . <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            Damoteles, the chief of the Spartan secret-service,. and <lb/>
            ordered him to explore the ground on both flanks, and <lb/>
            see that no attack was meditated in that direction. As <lb/>
            Damoteles, who is said to have been bribed by Antigonus, <lb/>
            answered that all was well on the flanks, and that he bad <lb/>
            better give his entire attention to the enemy in front, <lb/>
            Kleomenes believed him, and at once charged the army <lb/>
            of Antigonus. The furious attack of the Spartans drove <lb/>
            back the Macedonian phalanx, and Kleomenes forced it to <lb/>
            retreat before him for a distance of about five stadia. <lb/>
            Then, as he found that his brother Eukleidas on the other <lb/>
            wing was surrounded by the enemy, he halted, and looking <lb/>
            towards him, said, “You are gone, my dearest brother; <lb/>
            you have fought bravely, and are a noble model to the <lb/>
            Spartan youth, a noble theme for Spartan maidens' <lb/>
            songs." Then, as the entire division under Eukleidas <lb/>
            was cut to pieces, and the victors attacked his own men, <lb/>
            who were thrown into confusion and could no longer <lb/>
            stand their ground, he escaped from the field as best he <lb/>
            could. It is said that many of the mercenaries were <lb/>
            slain, and that of the Lacedæmonians, who were six <lb/>
            thousand in all, only two hundred remained alive.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Kleomenes, when he reached Sparta, advised <lb/>
            the citizens whom he met to submit to Antigonus, and <lb/>
            declared that he himself, whether he lived or died, would <lb/>
            do what was best for Sparta. As he saw the women <lb/>
            running up to those who had accompanied him in his <lb/>
            flight, taking their arms from them and offering them <lb/>
            drink, he retired into his own house, where his mistress, <lb/>
            a girl of a good family of Megalopolis, whom he had taken <lb/>
            to live with him after his wife’s death, came up to him as <lb/>
            usual, and wished to attend upon him on his return from <lb/>
            the wars. But he would neither drink, although exces­ <lb/>
            sively thirsty, nor sit down, weary though he was, but in <lb/>
            his armour as he was took hold of one of the columns with <lb/>
            his hand, leaned his face upon his elbow, and after resting <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρυπτεία</foreign> meant at Sparta a duty or discipline of the young men, <lb/>
            who for a certain time prowled about, watching the country, and en­ <lb/>
            during hardships: intended to season them against fatigue, and, unless <lb/>
            they are much belied, to reduce the number of the helots by assassina­ <lb/>
            tion.—Liddel l and Scott, s.v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            a short time in this posture while he revolved in his mind <lb/>
            every kind of plan, proceeded with his friends to Gythium. <lb/>
            Here they embarked on a ship which had been prepared <lb/>
            in case of such a disaster, and sailed away.</p>
          <p>XXX. After the battle Antigonus advanced upon Sparta, <lb/>
            and made himself master of the city. He treated the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians with kindness, and offered no kind of insult to <lb/>
            their glorious city, but permitted them to retain their <lb/>
            laws and constitution, sacrificed to the gods, and on the <lb/>
            third day withdrew, as he had learned that a terrible war <lb/>
            was raging in Macedonia, and that his kingdom was being <lb/>
            ravaged by the barbarians. His health was already <lb/>
            affected by a disease, which ended in consumption. How­ <lb/>
            ever, he bore up against it, and was able to die gloriously <lb/>
            after having recovered his kingdom, won a great victory <lb/>
            over the barbarians, and killed a great number of them. <lb/>
            Phylarchus tells us that he ruptured his lungs by shouting <lb/>
            in the battle itself, and this seems the most probable <lb/>
            account, but the common report at the time was that <lb/>
            while shouting aloud after the victory, “0 happy day ! " <lb/>
            he brought up a vast quantity of blood and fell sick of <lb/>
            a fever, of which he died. Such was the fate of Antigonus.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Kleomenes sailed from Kythera to another <lb/>
            island, named Ægialea. As he was about to cross over <lb/>
            from this place to Oyrene, one of his friends named <lb/>
            Therykion, a brilliant warrior and a man of lofty, un­ <lb/>
            bending spirit, said to him in private, “My king, we have <lb/>
            lost the opportunity of falling by the noblest of deaths in <lb/>
            the battle, although we publicly declared that Antigonus <lb/>
            should never enter Sparta unless he first passed over <lb/>
            the dead body of the king. However, the course which <lb/>
            is next to this in honour is still open to us. Why should <lb/>
            we recklessly embark on this voyage merely in order to <lb/>
            exchange out- misfortunes at home for others in a distant <lb/>
            country ? If it be not disgraceful for the sons of Herakles <lb/>
            to submit to the successors of Philip and Alexander, we <lb/>
            shall save ourselves a long voyage by delivering ourselves <lb/>
            up to Antigonus, who is probably as much better than <lb/>
            Ptolemy as the Macedonians are better than the Egyptians. <lb/>
            If, on the other hand, we scorn to become the subjects of <lb/>
            our conqueror, why should we become subject to one who <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            has not conquered us, and so prove ourselves inferior to two <lb/>
            men instead of one, by becoming the courtiers of Ptolemy <lb/>
            as well as fleeing before Antigonus ? Is it on account of <lb/>
            your mother that we are going to Egypt ? If so, you will <lb/>
            indeed make a glorious appearance before her, and you <lb/>
            will be much to be envied when she shows her son to the <lb/>
            ladies of Ptolemy's court, an exile instead of a king. <lb/>
            While we are still masters of our own swords, and are <lb/>
            still in sight of Laconia, let us put ourselves beyond the <lb/>
            reach of further misfortunes, and make amends to those <lb/>
            who died for Sparta at Sellasia, rather than settle our­ <lb/>
            selves in Egypt, and inquire whom Antigonus has been <lb/>
            pleased to appoint satrap of Lacedaemon ? "*</p>
          <p>To these remarks of Therykion Kleomenes answered, <lb/>
            “Wretch, do you think that by suicide, the easiest way <lb/>
            out of all difficulties, and one which is within every man's <lb/>
            reach, you will gain a reputation for bravery, and will <lb/>
            not rather be flying before the enemy more disgracefully <lb/>
            than at Sellasia? More powerful men than ourselves <lb/>
            have ere now been defeated, either by their own evil for­ <lb/>
            tune or by the excessive numbers of their enemy: but <lb/>
            the man who refuses to bear fatigue and misery, and the <lb/>
            scorn of men, is conquered by his own cowardice. A self­ <lb/>
            inflicted death ought to be an honourable action, not a <lb/>
            dishonourable means of escape from the necessity for <lb/>
            action. It is disgraceful either to live or to die for one­ <lb/>
            self alone: yet this is the course which you recommend, <lb/>
            namely, that I should fly from my present misery without <lb/>
            ever again performing any useful or honourable action. <lb/>
            I think that it is both your duty and mine, not to despair <lb/>
            of our country : for when all hope fails us, we can easily <lb/>
            find means to die." To this Therykion made no answer, <lb/>
            but as soon as he had an opportunity left Kleomenes, sought <lb/>
            a retired spot upon the beach, and killed himself.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Kleomenes sailed from Ægialea to Libya, <lb/>
            where he was received with royal honours and conducted <lb/>
            to Alexandria. At his first interview Ptolemyt treated <lb/>
            him with mere ordinary politeness, but when by conver­ <note type="footnote"> * This conversation Thirlwall conjectures to have been drawn from <lb/>
            some sophistical exercise. ' History of Greece,’ chap. lxii. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ptolemy Euergetes I. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            sation with him he discovered his great abilities, and is <lb/>
            the familiar intercourse of daily life observed the noble <lb/>
            Spartan simplicity of his habits, and saw with how proud <lb/>
            and unbroken a spirit he bore his misfortunes, he thought <lb/>
            him a much more trustworthy friend than any of the <lb/>
            venal throng of courtiers by whom he was surrounded. <lb/>
            Ptolemy felt real regret at having neglected so great a <lb/>
            man, and allowed Antigonus to gain so much glory and <lb/>
            power at his expense. He showed Kleomenes great <lb/>
            kindness and honour, and encouraged him by promising <lb/>
            that he would place a fleet and a sum of money at his <lb/>
            disposal, which would enable him to return to Greece and <lb/>
            recover his throne. He settled upon him a yearly allow­ <lb/>
            ance of twenty-four talents, the most part of which he <lb/>
            and his friends, who still retained their simple Spartan <lb/>
            habits, distributed in charity among the Greek refugees <lb/>
            who had found an asylum in Egypt.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The elder Ptolemy died before he could accom­ <lb/>
            plish his promise of attempting to restore Kleomenes to <lb/>
            his throne; and amidst the drunken licence of the court <lb/>
            of his successor, the affairs of Kleomenes were entirely <lb/>
            neglected. The young king * was so given up to wine <lb/>
            and women, that his soberest moments were spent in <lb/>
            organising religious ceremonies in the palace, and in <lb/>
            carrying a kettledrum in honour of the mother of the <lb/>
            gods. The whole of the public business of the kingdom <lb/>
            was managed by Agathoklea, the king's mistress, her <lb/>
            mother, and the brothel-keeper Œnanthes. Yet even here <lb/>
            it seems that the assistance of Kleomenes was needed, for <lb/>
            the king, fearing his brother Magas, who through his <lb/>
            mother had great influence with the army, attached him­ <lb/>
            self in a special manner to Kleomenes, and made him a <lb/>
            member of his own secret council, desiring to make use of <lb/>
            him to kill his brother. Kleomenes, although every one <lb/>
            in the court bade him do this, refused, saying that it would <lb/>
            rather be his duty, if it were possible, to raise up more <lb/>
            brothers for the king, to strengthen and confirm his <lb/>
            throne. When Sosibius, the most powerful of the king's <lb/>
            favourites, said that the mercenary troops were not to be <note type="footnote"> * Ptolemy Philopator succeeded his father, Ptolemy Euergetes, <lb/>
            B.O. 222. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            depended upon while Magas was alive, Kleomenes an <lb/>
            swered that he might be quite easy on that score, for <lb/>
            more than three thousand of the mercenaries were Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians, and at the slightest sign from him would seize <lb/>
            their arms and rally round him. This speech was thought <lb/>
            at the time to be a great proof of the loyalty of Kleomenes, <lb/>
            and gave the courtiers a great idea of his power; but <lb/>
            afterwards, as Ptolemy's weakness of character produced <lb/>
            cowardice, and after the manner of empty-headed men <lb/>
            he began to think it safest to suspect every one, these <lb/>
            words made the courtiers fear Kleomenes, as having a <lb/>
            dangerous power over the mercenaries; and many of them <lb/>
            were wont to say, "This man moves among us like a <lb/>
            lion among a flock of sheep." Indeed the demeanour of <lb/>
            Kleomenes in the Egyptian palace, as he calmly and <lb/>
            quietly watched the course of events, naturally suggested <lb/>
            this simile.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Kleomenes gave up asking for a fleet and an <lb/>
            army; but hearing that Antigonus was dead, and that the <lb/>
            Achæans were involved in a war with the Ætolians, <lb/>
            while his presence was imperatively demanded at home, <lb/>
            as all Peloponnesus seemed to be going to ruin, he desired <lb/>
            to be sent home alone with his friends. However, he <lb/>
            could persuade no one to accede to this request, as the <lb/>
            king thought of nothing but his concubines and his revels, <lb/>
            and Sosibius, upon whom devolved the whole conduct of <lb/>
            affairs, although he knew that Kleomenes would be dan­ <lb/>
            gerous and hard to manage if kept in Egypt against his <lb/>
            will, yet feared to set at large so daring and enterprising <lb/>
            a man, who had gained a thorough insight into the utter <lb/>
            rottenness of the Ptolemaic dynasty. For Kleomenes could <lb/>
            not be bribed into remaining quiet, but as the bull * sacred <lb/>
            to Apis, although he is abundantly fed and supplied with <lb/>
            every luxury, yet longs to frisk and range about as <note type="footnote"> * The sacred bull of Memphis was worshipped as a god by the <lb/>
            Egyptians. There were certain signs by which he was recognised to <lb/>
            be the god. At Memphis he had a splendid residence, containing <lb/>
            extensive walks and courts for his amusement. His birthday, which <lb/>
            was celebrated every year, was a day of rejoicing for all Egypt. His <lb/>
            death was a season of public mourning, which lasted till another <lb/>
            sacred bull was discovered by the priests.—Dr. Smithy Classical <lb/>
            Dictionary, s.v. Agis. </note> <lb/>

            nature intended, so he cared for none of their effeminate <lb/>
            pleasures, <lb/>
            "but wore his soul away" <lb/>
            like Achilles, <lb/>
            “Idling at home, though eager for the fray."</p>
          <p>XXXV. While his affairs were in this posture, there <lb/>
            arrived at Alexandria one Nikagoras, a Messenian, who <lb/>
            pretended to be a friend to Kleomenes, but really hated <lb/>
            him bitterly, because he had once sold him a fair estate, <lb/>
            but had never received the money, either because Klec­ <lb/>
            menes intended to cheat him, or because he was unable to <lb/>
            pay him on account of the wars. As this man was dis­ <lb/>
            embarking from his ship, Kleomenes, who happened to be <lb/>
            walking upon the quay, saw him, and at once warmly <lb/>
            greeted him, and inquired what business had brought him <lb/>
            to Egypt. Nikagoras returned his salutation with equal <lb/>
            friendliness, and said that he had brought over some fine <lb/>
            horses for the king's use in the wars. At this Kleomenes <lb/>
            laughed, and said, “I had rather you had brought singing- <lb/>
            girls or beautiful boys, for they are what please the king <lb/>
            best." Nikagoras listened to this remark with a smile, <lb/>
            but a few days afterwards he reminded Kleomenes of the <lb/>
            estate which he had bought, and asked him to pay the <lb/>
            price, saying that he would not have pressed for it if he <lb/>
            had not sustained losses on his cargo. As Kleomenes replied <lb/>
            that all his pension from the king was spent, Nikagoras <lb/>
            in a rage repeated to Sosibius the sarcasm which he had <lb/>
            used. Sosibius was much pleased to hear of it, but as he <lb/>
            wished to have some graver matter of which to accuse <lb/>
            him to the king, he persuaded Nikagoras to write a letter <lb/>
            before he left Egypt, accusing Kleomenes of a design to <lb/>
            make himself master of Cyrene, if the king put him in <lb/>
            possession of a fleet and army. Nikagoras wrote the letter, <lb/>
            and sailed away to Greece; and after forty days Sosibius <lb/>
            took the letter and showed it to Ptolemy, as though he <lb/>
            had just received it. By this means he so wrought upon <lb/>
            the young king's mind, that he confined Kleomenes in <lb/>
            a large house, and placed a guard before all the doors, <lb/>
            although he continued to allow him his pension as before.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. This treatment was in itself sufficiently <lb/>

            grievous to Kleomenes, and made him fear that something <lb/>
            worse was in store. Now Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermes, <lb/>
            who was a friend of the king's, had always been on good <lb/>
            terms with Kleomenes, and they had been in the habit of <lb/>
            conversing familiarly together. This man now, at Kleo­ <lb/>
            ment s's own request, came to see him, and talked amicably <lb/>
            with him, explaining away all which had appeared sus­ <lb/>
            picious about the king's conduct. As he was leaving the <lb/>
            house, without noticing that Kleomenes had followed him <lb/>
            to the door, he harshly reproved the guard for keeping <lb/>
            such careless watch over so great and savage a monster. <lb/>
            Kleomenes himself heard him say this, and before Ptolemy <lb/>
            observed him, retired and told his friends what he had <lb/>
            heard. They at once abandoned all hope, and fiercely <lb/>
            determined to avenge themselves on Ptolemy for his <lb/>
            wickedness and arrogance, and die as became Spartans, <lb/>
            not wait to be butchered like fat cattle. They thought <lb/>
            that it was intolerable that Kleomenes should have dis­ <lb/>
            dained to make terms with Antigonus, who was a soldier <lb/>
            and a man of action, and should sit waiting for the pleasure <lb/>
            of a timbrel-playing king, who as soon as he was at leisure <lb/>
            from his kettle-drummings and revellings, intended to <lb/>
            murder him.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. As soon as they had formed this resolution, <lb/>
            as it happened that Ptolemy had gone to Canopus, they <lb/>
            spread a report that the king had given orders for the <lb/>
            guard to be removed. Next, observing the custom of the <lb/>
            kings of Egypt, which was to send a dinner and various <lb/>
            presents to those who are about to be released from <lb/>
            confinement, the friends of Kleomenes prepared many <lb/>
            presents of this kind and sent them to him, deceiving the <lb/>
            guard, who believed that they had been sent by the king. <lb/>
            Kleomenes offered sacrifice, and gave the soldiers on <lb/>
            guard an ample share of the meat, while he himself put <lb/>
            on a garland and feasted with his friends. It is said that <lb/>
            they proceeded to action sooner than had been originally <lb/>
            intended, because Kleomenes perceived that one of the <lb/>
            servants who was in the plot had left the house, though <lb/>
            he had only gone to visit his mistress. Fearing that he <lb/>
            meant to denounce them, as soon as it was noon, and the <lb/>
            guard were sleeping off their wine, Kleomenes put on his <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>E</unclear> </note> <lb/>

            tunic, slit up the seam over the right shoulder, seized his <lb/>
            naked sword, and sallied forth with his friends similarly <lb/>
            arrayed, thirteen in all. One of them named Hippitas, <lb/>
            who was lame, came boldly out with the rest, but finding <lb/>
            that they proceeded slowly to enable him to keep up with <lb/>
            them, begged them to kill him, and not spoil their plot by <lb/>
            waiting for a useless man. It happened that one of the <lb/>
            Alexandrians was leading a horse past the door; they at <lb/>
            once took it, placed Hippitas on its back, and ran quickly <lb/>
            through the streets, calling upon the populace to rise and <lb/>
            set itself free. The people, it appears, had spirit enough <lb/>
            to admire Kleomenes, but no one dared to follow or help <lb/>
            him. Three of the conspirators met Ptolemy, the son of <lb/>
            Chrysermes, coming out of the palace, and killed him: <lb/>
            and when another Ptolemy, the governor of the city, <lb/>
            drove towards them in a chariot, they rushed to meet him, <lb/>
            scattered his body-guard, dragged him out of the chariot <lb/>
            and killed him. They now made their way to the citadel, <lb/>
            intending to break open the prison and make use of the <lb/>
            prisoners to swell their numbers; but the guardians of <lb/>
            the prison had closed the gates effectually before they <lb/>
            arrived, and Kleomenes, failing in this attempt, roamed <lb/>
            through the city without finding any one to join him, as <lb/>
            all fled in terror at his approach. At last he stopped, and <lb/>
            said to his friends, " No wonder women bear rule in a city <lb/>
            where men fear to be free." He now bade them all end <lb/>
            their lives worthily of him and of themselves. First of <lb/>
            all Hippitas, at his own request, was struck dead by one <lb/>
            of the younger men; after which, each man deliberately <lb/>
            and fearlessly inflicted upon himself a mortal stab, with <lb/>
            the exception of Panteus, who had been the first to break <lb/>
            into the city of Megalopolis. This man, the handsomest <lb/>
            and best warrior of all the Spartan youth, was especially <lb/>
            loved by the king, and was ordered by him to wait till <lb/>
            all the rest were dead, and then to put an end to his life. <lb/>
            When they had all fallen, Panteus pricked each man with <lb/>
            his dagger, to make certain that none of them were alive. <lb/>
            When he pricked Kleomenes in the ankle he saw his face <lb/>
            contract. He kissed him and sat down beside him until <lb/>
            he was quite dead, and then, embracing the corpse, killed <lb/>
            himself upon it.</p><pb n="51"/>
            
          <p>XXXVIII. Thus perished Kleomenes, after having <lb/>
            reigned over Sparta for thirteen years, as described above. <lb/>
            The news of his death was soon bruited abroad, and <lb/>
            Kratesiklea, although a woman of high spirit, was so <lb/>
            overcome by her misfortune that she embraced the children <lb/>
            and wept for Kleomenes. Upon this the eldest boy leaped <lb/>
            up, and before any one knew what he was going to do, <lb/>
            threw himself headlong from the roof of the house. He <lb/>
            was much hurt, but not killed, and was taken up, crying <lb/>
            out and reproaching his friends because they would not <lb/>
            allow him to die. When Ptolemy heard the news, he <lb/>
            ordered the corpse of Kleomenes to be flayed and exposed <lb/>
            on a gibbet, and his children, his mother, and her atten­ <lb/>
            dants to be put to death. Among these was the wife of <lb/>
            Panteus, the fairest and noblest-looking of them all. She <lb/>
            and her husband had only recently been married when <lb/>
            their misfortunes began. When Panteus left Sparta she <lb/>
            wished to accompany him, but her parents would not <lb/>
            allow her to do so, and locked her up in their house. <lb/>
            But she shortly afterwards procured a horse and a little <lb/>
            money, and made her escape by night. She rode all the <lb/>
            way to Taenarum, where she found a ship about to sail to <lb/>
            Egypt, on board of which she crossed the sea, joined her <lb/>
            husband, and cheerfully shared his exile. She now, when <lb/>
            the soldiers came to lead away Kratesiklea, took her by <lb/>
            the hand, held up the train of her dress, and bade her be <lb/>
            of good courage; although Kratesiklea herself was not <lb/>
            afraid to die, but only asked one favour, that she might <lb/>
            die before her children. When they arrived at the place <lb/>
            of execution, the children were first killed before the eyes <lb/>
            of Kratesiklea, and then she herself. All she said was : <lb/>
            “My children, whither have you come ? " The wife of <lb/>
            Panteus, being a tall and robust woman, girded up her <lb/>
            robe, and arranged each of the corpses as decently as her <lb/>
            means permitted. After she had paid the last offices to <lb/>
            each of them she prepared herself for death, bared her <lb/>
            neck, allowed no one to approach her but the executioner, <lb/>
            and died like a heroine, without requiring any one to <lb/>
            arrange her corpse. Thus the modesty which she had <lb/>
            observed throughout her life, did not desert her even when <lb/>
            the was dead. <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note></p><pb n="52"/>
            
          <p>XXXIX. Thus gloriously, even during its last days, <lb/>
            did Lacedæmon, whose women are taught to vie with <lb/>
            men in courage, prove that virtue is superior to Fortune. <lb/>
            A few days afterwards, those who were watching the <lb/>
            body of Kleomenes as it hung upon the gibbet, observed a <lb/>
            large snake which wound its body round his head and <lb/>
            covered his face, so that no ravenous bird could alight <lb/>
            upon it. On hearing this, the king was struck with <lb/>
            superstitious terror, fearing that he had offended the gods <lb/>
            by the murder of one who was evidently a favourite of <lb/>
            Heaven, and something more than mortal. All the ladies <lb/>
            of his court began to offer sacrifices of atonement for his <lb/>
            sin, and the people of Alexandria went to the place and <lb/>
            worshipped Kleomenes as a hero and child of the gods, <lb/>
            until they were restrained by the learned, who explained <lb/>
            that as from the corrupted bodies of oxen are bred bees, <lb/>
            from horses wasps, and from asses beetles, so human <lb/>
            bodies, by the melting and gathering together of the <lb/>
            juices of the marrow, produce serpents. This was observed <lb/>
            by the ancients, who therefore considered that of all <lb/>
            animals the serpent was peculiarly appropriated to <lb/>
            heroes.</p><pb n="53"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. HAVING finished the first History,. it remains to con­ <lb/>
            template equal calamities in the pair of Roman Lives, in <lb/>
            a comparison of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus with Agis <lb/>
            and Kleomenes.t Tiberius and Caius were the sons of <note type="footnote">* Plutarch calls the Lives of Agis and Kleomenes a History, though <lb/>
            he says in his Life of Alexander (c. 1) that his object is not to write <lb/>
            Histories (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίστορίαι</foreign>), but Lives (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βίοι</foreign>). But the Lives of the two Spartan <lb/>
            reforming kings may consistently enough be called a History, when <lb/>
            contrasted with the Lives of the two Roman reforming tribunes. <lb/>
            Plutarch's notion of History as contrasted with Biography appears <lb/>
            pretty plainly from the first chapter of his Life of Alexander. A <lb/>
            complete view of the events in the Lives of Alexander and Caius <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar would have formed, according to his notion, a History; <lb/>
            but he does not aim at this completeness : he selects out of the events <lb/>
            of their lives such as best show the character of the men, whether the <lb/>
            events be of great political importance or of none at all, and this <lb/>
            method of treating the subject he calls a Life. I believe the word <lb/>
            Biography is a modern invention. The distinction between History <lb/>
            and Annals, though the words have sometimes been used indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately (c. 3, notes), is clearly expressed by the Roman historian <lb/>
            Sempronius Asellio, as quoted by Aulus Gellius (v. 18). </note><note type="footnote"> † Most of Plutarch's extant Lives run in parallels, whence they are <lb/>
            entitled Parallel Lives. He compares a Greek with a Roman: thus <lb/>
            he compares Alexander with Caius Julius Cæsar, and Demosthenes <lb/>
            with Cicero. The beginning of the Life of Tiberius Gracchus is <lb/>
            somewhat abrupt, after Plutarch's fashion. He had no regular plan <lb/>
            for beginning and ending his stories, and thus he avoids the sameness <lb/>
            which is so wearisome in a Dictionary of Biography. The career of <lb/>
            Tiberius and Caius Gracchus was the same, and accordingly Plutarch <lb/>
            considers their lives as one; and he has found a parallel to them <lb/>
            in two Spartan kings, who were also reformers, Agis IV. and <lb/>
            Kleomenes IIL </note><note type="footnote"> Agis became king of Sparta B.O. 244, and reigned only four years: <lb/>
            his colleague in the first part of his reign was Leonidas II., and after­ <lb/>
            wards Kleombrotus. Agis attempted to restore the old institutions of <lb/>
            Lykurgus which had fallen into disuse. Wealth had become accumu­ <lb/>
            lated in a few hands. He proposed to adjust the disputes between </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            Tiberius Gracchus,* who was censor and twice consul, <lb/>
            and celebrated two triumphs, but was still more distin­ <note type="footnote"> debtor and creditor by the short method of abolishing debts; and he <lb/>
            proposed to restore the spirit of the old institutions by dividing all the <lb/>
            ands in equal lots among the Spartan citizens, the chief class in the <lb/>
            state; and by assigning lots also to the Periœki, who were in the <lb/>
            relation of subjects. He carried the project for the abolition of debts, <lb/>
            but before he c ould accomplish the rest of his reforms, he was thrown <lb/>
            into prison and strangled there. His grandmother and mother, both <lb/>
            of whom had favoured his schemes of reform, were strangled at the <lb/>
            same time. He was about twenty-four years of age when he died. <lb/>
            His reform was not a revolution, but an attempt to restore the old <lb/>
            constitution. </note><note type="footnote"> Kleomenes III., King of Sparta reigned from B.C. 236 to B.O. 220. <lb/>
            In the first part of his reign, the infant son of Agis IV., und afterwards <lb/>
            Archidamus V., the brother of Agis IV., were his colleagues. <lb/>
            Leonidas II., who had been deposed by Agis, had returned to Sparta <lb/>
            during the absence of Agis on a military expedition, and he was most <lb/>
            a five in bringing about the death of Agis. Leonidas compelled the <lb/>
            widow of Agis to marry his son Kleomenes, who was instructed by his <lb/>
            wife in the views and designs of Agis. Thus Kleomenes also became <lb/>
            a reformer, and attempted to restore the institutions of Lykurgus. <lb/>
            But his measures were violent. He is charged with poisoning his <lb/>
            infant colleague, the son of the widow whom he married, and with <lb/>
            other wrongful acts. He was defeated at the head of the Spartan <lb/>
            army by Antigonus in the great battle of Sellasia B.C. 222, and fled to <lb/>
            Egypt, where he was kindly received by Ptolemæus IIL (Euergetes) <lb/>
            the king. Ptolemæus IV. (Philopator) the successor of Euergetes, put <lb/>
            Kleomenes in prison, but he contrived to get out and attempted to <lb/>
            make a revolution in Alexandria. Failing in the attempt Kleomenes <lb/>
            killed himself. "In this manner," says Polybius, " fell Kleomenes ; a <lb/>
            prince whose manners were dexterous and insinuating, as his capacity <lb/>
            in the administration of affairs was great: and who, to express his <lb/>
            character in a word, was most admirably formed by nature both for a <lb/>
            general and a king" (Polybius, v. c. 39; Hampton's Translation, v. <lb/>
            chap. 4). Plutarch in his comparison of Agis and Kleomenes with <lb/>
            Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, concludes that “Tiberius in virtue <lb/>
            surpassed the rest, that the youth Agis was guilty of the fewest faults, <lb/>
            and that in doing and daring Caius was much inferior to Kleomenes;" <lb/>
            which appears to be a correct judgment. </note><note type="footnote"> * His complete name was Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. The <lb/>
            Sempronia gens contained the families of the Atratini, Gracchi, and <lb/>
            Pitiones. The Gracchi were plebeians, and the Atratiui patricians: <lb/>
            the order of the Pitiunes is uncertain. The name of the Gracchi is <lb/>
            best known from the political career of the two brothers, whose <lb/>
            measures were the immediate cause of the civil disturbances which <lb/>
            ended in the establishment of the Imperial power. Tiberius Gracchus, <lb/>
            the father, was tribune of the plebs B.C. 187, consul B.C. 177 and a <lb/>
            second time in B.C. 163: he was censor B.C. 169. Tiberius Gracchus </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            guished for his personal character, to which he owed the <lb/>
            honour cf having for his wife Cornelia, the daughter of <lb/>
            Scipio,* the conqueror of Hannibal, whom he married <lb/>
            after Scipio's death, though Tiberius had not been a <lb/>
            friend of Scipio, but rather a political opponent. A story <lb/>
            is told that Tiberius once caught a couple of snakes t in <lb/>
            his bed, and the diviners, after consulting on the matter, <lb/>
            told him that he must not kill both nor yet let both go; <lb/>
            as to the male, they said, if it were killed, the death <lb/>
            of Tiberius would follow, and if the female were killed, <lb/>
            Cornelia would die. Now Tiberius, who loved his wife <lb/>
            and thought it would be more suitable for him to die first, <lb/>
            as he was an elderly man and his wife was still young, <lb/>
            killed the male snake and let the female go; and he died <note type="footnote">had his first triumph in B.O. 178 for his victories over the Celtiberians <lb/>

            c. 11). In his fir-t consulship Gracchus had Sardinia assigned for his <lb/>
            province, and he defeated the Sardinians in a great battle. He was <lb/>
            continued in his province as proconsul, and he completely subdued <lb/>
            the island (Liv. 41, c. 21), for which he had a triumph which appears <lb/>
            to be commemorated by an extant medal (Rasche, Lexicon Rei <lb/>
            Numariæ). Cicero numbers Tiberius among the Roman orators <lb/>
            (Brutus, c. 20). </note><note type="footnote"> * Publius Cornelius Scipio defeated Hannibal at the battle of Zama <lb/>
            in the territory of Carthage B.C. 202. He died B.O. 183 in his retire­ <lb/>
            ment at Liternum in Campania. Though Tiberius Gracchus, the <lb/>
            father, was not on friendly terms with Scipio, yet during his tribunato <lb/>
            B.O. 187 he prevented Scipio from being tried on certain frivolous <lb/>
            charges brought against him by the tribunes, and owing to this <lb/>
            interference of Gracchus, the greatest commander that Rome had yet <lb/>
            ssen, was allowed to spend the remainder of his days in quiet privacy. <lb/>
            (Liv. 38, c. 50, &amp;c. ; Cicero, De Provinciis Consularibus, c. 8.) </note><note type="footnote"> † This story of the snakes is told by Cicero in his treatise on <lb/>
            Divination (i. 18, ii. 29). He says that Tiberius died a few d ays after <lb/>
            he had let the female snake go, and he refers as his authority to a <lb/>
            letter of Caius Gracchus to M. Pomponius:—“I wonder," says <lb/>
            Cicero, “if the letting loose the female was to cause the death of <lb/>
            Tiberius, and letting loose the male was to cause the death of <lb/>
            Cornelia, that he let either of them go. For Caius does not say that <lb/>
            the haruspices said any thing of what would happen if neither snake <lb/>
            was let go." To the objection, that the death of Gracchus did follow <lb/>
            the letting loose of the female snake, Cicero replies that he supposes <lb/>
            he must have died of some sudden attack, and he adds that the <lb/>
            haruspices are not so unlucky but that their predictions sometimes <lb/>
            happen to come ti ue. </note> <lb/>

            no long time after, leaving twelve children by Cornelia, <lb/>
            Cornelia undertook the care of her family and her hus­ <lb/>
            band's property, and showed herself so prudent, so fond <lb/>
            of her children, and of so exalted a character, that Tiberius <lb/>
            was judged to have done well in dying in place of such a <lb/>
            wife. And though Ptolemæus,* the king of Egypt, in­ <lb/>
            vited Cornelia to share his crown, and wooed her for his <lb/>
            wife, she refused the offer and continued a widow. All <lb/>
            her children died before her, except one daughter, who <lb/>
            married the younger Scipio,† and two sons, of whom I am <note type="footnote"> * I do not know if this offer of King Ptolemæus is noticed by any <lb/>
            other writer. It is not certain whether it was Ptolemæus VI. Philo­ <lb/>
            metor or his younger brother Ptolemæus VII. Euergetes II. Their <lb/>
            two reigns lasted 64 years from B.O. 181 to B.O. 117. Philometor died <lb/>
            B.C. 146 and was succeeded by Euergetes who died B.C. 117. The <lb/>
            death of Tiberius Gracchus the father is not ascertained. He married <lb/>
            his wife Cornelia after B.C. 183 and he was consul B.C. 163. His son <lb/>
            Tiberius, who was killed B.O. 133, was not thirty years old at the time <lb/>
            and therefore was born about B.C. 163. Caius, who was nine years <lb/>
            younger, was born about B.O. 154. It is not known whether Caius was <lb/>
            the youngest child of Cornelia. Ptolemæus Philometor went to Rome <lb/>
            B.C. 163, being driven out of his kingdom by his younger brother <lb/>
            Euergetes, and he was well received by the senate. His brother also <lb/>
            made a journey to Rome in the following year, B.O. 162. In B.C. 154 <lb/>
            Ptolemæus Euergetes was at Rome for the second time, and he obtained <lb/>
            the aid of the senate against his brother. Both the brothers may have <lb/>
            seen Cornelia at Rome, but probably during the lifetime of her husband. <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus, the son-in-law of Cornelia, was sent on an embassy <lb/>
            to Alexandria to Euergetes B.O. 143. An Egyptian king might wish to <lb/>
            strengthen himself at Rome by an alliance with the illustrious families <lb/>
            of the Gracchi and the Scipios; but it is impossible to determine which <lb/>
            of these two kings was the suitor. Philometor is spoken of as a mild <lb/>
            and generous prince: Euergetes, who was also called Physcon, or Big­ <lb/>
            belly, was a cruel sensualist. The daughter of Scipio Africanus, the <lb/>
            conqueror of Hannibal, might well decline a marriage with him, and <lb/>
            any Egyptian alliance would have been viewed as a degradation to a <lb/>
            noble Roman matron. The portrait of Physcon is given in Rosellini’s <lb/>
            work on Egypt, from the ancient monuments, and he is very far from <lb/>
            looking like a winning suitor. Kaltwasser assumes that it was Ptole­ <lb/>
            mæus Philometor who made the offer to Cornelia ; and he adds that he <lb/>
            was also called Lathyrus; but this is a mistake ; Lathyrus was the <lb/>
            surname of Ptolemæus VIII. Soter II., the son of Physcon. He has not <lb/>
            examined the chronology of these two kings. </note><note type="footnote"> † This was Publius Cornelius Scipio .Emilianus Africanus Minor. <lb/>

            which they owed, perhaps, more to their excellent educa­ <lb/>
            tion than even to their natural good qualities.</p>
          <p>II. Now as the figures of the Dioscuri,* whether sculp­ <lb/>
            tured or painted, though resembling one another, still <lb/>
            present such an amount of difference as appears when <lb/>
            we contrast a boxer with a runner, so in these two youths, <lb/>
            with all their resemblance in courage, temperance, <lb/>
            generous temper, eloquence, and magnanimity, yet great <lb/>
            contrasts also in their actions and polity blossomed forth, <lb/>
            so to speak, and displayed themselves, which I think it <lb/>
            well to set forth. First in the character and expression <lb/>
            of his countenance, and in his movements, Tiberius was <lb/>
            mild and sedate; Caius was animated and impetuous. <lb/>
            When Tiberius harangued the people, he would stand <lb/>
            composedly on one spot; but Caius was the first Roman <lb/>
            who moved about on the rostra t and pulled his toga <lb/>
            from his shoulder while he was speaking, as Kleon ‡ the <note type="footnote"> son of Æmilius Paulus took the name of his adopted father, P. Cornelius <lb/>
            Scipio, to which was added, according to the usage, the name of <lb/>
            Æmilianus, which marked the gene to which he belonged by birth. <lb/>
            It was after the destruction of Carthage that he acquired the additional <lb/>
            name or title of Africanus, like his adoptive grandfather, from whom <lb/>
            he is usually distinguished by the addition of the name Minor or <lb/>
            younger. The daughter of Cornelia, whom he married, was named <lb/>
            Sempronia. She was ugly and bore her husband no children, and they <lb/>
            did not live harmoniously together. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 20.) As to <lb/>
            the Roman names see the note on Marius, c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> * The Greek name for Castor and Pollux, who were the sons of <lb/>
            Jupiter and Leda. Pollux was a boxer, and Castor distinguished for <lb/>

            rally placed side by side with their appropriate characters, to which <lb/>
            Plutarch alludes. </note><note type="footnote"> † Plutarch uses the Greek word Bema (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βῆμα</foreign>), which is the name <lb/>
            for the elevated stone station in the Pnyx from which the Athenian <lb/>
            orators addressed the public assemblies. The place from which the <lb/>
            Roman orators addressed the public assemblies was called the Rostra, <lb/>
            or the beaks, because it was ornamented with the beaks of the ships <lb/>
            which the Romans took from the people of Antium. (Liv. 8, c. 14.) <lb/>
            The Rostra were in the Forum, and in a position between the Comiti <unclear/>,m <lb/>
            and that part of the Forum which was appropriated to the meeting of <lb/>
            the Roman tribes. (See Caius Gracchus, a 5.) </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The history of this Athenian demagogue is in Thucydides, iL xc. </note> <lb/>

            Athenian is said to have been the first popular orator at <lb/>
            Athens who threw his cloak from him and struck his <lb/>
            thigh. The manner of Caius was awe-striking and <lb/>
            vehemently impassioned; the manner of Tiberius was <lb/>
            more pleading and calculated to stir the sympathies: the <lb/>
            language of Tiberius was pure and elaborated to great <lb/>
            nicety ; that of Caius was persuasive and exuberant. In <lb/>
            like manner, in his mode of life and his table, Tiberius <lb/>
            was frugal and simple; compared with others, Caius was <lb/>
            moderate and austere, but, contrasted with his brother, <lb/>
            luxurious and curious, as we see by Drusus charging him <lb/>
            with buying silver dolphins* at the price of twelve hundred <lb/>
            and fifty drachmæ for every pound that they weighed. <lb/>
            The differences in their character corresponded to their <lb/>
            respective styles of speaking : Tiberius was moderate and <lb/>
            mild; Caius was rough and impetuous, and it often hap­ <lb/>
            pened that in his harangues he was carried away by <lb/>
            passion, contrary to his judgment, and his voice became <lb/>
            shrill, and he fell to abuse, and grew confused in his dis­ <lb/>
            course. To remedy this fault, he employed Licinius, a <lb/>
            well-educated slave, who used to stand behind him when <lb/>
            he was speaking, with a musical instrument,t such as is <note type="footnote"> The play of Aristophanes called “The Knights” (‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππη̂ς</foreign>) is directed <lb/>
            against him. By his turbulent oratory he acquired some distinction at <lb/>
            Athens during the Peloponnesian war, after the deat.i of Perikles. (See <lb/>
            Plutarch, Nikias, c. 2, 3.) </note><note type="footnote"> * The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">δελφι̂νας</foreign>, dolphins, which some critics would <lb/>

            Plinius (Nat. Hist. 33, c. 11) speaks of these dolphins, though he does <lb/>
            not say what they were. The alteration in the text is quite necessary. The <lb/>
            dolphins were probably ornaments attached to some piece of furniture. <lb/>
            Plutarch gives the value in drachmæ the usual Greek silver coin, and <lb/>
            the money of reckoning: the usual Roman money of reckoning was <lb/>
            the sestertius. Plinius mentions the value of these dolphins at 5000 <lb/>
            sestertii a pound, which would make 4 sestertii equivalent to a drachma. <lb/>
            The drachma is reckoned at about 91d. and the sestertius at 2d. under <lb/>
            the Republic. </note><note type="footnote"> † The original is literally “an instrument for practising the voice <lb/>

            pipe as some have done. Cicero (De Orat. iii. 60) tells the same story <lb/>
            somewhat differently. He says that this Licinius was a lettered marl <lb/>
            (literatus homo), and that he used to stand behind Caius Gracchus, <lb/>
            yet so as to be concealed, with an ivory pipe (fistula), when Gracchus <lb/>
            was addressing the public assemblies; his duty was to produce a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            used as an accompaniment to singing, and whenever he <lb/>
            observed that the voice of Caius was becoming harsh and <lb/>
            broken through passion, he would produce a soft note, <lb/>
            upon which Caius would immediately moderate his <lb/>
            vehemence and his voice, and become calm.</p>
          <p>III. Such were the contrasts between the two brothers, <lb/>
            but in courage against the enemy, in justice to the subject <lb/>
            nations, in vigilance in the discharge of public duties, <lb/>
            and in self-control over indulgence, they were both alike. <lb/>
            Tiberius was the elder by nine years, a circumstance <lb/>
            which caused their political career to be separated by an <lb/>
            interval, and greatly contributed to the failure of their <lb/>
            measures, for they did not rise to eminence at the same <lb/>
            time nor unite their strength in one effort, which from their <lb/>
            union, would have been powerful and irresistible. I must <lb/>
            accordingly speak of each separately, and of the elder first.</p>
          <p>IV. Immediately on attaining man's estate, Tiberius <lb/>
            had so great a reputation that he was elected a member <lb/>
            of the college of augurs,. rather for his excellent <lb/>
            qualities than his noble birth. Appius Claudius,t a man <lb/>
            of consular and censorian rank, who in consideration of <note type="footnote">suitable note either for the purpose of rousing his master when his tone <lb/>
            was too low or lowering his tone when it was too vehement. (See also <lb/>
            Dion, Fragmenta, p. 39, ed. Reimarus.) </note><note type="footnote"> * An augur was one who ascertained the will of the gods by certain <lb/>
            signs, but more particularly the flights of birds. The institution of <lb/>
            augurs was coeval with the Roman state, and as the augural cere­ <lb/>
            monial was essential to the validity of all elections, the body of augurs <lb/>
            possessed great political influence. The college of augurs at this time <lb/>
            consisted of nine members, who filled up the vacancies that occurred in <lb/>
            their body. A member of the college held his office for life, and the <lb/>
            places were objects of ambition to all the great personages in the state. <lb/>
            They were not appropriated to a class of priests: they were held by <lb/>
            persons who had no other priestly character. Cicero, tor instance, was <lb/>
            an augur. The Roman system of placing the highest religious offices <lb/>
            not in the hands of a priestly class, but in the hands of persons who <lb/>
            had held and might still hold civil offices, perhaps possessed some <lb/>
            advantages. There are many valuable remarks on the Roman Auguria <lb/>
            and Auspicia in Rubino, Untersuchungen über Römische Verfassung. </note><note type="footnote"> † Appius Claudius Pulcher was a member of the Claudia gens, and <lb/>
            belonged to an old patrician family, which had long been opposed to <lb/>
            all the pretensions of the plebeian order. He was consul B.O. 143. He <lb/>
            did not long survive his son-in-law. Cicero (Brutus, 28) enumerates <lb/>
            him among the orators of Rome; he observes that he spoke fluently, </note> <lb/>
            but with rather too much heat, <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            his dignity was appointed Princeps Senatus,* and in <lb/>
            loftiness of character surpassed all his contemporaries, <lb/>
            showed his opinion of Tiberius; for when the augurs were <lb/>
            feasting together, Appius addressed Tiberius with many <lb/>
            expressions of friendship, and solicited him to take his <lb/>
            daughter to wife. Tiberius gladly accepted the proposal, <lb/>
            and the agreement was forthwith made. As Appius was <lb/>
            entering the door on his return home, he called out to his <lb/>
            wife in a loud voice, " Antistia, I have given our daughter <lb/>
            Claudia to wife." Antistia in surprise replied, “What is <lb/>
            the need or the hurry, unless you have got Tiberius Grac­ <lb/>
            chus for her husband ? ” I am aware that some writers <lb/>
            tell this story of Tiberius the father of the Gracchi and of <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus; but the majority have the story as I <lb/>
            give it, and Polybius † says that after the death of Scipio <lb/>
            Africanus, his kinsmen selected Tiberius to be the hus­ <lb/>
            band of Cornelia, and that she had neither been given in <lb/>
            marriage nor betrothed by her father in his lifetime. <lb/>
            Now the younger Tiberius served in the army in Africa ‡<note type="footnote"> * The rank of Princeps Senatus was given at one time by the censors <lb/>
            to the oldest of those who had filled the office of censor (Liv. 27, o. 11), <lb/>

            of Livius, it was given to any person whom the censors thought most fit; <lb/>
            and it was for the same person to be reappointed at each successive lus­ <lb/>

            tion, though it had once been a substantive office. The title was <lb/>
            retained under the Empire by the Emperors; and Princeps is the title by <lb/>
            which Tacitus designates Augustusand his successor Tiberius. The title <lb/>

            emulation and practical imitation. Tiberius, also, soon <lb/>
            surpassed all the young soldiers in attention to discipline <lb/>
            and in courage; and he was the first to mount the enemy's <lb/>

            Roman generals. Accordingly in adverse fortune and <lb/>
            critical affairs the prudence and courage of Tiberius <lb/>
            became the more conspicuous, and not only his prudence <lb/>
            and courage, but what was truly admirable, his considera­ <lb/>
            tion and respect for his general, whose reverses almost <lb/>
            made him forget who he was. Having been defeated in <lb/>
            several great battles, Mancinus attempted to leave his <lb/>
            camp by night and make a retreat. The Numantines, <lb/>
            however, perceived his movements, and immediately <lb/>
            seizing the camp, fell on the Romans in their flight and <lb/>
            killed those in the rear; and at last, when they were <lb/>
            surrounding the whole army and driving them to un­ <lb/>
            favourable ground, from which escape was impossible, <lb/>
            Mancinus, despairing of all chance of saving himself by <lb/>
            resistance, sent to treat for a truce and terms of peace. <lb/>
            But the Numantines declared that they would trust <lb/>
            nobody except Tiberius, and they bade Mancinus send <lb/>
            him. The Numantines had come to this resolution as well <lb/>
            from a knowledge of the young man's character, for there <lb/>
            was much talk about him in this campaign, as from the <lb/>
            remembrance of his father Tiberius, who, after carrying <lb/>
            on war against the Iberians and subduing many of them, <lb/>
            made peace with the Numantines, and always kept the <lb/>
            Roman people to a fair and just observance of it. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly Tiberius was sent, and had a conference with the <lb/>
            Numantines, in which he got some favourable conditions, <lb/>
            and, by making some concessions, obtained a truce, and <lb/>
            thus saved twenty thousand Roman citizens, besides the <lb/>
            slaves and camp-followers.</p>
          <p>VI. All the property that was taken in the camp be­ <lb/>
            came the booty of the Numantines; and among it were <lb/>
            the tablets of Tiberius, which contained the entries and <lb/>
            accounts of his administration as quæstor. Being very <lb/>
            anxious to recover them, though the army had already <lb/>
            advanced some distance, he returned to the city with <lb/>
            three or four companions, and calling forth the magistrates <lb/>
            of Numantia, he begged to have back his tablets, in order <lb/>
            that his enemies might not have an opportunity of ca­ <lb/>
            lumniating him if he should not be able to give an account <note type="footnote"> situated in Old Castile on the Douro, but it is not certain what modern <lb/>
            site corresponds to it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            of his administration of the public money. The Numan­ <lb/>
            tines were pleased at the opportunity of doing him a <lb/>
            service, and invited him to enter the city; and when he <lb/>
            stood hesitating, they came near and clung to his hands, <lb/>
            and were urgent in entreating him not to consider them <lb/>
            as enemies any longer, but as friends, and to trust them. <lb/>
            Tiberius determined to do so, as he was very anxious to <lb/>
            get the tablets, and feared to irritate the Numantines if <lb/>
            he should seem to distrust them. When he had entered <lb/>
            the city, the first thing they did was to prepare an enter­ <lb/>
            tainment, and to urge him most importunately to sit <lb/>
            down and eat with them. They afterwards gave him <lb/>
            back the tablets, and bade him take anything else he <lb/>
            liked. Tiberius, however, would have nothing except the <lb/>
            frankincense which he wanted for the public sacrifices, <lb/>
            and after a friendly embrace he took his leave of them.</p>
          <p>VII. On his return to Rome, the whole transaction was <lb/>
            greatly blamed as dishonourable and disgraceful to Rome. <lb/>
            The kinsfolk and friends of the soldiers, who were a <lb/>
            large part of the people, crowded about Tiberius, charging <lb/>
            the general with the disgraceful part of what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened, and declaring that Tiberius had been the saviour <lb/>
            of so many citizens. Those who were the most vexed at <lb/>
            the events in Iberia,* recommended that they should <note type="footnote">* The Romans used the words Iberia and Hispania indifferently to <lb/>
            denote the Spanish Peninsula. From the word Hispania the Spaniards <lb/>
            have formed the name España, the French Espagne, and the English <lb/>
            Spain. The river Ebro, which the Romans called Iberus, is a remnant <lb/>
            of this old name. The Iberi originally occupied a part of Southern <lb/>
            Gaul (the modem France) as far east as the Rhone, where they bordered <lb/>
            upon the Ligurians. They were a different people from the Celtæ, who <lb/>
            in the time of C. Julius Cæsar occupied one of the three great divisions <lb/>
            of Gaul. (Gallic War, i. 1.) The Celtæ, at some unknown time, <lb/>
            crossed the Pyrenees and mingling with the Iberi, formed the Celtiberi, <lb/>
            a warlike race with whom the Romans had many wars, and over whom <lb/>
            Tiberius, the father of Tiberius Gracchus, gained a victory. (Note, c. <lb/>
            1.) It is maintained by William Humboldt in his work on the original <lb/>
            inhabitants of Spain (Prüfung der Untersuchungen iiber die Urbewohner <lb/>
            Hispaniens) that the present Basque is a remnant of the Iberian lan­ <lb/>
            guage, which he supposes not to have been confined to Spain, but to <lb/>
            have spread over part of Italy, the south of France, and the islands of <lb/>
            Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Thuoydides (vi. 2) says that the Sicani, <lb/>
            or old inhabitants of Sicily, were Iberi who were driven from the river <lb/>
            Sicanus in Iberia by the Ligurians.</note> <lb/>

            follow the example of their ancestors ; for in former times <lb/>
            the Romans stripped of their clothes and delivered up to <lb/>
            the Samnites* those who had purchased their safety on <note type="footnote">The name Iberia was also given by the Greeks and Romans to a <lb/>
            part of that mountainous region, commonly called the Caucasus, which <lb/>
            lies between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The Albani and <lb/>
            Iberi were the two chief nations that occupied this tract; the Albani <lb/>
            were between the Caspian Sea and the Iberi. who were their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours on the west. The great river Cyrus (Kur) flowed through <lb/>
            Albania into the Caspian. Iberia was partly surrounded by the moun­ <lb/>
            tains of the Caucasus and it bordered on Armenia and Colchis: the <lb/>
            river Cyrus was the chief river (Strabo, 499, ed. Casaub.). There is no <lb/>
            evidence that these Iberi of the Caucasus were related to the western <lb/>
            Iberi. The country was invaded by the Romans under L. Lucullus <lb/>
            and Pompeius Magnus. </note><note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to a memorable event in the Samnite war. The <lb/>
            consuls Spurius Postumius Albinus and Titus Veturius Calvinus B.C. <lb/>
            321, with their army, were caught by the Samnites in the pass called <lb/>
            Furculæ Caudinæ, and they were compelled, in order to save them­ <lb/>
            selves, to submit to the ignominy of passing under the yoke. The <lb/>
            Roman senate rejected the terms which had been agreed on between <lb/>
            the consuls and the officers of the army on the one side, and the Sam­ <lb/>
            nites on the other. It was not a treaty (fœdus) as Livius shows, for <lb/>
            such a treaty could not be made without the consent of the Populus nor <lb/>
            without the proper religious ceremonies. (Liv. 9, c. 5.) The senate, <lb/>
            upon the proposition of Postumius himself, sent to the Samnites all the <lb/>
            persons who were parties to the agreement and offered to surrender <lb/>
            them, but the Samnites would not receive them and they upbraided <lb/>
            the Romans for want of good faith. </note><note type="footnote"> Mancinus also supported the proposition for his own surrender to the <lb/>
            Numantines, and he was offered to them in due form by the officer <lb/>
            called the Pater Patratus, but the Numantines declined accepting him. <lb/>
            Cicero, De Officiis, iii. 30.) The principle that a general could not <lb/>
            formally make a treaty, and that all treaties required the sanction of <lb/>
            the senate or in earlier times perhaps of the patrician body in their <lb/>
            assembly, appears to be well established. Those who made the treaty <lb/>
            with a Roman general might not know this constitutional rule, but the <lb/>
            principle on which the Romans acted in such cases was sound, and the <lb/>
            censure that has been directed against them as to their conduct in such <lb/>
            transactions, proceeds from ignorance of the Roman constitution and of <lb/>
            the nature of the power which a sovereign state delegates to its min­ <lb/>
            isters. Delegated power or authority never authorises the persons to <lb/>
            whom it is delegated to do an act which is inconsistent with the con­ <lb/>
            stitution or fundamental principles on which the sovereign power in <lb/>
            based. </note><note type="footnote"> Mancinus returned to Rome and ventured to appear in the senate, <lb/>
            but a question was raised as to his right to be there, for it was argued <lb/>
            that a man who had been so surrendered ceased to be a citizen and <lb/>
            sould not recover his civic rights by the fiction of postliminium, as a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            dishonourable terms, both the generals and all who had any <lb/>
            share or participation in the treaty, quæstors and tribunes <lb/>
            all alike, and on their heads they turned the violation of the <lb/>
            oaths and the infraction of the agreement. It was on this <lb/>
            occasion particularly, that the people showed their affection <lb/>
            and zeal towards Tiberius: for they decided to deliver <lb/>
            up the consul, stripped and in chains, to the Numantines, <lb/>
            but they spared all the rest on account of Tiberius. It <lb/>
            appears that Scipio also, who was then the most powerful <lb/>
            man in Rome, gave his assistance in this matter, but never­ <lb/>
            theless he was blamed for not saving Mancinus, and not <lb/>
            making any exertion to ratify the treaty with the Numan­ <lb/>
            tines, which had been concluded by his relation and friend <lb/>
            Tiberius. But whatever difference there was between Scipio <lb/>
            and Tiberius on this occasion, perhaps originated mainly <lb/>
            in jealousy and was owing to the friends of Tiberius and <lb/>
            the sophists, who endeavoured to prejudice him against <lb/>
            Scipio. There was, however, no irreconcilable breach made <lb/>
            between them, and no bad result from this affair; indeed, <lb/>
            it seems to me that Tiberius would never have been in­ <lb/>
            volved in those political measures which cost him his <lb/>
            life, if Scipio Africanus had been at Rome while they <lb/>
            were going on. But it was while Scipio was carrying on <lb/>
            the war at Numantia* that Tiberius commenced his legisla­ <lb/>
            tion, to which he was led from the following motives.</p>
          <p>VIII. Whatever territory the Romans acquired from <lb/>
            their neighbours in war, they sold part, and retaining <lb/>
            the other part as public property,! they gave it to the <note type="footnote"> man who had escaped from the enemy could. (Cicero, De Oratore, 40.) <lb/>
            But the subtlety of the Romans found a solution of the difficulty in the <lb/>
            case of Mancinus: there can be no surrender, if there is nobody to re­ <lb/>
            ceive the surrender; therefore Mancinus was not surrendered; therefore <lb/>
            he was capable of recovering his civil rights. (Cicero, Topica 1.) </note><note type="footnote"> * The war of Numantia was prolonged to their disgrace, as the <lb/>
            Romans considered it, and they at last elected Scipio consul B.O. 134, <lb/>
            and sent him to Spain. He took Numantia after a siege of fifteen <lb/>
            months, and totally destroyed it, B.o. 133, the same year in which his <lb/>
            brother-in-law Tiberius Gracchus lost his life. (Velleius Paterc. ii. 4) <lb/>

            poorer citizens to cultivate, on the payment of a small <lb/>
            sum to the treasury. But as the rich began to outbid the <lb/>
            poor, and so to drive them out, a law was passed which <lb/>
            forbade any one to have more than five hundred jugera <lb/>
            of land. This law restrained the greediness of the rich for a <lb/>
            short time, and was a relief to the poor, who remained oil <lb/>
            the land which they had hired, and cultivated the several <lb/>
            portions which they originally had. But in course of <note type="footnote"> some respects, is given by Appian. (Civil Wars, i. 7, &amp;c.) The <lb/>
            Roman territory (Romanus Ager) was originally confined to a small <lb/>
            circuit, as we se e from the history of tho early wars of Rome. Even <lb/>
            Aricia (La Riccia) about fifteen miles south-east of Rome, was a city <lb/>
            of the Latin confederation in the reign cf Tarquinius Superbus. (Liv. <lb/>
            1, c. 50 ) The Romans extended their territory by conquest, and they <lb/>
            thus acquired large tracts of land in Italy, which were made the prop­ <lb/>
            riety of the state under the name of Ager Publicus. This public land <lb/>
            was enjoyed originally by the patricians, and perhaps by them only, on <lb/>
            payment of a certain rent to the treasury (Ærarium). The rents of <lb/>
            the public land were a large part of the public income, and in­ <lb/>
            tended to defray a portion of the public expenditure. The plebs soon <lb/>
            began to lay claim to a share in these lands, and a division of some tracts <lb/>
            was made among the plebeians in the reign of Servius Tullius. The <lb/>
            lands divided among the plebeians were given to them in ownership. <lb/>
            The tracts of public land which were enjoyed by the patricians on the <lb/>
            terms above mentioned, were considered, as they, in fact, were, public <lb/>
            property; and the interest of the patricians in such lands was called a <lb/>
            possession (possessio). Those who enjoyed the public land as a <lb/>
            possessio were said to possess it (possidere), and they were called <lb/>
            possessores, a term which often occurs in the first six books of Livius, <lb/>
            and which Plutarch has attempted to translate by a Greek word <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κτηματικοί</foreign>). It is 1 kely enough that the patricians abused their rig ht <lb/>
            to the use of the land by not always paying the rent; as we may <lb/>
            collect from the passages in Dionysius (Antiq. Rom. vii. 70, 73, ix. 51, <lb/>
            x. 36). Their enjoyment of extensive tracts also prevented the publie <lb/>
            land from being distributed among the plebeians to the extent that <lb/>
            they wished. The disputes between the two orders in the state, the <lb/>
            aristocracy or nobles and the plebeians, or, as Livius generally calls <lb/>
            them, the patres and the plebs (the padri and the plebe of Machia­ <lb/>
            velli, Discorsi, &amp;c.), about the public land, commenced with the agita­ <lb/>
            tion of Spurius Cassius, BoC. 486, the history of which is given by <lb/>
            Livius in his Second Book (c. 41). The contest was continued at in­ <lb/>
            tervals to B.C. 366, when a Jaw was passed which is commonly called <lb/>
            one of the Licinian Rogations, which forbade any man to have a pos­ <lb/>
            session in the public lands to the amount of more than 500 jugera. <lb/>
            This is the law to which Plutarch alludes. </note><note type="footnote"> The extent and difficulty of the subject of the public land makes it <lb/>

            time their rich neighbours contrived to transfer the <lb/>
            holdings to themselves in the names of other persons, and <lb/>
            at last openly got possession of the greater part of the <lb/>
            public lands in their own names, and the poor, being <lb/>
            expelled, were not willing to take military service and <lb/>
            were careless about bringing up families, in consequence <lb/>
            of which there was speedily a diminution in the number <lb/>
            of freemen all through Italy, and the country was filled <lb/>
            with ergastula* of barbarian slaves, with whom the rich <lb/>
            cultivated the lands from which they had expelled the <lb/>
            citizens. Now Caius Lælius,† the friend of Scipio, attempt­ <lb/>
            ed to remedy this mischief, but he desisted through fear <lb/>
            of the disturbances that were threatened by the opposition <lb/>
            of the rich, whence he got the name of wise or prudent, <lb/>
            for such is the signification of the Roman word “sapiens." <lb/>
            Tiberius, on being elected tribune, ‡ immediately undertook <lb/>
            the same measures, as most say, at the instigation of the <lb/>
            orator Diophanes and the philosopher Blossius.§ Diophanes <note type="footnote"> * The words in Plutarch literally signify 11 barbarian prisons," but I <lb/>
            have used the word ergastula, which was the Roman name, though it <lb/>
            is a word of Greek origin, and signifies “working-places." The er­ <lb/>
            gastula were places generally under ground and lighted from above: <lb/>
            they were used both as places to work in and as lodging-places for <lb/>
            slaves who cultivated the fields in chains. (Plinius, N. H. 18, c. 3; <lb/>
            Florus, iii. 19.) They were also places of punishment for refractory <lb/>
            slaves. The object of these places of confinement was also to prevent <lb/>
            slaves from running away, and rising in insurrection. The slaves <lb/>
            were placed at night in separate cells to prevent all communication <lb/>

            Eunus, who is mentioned by Plutarch (Sulla, c. 36), the ergastula were <lb/>
            broken open, and a servile army of above sixty thousand men was <lb/>
            raised. The Roman master had full power over his slave, who was <lb/>
            merely viewed as an animal; and these ergastula, being in the country <lb/>
            and out of sight, would give a cruel master full opportunity of exercis­ <lb/>
            ing his tyranny. They were abolished by the Emperor Hadrian <lb/>

            him some of his philosophical writings. Some give part of <lb/>
            the blame to Cornelia also, the mother of Tiberius, who <lb/>
            frequently reproached her sons that the Romans still <lb/>
            called her the mother-in-law of Scipio, but not yet the <lb/>
            mother of the Gracchi. Others say that jealousy of one <lb/>
            Spurius Postumius,* a contemporary of Tiberius, and a <lb/>
            rival of his reputation as an orator, was the immediate <lb/>
            motive: for it is said that when Tiberius returned to <lb/>
            Rome from his military service, he found that Postumius <lb/>
            had far out-stripped him in reputation and influence, and <lb/>
            seeing the distinction that Postumius had attained, he <lb/>
            determined to get the advantage over him by engaging in <lb/>
            measures which were attended with hazard, but promised <lb/>
            great results. But his brother Caius in a certain book has <lb/>
            recorded, that as Tiberius was passing through Tyrrhenia <lb/>
            (Tuscany), on his road to Numantia, he observed the de­ <lb/>
            serted state of the country, and that the cultivators and <lb/>
            shepherds were foreign slaves and barbarians; and that he <lb/>
            then for the first time conceived those political measures <lb/>
            which to them were the beginning of infinite calamities. <lb/>
            But the energy and ambition of Tiberius were mainly ex­ <lb/>
            cited by the people, who urged him by writing on the <lb/>
            porticoes, the walls, and on the tombs, to recover the public <lb/>
            land for the poor.</p>

            they thus became familiar, and their associating with Greeks, had con­ <lb/>
            siderable influence on their political opinions. Tiberius Gracchus the <lb/>
            father was also well enough acquainted with Greek to speak the <lb/>
            language. His oration to the Rhodians was spoken in Greek. </note><note type="footnote"> * It does not seem certain what Postumius is intended. Sp, <lb/>

            brother P. Scævola as one of the advisers of Tiberius Gracchus in his <lb/>
            legislation. Crassus was consul with L. Valerius Flaccus B.O. 131. <lb/>

            the limits of Italy, for he was consul and pontifex maximus when he <lb/>
            went to carry on the war against Aristonikus. (Livius, Epitome, 59.) <lb/>

            Tiberius Gracchus attempted his reform. He attained the dignity of <lb/>
            pontifex maximus in B.O. 131 on his brother's death. Scævola was <lb/>
            probably a timi I man. Cicero states that his brother openly favoured <lb/>
            the measures of Tiberius; and Scævola was suspected of doing so. <lb/>
            After the death of Tiberius he approved of the conduct of Scipio <lb/>
            Nasica, who was the active mover in this affair, and assisted in drawing <lb/>
            up several decrees of the Senate in justification of the measure and <lb/>

            foundations of Roman law and formed it into a science (Dig. 1, tit. 2, <lb/>

            division of land merely to disturb the state and to bring <lb/>
            about a revolution. But they failed altogether; for <lb/>
            Tiberius, supporting a measure in itself honourable and <lb/>
            just, with an eloquence- calculated to set off even a meaner <lb/>
            subject, showed his power and his superiority over his <lb/>
            opponents, whenever the people were crowded round the <lb/>
            rostra and he addressed them about the poor. “The <lb/>
            wild beasts of Italy," he would say, “had their dens and <lb/>
            holes and hiding-places, while the men who fought and <lb/>

            who were vehemently excited and roused, none of the <note type="footnote"> * The eloquence of Tiberius Gracchus is commemorated by Cicero <lb/>
            (Brutus, c. 27), who had read his orations. He describes them as not <lb/>
            sufficiently ornate in expression, but as acute and full of judgment. The <lb/>
            specimens of the orations of Tiberius (c. 9. 15) and those in Appian <lb/>
            (Civil Wars, 9. 15) fully bear out the opinion of Cicero as to his acute­ <lb/>
            ness. Some German writers assert that these speeches in Plutarch are <lb/>
            either fabricated by him or taken from other writers; but assertions <lb/>
            like these, which are not founded on evidence, are good for nothing. <lb/>
            Plutarch gives the speeches as genuine: at least he believes them to <lb/>
            be so, and therefore he did not fabricate them. And it is not likely <lb/>
            that any body else did. These two fragments (c. 9. 15) bear no rest m- <lb/>
            blance to the style of most writers who have fabricated speeches. <lb/>
            They arc in a genuine Roman style. If any man could fabricate them, <lb/>

            enemies of Tiberius attempted to refute. Abandoning, <lb/>
            therefore, all idea of opposing him by words, they <lb/>
            addressed themselves to Marcus Octavius,* one of the <lb/>
            tribunes, a young man of sober and orderly disposition, <lb/>
            and a companion and friend of Tiberius. At first Octavius, <lb/>
            from regard to Tiberius, evaded the proposals, but being <lb/>
            urged and importuned by many of the powerful nobles,† <note type="footnote"> * Marcus Octavius, who was one of the tribuni plebis B.O. 133, was <lb/>
            a descendant of Cneius Octavius, quæstor B.O. 230. Caius Octavius, <lb/>
            better known as Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus and as the Emperor <lb/>
            Augustus, was a descendant of Caius the second son of Cneius. Cicero, <lb/>
            whose opinion about the Gracchi changed with the changed circum­ <lb/>
            stances of his own life, commends the opposition of Marcus Octavius <lb/>
            to the measures of Gracchus. (Brutus, c. 25.) He also says that <lb/>
            Octav ius was a good speaker. </note><note type="footnote"> The institution of the tribuni plebis is one of the most important <lb/>
            events in the history of Rome, and the struggle between the plebeians <lb/>
            headed by their tribunes, and the nobility, is the development of the <lb/>
            constitutional history of Rome. Though there were tribunes in the <lb/>
            kingly period, the establishment of the tribuni plebis as the guardians <lb/>
            of the plebs is properly referred to the year B.C. 494, when the plebs <lb/>
            seceded to the Mons Sacer or the Sacred Mount. On this occasion the <lb/>
            patricians consented to the election of two tribunes from the plebs. <lb/>
            (Livius, 2, c. 33: compare Livius, 2,56.58.) The number was afterwards <lb/>
            increased to ten, and this number continued unaltered. Only a <lb/>
            plebeian could be elected tribune. The persons of the tribunes were <lb/>
            declared to be sacred (sacrosancti). Their powers were originally <lb/>
            limited, as above stated, to the protection of the rights of the plebs <lb/>
            and of the individuals of the plebeian body against the oppression of <lb/>
            the patrician magistrates. It is not possible within the compass of a <lb/>
            note to trace the history of the gradual increase of the tribunitian <lb/>
            power (tribunitia potestas): such a subject is a large chapter in the <lb/>
            history of Rome. Incidental notices often appear in Plutarch's Lives, <lb/>
            which will help a reader to form a general notion of the nature of the <lb/>
            magistracy, and the effect which it had on the development of the <lb/>
            Roman constitution. The article Tribuni in Smith's Dictionary of <lb/>
            Greek and Roman Antiquities gives an outline of the functions of thia <lb/>
            tribuni plebis. </note><note type="footnote"> Very soon after the institution of the tribunate, the nobles learned <lb/>
            the art of destroying the power of the college of tribunes by gaining <lb/>
            over one or more of the members : for, as Plutarch states, the opposi­ <lb/>
            tion (intercessio) of a single tribune rendered the rest of his colleagues <lb/>
            powerless. </note><note type="footnote"> t As this is the first time that I have used this word, it requires <lb/>

            aristocracy, and the people. The old nobility of Rome were the</note> <lb/>

            and as it were, driven to it, he set himself in opposition <lb/>
            to Tiberius, and prevented the passing of the law. Now <note type="footnote"> patricians, whom Livius calls indifferently patres (father) and patricii. <lb/>
            In his early History patres and plebs are opposed to one another, as <lb/>
            wo should now oppose the terms nobles or aristocracy, and com­ <lb/>
            monalty or people; not that nobles and aristocracy are among us <lb/>
            exactly equivalent, but in the history of Rome there is no distinction <lb/>
            between them. Livius frequently uses the term patres and plebs as <lb/>
            comprehending all the Roman citizens (ii. 33). The word populus <lb/>
            was originally and properly not the people in our sense; it signified <lb/>
            the superior and privileged class and was equivalent to patricians. <lb/>
            The plebs were originally not a part of the populus. In later times <lb/>
            the word populus was often used loosely to express generally the Roman <lb/>
            people, and the style and title of the Roman state was Senatus Popu­ <lb/>
            lusque Romanus—The Senate and the Roman populus, which term <lb/>
            populus in the later republic certainly included the plebs, though <lb/>
            the plebs is still spoken of as a class. As the plebeians gradually <lb/>
            obtained access to the higher honours of the state and to the consul­ <lb/>
            ship by a law of Licinius Stole B.O. 366, a new class of nobles was <lb/>
            formed out of those persons who had enjoyed those honours and out <lb/>
            of their descendants. This class was called nobiles by the Romans; <lb/>
            the word nobilitas denoted the rank or title of the class, but it was <lb/>
            also used like our word nobility to express the body of nobiles. <lb/>
            Livius uses this term even in the earlier books of his History, but <lb/>
            perhaps not with strict correctness, for in some cases at least he makes <lb/>
            the term nobility equivalent to the patricians. He wrote in the <lb/>
            reign of Augustus, and he has not always applied his terms in the <lb/>
            earlier periods with perfect accuracy. Still we may trace the meaning <lb/>
            of political terms in the Roman writers with great clearness, for no <lb/>
            nation ever stuck more closely to old forms and expressions, and there <lb/>
            is a wonderful precision in the use of political terms by Roman writers <lb/>
            of all ages and of all classes. The name patricians still existed after <lb/>
            the term nobilis was introduced: a noble might be either a patrician <lb/>
            or a plebeian, but the distinction was well understood between an old <lb/>
            patrician family and a plebeian family, however distinguished the <lb/>
            plebeian family might become. Under the Emperors it was not <lb/>
            uncommon for them to promote a man to the rank of patrician for <lb/>
            eminent services, which under the monarchy was equivalent to the <lb/>
            conferring of a title of dignity in modern times, and nothing more. <lb/>
            (Tacit. Ann. xi. 25.) </note><note type="footnote"> In Cicero we find the aristocratical order often spoken of as the <lb/>
            optimates (the class of the best), a term which corresponds to the <lb/>
            Greek aristi (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄριστοι</foreign>), whence we have the word aristocracy, which, <lb/>
            however, the early Greek writers, at least, only used to express a form of <lb/>
            government and not a class of persons. Cicero on one occasion (Pro <lb/>
            P. Sesto, c. 45) attempts to give to the word optimates a much wider <lb/>
            signification ; to make it comprehend all good and honest people: but <lb/>
            this is a mere piece of rhetoric. When a poor plebeian heard the <lb/>
            optimates spoKen of, he never imagined that it was intended to place </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            all the power is virtually in the hands of the dissentient <lb/>
            tribune, for the rest can do nothing if a single tribune <note type="footnote"> him among them, were he as honest as the best man among the <lb/>
            optimates. Cicero also says the populares were those who merely <lb/>
            spoke and acted to please the multitude; which shows that populus <lb/>
            must now have changed its meaning: the optimates were those who <lb/>
            wished to act so as to get the approbation of all honest men. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch's perception of the early periods of Roman history was <lb/>
            perhaps not btrictly exact; but he comprehended very clearly the <lb/>
            state of the parties in the age of the Gracchi. On the one side were <lb/>
            the nobles and the rich, some of whom were noble and some were not; <lb/>
            on the other side were the people, the mass, the poor. The <unclear>struggle</unclear> <lb/>
            was now between rich and poor, and the rich often became the <lb/>
            leaders of the poor for the purpose of political distinction and influence, <lb/>
            and hence the name populares. Probably few states have ever <lb/>
            presented the spectacle of the striking contrast between wealth and <lb/>
            poverty which the Roman state exhibited from the time of the Gracchi; <lb/>
            a class of rich, rich by hereditary wealth and by all the modes of <lb/>
            acquiring wealth which the possession of office and the farming of the <lb/>
            public revenues offered to them; a class of poor who were born poor, <lb/>
            who had little industry and few means of exercising it. To this we <lb/>
            must add, that though there were many cultivators in the country who <lb/>
            might enjoy a moderate subsistence from their small estates, there was <lb/>
            a city crowded with poor who had votes, and by their union and <lb/>
            numbers mainly determined the elections and the acceptance or re­ <lb/>
            jection of legislative measures. Rome, in fact, was the centre of all <lb/>
            political agitation, and the result of a revolution in the city generally <lb/>
            determined the dispute between two rival factions. We have still to <lb/>
            take into the account a very numerous class of slaves. It is probable <lb/>
            that in the earlier periods of Roman history the slaves were coin­ <lb/>
            paratively few; in the later republic they became very numerous. <lb/>
            They formed a large part of the wealth of the rich, and they were <lb/>
            always a dangerous body to the state. The effect of employing slaves <lb/>
            generally in agriculture and other occupations was, as it always must <lb/>
            be, unfavourable to industry among free men. Slaves, also, were often <lb/>
            manumitted, and though the son of a manumitted slave was in all <lb/>
            respects on the same footing as a complete Roman citizen, if his father <lb/>
            was made such by the act of manumission, yet persons of this con­ <lb/>
            dition, and especially those who had been liberated from slavery, were <lb/>
            looked upon as a somewhat inferior class. Their connection with the <lb/>
            powerful families to which they had belonged, also gave such families <lb/>
            great influence in all elections; and as we see in various instances, the <lb/>
            class of libertini, manumitted slaves, was viewed as a dangerous body <lb/>
            in the state. The equites at Rome can scarcely be called a middle <lb/>
            class: they were generally rich and the farmers of the revenues, under <lb/>
            the name of publicani. They were often opposed to the senate, but <lb/>
            it was an opposition of pure interest, and their wealth made them <lb/>
            rather the partisans of the aristocratical than of the popular body. <lb/>
            Such were the political elements with which Tiberius Graoohus had to</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            oppose them. Irritated at this, Tiberius withdrew his <lb/>
            moderate measure and introduced another, more agreeable <note type="footnote"> deal, when he attempted a reform which perhaps the times did not <lb/>
            render practicable, and for which he certainly did not possess the <lb/>
            courage or the judgment or the inflexible resolution which were <lb/>
            necessary to secure success. The word in Plutarch which I have here <lb/>
            translated nobles is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνατοί</foreign>, the powerful. In other places he calls <lb/>
            them the rich (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλούσιοι</foreign>), the possessors [of public land] (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κτηματικοί</foreign>), <lb/>
            the aristocratical body (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριστοκρατικοί</foreign>); and perhaps other terms. He <lb/>
            calls the plebs, or people as opposed to this class, by various names, of <lb/>
            which <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</foreign> is the most common: he also calls them the multitude <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλῆθος</foreign>), the many (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</foreign>), and other like names. </note><note type="footnote"> It is impossible to attain perfect precision in the use of political terms <lb/>
            in a translation of Plutarch; and in order to be critically exact, it would <lb/>
            be necessary to load these notes continually with remarks. But this <lb/>
            critical exactness is not required here: the opposition of the two orders <lb/>
            in the state is intelligible to everybody. The contests in Rome from <lb/>
            the time of the Gracchi to the establishment of the monarchy under <lb/>
            Augustus, were contests in which the rich and the powerful were COIl­ <lb/>
            stantly struggling among themselves for political supremacy; there <lb/>
            was an acknowledged aristocratical and an acknowledged popular <lb/>
            party. But the leaders of both parties, with perhaps some few excep­ <lb/>
            tions, were mainly bent on personal axgrandi ement. The aristocra­ <lb/>
            tical class had a clearer object than the leaders of the popular party: <lb/>
            they wished to maintain the power of their order and that of the senate, <lb/>
            which was the administering body. The leaders of the popular party <lb/>
            could have no clear object in view except the destruction of the power <lb/>
            of the senate: the notion of giving the people more power than they <lb/>
            possessed would have been an absurdity. Accordingly the depression <lb/>
            of the aristocratical body had for a necessary consequence the elevation <lb/>
            of an individual to power, as in the case of Cæsar the dictator. Sulla, <lb/>
            it is true, was an aristocrat, and he destroyed so far as he could the <lb/>
            popular party; but he made himself dictator, and to the last day of his <lb/>
            life he ruled all parties with a rod of iron. </note><note type="footnote"> The existence of a numerous and needy class who participated in <lb/>
            political power without having any property which should be a <lb/>
            guarantee for their honest use of it, was the stuff out of which grew the <lb/>
            revolutions of Rome. There was a crowded city population, clamorous, <lb/>
            for cheap bread, for grants of land, for public shows and amusements, <lb/>
            averse to labour, constantly called into political activity by the annual <lb/>
            elections, always ready to sell their votes to the best bidders; and a <lb/>
            class always ready to use this rabble as a tool for their political and <lb/>
            personal aggrandisement. Machiavelli observes (Istor. Fiorent. iii.) <lb/>
            that the natural enmity which exists between the men of the popular <lb/>
            party and the nobles (gli uomini Popular! e i Nobili), proceeds from tho <lb/>
            wish of the nobles to command and of the others not to obey, and that <lb/>
            these are the causes of all the evils that appear in states. He adds (tv.) <lb/>
            that states, and especially those that are not well constituted, which <lb/>
            are administered under the name of republics, often change their </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            to the people and more severe against the illegal possessors <lb/>
            of land; this new measure ejected persons out of the <lb/>
            lands which they had got possession of contrary to exist­ <lb/>
            ing laws. There was a daily contest between him and <lb/>
            Octavius at the rostra, but though they opposed one <lb/>
            another with great earnestness and rivalry, it is said they <lb/>
            never uttered a disparaging word against one another, <lb/>
            and that no unbecoming expression ever escaped either of <lb/>
            them against the other. It is not, then, in bacchanalian <lb/>
            revelries* only, as it seems, but also in ambitious rivalry <lb/>
            and passion, that to be of noble nature and to have been <lb/>
            well brought up, restrains and governs the mind. Tiberius, <lb/>
            observing that Octavius himself was obnoxious to the law <lb/>
            and possessed a considerable tract of the public land, <lb/>
            begged him to desist from his opposition, offering to pay <lb/>
            him the value of the land out of his own purse, though <lb/>
            he was by no means in affluent circumstances. Upon <lb/>
            Octavius rejecting the proposal, Tiberius by an edict <lb/>
            forbade all the other magistrates to transact any public <lb/>
            business until the people had voted upon his law; and <lb/>
            he placed his private seals on the temple of Saturn,t that <lb/>
            the quæstors might not be able to take anything out of it <lb/>
            or pay anything in, and he. gave public notice that a <lb/>
            penalty would be imposed on the prætors if they dis­ <note type="footnote"> government and condition, but the fluctuation is not between liberty <lb/>
            and servitude, as many suppose, but between servitude and licence. It <lb/>
            is only the name of liberty which is in the mouths of the ministers of <lb/>
            licence who are the popular leaders, and the ministers of servitude who <lb/>
            are the nobles; both of them wish to be subject neither to the laws nor <lb/>
            to men. These remarks, which are peculiarly applicable to Florence <lb/>
            and the so-called republics of Italy of that time, apply equally to the <lb/>
            Roman state. There are governments, however, to which the name <lb/>
            republic can be properly applied, and that of Great Britain is one, which <lb/>
            owing to the possession of certain elements have a more stable character. <lb/>
            Still the general character of a popular and of an aristocratical party is <lb/>
            correctly sketched by Machiavelli. </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch, who is fond of allusions to the Greek poets, here alludes <lb/>

            obeyed; in consequence of which all the magistrates were <lb/>

            Upon this the possessors changed their dress and went <lb/>

          <p>XI. When the day came and Tiberius was calling the <lb/>
            people to the vote, the voting-urns† were seized by the <note type="footnote"> * A dolo is described by Hesychius, v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δόλωνες</foreign>, in one sense, as a <lb/>

            Facciolati, Lexicon.) Kaltwasser describes it as a walking-stick <lb/>
            containing a dagger, and translates the passage, “ he provided himself <lb/>
            with a robbers' dagger, without making any secret of it." I think that <lb/>

            when the order of voting had been fixed for the tribes and centuries, <lb/>

            the kind, of a cylindrical shape. If Plutarch has used the proper word <lb/>
            he re, the preliminary proceedings were disturbed by the rich seizing or <lb/>
            throwing down the vessels, out of which were to be drawn the lots for <lb/>
            determining in what order the tribes should vote. The business had <lb/>
            not yet got so far as the voting, which consisted in the voters depositing <lb/>
            in a cista. one of the tablets (tabellæ), which were distributed among <lb/>
            them for this purpose, and which were marked with an appropriate <lb/>
            letter to express acceptance of a measure or rejection of it. There is a <lb/>
            Roman denarius which represents a man going to put a tabella into a <lb/>
            cista: the tabella is marked A, which means Absolve, I acquit. The <lb/>

            maintained. He observes that in the Roman comitia one sitella would </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            rich and the proceedings were put into great confusion. <lb/>
            However, as the partisans of Tiberius, who had the su­ <lb/>
            periority in numbers, were collecting in order to make <lb/>
            resistance, Manlius. and Fulvius, both consular men, <lb/>
            falling down at the knees of Tiberius, and clinging to his <lb/>
            hands with tears, begged him to desist. Tiberius, seeing <lb/>
            that matters were near coming to extremities, and from <lb/>
            regard to the men also, asked them what they would have <lb/>
            him do; to which they replied, that they were not com­ <lb/>
            petent to advise on so important a matter, and they <lb/>
            urged him to refer it to the senate, and at last he <lb/>
            consented. The senate met, but did nothing, owing to <lb/>
            the opposition of the rich, who had great influence in the <lb/>
            body; upon which Tiberius had recourse to the uncon­ <lb/>
            stitutional and violent measure of depriving Octavius <lb/>
            of his office, finding it impossible to put his proposed <lb/>
            law to the vote in any other way. In the first place, <lb/>
            he publicly entreated Octavius, addressing him affection <lb/>
            ately and clinging to his hands, to yield to and gratify <lb/>
            the people, who asked for nothing but their rights, and <lb/>
            would only get a small matter in return for great dangers <lb/>
            and sufferings. Octavius rejected this proposition; upon <lb/>
            which Tiberius reminded him that both of them were <lb/>
            magistrates and were contending with equal power on <lb/>
            a weighty matter, and that it was. not possible for this <lb/>
            struggle to continue without coming to open hostility; <lb/>
            that he saw no remedy except for one of them to give <lb/>
            up his office; and he bade Octavius put it to the people <lb/>
            to vote on his case first, and said that he would imme­ <lb/>
            diately descend to the station of a private man, if the <note type="footnote"> be sufficient, as it was only used for receiving the names of the tribes or <lb/>
            centuries, which were put in for the purpose of determining by drawing <lb/>
            them out, in what order the tribes or centuries should vote. And <lb/>
            accordingly he says that when comitia are spoken of, we never find urns <lb/>
            or sitellæ spoken of in the plural number. But he has not mentione d <lb/>
            the passage of Plutarch. It may be difficult to determine if Plutarch <lb/>
            considered that the preliminary lot-drawing had been gone through, <lb/>
            and the people were voting. If he considered the voting to be going on, <lb/>
            be has used the wrong word. With this explanation, I leave the <lb/>
            word “ voting-urns " in the text, which is not the correct Roman word <lb/>
            but may be what Plutarch meant. It seems as if he thought that the <lb/>
            voting had commenced. </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch writes it Mallius, for the Greeks never place n before L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            citizens should desire it. As Octavius refused this pro­ <lb/>
            posal also, Tiberius said that he would put the question <lb/>
            about Octavius retiring from the tribunate to the people, <lb/>
            if Octavius did not change his resolution.</p>
          <p>XII. Thus ended the assembly of that day. On the <lb/>
            following day Tiberius mounted the rostra and again <lb/>
            endeavoured to persuade Octavius; but as he would <lb/>
            not yield, Tiberius proposed a law by which Octavius <lb/>
            should be deprived of his tribunate, and he forth w ith sum­ <lb/>
            moned the citizens to vote upon it. Now, there were <lb/>
            five and thirty tribes,. and when seventeen of them <lb/>
            had already given their vote, and the addition of one more <lb/>
            tribe would reduce Octavius to a private condition, <lb/>
            Tiberius stopped the voting, and again entreated Octavius, <lb/>
            embracing him in the presence of the people and urgently <lb/>
            praying him not to be careless about being deprived <lb/>
            of his office, and not to bring on him the blame of so <lb/>
            severe and odious a measure. It is said that Octavius <lb/>
            was not entirely untouched or unmoved by these en­ <lb/>
            treaties, and his eyes were filled with tears and he was <lb/>
            silent for some time. But when he looked to the rich and <lb/>
            the possessors, who were standing together in one body, <lb/>
            through fear of losing their good opinion, as it seems, <lb/>
            he boldly determined to run every risk, and he told <lb/>
            Tiberius to do what he pleased. Accordingly the law <lb/>
            was passed, and Tiberius ordered one of his freedmen <lb/>
            to drag Octavius from the rostra, for Tiberius employed <lb/>
            his own freedmen as officers ; a circumstance which made <lb/>
            the spectacle of Octavius dragged from the rostra with <lb/>
            contumely still more deplorable. At the same time the <lb/>
            people made an assault on Octavius, and though the rich <lb/>
            all ran to his assistance and disengaged him from their <lb/>
            hands, it was not without difficulty that he was rescued <lb/>
            and made his escape from the mob. But one of his faith­ <lb/>
            ful slaves, who had placed himself in front of his master <lb/>
            to defend him, had his eyes torn out. This violence was <note type="footnote"> * From this it appears that the vote of each tribe counted as one, <lb/>
            and the vote of the tribe was determined by the majority of voters in <lb/>
            each tribe. It seems to follow that each tribe had a cista to receive its <lb/>
            votes. It is said, the practice was to count the votes when all was <lb/>
            over; but they must have been counted as each tribe voted, according <lb/>
            to this story. The narrative of Appian is the same (Civil Wars, i. 12). </note> <lb/>

            quite contrary to the wishes of Tiberius, who, on seeing <lb/>
            what was going on, speedily made his way to the dis­ <lb/>
            turbance.</p>
          <p>XIII. The law about the land was now immediately <lb/>
            carried, and triumviri* were appointed for ascertaining <lb/>
            its bounds and distributing it; the triumviri were <lb/>
            Tiberius, and his father-in-law Claudius Appius, and <lb/>
            Caius Gracchus, his brother, who, however, was not at <lb/>
            Rome, but serving under Scipio against Numantia. All <lb/>
            this Tiberius accomplished quietly without any opposition, <lb/>
            and he also procured to be elected tribune in the room of <lb/>
            Octavius, not a person of rank, but one Mucius t a client ‡ <lb/>
            of his own. The nobles, who were vexed at all these <lb/>
            measures and feared the growing power of Tiberius, <lb/>
            treated him in the senate with contumely; and upon his <lb/>
            asking, according to custom, for a tent from the treasury <lb/>
            for his use while he was distributing the land, they <lb/>
            refused it to him, though others had often had one <lb/>
            allowed them on less important occasions; and they only <lb/>
            gave him for his expenses nine oboli§ a day, which was <lb/>
            done on the motion of Publius Nasica,|| who entered <lb/>
            violently into the opposition against Tiberius, for he was <lb/>
            in possession of a very large amount of public land, and <lb/>
            was greatly annoyed at being forcibly ejected from it. <lb/>
            But the people now became still more violent. A. <lb/>
            friend of Tiberius happened to die suddenly, and sus­ <lb/>
            picious marks immediately showed themselves on the <lb/>
            body. The people cried out that he was poisoned, and <lb/>
            collecting in great numbers at the funeral, they carried the <lb/>
            bier and stood by while the body was burnt. And the <lb/>
            suspicion of poison appeared to have some reason, for the <note type="footnote"> * The names of various Roman officers and functionaries were <lb/>

            to denote their functions. There were triumviri agro dando or <lb/>

            body burst on the pile and sent forth such a quantity of <lb/>
            corrupt humours as to quench the flame; and though a <lb/>
            light was again applied, the body would not burn till it <lb/>
            was removed to another place, where, after much trouble, <lb/>
            the fire at last laid hold of it. Upon this Tiberius, with <lb/>
            the view of exciting the people still more, changed his dress, <lb/>
            and showing his children to the people, begged that they <lb/>
            would protect them and their mother, for he now despaired <lb/>
            of his own safety.</p>
          <p>XIV. On the death of Attalus * Philometor, Eudemus of <lb/>
            Pergamum brought his will to Home, in which the Roman <lb/>
            people were made the king's heir. In order to please the <lb/>
            people, Tiberius promulgated a law to the effect that as <lb/>
            soon as the king's treasures were received, they should be <lb/>
            distributed among those who had assignments of land, <lb/>
            in order to enable them to stock the farms and to assist <lb/>
            them in their cultivation. With respect to the cities <lb/>
            included within the kingdom of Attains, he said that the <lb/>
            senate had no right to decide about them, but he would <lb/>
            bring the subject before the popular assembly. This <lb/>
            measure gave violent offenoo to the senate, and Pompeius t <lb/>
            getting up, said that he lived near Tiberius, and so knew <lb/>
            that Eudemus of Pergamum had given a diadem out of the <lb/>
            royal treasures and a purple robe to Tiberius, who <lb/>
            designed to make himself king in Rome. Quintus <lb/>
            Metellus ‡ reproached Tiberius by reminding him, that <lb/>
            whenever his father, during his censorship, was returning <lb/>
            home from supper, the citizens used to put out the lights <note type="footnote"> * This Attalus III., the last king of Pergamum, left his kingdom to <lb/>

            Romans formed the province of Asia. Pergamum was the name of the <lb/>

            doubt he means the father, who is mentioned by Cicero as an opponent <lb/>
            of Tiberius Gracchus, and he states that an oration of his against <lb/>

            too much in entertainments and drinking, but that the <lb/>
            most insolent and needy of the citizens accompanied <lb/>
            Tiberius with lights at night. Titus Annius,* who was <lb/>
            not a man of good repute or sober behaviour, but in any <lb/>
            contest of words by way of question and answer was con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be unequalled, challenged Tiberius to answer <lb/>
            definitely whether he had or had not branded with infamy <lb/>
            his brother tribune, though by the law he was sacred and <lb/>
            inviolable. As the question was received with signs of <lb/>
            approbation, Tiberius, hastily quitting the senate-house, <lb/>
            convoked the people and ordered Annius to be brought <lb/>
            before them, with the intention of accusing him. But <lb/>
            Annius, who was much inferior to Tiberius both in <lb/>
            eloquence and reputation, had recourse to his tricks, and <lb/>
            called on Tiberius to answer a few questions before he <lb/>
            began his speech. Tiberius assented, and as soon as there <lb/>
            was silence, Annius said, " If you intend to deprive me <lb/>
            of my rank, and disgrace me, and I appeal to one of <lb/>
            your brother tribunes, and he shall come to my aid, <lb/>
            and you shall then fall into a passion, will you deprive <lb/>
            him of his office ?” On this question being put, it <lb/>
            is said that Tiberius, though no man was readier in <lb/>
            words or bolder in action, was so confused that he made <lb/>
            no reply.</p>
          <p>XV. For the present Tiberius t dissolved the assembly, <lb/>
            seeing that his proceedings with respect to Octavius were <note type="footnote"> * Titus Annius Luscus was consul with Q. Fulvius Nobilior B.C. 153. <lb/>
            (Cicero, Brutus, c. 20; Livius, Epitome, 58.) </note><note type="footnote"> t It is clear that Plutarch believed this to be a genuine speech of <lb/>
            Tiberius. It is not an argument that he could have made, nor is <lb/>
            it likely that it is a fabrication of any professed speech-writer. It is <lb/>
            true that there were many speeches extant among the Romans, which, <lb/>
            though mere rhetorical essays, were attributed to persons of note and <lb/>
            passed off as genuine speeches. But this is either not one of them, <lb/>
            or it has been managed with consummate art. The defence of Tiberius <lb/>
            is a blot on his character. He could not avoid knowing that his argu­ <lb/>
            ments were unsound. To abdicate, which means to resign a Roman <lb/>
            magistracy, was a different thing from being deprived of it. The <lb/>
            Tribunes were elected at the Comitia Tributa, but they derived their <lb/>
            powers by uninterrupted succession from the consecrated act (Lex <lb/>
            Sacrata) done on the Holy Mount and confirmed after the overthrow of <lb/>
            the Decemviral power. (Livius, 2, c. 33; a, c. 55.) On this subject, see <lb/>
            Bubino, Untersuchungen über Röm, Verfassung, p. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>

            not liked either by the nobles or the people, for they <lb/>
            considered that the high and honourable dignity of the <lb/>
            tribunate, which had been kept unimpaired up to that <lb/>
            time, had been destroyed and trampled upon. He made <lb/>
            an harangue to the people, a few of the arguments of <lb/>
            which it will not be out of place to mention, for the <lb/>
            purpose of showing the persuasive eloquence and the <lb/>
            subtlety of the man. He said that a tribune was sacred <lb/>
            and inviolate, only because he was dedicated to the people <lb/>
            and was the guardian of the people. If then a tribune <lb/>
            should deviate from his duty and wrong the people, <lb/>
            abridge their power and deprive them of the opportunity <lb/>
            of voting, he had by his own act deprived himself of his <lb/>
            rank, by not fulfilling the conditions on which he <lb/>
            received it. Now we must consider a tribune to be still a <lb/>
            tribune, though he should dig down the Capitol and burn <lb/>
            the naval arsenal. If he should commit such excesses <lb/>
            as these, he is a bad tribune; but if he should attempt to <lb/>
            deprive the people of their power, he is not a tribune at <lb/>
            all. And is it not a monstrous thing if a tribune shall <lb/>
            have power to order a consul to be put in prison, and the <lb/>
            people shall not be able to deprive a tribune of his power <lb/>
            when he is using it against the people who gave it to <lb/>
            him? for both tribune and consul are equally chosen <lb/>
            by the people. Now the kingly office, besides compre­ <lb/>
            hending within it all civil power, is consecrated to the <lb/>
            divinity by the discharge of the chief ceremonials of reli­ <lb/>
            gion ; and yet the state ejected Tarquinius for his wrong- <lb/>
            doing, and for the violence of one man the ancient power <lb/>
            which established Rome was overthrown. And what is <lb/>
            there at Rome so sacred, so venerated as the virgins who <lb/>
            guard the ever-burning fire ? but if any of them offends, <lb/>
            she is buried alive; for when they sin against the gods, <lb/>
            they no longer retain that inviolable sanctity which they <lb/>
            have by being devoted to the gods. In like manner, <lb/>
            neither has a tribune when he is wronging the people any <lb/>
            right to retain the inviolable character which he receives <lb/>
            from the people, for he is destroying the very power <lb/>
            which is the origin of his own power. And indeed, if he <lb/>
            has legally received the tribunitian power by the votes of a <lb/>
            majority of the tribes, how is it that he cannot even still <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            more legally be deposed by the vote of all the tribes ? Now, <lb/>
            nothing is so sacred and inviolable as things dedicated to <lb/>
            the gods; but yet no one has ever hindered the people <lb/>
            from using such things, moving them, and changing their <lb/>
            places as they please. It is therefore legal for the <lb/>
            people to transfer the tribunate, as a consecrated thing, <lb/>
            from one man to another. And that the tribunate is <lb/>
            not an inviolable thing, nor an office of which a man <lb/>
            cannot be divested, is clear from this that many magis­ <lb/>
            trates have abdicated their office and prayed to be excused <lb/>
            from it of their own free will.</p>
          <p>XVI. Such were the heads of the justification of <lb/>
            Tiberius. His friends, seeing the threats of his enemies <lb/>
            and their combination, thought that he ought to be a <lb/>
            candidate for the tribunate for the next year; and <lb/>
            Tiberius attempted to strengthen his popularity by <lb/>
            promising to carry new measures,. such as a diminution <lb/>
            of the period of military service, an appeal to the people <lb/>
            from the judices, an intermixture of an equal number of <lb/>
            the Equites with the Senators, from whom alone the <lb/>
            judices were then taken; and in every way he attempted <lb/>
            to abridge the power of the Senate, influenced rather <lb/>
            by passion and ambition, than justice and the interests of <lb/>
            the state. While the voting was going on, the friends of <lb/>
            Tiberius, seeing that their enemies were gaining the <lb/>
            advantage, for all the people were not present,t at first <lb/>
            attempted to prolong the time by abusing the other tri­ <lb/>
            bunes, and next they dissolved the meeting and appointed <lb/>
            it for the following day. Tiberius, going down to the <lb/>
            Forum, supplicated the citizens in humble manner and <lb/>
            with tears in his eyes; he then said that he feared his <lb/>
            enemies would break into his house by night and kill him, <note type="footnote"> * See Caius Gracchus, c. 5. Appian does not mention these measures <lb/>
            of Tiberius. </note><note type="footnote"> † The elections of Tribunes in the time of Cicero were on the 17th of <lb/>
            July (Ad Attic. i. 1). According to Dionysius the first Tribunes <lb/>
            entered on their office on the loth of December. Kaltwasser suggests <lb/>
            that as it was now the summer season, the country people were busy in <lb/>
            their fields and could not come to the election, which thus would be in <lb/>
            the hands of the townspeople. If Tiberius was killed in July and <lb/>
            entered on his office in the previous December, this will agree with <lb/>
            what Cicero says of him, " he reigned a few months.” (Lælius, c. 12.) </note> <note type="footnote">G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            and thus he induced a great number of the citizens to take <lb/>
            their station about his house and watch there all night.</p>
          <p>XVII. At daybreak the man came to bring the birds <lb/>
            which the Romans use in their auspices, and he threw them <lb/>
            food. But the birds would not come out of the basket­ <lb/>
            with the exception of one, though the man shook it hard; <lb/>
            and even this one would not touch the food, but after <lb/>
            raising its left wing and stretching out a leg it ran back <lb/>
            to the basket. This reminded Tiberius of another omen <lb/>
            that had happened. He had a helmet which he wore in <lb/>
            battle, elaborately worked and splendid. Some snakes <lb/>
            had got into the helmet unobserved, and laid their eggs <lb/>
            and hatched them there. This made Tiberius still more <lb/>
            uneasy about the signs from the fowls. Nevertheless <lb/>
            he advanced up the city on hearing that the people was <lb/>
            assembled about the Capitol; but before he got out of <lb/>
            the house he stumbled over the threshold, and the blow <lb/>
            was so violent that the nail of his great too was broken, <lb/>
            and the blood ran out through his shoe. He had not got <lb/>
            far before some crows were seen fighting on the roof of <lb/>
            a house on the left hand, and though a great crowd was <lb/>
            passing by, as was natural on such an occasion, a stone <lb/>
            which was pushed off by one of the crows fell by the <lb/>
            feet of Tiberius. This made even the boldest of his <lb/>
            adherents hesitate; but Blossius of Cumæ, who was <lb/>
            present, said it would be a shame and a great disgrace if <lb/>
            Tiberius, a son of Gracchus and a grandson of Scipio <lb/>
            Africanus, and a defender of the Roman people should <note type="footnote"> * A cage, the Roman cavea. This was one of the modes of ascer­ <lb/>
            tuning the will of the gods. It was a firm belief among the nations <lb/>
            of antiquity that the gods did by certain signs and tokens give men <lb/>
            the opportunity of knowing their will. The determination of these <lb/>
            signs was reduced to a system, which it was the duty of certain <lb/>
            persons, augurs and others, to learn and to transmit. The careful <lb/>
            render will find many other notices of this matter in Plutarch and some <lb/>
            in these notes. (See Sulla, c. 6, notes.) </note><note type="footnote"> P. Claudius Pulcher, who was consul B.O. 249, and in the command <lb/>
            of the Roman fleet off Sicily, despised the omens. The fowls would not <lb/>

            would be unfavourable; but Claudius said that if they would not eat, <lb/>
            they should drink, and he pitched the sacred fowls into the sea. He <lb/>
            lost most of his ships in the engagement that followed. (Cicero, Do <lb/>

            not obey the summons of the people for fear of a crow, <lb/>
            and that his enemies would not treat this cowardly act <lb/>
            as a matter of ridicule, but would make it the ground of <lb/>
            calumniating him to the people as playing the tyrant and <lb/>
            treating them with contempt. At the same time many <lb/>
            persons ran up to Tiberius with a message from his friends <lb/>
            in the Capitol, to hasten there, as all was going on <lb/>
            favourably. And indeed everything promised well at <lb/>
            first, for as soon as he appeared he was greeted with <lb/>
            friendly cheers, and as he ascended the Capitol he was <lb/>
            joyfully received, and the people crowded about him to <lb/>
            prevent any stranger from approaching.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Now, Mucius began to summon the tribes again, <lb/>
            but nothing could be conducted with the usual forms on <lb/>
            account of the confusion that prevailed among those who <lb/>
            were on the outskirts of the assembly, where they were <lb/>
            struggling with their opponents, who were attempting <lb/>
            to force their way in and mingle with the rest. At this <lb/>
            juncture Flavius Flaccus,* a senator, posted himself in a <lb/>
            conspicuous place, and as it was not possible to make <lb/>
            his voice heard so far, he made a signal with his hand <lb/>
            that he wished to say something in private to Tiberius. <lb/>
            Tiberius bade the crowd let Flaccus pass, who, with <lb/>
            great difficulty making his way up to Tiberius, told him <lb/>
            that the Senate was sitting, that as they could not pre­ <lb/>
            vail on the consul, the rich were resolving to kill Tiberius <lb/>
            themselves, and that they had armed many of their slaves <lb/>
            and friends for this purpose.</p>
          <p>XIX. Upon Tiberius reporting this to those who were <lb/>
            standing about him, they forthwith tucked up their <lb/>
            dress, and breaking the staves which the officers use to <lb/>
            keep the crowd back, distributed the fragments among <lb/>
            them and made ready to defend themselves against their <lb/>
            assailants. While those at a distance were wondering at <lb/>
            what was going on, and asking what it meant, Tiberius <lb/>
            touched his head with his hand, since his voice could not <lb/>
            be heard, intending thereby to signify to the people that <lb/>
            his life was in danger. His enemies on seeing this ran to <note type="footnote"> * His name was Fulvius Flaccus; the name of Flaccus belongs to the <lb/>

            the Senate and told them that Tiberius was asking <lb/>
            for a crown, and that his touching his head was a proof of <lb/>
            it. On this the whole body was greatly disturbed ; Nasica <lb/>
            entreated the consul- to protect the state and put down <lb/>
            the tyrant. The consul however answered mildly that he <lb/>
            would not be the first to use violence, and that he would <lb/>
            not take any citizen's life without a regular trial; if how­ <lb/>
            ever, he said, the people should come to an illegal vote at the <lb/>
            instigation of Tiberius, or from compulsion, he would not <lb/>
            respect any such decision. Upon this Nasica springing up <lb/>
            exclaimed, “ Well then, as the consul betrays the state, do <lb/>
            you who wish to maintain the laws follow me." As he <lb/>
            uttered these words he drew the skirt of his dress over his <lb/>
            head, and hastened to the Capitol; and the senators who <lb/>
            followed him, wrapping their dress about them with one <lb/>
            hand, pushed all the people they met out of the way, no one <lb/>
            opposing them, from respect to their rank, but taking to <lb/>
            flight and trampling down one another. The followers <lb/>
            of the senators had clubs and sticks which they had <lb/>
            brought from home; but the senators seizing the fragments <lb/>
            and legs of the benches which were broken by the people <lb/>
            in their hurry to escape, made right to Tiberius, and <lb/>
            struck all those who were in their road. The people <lb/>
            were all put to flight or killed. As Tiberius was attemp­ <lb/>
            ting to make his escape, some one laid hold of his dress, <lb/>
            on which he dropped his toga and fled in his tunic; but <lb/>
            he stumbled over some persons who were lying on the <lb/>
            ground and was thrown down. While he was endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to rise, he received the first blow, as it is universally <lb/>
            admitted, from Publius Satyreius, one of his colleagues, <lb/>
            who struck him on the head with the leg of a bench. <lb/>
            Lucius Rufus claimed the credit of giving him the second <lb/>
            blow, as if that were a thing to be proud of. Above three <lb/>
            hundred persons lost their lives by sticks and stones, but <lb/>
            none by the sword. <note type="footnote"> * This WAS P. Mucius Scævola. His colleague L. Calpurnius Piso <lb/>
            was conducting the war in Sicily against the slaves who had risen. <lb/>
            The Senate, according to Appian (Civil Wars, i. 16), was assembled in <lb/>
            the Temple of Fides on the Capitol. The circumstances of the death of <lb/>
            Tiberius are told by Appian (Civil Wars, i. 15. 16), who states that <lb/>
            there was a fight between the partisans of Tiberius and the other party <lb/>
            before the Senate met. </note></p><pb n="87"/>
            
          <p>XX. This is said to have been the first disturbance at <lb/>
            Rome since the abolition of the kingly power, which <lb/>
            ended in bloodshed and the death of citizens. All <lb/>
            previous disputes, though they were neither trifling nor <lb/>
            about trifling matters, were settled by mutual concession: <lb/>
            the nobles yielded through fear of the people, and the <lb/>
            people yielded from respect to the Senate. Even on this <lb/>
            occasion it is probable that Tiberius would have given <lb/>
            way to persuasion without any difficulty, and still more <lb/>
            readily if his assailants had not come to bloodshed and <lb/>
            blows, for those about him were not above three thousand <lb/>
            in number. But the combination against him seems to <lb/>
            have proceeded rather from the passion and hatred of the <lb/>
            rich citizens, than from the reasons which they alleged; <lb/>
            and the brutal and indecent treatment of his dead body is <lb/>
            a proof of this. For they would not listen to his brother's <lb/>
            request * to take up the body and bury it at night, but it <lb/>
            was thrown into the Tiber with the other bodies. And <lb/>
            this was not all; they banished some of his friends with­ <lb/>
            out trial, and others they seized and put to death, among <lb/>
            whom was Diophanes the orator. One Caius Villius t <lb/>
            they shut up in a vessel with snakes and vipers, and thus <lb/>
            he died. Blossius of Cumæ, being brought before the <lb/>
            consuls and questioned about what had passed, admitted <lb/>
            that he had done everything at the bidding of Tiberius. <lb/>
            On Nasica asking ‡ him, " What if Tiberius had told you <lb/>
            to burn the Capitol ? ” Blossius said, that Tiberius would <lb/>
            never have given him any such order. The same question <lb/>
            being often put to him, and by several persons, he said, " If <lb/>
            he had commanded me to burn the Capitol, it would have <lb/>
            been a good deed for me to do; for Tiberius would not <lb/>
            have given such an order unless it were for the interest of <lb/>
            the people." Blossius, however, was set at liberty, and <lb/>
            afterwards went to Aristonikus § in Asia, on the ruin of <lb/>
            whose affairs he killed himself. <note type="footnote"> * To make Plutarch consistent, we must suppose that Caius had re­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XXI. The Senate, under present circumstances, en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to soothe the people; they made no opposition to <lb/>
            the distribution of the public land, and they allowed the <lb/>
            people to elect another commissioner in place of Tiberius. <lb/>
            Having come to a vote, they elected Publius Crassus * a <lb/>
            relation of Gracchus, for his daughter Licinia was the wife <lb/>
            of Caius Gracchus. Cornelius Nepos,t indeed, says that <lb/>
            Caius did not marry the daughter of Crassus, but the <lb/>
            daughter of Brutus t who triumphed over the Lusitanians: <lb/>
            however, the majority of writers state the matter as I have <lb/>
            done. Now, as the. people were sore about the death of <lb/>
            Tiberius, and were manifestly waiting for an opportunity <lb/>
            to be revenged, and N asica § was threatened with prosecu­ <lb/>
            tions, the Senate, fearing for his safety, made a decree for <lb/>
            sending him to Asia, though they had nothing for him to do <lb/>
            there. For when men met Nasica they did not conceal their <lb/>
            hostility, but broke out into violence, and abused him <lb/>
            wherever they fell in with him, calling him accursed, and <lb/>
            tyrant, who had stained with the blood of an inviolable <lb/>
            and sacred functionary the most sacred and revered of all <lb/>
            the holy places in the city. Accordingly, Nasica left Italy, <note type="footnote"> gamum. He disputed the will of Attalus III. and seized the kingdom. <lb/>
            Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, who was sent against him <lb/>
            B.O 131, was unsuccessful, and lost his life; but Aristonikus was defeated <lb/>
            by the consul M. Perperna B.C. 130, and taken to Rome, where he <lb/>
            was strangled in prison. </note><note type="footnote"> * This is P. Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, c. 9. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> † This does not appear in the extant Lives which bear the name of <lb/>
            Nepos; but what we have under his name is a spurious work of little <lb/>
            value except the Life of Atticus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ D. Junius Brutus Gallæcus was consul with P. Cornelius Scipio <lb/>
            Nasica Serapio B.C. 138. He completely subdued the Gallæci (people of <lb/>
            Galicia) and the Lusitani who occupied a part of modern Portugal, <lb/>
            and carried the Roman arms to the western extremity of the Spanish <lb/>
            peninsula. </note><note type="footnote"> § He was the colleague of Brutus B.O. 138, as just stated, and Pontifex <lb/>
            Maximus in the year of the death of Tiberius. He must have died <lb/>
            soon after going to Asia; for Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives <lb/>
            was Pontifex Maximus B.C. 131 (c. 9); but the remark in the Epitome <lb/>
            of Livius (lib. 59) that he was the first Pontifex Maximus who went <lb/>
            beyond the limits of Italy is not true. The Pontifex Maximus, who <lb/>
            was the chief of the college of Pontifices, was chosen for life. He could <lb/>
            not be deprived of his office, nor, it seems, could he give it up. <lb/>

            Maximus till his death. (Dion Cassius, 49, c. 15.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            though bound by the most sacred functions, for he was <lb/>
            Pontifex Maximus; and, rambling about despised from <lb/>
            place to place, he died no long time after in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Pergamum. It is no wonder if Nasica was so <lb/>
            much hated by the people, when even Scipio Africanus, <lb/>
            whom the Romans considered inferior to no man in <lb/>
            integrity, and loved as well as any, narrowly escaped <lb/>
            losing the popular favour, because, on receiving the news <lb/>
            of the death of Tiberius, at Numantia, he exclaimed in the <lb/>
            verse of Homer, <lb/>
            So perish * all who do the like again. <lb/>
            Subsequently, when Caius and Fulvius asked him, before <lb/>
            an assembly of the people, what he thought of the death <lb/>
            of Tiberius, he showed by his answer that he was not <lb/>
            pleased with the measures of Tiberius. This made the <lb/>
            people interrupt him with their shouts when he was <lb/>
            speaking, as they had never done before; and Scipio was so <lb/>
            far transported with passion as to break out into invectives <lb/>
            against them. But of this I have spoken more particularly <lb/>
            in the Life of Scipio.† <note type="footnote"> * The line is from Homer's Odyssey, i. 47. </note><note type="footnote"> † This is loot, and also Plutarch's Life of Scipio Africanus Major.</note> <pb n="90"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. CAIUS GRACCHUS at first, either through fear of hit <lb/>
            enemies or with the view of making them odious, with­ <lb/>
            drew from the Forum * and kept quiet at home, like a <lb/>
            man humbled for the present, and intending for the <lb/>
            future to keep aloof from public affairs; which gave <lb/>
            occasion for some people to say that he disliked the <lb/>
            measures of Tiberius, and had abandoned them. He was <lb/>
            also still quite a youth, for he was nine years younger <lb/>
            than his brother, and Tiberius was not thirty t when he <lb/>
            was killed. But in the course of time, as his character <lb/>
            gradually displayed itself in his aversion to indolence, <lb/>
            luxury, wine, and all matters of private profit, and it was <lb/>
            clear, from his application to the study of eloquence, that <lb/>
            he was preparing, as it were, his pinions for public life, <lb/>
            and that he would not remain quiet; and further, when <lb/>
            he showed by his defence of Vettius, one of his friends, <lb/>
            who was under prosecution, the people all around him <lb/>
            being wild and frantic with delight, that the rest of the <note type="footnote">* The word by which Plutarch has translated Forum is Agora (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγορά</foreign>). <lb/>
            A Forum was an open place or area, and is often generally used for <lb/>
            Public Place, such as almost every town has. The Forum at Rome was <lb/>
            the Forum Romanum, which was situated between the Palatine and <lb/>
            Capitoline Hills; it was surrounded by buildings and was the chief <lb/>
            place for the administration of justice and for the public assemblies. <lb/>
            To keep away from the Forum here means to take no share in public <lb/>
            affairs. Sometimes, Forensic (forensis), a term comprehending all that <lb/>
            relates to public business and the proceedings in the courts, is opposed <lb/>
            to Domestic (domesticus), private, as we see in Cicero (Ad Attic. i. <lb/>
            5, &amp;c.). </note><note type="footnote"> † As thirty-one was the age at which according to a law (Lex <lb/>
            Annalis Villia) a man could become Quæstor, Tiberius, who was <lb/>
            Quæstor before lie was tribune, must have been older than Plutarch <lb/>
            says that he was ; unless he was elected Quæstor before the legal age. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            orators were mere children, the nobles were again alarmed, <lb/>
            and there was much talk among them that they would <lb/>
            not allow Caius to obtain the tribunate. It happened <lb/>
            without any set design that the lot fell on him to go as <lb/>
            quæstor to Sardinia,. under Orestes t the consul, which <lb/>
            pleased his enemies, and was not disagreeable to Caius. <lb/>
            For he was fond of war, and equally disciplined for <lb/>
            military service and speaking in the courts of justice; <lb/>
            but he still shrunk from public affairs and the Rostra, <lb/>
            and as he could not resist the invitations of the people <lb/>
            and his friends, he was well pleased with this opportunity <lb/>
            of leaving Rome. It is true it is a common opinion that <lb/>
            Caius was a pure demagogue, and much more greedy of <lb/>
            popular favour than Tiberius. But it was not so in fact, <lb/>
            and Caius seems to have been involved in public affairs <lb/>
            rather through a kind of necessity than choice. Cicero <lb/>
            the orator also says that Caius declined all offices, and <lb/>
            had determined to live in retirement, but that his brother <lb/>
            appeared to him in a dream,‡ and said, “ Caius, why do <lb/>
            you linger ? There is no escape: one life for both of us, <lb/>
            and one death in defence of the people is our fate."</p>
          <p>II. Now, Caius during his stay in Sardinia exhibited his <lb/>
            excellent qualities in every way ; he far surpassed all the <lb/>
            young men in military courage, in upright conduct to the <lb/>
            subject people, in loyalty and respect to the commander; <lb/>
            and in temperance, frugality, and attention to his duties <lb/>
            he excelled even his elders. The winter having been <lb/>
            severe and unhealthy in Sardinia, the general demanded <lb/>
            clothing for his soldiers from the cities, upon which they <lb/>
            sent to Rome to pray to be relieved from this imposition. <lb/>
            The Senate granted their petition, and ordered the general <lb/>
            to get supplies for the troops by other means; but as the <lb/>
            general was unable to do this, and the soldiers were suffer­ <lb/>
            ing, Caius went round to the cities and induced them <lb/>
            voluntarily to send clothing and to assist the Romans. <lb/>
            This, being reported to Rome, made the Senate uneasy, for <note type="footnote"> * The island of Sardinia was made a Roman province B.C. 235. </note><note type="footnote"> † Lucius Aurelius Orestes and M. AEmilius Lepidus were consuls <lb/>
            B.C. 126. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This dream is mentioned by Cicero, Do Divinatione, i. 26. C. <lb/>
            Gracchus told his dream to many persons, before he was elected tribune. <lb/>
            It happened while he was a candidate for the quæstorship. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            they viewed it as a preliminary to popular agitation. <lb/>
            Ambassadors also arrived at Rome from Libya, with a <lb/>
            message from King Micipsa,* that the king had sent corn <lb/>
            to the commander in Sardinia, out of respect for Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus. The Senate, taking offence at the message, <lb/>
            would not receive the ambassadors, and they passed a <lb/>
            decree that fresh troops should be sent out to replace those <lb/>
            in Sardinia, but that Orestes should stay; intending by <lb/>
            this measure to keep Caius there also, in respect of his <lb/>
            office. On this being done, Caius immediately set sail in <lb/>
            a passion, and appearing at Rome contrary to all expecta­ <lb/>
            tion, was not only blamed by his enemies, but even the <lb/>
            people considered it a strange thing for the quæstor to <lb/>
            leave his general behind. However, when the matter was <lb/>
            brought before the Censors,† he asked for permission to <lb/>
            make his defence, and he produced such a change in the <lb/>
            opinions of his audience, that he was acquitted, and con­ <lb/>
            sidered to have been exceedingly ill used: he said that he <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">* Micipsa, King of Numidia, was the son of Massinissa, who was the <lb/>
            firm ally of the Romans in their contest with the Carthaginians in the <lb/>
            Second Punic War. At the close of this war, his territory was greatly <lb/>
            enlarged by the addition of the dominions of Syphax and a large part <lb/>
            of the Carthaginian territory. He was succeeded by Micipsa, who <lb/>
            died B.C. 118. The Carthaginian territory which subsequently formed <lb/>
            a large part of the Roman province of Africa was a rich corn country, <lb/>
            and one of the granaries of Rome under the latter Republic and the <lb/>
            Empire. </note><note type="footnote"> † Gracchus made his defence before the Censors On. Servilius Cario <lb/>
            and L. Cassius Longinus B.C. 124. Gracchus belonged to the class of <lb/>
            Equites, and as such he had a Public horse. The censors summoned <lb/>
            him to account for leaving his province, and, if he was not able to <lb/>
            justify himself, he would be deprived of his horse and marked with the <lb/>
            Nota Censoria, in the lists of the Censors, the consequence of which <lb/>
            was what the Romans called Ignominia, or temporary civil incapacity. </note><note type="footnote"> If Gains was born B.O. 151 and had now (B.C. 124) served twelve <lb/>
            years, he entered the army B.C. 136, when lie was eighteen. It is true <lb/>
            as he here says, that he was only required to serve ten years. This <lb/>
            fragment of his speech is preserved by Aulus Gellius (xv. 12), and it <lb/>
            is expressed with all the vigour of the best Roman style. A com­ <lb/>
            parison of this fragment with the passages from the speeches of <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus, which are given by Plutarch, is sufficient to show <lb/>
            that Plutarch's extracts are genuine. There appears to be an error <lb/>
            in Plutarch as to the " three years." Gellius makes Caius say: “ Bien­ <lb/>
            nium fui in Provincia; ” “1 was two years in the province:" and one <lb/>
            MS. is said to have “ two years” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διετία</foreign>), which Cortes has adopted <lb/>
            In his edition of Plutarch. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            had served in the army for twelve years, while others were <lb/>
            only required to serve ten years, and that he had exercised <lb/>
            the functions of quæstor to the commander for three years, <lb/>
            though the law allowed him to return after one year's <lb/>
            service; he added that he was the only soldier who took <lb/>
            out a full purse with him and brought it back empty, <lb/>
            while the rest took out with them only jars of wine, which <lb/>
            they had emptied in Sardinia, and brought them back full <lb/>

          <p>III. After this, his enemies brought fresh charges <lb/>
            against him, and harassed him with prosecutions on the <lb/>
            ground of causing the defection of the allies and having <lb/>
            participated in the conspiracy which had been detected at <lb/>
            Fregellæ.* But he cleared himself of all suspicion, and <lb/>
            having established his innocence, immediately set about <lb/>
            canvassing for the tribunate. All the men of distinction, <lb/>
            without exception, opposed him ; and so great a multitude <lb/>
            flocked to Rome from all parts of Italy, to the Comitia, <lb/>
            that many of them could not find lodgings, and the Campus <lb/>
            Martiust being unable to contain the numbers, they <lb/>
            shouted from the house-tops and tilings. However, the <lb/>
            nobility so far prevailed against the people as to disappoint <lb/>
            the hopes of Caius, inasmuch as he was not returned first, <lb/>
            as he expected, but only fourth. But upon entering on <lb/>
            his office he soon made himself first, for he surpassed every <lb/>
            Roman in eloquence,t and his misfortunes gave him a <note type="footnote"> * Fregellæ was a subject city in the territory of the Volsci. The <lb/>

            B.C 125. Caius Gracchus was tried B.C. 124 before the Prætor Opimius <lb/>

            could. Caius was elected tribune B.C. 123, just ten years after his <lb/>
            brother's tribunate. The consuls were Quintus Cæcilius Metellus <lb/>

            licence for speaking freely when lamenting the fate of his <lb/>
            brother. He took every opportunity of directing the <lb/>
            thoughts of the people to this subject, reminding them of <lb/>
            former times, and contrasting the conduct of their <lb/>
            ancestors, who went to war with the Falisci on behalf of <lb/>
            Genucius, a tribune, who had been insulted by them, and <lb/>
            condemned Caius Veturius to death because he was the <lb/>
            only man that did not make way for a tribune as he was <lb/>
            passing through the Forum. “ But before your eyes," he <lb/>
            exclaimed, “ these men beat Tiberius to death with staves, <lb/>
            and his body was dragged through the midst of the city <lb/>
            to be thrown into the Tiber; and all his friends who <lb/>
            were caught were put to death without trial. And yet <lb/>
            it is an old usage among us, if a man is accused of a <lb/>
            capital charge and does not appear, for a trumpeter to come <lb/>
            to the door of his house in the morning and summon him <lb/>
            by the sound of the trumpet, and the judices cannot vote <lb/>
            upon the charge till this has been done. So circumspect <lb/>
            and careful were the Romans of old in the trials of persons <lb/>
            accused."</p>
          <p>IV. Having first stirred up the people by such harangues <lb/>
            as these (and he had a very loud voice, and was most <lb/>
            vigorous in speech), he promulgated two laws: * one, to the <note type="footnote"> the powerful eloquence of Caius Gracchus. Up to the time of Cicero, <lb/>
            the orations of Gracchus were the models of oratory which all Romans <lb/>
            studied. Cicero says that his speeches did not receive the finishing <lb/>
            touch; he left behind him many things which were well begun, but not <lb/>
            perfected. The practice of revising speeches for the purpose of public­ <lb/>
            ation was common among the Athenian and Roman orators. In manly <lb/>
            and vigorous oratory we may doubt if Caius Gracchus ever had his <lb/>
            equal among the Romans; and if not among the Romans, where shall <lb/>
            we look for his equal ? </note><note type="footnote"> * I have here allowed a word to stand by something of an oversight, <lb/>
            to which however there is no objection. Plutarch uses the word " law;" <lb/>
            but the Roman word is “ Rogatio," which means a Bill, a proposed Law, <lb/>
            so called because the form of passing a law was to ask (rogare) the <lb/>
            assembly if they would have it. The form of voting was to reject <lb/>
            (antiquare) by the formula A, or to confirm (jubere) by the formula <lb/>
            UT. R. (Uti Rogas), “ as you propose," which were marked on the tabellæ <lb/>
            or voting-tablets. (Cicero, Ad Attic. i. 14.) </note><note type="footnote"> To Promulgate a law, or more properly a Rogation, signified among <lb/>

            and its contents. To promulgate a law in modern times means to </note> <lb/>

            effect that if the people had deprived any magistrate of <lb/>
            his office, he should be incapacitated from holding office a <lb/>
            second time; and the other, which rendered a magistrate <lb/>
            liable to a public prosecution if he had banished any <lb/>
            citizen without trial. One of these rogations had the <lb/>
            direct effect of branding with infamy Marcus Octavius, <lb/>
            who had been deprived of the tribunate by Tiberius; and <lb/>
            Popillius * came within the penalties of the other, for <lb/>
            during his prætorship he had banished the friends of <lb/>
            Tiberius. Popillius did not stand his trial, and he fled <lb/>
            from Italy; but the other law Caius himself withdrew, <lb/>
            saying that he refrained from touching Octavius at the <lb/>
            request of his mother Cornelia. The people admired his <lb/>
            conduct on this occasion, and gave their consent, for they <lb/>
            respected Cornelia no less for the sake of her sons than her <lb/>
            father; and afterwards they set up a bronze statue t of her, <lb/>
            with the inscription—Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi. <lb/>
            There are recorded several things that Caius said in <lb/>
            defence of his mother in a rhetorical and coarse way, in <lb/>
            reply to one of his enemies. “ What," said he, “ do you <lb/>
            abuse Cornelia, the mother of Tiberius?" And as the <lb/>
            man laboured under the imputation of being a dissolute <lb/>
            fellow, he added, “ How can you have the impudence to <lb/>
            compare yourself with Cornelia? Have you been a <lb/>
            mother, as she has?” —and more to the like effect, but <lb/>
            still coarser. Such was the bitterness of his language, and <lb/>
            many like things occur in his writings.</p>

            st atues. Though most of the great Romans were distinguished by their <lb/>
            military talents, it was not only in respect of military fame that statues <lb/>
            were erected; nor were they confined to men as we see in this instance. <lb/>

            of gaining the popular favour and weakening the Senate, <lb/>
            one was for the establishment of colonies and the diRtribu­ <note type="footnote"> of a note. Part of the subject has been referred to already. (Tiberius <lb/>

            to the sovereign power of Rome, a power which was distributed among <lb/>
            many members. They bore heavy burdens, particularly in the form of <lb/>
            supplies of men and money for war; and they claimed as an indemni­ <lb/>
            fication the citizenship (civitas), or admission to the sovereign body, as <lb/>
            members of it The claim was finally settled by the Marsic or Social <lb/>
            war. (See Mnrius and Sulla.) </note><note type="footnote"> The law about the price of grain belonged to the class of Laws which <lb/>
            the Romans called Frumentariæ Leges, or Corn Laws; the object of <lb/>
            these laws was not to keep up the price of grain, but to furnish it to the <lb/>
            poor at a low rate. This low rate however was not effected in the only <lb/>
            way in which such an object could profitably be effected, by allowing <lb/>
            corn to come to Rome from all parts free of duty, but by buying grain <lb/>
            with the Public money and selling it to the poor at a lower rate. This <lb/>
            law of Gracchus proposed that corn should be sold to the people (plebs) <lb/>
            monthly at the rate of I of the As for a modius. This is the first <lb/>
            recorded instance in Roman History of the poor being relieved in this <lb/>
            manner. The city was crowded with poor who had few or no means of <lb/>
            subsistence, but had votes in the annual elections and were members of <lb/>
            the sovereign body. The consequences of such a measure might be <lb/>
            easily foreseen: the treasury became exhausted, and the people were <lb/>
            taught to depend for their subsistence, not on their industry, but on <lb/>
            these almost gratuitous distributions of grain. This allowance, which <lb/>
            was made monthly, added to the sale of their votes at the annual elec­ <lb/>
            tions and the distributions on extraordinary occasions, of corn and oil <lb/>
            (Dion Cassius, 43, c 31) helped a poor Roman to live in idleness. <lb/>
            This system of distributions of corn, sometimes free of cost, being once <lb/>
            established was continued all through the Republic and under the <lb/>
            Empire. It was impossible to stop the evil, when it had been rooted, <lb/>
            and in the crowded city of Rome under the Empire, it was an impor­ <lb/>
            tant duty of the adminstration to prevent famine and insurrection by <lb/>
            provisioning the city. C. Julius Cæsar reduced the number of those <lb/>
            who received this corn relief from 320,000 to 150,000. The number <lb/>
            of receivers must have increased again, for Augustus reduced the <lb/>
            number to 200,000. This subject of the distribution of corn among the <lb/>
            poor is an important element in the history of the later Republic. <lb/>
            Dureau de la Malle (Économie Politique des Romains, ii. 307) has <lb/>
            compared it with the English mode of providing for the poor by the <lb/>
            Poor Laws ; but though there are some striking points of resemblance <lb/>
            between the two systems, there are many differences, and the matter <lb/>
            requires to be handled with more knowledge and judgment than <lb/>
            this writer has shown in order to exhibit it in its proper light. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch's account of the changes made by Gracchus in the body <lb/>
            of the Judices is probably incorrect. The law of Gracchus related to <lb/>
            trials for offences, such as bribery at elections (ambitus), and corrupt</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            tion of Public Land among the poor; another provided for <lb/>
            supplying the soldiers with clothing at the public expense, <lb/>
            without any deduction on this account being made from <lb/>
            their pay, and exempted youths under seventeen years of <lb/>
            age from being drafted for the army; a third was in <lb/>
            favour of the allies, and put the Italians on the same foot­ <lb/>
            ing as the citizens with respect to the suffrage; another <lb/>
            related to grain, and had for its object the lowering of the <note type="footnote"> tion in the administration of offices (repetundse), which belong to the <lb/>
            class of trials called at a later time judicia publica or public trials. <lb/>
            In the trials for These offences, those who had to decide on the guilt <lb/>
            or innocence of the accused, were called judices; and the judices were <lb/>
            taken only from the senators. But as the pfraons accused of offences, <lb/>
            of the kind above mentioned generally belonged to the senatorian <lb/>
            order, it was found very difficult to get a man convicted. Some <lb/>
            notorious instances of acquittals of persons, who had been guilty of <lb/>
            corruption, had occurred just before Gracchus proposed his law. <lb/>
            According to Appian, his law gave the judicial power solely to the <lb/>
            equites, who formed a kind of middle class between the senators and <lb/>
            the people. But the equites were not a safe body to intrust with this <lb/>
            power. To this body belonged the publicami, or publicans as they are <lb/>
            called in our translation of the Gospels (Matt., ch. v., v. 47), who forme d <lb/>
            the revenues in the provinces. A governor who winked at the extortion <lb/>
            of the farmers of taxes would easily be acquitted, if he was tried for <lb/>
            maladministration on his return to Rome. The equips at Rome had <lb/>
            an interest in acquitting a man who favoured their orler. Cicero <lb/>
            remarks (In Verrem, Act Prima, 13) t at the judices were selected out <lb/>
            of the equites for near fifty years until the functions were restored to <lb/>
            the senate. He is alluding to the change Sulla made B.O. 83; but it <lb/>
            appears that there were some intermediate changes. Cicero adds that <lb/>
            during all this time there was never the slightest suspicion of any <lb/>
            eques taking a bribe in the discharge of his functions as judex. <lb/>
            Appian says that they soon became corrupt; and Cicero, who is <lb/>
            in the habit of contradicting himself, says in effect the same thing <lb/>
            (In Verrem, lib. iii. 41; Brutus, c. 34). The judices of Gracchus <lb/>
            condemned Opimius, whose character Cicero admired. (See c. 18, notes.) <lb/>
            The condemnation was either honest or dishonest: if honest, Cicero <lb/>
            is a dishonest man for complaining of the sentence (Pro Plancio, c. <lb/>
            29): if dishonest then Cicero here contradicts what he has said <lb/>
            elsewhere. (See also In Pisonem, o. 39.) </note><note type="footnote"> I have used the Roman word judices, which is the word that <lb/>
            Plutarch has translated. These judices were selected out of the <lb/>
            qualified body by lot (at least this was the rule sometimes) for each <lb/>
            particular trial. A judge, generally the prætor, presided, and the <lb/>
            guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by the judices by a <lb/>
            majority of votes; the votes were given by ballot at this time. </note><note type="footnote"> This law of Gracchus about the judicia is a difficult subject, owing <lb/>
            to the conflicting evidence. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>

            price for the poor ; the last related to the judices, a <lb/>
            measure which most of all encroached on the privileges of <lb/>
            the senate-for the senate alone supplied judices for the <lb/>
            trials, and this privilege rendered that body formidable <lb/>
            both to the people and the equites. The law of Gracchus <lb/>
            added three hundred equites to the senate, who were also <lb/>
            three hundred in number, and it made the judices eligible <lb/>
            out of the whole six hundred. In his endeavours to carry <lb/>
            this law he is said to have made every exertion; and in <lb/>
            particular it is recorded that all the popular leaders who <lb/>
            preceded him turned their faces to the senate and the <lb/>
            comitium while they were speaking, but he was the first <lb/>
            who turned his face the other way to the Forum while <lb/>
            haranguing the people, and he continued to do so; and by <lb/>
            a small deviation and alteration in attitude he stirred a <lb/>
            great question, and in a manner transformed the govern­ <lb/>
            ment from an aristocratical to a democratical form, by this <lb/>
            new attitude intimating that the orators should direc­ <lb/>
            their speeches to the many and not to the senate.</p>
          <p>VI. The people not only passed this law, but empowered <lb/>
            Gracchus to select from the equites those who were to act <lb/>
            as judices, which conferred on him a kind of monarchical <lb/>
            authority, and even the senate now assented to the <lb/>
            measures which he proposed in their body. But all the <lb/>
            measures which he proposed were honourable to the senate; <lb/>
            such, for instance, was the very equitable and just decree <lb/>
            about the grain which Fabius the proprætor sent from <lb/>
            Iberia. Gracchus induced the senate to sell the grain and <lb/>
            to return the money which it produced to the Iberian cities, <lb/>
            and further to censure Fabius for making the Roman <lb/>
            dominion heavy and intolerable to the subject nations; this <lb/>
            measure brought him great reputation and popularity in <lb/>
            the provinces. He also introduced measures for sending <lb/>
            out colonies, the construction of roads, and the building of <lb/>
            public granaries; and he made himself director and super­ <lb/>
            intendent for the carrying all these measures into effect. <lb/>
            Though engaged in so many great undertakings, he waft <lb/>
            never wearied, but with wonderful activity and labour he <lb/>
            effected every single object as if he had for the time no <lb/>
            other occupation, so that even those who thoroughly hated <lb/>
            and feared him were struck with amazement at the rapidity <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            and perfect execution of all that he undertook. But the <lb/>
            people looked with admiration on the man himself, seeing <lb/>
            him attended by crowds of building-contractors, artificers, <lb/>
            ambassadors, magistrates, soldiers, and learned men, to all <lb/>
            of whom he was easy of access; and while he maintained <lb/>
            his dignity, he was affable to all, and adapted his behaviour <lb/>
            to the condition of every individual, and so proved the <lb/>
            falsehood of those who called him tyrannical or arrogant or <lb/>
            violent. He thus showed himself more skilful as a popular <lb/>
            leader in his dealings with men, and in his conduct, than <lb/>
            in his harangues from the Rostra.</p>
          <p>VII. But Caius busied himself most about the construe­ <lb/>
            tion of roads,. having in view utility, convenience, and <lb/>
            ornament. The roads were made in a straight line, right <lb/>
            through the country, partly of quarried stone and partly <lb/>
            with tight-rammed masses of earth. By filling up the <lb/>
            depressions, and throwing bridges across those parts which <lb/>
            were traversed by winter torrents or deep ravines, and <lb/>
            raising the road on both sides to the same uniform height, <lb/>
            the whole line was made level and presented an agreeable <lb/>
            appearance. He also measured all the roads by miles (the <lb/>
            Roman mile is not quite eight Greek stadia), and fixed <lb/>
            stone blocks to mark the distances. He placed other stones <lb/>
            at less distances from one another on each side of the road, <lb/>
            that persons might thus easily mount their horses without <lb/>
            assistance.</p>
          <p>VIII. As the people extolled him for all these services, <lb/>
            and were ready to show their good will towards him in <lb/>
            any way, he said on one occasion when he was addressing <lb/>
            them, that he would ask a favour, which he would value <lb/>
            above everything if it was granted, but if it were refused, <note type="footnote"> * The character of the Roman roads is here accurately described. <lb/>
            The straight lines in which they ran are nowhere more apparent than <lb/>
            in England, as may be seen by inspecting the Ordnance maps. That <lb/>
            from Lincoln to the Humber is a good example. It is conjectured that <lb/>
            some of the strong substructions at La Riccia (Aricia) on the Appian <lb/>
            Road near Rome may be the work of Cams; but I do not know on <lb/>
            what this opinion rests. (See Classical Museum, ii. 164.) </note><note type="footnote"> The Roman mile is tolerably well ascertained. It is variously es­ <lb/>

            he should not complain. It was accordingly expected that <lb/>
            he would ask for the consulship, and everybody supposed <lb/>
            that he would be a candidate for the consulship and the tri­ <lb/>
            bunate at the same time. When the consular comitia were <lb/>
            near, and all were at the highest point of expectation, Caius <lb/>
            appeared conducting Caius Fannius into the Campus <lb/>
            Martius, and canvassing with his friends for Fannius.* <lb/>
            This gave Fannius a great advantage. Fannius was <lb/>
            elected consul, and Caius tribune for the second time, <lb/>
            though he was neither a candidate nor canvassed, but his <lb/>
            election was entirely due to the zeal of the people. Per­ <lb/>
            ceiving, however, that the senate was clearly opposed to <lb/>
            him, and that the kind feeling of Fannius towards him <lb/>
            cooled, he forthwith endeavoured to attach the people by <lb/>
            other measures, by proposing to send colonies to Tarentum <lb/>
            and Capua, and by inviting the Latins to a participation <lb/>
            in the Roman franchise. The senate, fearing that Gracchus <lb/>
            would become irresistible, attempted a new and unusual <lb/>
            method of diverting the people from him, by opposing <lb/>
            popular measures to his, and by gratifying the people, <lb/>
            contrary to sound policy. Livius Drusus was one of the <lb/>
            colleagues of Caius, a man by birth and education inferior <lb/>
            to none in Rome, and in character, eloquence, and wealth <lb/>
            equal to any who enjoyed either honour or power by the <lb/>
            aid of these advantages. To him accordingly the chief <lb/>
            nobles applied, and they urged him to attack Caius, and <lb/>
            to unite with them against him, not by adopting violent <lb/>
            measures, nor coming into collision with the many, but by <lb/>
            a course of administration adapted to please, and by making <lb/>
            such concessions as it would have been honourable to refuse, <lb/>
            even at the risk of unpopularity.</p>
          <p>IX. Livius, having agreed to employ his tribunitian <lb/>
            authority on the side of the senate, framed measures which <lb/>
            had neither any honourable nor any useful object: he only <lb/>
            had in view to outbid Caius in the popular favour, just as <lb/>
            it is in a comedy, by making himself busy and vying with <lb/>
            his rival. This showed most clearly that the senate were <note type="footnote">* Caius Fannius Strabo must not be confounded with the historian <lb/>
            of the same name. He was consul B.C. 122 with C. Domitius <lb/>
            Ahenobarbus. Cicero speaks of an excellent speech of his against the <lb/>
            proposal of Gracchus to give the Latins the full citizenship, and the <lb/>
            to the Italian allies. (Cic., Brutus. c. 26.) </note> <lb/>

            not displeased with the measures of Cams, but only wished <lb/>
            to destroy him or completely humble him. When Caius <lb/>
            proposed to send out ten colonies consisting of citizens of <lb/>
            the best character, the senate accused him of truckling to <lb/>
            the people; but they co-operated with Livius, who pro­ <lb/>
            posed twelve colonies, each of which was to consist of <lb/>
            three thousand needy citizens. They set themselves in <lb/>
            opposition to Caius when he proposed to distribute land <lb/>
            among the poor, subject to a yearly payment to the <lb/>
            treasury from each, on the ground that he was trying to <lb/>
            gain the popular favour; but they were satisfied when <lb/>
            Livius proposed to relieve the colonists even from this <lb/>
            payment. Further, Caius gave them offence by proposing <lb/>
            to confer on the Latins the Roman suffrage; but when <lb/>
            Livius brought forward a measure which forbade any Latin <lb/>
            to be beaten with rods even while serving in the army, <lb/>
            they supported it. And indeed Livius himself, in his <lb/>
            harangues to the people, always said that he only proposed <lb/>
            what was agreeable to the senate, who had a regard for <lb/>
            the many; which indeed was the only good that resulted <lb/>
            from his measures. For the people became more pacific­ <lb/>
            ally disposed towards the senate; and though the most <lb/>
            distinguished of them were formerly suspected and hated <lb/>
            by the people, Livius did away with and softened their <lb/>
            recollection of past grievances and their ill feeling, by <lb/>
            giving out that it was in accordance with the wish of the <lb/>
            senate that he had entered upon his popular career and <lb/>
            framed measures to please the many.</p>
          <p>X. But the best proof to the people of the good intentions <lb/>
            and honesty of Livius was, that he proposed nothing for <lb/>
            himself or in behalf of his own interests; for he appointed <lb/>
            other persons to superintend the establishment of the <lb/>
            colonies, and he did not meddle with the administration of <lb/>
            the money, while Caius had assigned to himself most of <lb/>
            such functions, and the most important of them. It hap­ <lb/>
            pened that Rubrius, one of the tribunes, had proposed a <lb/>
            measure for the colonisation of Carthage, which had been <lb/>
            destroyed by Scipio ; and as the lot fell on Caius, he set sail <lb/>
            to Libya to found the colony. In his absence, Drusus, <lb/>
            making still further advances, insinuated himself into the <lb/>
            favour of the people, and gained them over mainly by <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            calumniating Fulvius.* This Fulvius was a friend of <lb/>
            Caius and a joint commissioner for the distribution of <lb/>
            lands; but he was a noisy fellow, and specially disliked <lb/>
            by the senate; he was also suspected by others of stirring <lb/>
            up the allies, and secretly encouraging the Italians to <lb/>
            revolt; and though this was said without proof or inquiry, <lb/>
            Fulvius himself gave it credit by his unwise and revolu­ <lb/>
            tionary policy. This more than anything else destroyed <lb/>
            the popularity of Caius, who came in for his share of the <lb/>
            odium against Fulvius. And when Scipiot Africanus died <lb/>
            without any obvious cause, and certain signs of blows and <lb/>
            violence were supposed to be visible on the body, as I told <lb/>
            in the Life of Scipio, the suspicion fell chiefly on Fulvius, <lb/>
            who was his enemy, and on that day had abused Scipio <lb/>
            from the Rostra. Suspicion attached to Caius also. <lb/>
            So abominable a crime committed against the first and <lb/>
            greatest of the Romans went unpunished, and there was <lb/>
            not even an inquiry; for the many opposed it and stopped <lb/>
            the investigation through fear for Caius, lest he should be <lb/>
            discovered to be implicated in the murder. These events, <lb/>
            indeed, belong to an earlier period.</p>

            (c. 16): his house was pulled down, and the ground made public <lb/>
            property. </note><note type="footnote"> † Plutarch's Life of the younger Scipio Africanus is lost. Scipio <lb/>
            died B.O. 159, six years before Caius was tribune. He had retired to <lb/>

            speech to deliver before the people on the subject of the Agrarian Law <lb/>
            of Tiberius Gracchus and the difficulties of carrying it into effect. He <lb/>
            was found dead in the morning, and it was the general opinion that he <lb/>
            was murdered. His wife Sempronia was suspected, and even Cornelia <lb/>
            his mother-in-law, as well as 0. Gracchus. C. Papirius Carbo, one of the <lb/>
            triumviri for dividing the land with Caius and Fulvius Flaccus is dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly mentioned by Cicero as one of the murderers. As to him, there <lb/>
            is no doubt that he was believed to be guilty. It is also admitted by all <lb/>
            authorities that there was no inquiry into the death of Scipio; and <lb/>

            Caius named Junonia, which is the same as Heraea, it is <lb/>
            said there were many supernatural hindrances. Foi the <lb/>
            first standard was seized and broken by a violent gust of <lb/>
            wind, though the standard-bearer stuck to it vigorously; <lb/>
            and the victims which were lying on the altars were dis­ <lb/>
            persed by a tempest, and scattered beyond the stakes <lb/>
            which marked the limits of the city, and the stakes were <lb/>
            torn up by tho wolves and carried a long way off. How­ <lb/>
            ever Caius, after settling and arranging everything in <lb/>
            seventy days, returned to Rome upon hearing that Fulvius <lb/>
            was hard pressed by Drusus, and that affairs required his <lb/>
            presence. Lucius Opimius, a man who belonged to the <lb/>
            faction of the oligarchs,* and had great influence in the <lb/>
            senate, failed on a former occasion when he was a candi­ <lb/>
            date for the consulship, at the time when Caius brought <lb/>
            forward Fannius and canvassed against Opimius; but <lb/>
            now, being supported by a powerful party, it was expected <lb/>
            that Opimius would be elected consul and would put down <lb/>
            Caius, whose influence was already in some degree on the <lb/>
            wane, and the people also were tired of such measures as <lb/>
            his, for there were many who sought their favour, and <lb/>
            the senate easily gave way.</p>
          <p>XII. On his return from Libya, Caius removed from the <lb/>
            Palatium to the neighbourhood of the Forum, as being a <lb/>
            more popular place of residence, for it happened that most <lb/>
            of the lowest classes of the poor lived there ; he next pro­ <lb/>
            mulgated the rest of his measures, intending to take the <lb/>
            vote of the people upon them. As crowds were collecting <note type="footnote"> of Carthage heavy imprecations were laid on any man who should <lb/>
            restore the city. The colony was established by Cæsar the Dictator. </note><note type="footnote"> The foundation of a Roman colony was accompanied with solemn <lb/>
            ceremonials, to which Plutarch alludes. The anniversary day of the <lb/>
            foundation was religiously observed. On some Roman coins there is a <lb/>
            representation of a man driving a yoke of oxen and a vexillum <lb/>
            (standard), which are the symbols of a Roman colony. </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch has here used the word oligarch (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχικός</foreign>), one who <lb/>
            is a friend to the party of the Few as opposed to the Many. The <lb/>
            meaning of an oligarchy, according to Aristotle (Politik, 4, c. 4), is a <lb/>
            government in which the rich and those of noble birth possess the <lb/>
            political power, being Few in number. But the smallness of the <lb/>
            number is only an accident: the essence of an oligarchy consists in the <lb/>
            power being in the hands of the rich and the noble, who happen in all <lb/>

            from all parts to support Caius, the senate prevailed on <lb/>
            the consul Fannius to drive out of the city all who were <lb/>
            not Romans. Accordingly a strange and unusual pro­ <lb/>
            clamation was made, to the effect that none of the allies or <lb/>
            friends of the Roman state should appear in Rome during <lb/>
            those days; on which Caius published a counter edict, in <lb/>
            which he criminated the consul and promised his support <lb/>
            to the allies if they remained in Rome. But he did not <lb/>
            keep his promise; for though he saw one of them, who <lb/>
            was his own friend and intimate, dragged off by the <lb/>
            officers of Fannius, he passed by without helping him, <lb/>
            whether it was that he feared to put to the test his power <lb/>
            which was now on the decline, or that he did not choose, <lb/>
            as he said, to give his enemies the opportunity which they <lb/>
            were seeking of coming to a collision and a struggle. It <lb/>
            also chanced that he had incurred the ill-will of his fellow- <lb/>
            colleagues, in the following manner :-l'he people were <lb/>
            going to see an exhibition of gladiators in the Forum, and <lb/>
            most of the magistrates had constructed seats round the <lb/>
            place, with the intention of letting them for hire. But <lb/>
            Caius urged them to remove the seats, that the poor might <lb/>
            be able to see the show without paying. As no one took <lb/>
            any notice of what he said, he waited till the night before <lb/>
            the show, when he went with the workmen whom he had <lb/>
            under him, and removed the seats, and at daybreak he <lb/>
            pointed out to the people that the place was clear; for <lb/>
            which the many considered him a man, but he offended <lb/>
            his colleagues, who viewed him as an audacious and violent <lb/>
            person. Owing to this circumstance, it is supposed, he <lb/>
            lost his third tribunate, though he had most votes, for it <lb/>
            is said that his colleagues acted illegally and fraudulently <lb/>
            in the proclamation and return. This, however, was dis­ <lb/>
            puted. Caius did not bear his failure well: and to his <lb/>
            enemies, who were exulting over him, he is said to have <lb/>
            observed, with more arrogance than was befitting, that <lb/>
            their laugh was a sardonic laugh,. for they knew not <note type="footnote"> * This was a proverbial expression, of which different explanations <lb/>

            eat it to laugh till they die; and he supposes that Homer's expression <lb/>

            what a darkness his political measures had spread all <lb/>
            around them.</p>
          <p>XIII. After effecting the election of Opimius to the <lb/>
            consulship, the enemies of Caius began to repeal many <lb/>
            of his laws and to disturb the settlement of Carthage, <lb/>
            for the purpose of irritating Caius, in order that he might <lb/>
            give them some cause of quarrel, and so be got rid of. <lb/>
            He endured this for some time, but his friends, and <lb/>
            especially Fulvius, beginning to urge him on, he again <lb/>
            attempted to combine his partisans against the consul. <lb/>
            On this occasion it is said that his mother also helped him, <lb/>
            by hiring men from remote parts and sending them to <lb/>
            Rome in the disguise of reapers, for it is supposed that <lb/>
            these matters are obscurely alluded to in her letters­ <lb/>
            to her son. Others, on the contrary, say that this was <lb/>
            done quite contrary to the wishes of Cornelia. On the <lb/>
            day on which the party of Opimius intended to repeal <lb/>
            the laws of Caius, the Capitol had been occupied by <lb/>
            the opposite faction early in the morning. The consul <lb/>
            had offered the sacrifices, and one of his officers, named <lb/>
            Quintus Antyllius,† was carrying the viscera to another <lb/>
            part, when he said to the partisans of Fulvius, “ Make <lb/>
            way for honest men, you rascals." Some say that as <lb/>
            he uttered these words he also held out his bare arm <lb/>
            with insulting gestures. However this may be, Antyllius <lb/>
            was killed on the spot, being pierced with large styles t <lb/>

            people were greatly disturbed at the murder, but it <lb/>
            produced exactly opposite effects on the leaders of the <lb/>
            two parties. Caius was deeply grieved at what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened, and abused his party for having given a handle <lb/>
            to their enemies, who had long been looking for it; but <lb/>
            Opimius, as if he had got the opportunity which he <lb/>
            wanted, was highly elated, and urged the people to avenge <lb/>
            the murder.</p>
          <p>XIV. A torrent of rain happened to fall just then, <lb/>
            and the meeting was dissolved. Early on the following <lb/>
            day Opimius summoned the senate to transact business. <lb/>
            In the mean time the naked body of Antyllius was placed <lb/>
            on a bier, and, according to arrangement, carried through <lb/>
            the Forum past the senate-house with loud cries and <lb/>
            lamentations. Opimius, though he knew what was going <lb/>
            on, pretended to be surprised at the noise, and the senators <lb/>
            went out to see what was the matter. When the bier had <lb/>
            been set down in the midst of the crowd, the senators <lb/>
            began to express their indignation at so horrible and <lb/>
            monstrous a crime; but this only moved the people to <lb/>
            hate and execrate the oligarchs, who, after murdering <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol, a tribune, had treated <lb/>
            his body with insult; while Antyllius, a mere servant, <lb/>
            who perhaps had not deserved his fate, yet was mainly <lb/>
            to blame for what happened, was laid out in the Forum, <lb/>
            and surrounded by the Roman senate lamenting and <lb/>
            assisting at the funeral of a hireling; and all this merely <lb/>
            to accomplish the ruin of the only remaining guardian <lb/>
            of the people's liberties. On returning to the senate- <lb/>
            house, the senators passed a decree- by which the consul <lb/>
            Opimius was directed to save the state in such way as <lb/>
            he could, and to put down the tyrants. Opimius gave <note type="footnote"> * The form of the decree was, Videant consules ne quid respublica <lb/>
            detriments capiat (Livius, 3, c. 4), which empowered the consuls or <lb/>
            consul, as the case might be, to provide that the commonwealth sustained <lb/>
            no damage. The word detrimentum, which signifies damage caused <lb/>
            by rubbing off, had a tacit reference to the majestas of the Populus <lb/>
            Romanus. The majestas (majesty) of the state is its integrity, its <lb/>
            wholeness, any diminution of which was an offence; and under the <lb/>
            Emperors the crime of majestas, that is majestas impaired, was equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to high treason. The decree here alluded to was only adopted, as <lb/>
            Livius expresses it, in the utmost extremity, when the state was in <lb/>
            danger; its effect was to proclaim martial law, and to suspend for the <lb/>
            time all the usual forms of proceeding. </note> <lb/>

            notice to the senators to arm, and each eques was com­ <lb/>
            manded to bring in the morning two armed slaves. On <lb/>
            the other side, Fulvius also made preparation and got <lb/>
            together a rabble; but Caius as he left the Forum stood <lb/>
            opposite his father's statue, and looking at it for some <lb/>
            time without speaking, at last burst into tears, and <lb/>
            fetching a deep sigh, walked away. The sight of this <lb/>
            moved many of the spectators to compassion, and blaming <lb/>
            themselves for deserting the man and betraying him, they <lb/>
            came to the house of Caius and passed the night at his <lb/>
            door; but not in the same manner as those who watched <lb/>
            about the house of Fulvius, for they spent the night in <lb/>
            tumult and shouting, drinking, and bragging what they <lb/>
            would do. Fulvius himself, who was the first to get <lb/>
            drunk, spoke and acted in a way quite unseemly for a <lb/>
            man of his age. The followers of Caius, viewing the <lb/>
            state of affairs as a public calamity, kept quiet, thinking <lb/>
            of the future, and they passed the night watching and <lb/>
            sleeping in turns.</p>
          <p>XV. At daybreak Fulvius was with difficulty roused <lb/>
            from his drunken sleep, and his partisans, arming them­ <lb/>
            selves with the warlike spoils in his house, which he had <lb/>
            taken in his victory over the Gauls during his consulship, <lb/>
            with loud threats and shouts went to seize the Aventine <lb/>
            Hill.- Caius would not arm, but went out in his toga <lb/>
            just as if he was proceeding to the Forum, with only a <lb/>
            short dagger at his side. As he was going out at the <lb/>
            door, his wife met him, and throwing one arm round him, <lb/>
            while she held in the other their little child, said, " Caius, <lb/>
            not as in time past do I take my leave of you going to the <lb/>
            Rostra as tribune and as legislator, nor yet going to a <lb/>
            glorious war, where, if you died in the service of your <lb/>
            country, you would still leave me an honoured grief; but <lb/>
            you are going to expose yourself to the murderers of Tibe­ <lb/>
            rius : 'tis right indeed to go unarmed, and to suffer rather <lb/>
            than do wrong, but you will perish without benefiting the <lb/>
            state. The worst has now prevailed; force and the sword <lb/>
            determine all controversies. If your brother had died at <lb/>
            Numantia, his body would have been restored to us on the <note type="footnote"> * This was one of the hills or eminences in Rome: it was the <lb/>
            plebeian quarter. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            usual terms of war; but now perchance I too shall have to <lb/>
            supplicate some river or the sea to render up to me your <lb/>
            corpse from its keeping. What faith can we put in the <lb/>
            laws or in the deities since the murder of Tiberius?" <lb/>
            While Licinia was thus giving vent to sorrow, Grac­ <lb/>
            chus gently freed himself from his wife's embrace, and <lb/>
            went off in silence with his friends. Licinia, as she <lb/>
            attempted to lay hold of his dress, fell down on the floor, <lb/>
            and lay there some time speechless, until her slaves took <lb/>
            her up fainting, and carried her to her brother Crassus.</p>
          <p>XVI. When they were all assembled, Fulvius, at the <lb/>
            request of Caius, sent his younger son with a caduceus * <lb/>
            to the Forum. He was a most beautiful youth, and with <lb/>
            great decorum and modesty, and with tears in his eyes he <lb/>
            addressed to the consul and the senate the message of <lb/>
            conciliation. The majority who were present were not <lb/>
            disinclined to come to terms; but Opimius replied, that <lb/>
            Fulvius and Gracchus must not attempt to bring the <lb/>
            senate to an accommodation through the medium of a <lb/>
            messenger; they must consider themselves as citizens who <lb/>
            had to account for their conduct, and come down and <lb/>
            surrender, and then beg for mercy; he further told the <lb/>
            youth that these were the terms on which he must come <lb/>
            a second time, or not at all. Now Caius, it is said, <lb/>
            wished to go and clear himself before the senate, but as no <lb/>
            one else assented, Fulvius again sent his son to address the <lb/>
            senate on their behalf in the same terms as before. But <lb/>
            Opimius, who was eager to come to blows, forthwith ordered <lb/>
            the youth to be seized and put in prison, and advanced <lb/>
            against the party of Fulvius with many legionary soldiers <lb/>
            and Cretan bowmen t who mainly contributed to put them <lb/>
            into confusion by discharging their arrows and wounding <lb/>
            them. The partisans of Fulvius being put to flight, he <lb/>
            made his escape into a bath that was not used where he <lb/>
            was soon discovered and put to death with his elder son. <lb/>
            Caius was not observed to take any part in the contest, <lb/>
            but greatly troubled at what was taking place, he retired <note type="footnote"> * This is the Roman term which corresponds to the kerukeion <lb/>

            but was prevented by his faithful friends Pomponius and <lb/>
            Licinius, who took the sword away and induced him to fly. <lb/>
            It is said that he went down on his knees in the temple, <lb/>
            and stretching out his hands to the statue of the goddess, <lb/>
            prayed that the Roman people, for their ingratitude and <lb/>
            treachery to him, might always be slaves; for the greater <lb/>
            part of them had openly gone over to the other side upon <lb/>
            an amnesty * being proclaimed.</p>
          <p>XVII. In his flight Caius was followed by his enemies, <lb/>
            who were near overtaking him at the wooden bridge, t <lb/>
            but his two friends, bidding him make his escape, opposed <lb/>
            the pursuers and allowed no man to pass the head of the <lb/>
            bridge till they were killed. Caius was accompanied by a <lb/>
            single slave, named Philocrates, t and though all the spec­ <lb/>
            tators urged him to fly, just as if they were shouting <lb/>
            at a race, yet no one, though he prayed for it, would come <lb/>
            to his aid or lend him a horse: for the pursuers were close <lb/>
            upon him. He just escaped into a sacred grove of the <lb/>
            Furies, § and there he fell by the hand of Philocrates, who <lb/>
            killed himself on the body of his master. Some say <lb/>
            both of them were taken alive by their enemies, and thai <lb/>
            the slave embraced his master so closely, that Caius could <note type="footnote"> * This is not Plutarch's word, but it expresses his meaning, and he <lb/>

            a Greek, of whom there were now many at Rome. They were valued <lb/>
            for their superior acquirements and dexterity, and filled the higher <lb/>

            not be struck until the slave had been dispatched first, and <lb/>
            with many blows. It is said that a man cut off the head <lb/>
            of Caius and was carrying it away, but it was taken from <lb/>
            him by a friend of Opimius named Septimuleius; for <lb/>
            proclamation had been made at the beginning of the <lb/>
            contest, that those who brought the heads of Caius and <lb/>
            Fulvius should have their weight in gold. The head <lb/>
            of Caius was brought to Opimius by Septimuleius stuck on <lb/>
            a spear, and it weighed seventeen pounds and two-thirds in <lb/>
            the scales. Septimuleius was a scoundrel and a knave * <lb/>
            here also, for he had taken out the brain and dropped <lb/>
            melted lead in its place. Those who brought the head of <lb/>
            Fulvius got nothing, for they belonged to the lower <lb/>
            class. The bodies of Caius and Fulvius and their par­ <lb/>
            tisans were thrown into the river, the number of dead being <lb/>
            three thousand: their property was sold and the produce <lb/>
            paid into the treasury. They also forbade the women to <lb/>
            lament for their relatives, and Licinia was deprived of her <lb/>
            marriage portion. But their conduct was most cruel to <lb/>
            the younger son of Fulvius, who had neither raised up his <lb/>
            hand against them nor been among the combatants; for <lb/>
            he was seized before the battle, when he came to treat of <lb/>
            terms, and was put to death after the battle. But what <lb/>
            most of all vexed the people was the circumstance of <lb/>
            Opimius erecting a temple to Concord, which was viewed <lb/>
            as an evidence of his insolence and arrogance, and as a <lb/>
            kind of triumph for the slaughter of so many citizens. <lb/>
            Accordingly by night some person wrote under the in­ <lb/>
            scription on the temple the following line :— <lb/>
            The work of Discard t makes the temple of Concord. <note type="footnote"> * Opimius must have been as great a knave as Septimuleius, for the <lb/>
            fraud was palpable. Stories of this kind are generally given with <lb/>
            variations. Plinius (N. H. 33, c. 14) says it was the mouth that was <lb/>
            filled with lead, and that Septimuleius had been a confidential friend <lb/>
            of Caius. This was the first instance in Rome of head money being <lb/>
            offered and paid ; but the example was followed in the proscriptions of <lb/>
            Sulla, and those of the triumviri Lepidus, M. Antonius, and Cæsar <lb/>

            cised the dictatorial power in the office of consul, and who <lb/>
            had condemned without trial three thousand citizens, and <lb/>

            Flaccus, a consular, who had enjoyed a triumph; <lb/>

            putation—this Opimius did not keep himself free from <lb/>
            corruption. Being sent as a commissioner to Jugurtha, <lb/>
            the Numidian, he was bribed by him, and being convicted <lb/>
            of most shameful corruption, he spent the last years of his <lb/>
            life in infamy, hated and insulted by the people, who, <lb/>
            though humbled and depressed for the time, soon showed <lb/>
            how much they desired and regretted the Gracchi. Foi <lb/>
            they had statues of the two brothers made and set up in <lb/>
            public places, and the spots on which they fell were de­ <lb/>
            clared sacred ground, to which people brought all the first <lb/>
            fruits of the seasons, and many persons daily offered sacri­ <lb/>
            fices there and worshipped, just as at the temples of the gods.</p>

            with a noble and elevated spirit, and to have said of the <lb/>
            sacred ground on which her sons were murdered, that <lb/>
            they had a tomb worthy of them. She resided in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Misenum, without making any change <lb/>
            in her usual mode of life. She had many friends, and <lb/>
            her hospitable table was always crowded with guests; <lb/>
            Greeks and learned men were constantly about her, and <lb/>
            kings sent and received presents from her. To all her <lb/>
            visitors and friends she was a most agreeable companion: <note type="footnote"> * Caius Opimius was consul with Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, <lb/>
            s.c. 121, the year of the death of Caius. The history of his conduct in <lb/>
            Libya is told by Sallustius in the Jugurthine war. He was one of ten <lb/>
            commissioners who were sent, B.o. 112, to settle the disputes between <lb/>
            Adherbal, the son of Micipsa, and Jugurtha, the illegitimate son of <lb/>
            Micipsa's brother. The commissioners were bribed by Jugurtba and <lb/>
            decided in his favour. Opimius and the rest of them were tried for the <lb/>
            offence, B.C. 109, and banished. Opimius died in great poverty at <lb/>
            Dyrrachium (Durazzo) in Epirus. (Sallustius, Jugurthine War, c. 134: <lb/>
            Velleius, ii. 7.) Cicero thinks that Opimius was very hardly used after <lb/>
            his services in crushing the insurrection at Fregellæ and putting down <lb/>
            the disturbances excited by Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus: her <lb/>
            calls him the saviour of the state, and laments his condemnation <lb/>

            she would tell them of the life and habits of her father <lb/>

            relating their sufferings and their deeds to her inquiring <lb/>
            friends as if she was speaking of the men of olden time. <lb/>
            This made some think that her understanding had been <lb/>
            impaired by old age or the greatness of her sorrows, and <lb/>
            that she was dull to all sense of her misfortunes, while in <lb/>
            fact such people themselves were too dull to see what a <lb/>
            support it is against grief to have a noble nature, and to <lb/>
            be of honourable lineage and honourably bred; and that <lb/>

            in its attempts to guard against evils, yet she cannot <lb/>

            fashion to name a law after the gentile name of him who proposed it. <lb/>
            The most important of the measures of Cuius have been mentioned <lb/>
            by Plutarch, with the exception of a law about the provinces. At the <lb/>
            outbreak of the Social War, B.O. 91, the Roman provinces compre­ <lb/>
            bended Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, the Spanish Peninsula the whole of <lb/>
            which, however, was not subdued, Cisalpine Gaul, Asia, Macedonia, <lb/>
            Acliæa, Transalpine Gaul, and some others of less note. </note><note type="footnote"> The original sense of the word provincia had no reference to a <lb/>
            territory, though this is the later sense of the word and the common <lb/>
            usage of it. The functions of the prætor urbanus who stayed at Rome <lb/>
            were called his provincia, that is, the administration of justice was his <lb/>
            provincia or business. The word is used in the sense of a function or <lb/>
            office by Livius with reference to a time when there was no provincia <lb/>
            in the later sense of the word. In the time of Cicero, provincia <lb/>
            signified a territory out of Italy, which was administered by a Roman <lb/>
            governor. The term Italy, at this time, did not comprise the whole <lb/>
            peninsula, but only that part which was south of the rivers Rubico and <lb/>
            Macra. The primary meaning of the word is confirmed by its etymo­ <lb/>
            logy; provincia is a shortened form of providentia, which also <lb/>
            appears in the shape prudentia. Providentia signifies "foresight,” <lb/>
            “ superintending care," and so forth; and it is formed on the same <lb/>
            principle as beneficentia, benevolentia, and other Latin words which <lb/>
            are of a participial character. The etymology of Niebuhr (proventus) is <lb/>
            untenable, and that which I have partly adopted (Smith's Dict. of <lb/>
            Antiquities, art. “ Provincia") is no better. Since writing that article, <lb/>
            I saw that the word is only another form of providentia, and a friend <lb/>
            has pointed out to me that Mr. G. C. Lewis first suggested this as the <lb/>
            origin of the word in his Essay on the Government of Dependencies, <lb/>
            London, 1841, Note H. p. 353. If this explanation of the word in </note><pb n="113"/>
             <note type="footnote">correct, the trod orthography is provintia, but I have not yet been able to find it on an inscription.</note> <note type="footnote"> The old practice was for the Senate, after the elections of the Consuls <lb/>
            and Prætors, to name two provinces which should be given to the <lb/>
            consuls after the consulship was expired. The two consuls settled by <lb/>
            lot or by agreement which province of the two they should have. As <lb/>
            the consuls were chosen before the two cousular provinces were deter­ <lb/>
            mined by the senate, it was in the power of the senate to give what pro­ <lb/>
            vinces they pleased to the consuls, and so make the appointment either <lb/>
            a favour or not. A law of Gracchus enacted that the two consular <lb/>
            provinces should be determined before the election of consuls, and <lb/>
            that the senate should not have the power, which they had formerly <lb/>
            exercised, of prolonging a man's government in a province beyond the <lb/>
            year. This law manifestly limited the power of the Senate, though <lb/>
            some writers conceive that it was enacted for the advantage of that <lb/>
            body as some compensation for their loss of the judicial power. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch has treated the subject of the Gracchi with perfect <lb/>
            impartiality. He has given them credit for good motives, and <lb/>
            approved of their measures in general, but he has not disguised their <lb/>
            faults. Appian considered that the measures of Tiberius were for the <lb/>
            public good, but that his conduct was not judicious. Sallustius also <lb/>
            admits that the Gracchi did not conduct themselves with sufficient <lb/>
            moderation (Jugurthine War, c. 46); but Sallustius belonged to the <lb/>
            popular party, and he approved of their measures. Most of the other <lb/>
            Roman writers express an unfavourable opinion of the Gracchi. Florus <lb/>
            however gives them credit for good intentions, but disapproves of the <lb/>
            means by which they attempted to carry their measures into effect. <lb/>
            That part of the work of Livius which treated of this period is lost, <lb/>
            but we may collect his opinions of the Gracchi from the Epitomes <lb/>
            of the lost books, and the general tenor of his History. The <lb/>
            measures of the Gracchi were estimated by the rule of party spirit. <lb/>
            The judgment of Cicero, who often mentions the Gracchi, is both for <lb/>
            and against. His expressed opinion, whatever might be his real <lb/>
            opinion, varied with circumstances. If we only knew his opinion from <lb/>
            the second oration against the Agrarian Law of Rullus (ii. 5), we should <lb/>
            consider him as approving of all the measures of the Gracchi. When <lb/>
            he delivered that oration, Cicero had jus been elected Consul: he was <lb/>
            a Novus homo, a new man as the Romans called him, who was the first <lb/>
            of his family to attain to the high honours of the State, and he had <lb/>
            obtained the consulship as a friend of the people, as a popular <lb/>
            man (Popularis). In his treatise on Friendship and other of <lb/>
            his writings, he gives a contradictory judgment of the Gracchi; he <lb/>
            says that Tiberius Gracchus aimed at the kingly power, or rather in <lb/>
            fact was king for a few months; he calls the two Gracchi degenerate <lb/>
            sons of their father; he extols the murderers of Tiberius Gracchus; ho <lb/>
            commiserates the hard fate of Opimius after saving the state by putting <lb/>
            Caius Gracchus to death. All this was written or said after he was <lb/>
            consul, after he had done what the murderers of the Gracchi had done, <lb/>
            after he had put to death Catilina and his accomplices without trial <lb/>
            contrary to the constitution, contrary to a special law which Caius </note><note type="footnote">VOL. IV </note><note type="footnote">I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="footnote"> Gracchus had carried that no Roman citizen should be put to death <lb/>
            without a duly constituted trial; after he had, like Nasica and Opimius, <lb/>
            made himself a murderer by putting men to death without letting them <lb/>
            be tried according to law; whether they were guilty or not, is imma­ <lb/>
            terial; they were put to death without trial, contrary to a principle of <lb/>
            justice which, before he became guilty himself, Cicero bad maintained <lb/>
            and defended. The acts of the Gracchi were on record and well <lb/>
            understood; but Cicero made his opinion of their acts depend not on <lb/>
            his convictions, but on his interests; it is to him mainly that we may <lb/>
            trace the common notion that the Gracchi were merely a couple of <lb/>
            designing demagogues. The Gracchi were not wise. enough or firm <lb/>
            enough to be good reformers, but few reformers in so difficult a situa­ <lb/>
            tion have left behind them so fair a reputation for honest intention. <lb/>
            There was a great mass of contemporary materials for the history of <lb/>
            the Gracchi, consisting of the speeches of the two brothers, of the <lb/>
            numerous speeches made against them, the history of Polybius, who <lb/>
            could not have overlooked the Gracchi in his account of the Numantine <lb/>
            war, the history of Fannius, and other materials which Gerlach has <lb/>
            enumerated in his Essay on the Gracchi. It is plain from Plutarch's <lb/>
            narrative, that he used these authorities; and if we consider how far <lb/>
            removed he was from the time of the Gracchi, and his character, we <lb/>
            may conclude that he has given as impartial a view of the times as he <lb/>
            could collect from contemporary evidence. He may have made mistakes, <lb/>
            and some mistakes we cannot help considering that he has made; but <lb/>
            he can hardly have made any mistake in his representation of the <lb/>
            nature of the reforms which the two brothers attempted, of the opposi­ <lb/>
            tion that they encountered, and of their general character. </note><note type="footnote"> Misenum.] Misenum was on the coast of Campania near Cape Miseno, <lb/>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF TIBERIUS AND CAIUS GRACCHUS WITH AGIS AND KLEOMENES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. Now that we have completed the narrative of these <lb/>
            men's lives, it remains for us to compare them with one <lb/>
            another. As for the Gracchi, not even their bitterest <lb/>
            enemies could deny that they were the most virtuous of <lb/>
            all the Romans, or that they were excellently well <lb/>
            nurtured and educated; while Agis and Kleomenes <lb/>
            appear to have excelled them in strength of mind, because <lb/>
            they both, after having been brought up in the same <lb/>
            fashion by which their elders had been corrupted, became <lb/>
            the restorers of temperance and simplicity of life. Further­ <lb/>
            more, the Gracchi, who lived at a period when Rome was <lb/>
            at the height of its greatness and renown, felt ashamed to <lb/>
            fall short of the glorious achievements of their forefathers ; <lb/>
            while the virtuous impulses of the others were not checked <lb/>
            by their fathers having pursued the opposite course of <lb/>
            policy, or by the miserable and distracted condition of <lb/>
            their country. The greatest proof of the unselfishness and <lb/>
            indifference to money of the Gracchi is that they filled <lb/>
            various offices in the state, and yet kept their hands clean <lb/>
            from dishonest gains ; while it would be an insult to Agis <lb/>
            to praise him for not having taken other men's money, as <lb/>
            he gave up to his countrymen his own private property, <lb/>
            which alone was worth six hundred talents. If then he <lb/>
            thought it discreditable for him to be richer than any of <lb/>
            his countrymen, even though his riches were lawfully <lb/>
            acquired, what must have been his abhorrence of those <lb/>
            who obtain money wrongfully.</p>
          <p>II. There was also a great difference in the boldness and <lb/>
            extent of their schemes of reform. The Gracchi were <lb/>
            chiefly engaged in the construction of roads and the found- <note type="footnote">1 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            ing of cities, and Tiberius's most important measure of <lb/>
            reform was the division of the public lanes among the <lb/>
            people, while the best act of his brother Caius was the <lb/>
            establishment of a mixed tribunal by adding to the three <lb/>
            hundred Senators three hundred Roman Knights. The <lb/>
            revolution effected by Agis and Kleomenes was of quite a <lb/>
            different kind. They thought, in Plato's words, that to <lb/>
            proceed by slow degrees was merely cutting off the heads <lb/>
            of the hydra,. and therefore they by one comprehensive <lb/>
            measure swept away all abuses at once: although it would <lb/>
            be nearer the truth to say that they swept all abuses out <lb/>
            of the state by restoring to it its original constitution. It <lb/>
            may also be observed that the reforms of the Gracchi were <lb/>
            opposed by some of the most powerful men in Rome, <lb/>
            whereas the legislation which was begun by Agis, and <lb/>
            completed by Kleomenes, followed a famous and ancient <lb/>
            precedent, the rhetras on sobriety and equality which had <lb/>
            been communicated to their ancestors by Lykurgus with <lb/>
            the sanction of the Pythian Apollo. It is also most <lb/>
            important to notice that the reforms of the Gracchi made <lb/>
            Rome no greater than she was before, while the acts of <lb/>
            Kleomenes enabled him in a short time to make Sparta <lb/>
            mistress of the whole of Peloponnesus, and to engage in a <lb/>
            contest with the most powerful man of his time, with the <lb/>
            object of ridding Greece from Illyrian and Gaulish <lb/>
            mercenary troops, and of renewing its ancient glories <lb/>
            under the rule of the Herakleidæ.</p>
          <p>III. I think too that the deaths of these men show a <lb/>
            certain difference in their courage. The Gracchi fought <lb/>
            with their countrymen, and were slain by them while <lb/>
            flying, while of the other two, Agis may almost be said to <lb/>
            have died voluntarily, because he would not put a citizen <lb/>
            to death, while Kleomenes, when insulted and ill-treated, <lb/>
            fiercely attempted to avenge himself, and as circumstances <lb/>
            prevented his succeeding, bravely killed himself. It may <lb/>
            be said on the other side that Agis never distinguished <lb/>
            himself in the field, and we may set against the many <note type="footnote"> * Alluding to tho fight of Herakles with the Lemæan hydra <lb/>
            wh;ch had nine heads. Herakles struck off its heads with his club, <lb/>
            but in the place of the head he out off two new heads grew forth each <lb/>
            time. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            brilliant victories of Kleomenes the scaling of the wall of <lb/>
            Carthage by Tiberius Gracchus, no slight achievement, <lb/>
            and the peace which he made with the Numantines, by <lb/>
            which he saved the lives of twenty thousand Roman <lb/>
            soldiers, who could not otherwise have hoped to survive; <lb/>
            while Caius, in several campaigns both in Italy and <lb/>
            Sardinia, showed great military skill; so that they both <lb/>
            might have rivalled the fame of the greatest generals of <lb/>
            Rome, had they not been cut off so soon,</p>
          <p>IV. In political matters Agis appears to have shown <lb/>
            weakness, as he allowed Agesilaus to cheat the citizens out <lb/>
            of their promised redistribution of lands, and in a feeble <lb/>
            and vacillating manner announced his intention and then <lb/>
            abandoned it. The cause of his irresolution was his <lb/>
            extreme youth; while Kleomenes on the other hand <lb/>
            effected his revolution with too great promptitude and <lb/>
            daring, putting the Ephors to death without a trial, when <lb/>
            it would have been easy for him to have won them over to <lb/>
            his side, and banishing many of the citizens. It is not the <lb/>
            part either of a wise physician or of a good politician to <lb/>
            use the knife except in the last extremity, but it shows a <lb/>
            want of skill in both, and in the latter case it is unjust as <lb/>
            well as cruel. Of the Gracchi, neither would begin a civil <lb/>
            war, and Caius is said not even to have defended himself <lb/>
            when struck, but though forward enough in battle ho <lb/>
            was loth to fight in a party quarrel; for he appeared in <lb/>
            public unarmed, and retired when fighting began, and <lb/>
            evidently took more pains not to do any harm than not to <lb/>
            suffer any. For this reason we must regard the flight of <lb/>
            both the Gracchi as a proof, not of cowardice, but of <lb/>
            caution; for they must either have retreated when attacked <lb/>
            or have retaliated upon their opponents.</p>
          <p>V. The heaviest charge that can be brought against <lb/>
            Tiberius is that he deposed his colleague from the tribune­ <lb/>
            ship, and afterwards sought a second tribuneship for <lb/>
            himself. As for the murder of Antyllius, Caius Gracchus <lb/>
            was most falsely and unjustly accused of it, for he did not <lb/>
            wish him to die, and was grieved at his death. Again <lb/>
            Kleomenes, not to speak of his massacre of the Ephors, set <lb/>
            all the slaves at liberty, and practically made himself <lb/>
            despot of the kingdom, although for form's sake he associated <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            his brother with him, who was of the same family. And <lb/>
            when Archidamus, who was the next heir to the throne of <lb/>
            the other royal house, was persuaded by him to return <lb/>
            from Messene to Sparta, as Kleomenes did not avenge his <lb/>
            death, he caused men to suspect that he himself had some <lb/>
            share in it. Yet Lykurgus, whom he affected to imitate, <lb/>
            abdicated the throne of his own free will in favour of his <lb/>
            nephew Charilaus, and fearing that if the child died by <lb/>
            any mischance he might be thought guilty of having <lb/>
            caused its death, he travelled abroad for a long time and <lb/>
            did not return until Charilaus had begotten a son to <lb/>
            succeed him. However, no Greek can bear comparison <lb/>
            with Lykurgus; yet we have proved that Kleomenes <lb/>
            effected greater reforms, and showed less respect to the <lb/>
            laws than any of the others. Both the Greeks have been <lb/>
            blamed for having from the very outset aimed at being <lb/>
            nothing more than warlike depots; while the worst <lb/>
            enemies of the Romans only charge them with an <lb/>
            immoderate ambition, and admit that they became so <lb/>
            excited by the contest with their political opponents that <lb/>
            the natural heat of their temper drove them in spite of <lb/>
            themselves like a baleful gust of wind to advocate extreme <lb/>
            measures. What indeed can be more just or honourable <lb/>
            than the objects with which they started; for their troubles <lb/>
            were brought upon them by the opposition which the rich <lb/>
            offered to their laws, so that the one was forced to fight to <lb/>
            save his own life, while the other endeavoured to avenge <lb/>
            his brother, who was slain without law or justice ? From <lb/>
            what has been said the reader can himself form an opinion <lb/>
            about their respective merits, but if I must say what I <lb/>
            think of each, I should give the highest place in respect <lb/>
            of virtue to Tiberius Gracchus; I think that the young <lb/>
            Agis committed the fewest crimes; while in daring and <lb/>
            action Caius fell far short of Kleomenes.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. The writer of the Ode to Alkibiades on the occasion of <lb/>
            his winning the chariot-race at Olympia, whether he was <lb/>
            Euripides, as is commonly supposed, or some other poet, <lb/>
            my friend Sossius, tells us that the first thing necessary <lb/>
            for a perfectly happy man is that he should be born a <lb/>
            citizen of some famous city. But for my own part I <lb/>
            believe that for the enjoyment of true happiness, which <lb/>
            depends chiefly upon a man's character and disposition, <lb/>
            it makes no difference whether he be born in an obscure <lb/>
            state or of an ill-favoured mother, or not. It would <lb/>
            indeed be absurd if one were to suppose that the town <lb/>
            of lulls, which is only a small part of the little island of <lb/>
            Keos or Ægina, which some Athenian bade his country­ <lb/>
            men clear away because it was an eyesore to Peiræus, <lb/>
            should be able to produce good actors and poets, and yet <lb/>
            be unable to bring forth a just, virtuous, sensible and high- <lb/>
            minded man. We may reasonably expect that those arts <lb/>
            by which men gain glory or profit should be neglected <lb/>
            and fall into decay in small and obscure towns; but <lb/>
            virtue, like a hardy plant, can take root in any country <lb/>
            where it meets with noble natures and industrious dis­ <lb/>
            position. I myself therefore must lay the blame of my <lb/>
            intellectual and moral shortcomings, not upon the insig­ <lb/>
            nificance of my native city, but upon myself.</p>
          <p>II. However, when a man is engaged in compiling a <lb/>
            history from materials which are not ready to his hand, <lb/>
            but for the most part are to be found scattered through <lb/>
            other foreign towns, it becomes really of the first impor­ <lb/>
            tance that he should live in some famous, cultivated, and <lb/>
            populous city, where he can have unlimited access to <lb/>
            books of all kinds, and where he can also personally collect <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            and inquire into the truth of those stories which, though <lb/>
            not reduced to writing, are all the more likely to be true <lb/>
            because they rest upon universal popular tradition. <lb/>
            The work of a historian who is deprived of these advan­ <lb/>
            tages must necessarily be defective in many essential <lb/>
            particulars. Now I, who belong to a small city, and who <lb/>
            love to live in it lest it should become even smaller, when <lb/>
            I was at Rome, and during my travels in Italy, found my <lb/>
            time so taken up with political business and with the care <lb/>
            of my pupils in philosophy, that I had no leisure to learn <lb/>
            the Roman language, and have only applied myself to <lb/>
            Latin literature at a very advanced period of life. In this <lb/>
            reading of Latin books, singular as it may appear, I did not <lb/>
            find that the words assisted me to discover the meaning, <lb/>
            but rather that my knowledge of the history enabled me <lb/>
            to find out the meaning of the words. I think that to <lb/>
            speak the Latin language with elegance, to understand it <lb/>
            readily, and to use its various idioms and phrases correctly, <lb/>
            is for a literary man both useful and interesting; but the <lb/>
            amount of study and practice which it requires is consi­ <lb/>
            derable and should only be undertaken by those who are <lb/>
            younger than myself, and who have more leisure time to <lb/>
            devote to the acquisition of such accomplishments.</p>
          <p>III. In consequence of these considerations, in this my <lb/>
            fifth book of Parallel Lives, which deals with the lives of <lb/>
            Demosthenes and Cicero, I intend to describe their <lb/>
            several characters, and to compare them with one another <lb/>
            by means of their political acts, but I do not mean to <lb/>
            examine minutely into their respective speeches, or to <lb/>
            decide which of the two was the more pleasing or the <lb/>
            more able orator. Were I to attempt such a task, I <lb/>
            should be forgetting Ion's proverb about a "fish out of <lb/>
            water," like the all-accomplished Cæcilius, who has boldly <lb/>
            taken upon himself to write a comparison of Demosthenes <lb/>
            with Cicero. Perhaps, however, we might begin to doubt <lb/>
            the divine origin of the commandment “ know thyself," if <lb/>
            we found men always ready to apply it. Indeed Heaven <lb/>
            appears to have originally intended to form the characters <lb/>
            of Demosthenes and Cicero on the same model, and in some <lb/>
            instances to have implanted in them precisely the same <lb/>
            qualities, such as great personal ambition, love of freedom, <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            and want of courage in the wars, yet to have left much to <lb/>
            chance. I think it would be difficult to find an instance <lb/>
            of any two other orators who both rose from a humble <lb/>
            station to great power and influence, who both opposed <lb/>
            absolute monarchy both lost favourite daughters, were <lb/>
            both exiled and brought back with honour, who both <lb/>
            when flying from their country a second time fell into the <lb/>
            hands of their enemies, and with whose deaths the liberties <lb/>
            of their countrymen were finally extinguished; so that it <lb/>
            is hard to say whether their resemblance is clue more to <lb/>
            nature, which originally moulded their characters alike, or <lb/>
            to fortune, which placed then in exactly similar circum­ <lb/>
            stances. First, then, I will relate the life of the elder of <lb/>
            the two.</p>
          <p>IV. The father of Demosthenes was also named Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, and belonged, according to Theopompus, to the <lb/>
            best class of Athenian citizens. He was commonly called <lb/>
            “ the sword cutler," because he possessed a large work­ <lb/>
            shop and many slaves skilled in cutlery. As for the accusa­ <lb/>
            tion which the orator Æschines brings against his mother, <lb/>
            that she was the daughter of one Gylon, who was banished <lb/>
            for treason, by a foreign woman, we cannot tell whether <lb/>
            it is true or only a calumnious imputation. Demosthenes <lb/>
            was left an orphan at the age of seven years, and was the <lb/>
            heir to considerable property, amounting in all to no less <lb/>
            than fifteen talents. He was scandalously ill-used by his <lb/>
            guardians, who appropriated much of his income, and <lb/>
            neglected the rest so much that he was unable to pay his <lb/>
            teachers. He grew up ignorant of much that a buy of <lb/>
            good birth is expected to learn, partly for this reason, and <lb/>
            partly on account of his weak health, which caused his <lb/>
            mother to keep him away from school. He was a sickly <lb/>
            child, and it is said that the opprobrious nickname of <lb/>
            Batalus was bestowed upon him by his school-fellows <lb/>
            because of his bodily weakness. Batalua, according to <lb/>
            some writers, was an effeminate flute-player, whose habits <lb/>
            were satirized in a comic drama written by Antiphanes. <lb/>
            Others assert that Batalus was a poet who wrote in a <lb/>
            drunken licentious style; and there seems also some <lb/>
            foundation for the belief that this word was used for a <lb/>
            certain part of the human body by the Athenians of <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            that time. The other nickname of Demosthenes, Argas, <lb/>
            either alludes to his savage and harsh temper, for <lb/>
            some poets use the word to mean a snake; or else it refers <lb/>
            to his speeches, as wearying those who heard them; <lb/>
            for Argas was the name of a poet whose verses were bad and <lb/>
            tiresome. And, as Plato says, so much for this.</p>
          <p>V. We are told that he was first led to turn his attention <lb/>
            to oratory by the following incident. When Kallistratus <lb/>
            was going to make a speech in court about the affair of <lb/>
            Oropus * great interest was taken in the trial because of <lb/>
            the ability of the orator, who at that time was at the height <lb/>
            of his reputation, and also because of the important <lb/>
            character of the law suit. Demosthenes, hearing his <lb/>
            teachers and attendants making arrangement to be present <lb/>
            at the trial, persuaded his own servant by great entreaties <lb/>
            to take him to hear the speeches. The man, who was <lb/>
            intimate with the doorkeepers of the court, managed to <lb/>
            obtain a place for Demosthenes, in which the boy could <lb/>
            sit unseen by the public and hear all that was said. Kallis­ <lb/>
            thenes spoke very brilliantly and was much admired. He <lb/>
            excited the envy of Demosthenes by the honours which he <lb/>
            received, as he was escorted home by a long train of friends <lb/>
            who congratulated him upon his success; but the boy was <lb/>
            even more impressed by the power of his eloquence, which <lb/>
            enabled him to deal with everything just as he pleased. <lb/>
            In consequence of this Demosthenes neglected all other <lb/>
            branches of learning, neglected all the sports of childhood, <lb/>
            and laboriously practised and exercised himself in the art <lb/>
            of oratory, meaning some day to become an orator himself. <lb/>
            He studied rhetoric under Isaeus, although Isokrates <lb/>
            was giving lessons at the same time, either, according to <lb/>
            some writers, because, being an orphan, he was unable to <lb/>
            raise the sum of ten minæ which Isokrates demanded as a <lb/>
            fee, or because he thought that the vigorous invective of <lb/>
            Isaeus was more what he required to learn. Hermippus <lb/>
            informs us that he read in some anonymous work that <lb/>
            Demosthenes was a scholar of Plato, and learned much of <lb/>
            the art of speaking from him, while he mentions having <lb/>
            heard from Ktesibius that Demosthenes had been lent the <note type="footnote"> * This was a frontier town, whose possession was disputed by the <lb/>
            Athenians and Bœotians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            works of Isolates and Alkidamas by one Kallias, a Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan, and some others, and that he used to read and <lb/>
            practise himself in them in secret.</p>
          <p>VI. When he came of age he at once brought a <lb/>
            series of actions against his guardians for malversation <lb/>
            of his property, while they resorted to every species <lb/>
            of legal subtlety and chicanery to avoid making restitu­ <lb/>
            tion. By publicly pleading his cause, as Thucydides <lb/>
            says, " he learned his trade by dangers," and succeeded in <lb/>
            recovering some of his paternal estate, though but a <lb/>
            small part of that to which he was entitled. He gained, <lb/>
            however, confidence and practice as a public speaker, and <lb/>
            the fascinating excitement and sense of power which he <lb/>
            experienced in these contests emboldened him to become <lb/>
            a professional orator and to deal with political matters. <lb/>
            We are told that Laomedon of Orchomenus, by the advice of <lb/>
            his physicians, used to run long distances as a remedy for <lb/>
            a disease of the spleen from which he suffered, until he not <lb/>
            only overcame his disorder, but was able to enter for races <lb/>
            at the games, and became one of the best long-distance <lb/>
            runners of his time. Even so Demosthenes, who was forced <lb/>
            by his private misfortunes to make his first appearance as <lb/>
            a speaker, gained such skill and power by his success <lb/>
            in the law-courts that he soon took the lead among the <lb/>
            speakers in the public assembly. Yet when he first <lb/>
            addressed the people he was violently coughed down, inter­ <lb/>
            rupted and ridiculed, because his speech was found dull <lb/>
            and tiresome, being confused in style and strained and arti­ <lb/>
            ficial in argument. It is said that his voice was weak, and <lb/>
            his pronunciation indistinct, and that, as he was frequently <lb/>
            obliged to pause for want of breath, it was difficult <lb/>
            to follow the meaning of his sentences. At last he left <lb/>
            the public assembly and wandered about Peiræus in <lb/>
            despair. Here he was met by an old man named <lb/>
            Eunomus of Thriasia,* who reproved him and told him that <lb/>
            he did himself great wrong, because, having a manner of <lb/>
            speech extremely like that of Perikles, he permitted <lb/>
            himself to be disheartened by failure, and did not face the <lb/>
            clamour of the rabble boldly, and did not train his body to <lb/>
            be strong enough to support the strain of such contests, but <note type="footnote"> * An Athenian of the township of Thriasia, near Eleusis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            allowed himself to fall into a weakly and effeminate <lb/>
            condition.</p>
          <p>VII. After a second failure, as he was going home <lb/>
            overwhelmed with shame hiding his face in his cloak, <lb/>
            Satyrus the actor is. said to have followed him and joined <lb/>
            him. Demosthenes told him with tears in his eves that <lb/>
            although he had taken more pains than any other speaker, <lb/>
            and had devoted all his energes to the study of eloquence, <lb/>
            yet he could not gain the ear of the people, but that <lb/>
            ignorant drunken sailors were listened to when they <lb/>
            mounted the tribune, while he was treated with scorn. <lb/>
            On hearing this Satyrus answered, "Demosthenes, what <lb/>
            you say is very true, but I will soon apply a remedy, if <lb/>
            you will recite to me one of the long speeches from the <lb/>
            plays of Sophokles or Euripides." After Demosthenes had <lb/>
            recited a speech, Satyrus recited the same speech in turn, <lb/>
            and so altered it and gave it so much more grace, <lb/>
            by throwing into it the expression which the verses <lb/>
            required, that it appeared to Demosthenes to be quite <lb/>
            different. Having thus learned how much a speech gains <lb/>
            by a really artistic delivery, Demosthenes perceived that it <lb/>
            was of but little use for him to study the matter of a speech, <lb/>
            unless he also paid attention to the form in which it was <lb/>
            to be presented to his audience. He now built for himself <lb/>
            an underground study, which remained entire down to the <lb/>
            present day, where he daily practised himself in gesture <lb/>
            and declamation, and exercised his voice, and where he <lb/>
            sometimes spent two or three months at a time with <lb/>
            half of his head shaved, so that even if he wished he could <lb/>
            not go out of doors.</p>
          <p>VIII. He took, however, his themes and subjects for <lb/>
            declamation from the various topics of the day, which he <lb/>
            learned from those who came to visit him. As soon as <lb/>
            they left him he used to return to his study, and repeated <lb/>
            aloud in the form of a speech all the news which he had <lb/>
            heard, and made comments upon it. He also used to <lb/>
            work up any conversations which he heard, into sentences <lb/>
            and periods for his orations, and would alter, correct and <lb/>
            paraphrase both his own remarks and those of his <lb/>
            friends. This gave rise to the opinion that he was not <lb/>
            really a man of ability, but that his power and skill as <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            an orator was obtained by laborious study. A great proof <lb/>
            of this was thought to be that Demosthenes seldom spoke <lb/>
            on the spur of the moment, but often when he was present <lb/>
            in the assembly and was called upon by the people to <lb/>
            speak, he would remain silent unless he had prepared <lb/>
            and meditated over his speech. Many of the other orators <lb/>
            ridiculed him for this, and Pytheas in derision said that <lb/>
            his arguments smelt of the lamp. To this Demosthenes <lb/>
            made the bitter retort, " My lamp, Pytheas, sees very <lb/>
            different work from yours." In conversation with others, <lb/>
            however, he did not altogether deny the practice, but <lb/>
            said that although he never spoke without having made <lb/>
            notes, yet that he often spoke without having written <lb/>
            down everything that he was going to say. He used to <lb/>
            say that this careful preparation of his speeches showed <lb/>
            that he was a true lover of the people, and felt a due <lb/>
            reverence for them; while, on the contrary, to speak <lb/>
            without caring how the people take one's words proves a <lb/>
            man to be of an overbearing oligarchioal disposition, who <lb/>
            would use force rather than persuasion. Many writers <lb/>
            allege, as a proof that Demosthenes dared not speak on <lb/>
            the spur of the moment, that when he attacked Demades <lb/>
            he was always immediately answered by him, but that <lb/>
            he never so answered Demades.</p>
          <p>IX. How then, one might ask, was it that Æschines <lb/>
            in his orations speaks of Demosthenes as a man of un­ <lb/>
            bounded impudence ? or how was it that when Python of <lb/>
            Byzantium was pouring forth a flood of invective against <lb/>
            Athens, Demosthenes alone rose and answered him? <lb/>
            Moreover, when Lamachus of Mytilene, who had written <lb/>
            an encomium upon the Kings of Macedon, Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander, which was full of abuse of the Thebans and <lb/>
            Olynthians, read his composition in public at the Olympic <lb/>
            festival, Demosthenes came up to him and in a fine speech <lb/>
            proved from history how great things the Thebans and <lb/>
            inhabitants of Chalkidike had done for Greece, and what <lb/>
            evils had arisen from the baseness of those who flattered <lb/>
            the Macedonians, till the audience were so much wrought <lb/>
            upon by his eloquence that Lamachus was forced to flee <lb/>
            for his life. The answer to this appears to be that <lb/>
            Demosthenes, although he did not copy Perikles in all <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            respects, imitated his reserve and dignity of manner, and <lb/>
            his reluctance to speak upon every trivial occasion; and <lb/>
            that he was not so much attracted by the credit which he <lb/>
            might gain by engaging in these encounters, as he was <lb/>
            unwilling rashly to place his power and reputation at the <lb/>
            mercy of fortune. Indeed, his spoken orations had more <lb/>
            fire and daring than the written ones, if we may trust <lb/>
            Eratosthenes, Demetrius of Phalerum, and the comic <lb/>
            poets. Eratosthenes tells us that in his speeches he used <lb/>
            to rave like a Bacchanal, while Demetrius says that once, <lb/>
            as if inspired, he recited the metrical oath : <lb/>
            " By earth, by fountains, and by waterfloods.' <lb/>
            One of the comic poets also calls him " the random talker," <lb/>
            while another mocks at his fondness for antithesis in <lb/>
            the following verses: <lb/>
            "Ist Citizen. He got it as he got it back. <lb/>
            2nd Citizen. Demosthenes would willingly have spoken words like <lb/>
            theee." <lb/>
            Unless indeed Antiphanes meant by this to allude to the <lb/>
            oration on Halonesus, in which Demosthenes advised <lb/>
            the Athenians not to take that island, but to take it back <lb/>
            from Philip.</p>
          <p>X. Yet all admitted that Demades, by his own natural <lb/>
            wit, without art, was invincible; and that he often, <lb/>
            speaking on the spur of the moment, would demolish the <lb/>
            carefully studied orations of Demosthenes. Ariston of <lb/>
            Chios has preserved the opinion of Theophrastus about <lb/>
            these two orators. Theophrastus, when asked what kind <lb/>
            of orator he thought Demosthenes to be, replied, "an <lb/>
            orator worthy of Athens." When again asked his opinion <lb/>
            of Demades, he replied that he thought him " Too great <lb/>
            for Athens." The same philosopher relates that Poly­ <lb/>
            euktus of Sphettus, one of the chief Athenian statesmen <lb/>
            of the time, used to declare that Demosthenes was the <lb/>
            best orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful <lb/>
            speaker, because his speeches contained the greatest <lb/>
            possible amount of meaning in the fewest words. Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes himself, whenever Phokion rose to answer him, <lb/>
            was wont to whisper to his friends, "Here comes the <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            cleaver of my harangues." It is not clear whether by <lb/>
            this Demosthenes alluded to Phokion's oratorical skill, <lb/>
            or to his blameless life and high reputation, meaning <lb/>
            that the slightest sign given by a man in whom the <lb/>
            people felt such confidence carried more weight than <lb/>
            the longest oration by anyone else.</p>
          <p>XI. Demetrius of Phalerum has recorded the devices <lb/>
            by which Demosthenes overcame his bodily defects, which <lb/>
            he says he heard from Demosthenes's own lips when he <lb/>
            was an old man. He corrected the indistinctness of his <lb/>
            articulation and his tendency to lisp by declaiming long <lb/>
            speeches with pebbles in his mouth, while he strengthened <lb/>
            his voice by running or walking up hill, talking the <lb/>
            while, and repeating orations or verses. He also had a <lb/>
            large mirror in his house, and used to stand before it and <lb/>
            study oratorical gestures. We are told that once a man <lb/>
            called upon him and asked him to act as his counsel in a <lb/>
            lawsuit against a man by whom he had been beaten. <lb/>
            " But," said Demosthenes, " you have not suffered any of <lb/>
            this ill-treatment which you complain of." At this the <lb/>
            man raised his voice and excitedly exclaimed, "Do you <lb/>
            say, Demosthenes, that I have not been ill-treated?" <lb/>
            " Yes," answered he, " now I hear the voice of one who <lb/>
            has really been ill-used." So important did he think the <lb/>
            action and the tone of voice of a speaker to be in carrying <lb/>
            conviction to the minds of his hearers. His manner in <lb/>
            speaking marvellously pleased the common people, though <lb/>
            men of taste, such as Demetrius of Phalerum, thought it <lb/>
            vulgar and affected. Hermippus informs us that Æsion,* <lb/>
            when asked to give his opinion about the orators of former <lb/>
            times and those of his own day, said that the ancient <lb/>
            orators used to address the people in a surprisingly <lb/>
            decorous and dignified manner, but that the speeches of <lb/>
            Demosthenes when read aloud, appeared to him to be <lb/>
            much more carefully constructed and more forcible. It <lb/>
            is indeed unnecessary to say that the written speeches <lb/>
            of Demosthenes are bitter and angry compositions; but <lb/>
            in his impromptu repartees, he often was genuinely witty <lb/>
            and pleasant. As for example, when Demades exclaimed, <lb/>
            "Demosthenes teach me Will a sow teach Athena?" <note type="footnote"> * A fellow-scholar of Demosthenes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            Demosthenes answered, "This Athena was caught in <lb/>
            adultery in Kollytus* the other day." And when the <lb/>
            thief who was surnamed Chalkus, that is, Brazen-face, <lb/>
            attempted to sneer at him for sitting up late at night <lb/>
            writing, Demosthenes answered, " I know that my habit <lb/>
            of burning a lamp at night must disconcert you. But, <lb/>
            men of Athens, need we wonder at the thefts which take <lb/>
            place, when we see that our thieves are brazen, and our <lb/>
            walls are only made of clay." However, although I <lb/>
            could relate several more anecdotes of this kind, I must <lb/>
            now stop, as we ought to discover what remains of the <lb/>
            disposition and character of Demosthenes from a survey <lb/>
            of his political acts.</p>
          <p>XII. He first began to take an active part in public <lb/>
            affairs during the Phokian war, as we learn from his own <lb/>
            words, and as we may also gather from his Philippic ora­ <lb/>
            tions, some of which were pronounced after that war was <lb/>
            ended, while the earlier ones touch on those matters most <lb/>
            nearly connected with it. It is evident that when he <lb/>
            prepared the oration against Meidias he was thirty-two <lb/>
            years of age, and had not as yet acquired any fame or <lb/>
            reputation. This appears to me to be the chief reason <lb/>
            for his having made up his quarrel with Meidias for a <lb/>
            sum of money, for he was far from being a " mild-man­ <lb/>
            nered " man, but keen and savage in avenging the injuries <lb/>
            which he received. It must have been because he saw, <lb/>
            that to ruin a man who was so rich, so able a speaker, and <lb/>
            so well-befriended as Meidias, was too difficult a task for <lb/>
            a man of his political power, and so yielded to the entreaties <lb/>
            of those who begged him to let the action drop; for I do <lb/>
            not believe that the bribe of three thousand drachmae <lb/>
            which he received would by itself have caused Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes to lay aside the rancorous hatred which he bore to <lb/>
            Meidias, if he had entertained any hopes of obtaining a <lb/>
            verdict against him.</p>
          <p>In the defence of the liberties of Greece against the <lb/>
            encroachments of Philip, Demosthenes found a noble theme <lb/>
            for political oratory, which he treated in a manner worthy <lb/>
            of the subject, and soon acquired such renown by his able <lb/>
            and fearless speeches, that he was courted by the king of <note type="footnote"> * A low quarter of Athens. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            Persia himself, and was more talked about in the court <lb/>
            of Philip than any of the other statesmen of the time, <lb/>
            while even his bitterest antagonists admitted that they <lb/>
            had to deal with no mean adversary; for both AEschines <lb/>
            and Hypereides own as much in their invectives against <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>XIII. I cannot, therefore, understand what Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus meant by saying that he was of an inconstant <lb/>
            disposition, and not able to remain long associated with <lb/>
            any party or any line of policy. It appears rather that he <lb/>
            remained throughout the consistent advocate of the same <lb/>
            principles, and a member of the same political party to <lb/>
            which he originally belonged, and that he not only never <lb/>
            changed his politics in his life, but even lost his life <lb/>
            because he would not change them. He was not like <lb/>
            Demades, who to excuse himself for changing sides pleaded <lb/>
            that he had oftentimes gone against his own words, but <lb/>
            never against the interests of the state. Still less can he <lb/>
            be compared with Melanopus, the political opponent of <lb/>
            Kallistratus, who was often bribed by him to allow some <lb/>
            measure to pass, and on these occasions would say to the <lb/>
            people, " The man is my personal enemy, but I postpone <lb/>
            my personal feelings to the good of my country." Niko­ <lb/>
            demus of Messene, who first took up with Kassander, and <lb/>
            afterwards became the advocate of Demetrius, used to <lb/>
            declare that he never was inconsistent, because it was <lb/>
            always best to obey the strongest party. But in the case <lb/>
            of Demosthenes, unlike these men, we can say that he <lb/>
            never deviated either in word or deed from the one direct <lb/>
            line of policy which he unswervingly pursued to the end. <lb/>
            The philosopher Panætius declares that in most of his <lb/>
            orations, as in that about the Crown, that against Aristo­ <lb/>
            krates, that on behalf of the persons exempted from taxa­ <lb/>
            tion (against Leptines), and in the Philippics, we can <lb/>
            trace the principle that honour ought to be pursued for its <lb/>
            own sake; for in all these he urges his countrymen not to <lb/>
            adopt the most pleasant, the most easy, or the most pro­ <lb/>
            fitable line of policy, but often thinks that caution and <lb/>
            even safety should be regarded as of less importance than <lb/>
            honourable conduct; so that if to his noble principles and <lb/>
            high-minded eloquence he had joined warlike courage and <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            clean hands from bribery, he would have been worthy to <lb/>
            rank, not with Mœrokles, Polyeuktus, and Hypereides, <lb/>
            but with Kimon, Thucydides, Perikles, and other great <lb/>
            men of old.</p>
          <p>XIV. Indeed, of his contemporaries, Phokion, although <lb/>
            we cannot approve of the strong Macedonian bias of <lb/>
            his policy, was nowise inferior to Ephialtes, Aristeides, <lb/>
            or Kimon, either in courage or in just dealing; while <lb/>
            Demosthenes, who could not be trusted, as we are told <lb/>
            by Demetrius, to stand his ground in battle, and who <lb/>
            was not altogether proof against the seductions of money <lb/>
            -for though he never would receive a bribe from Philip <lb/>
            or from Macedonia, yet he was overwhelmed by the torrent <lb/>
            of gold which poured from Susa and Ekbatana-was better <lb/>
            able than any one else to praise the great deeds of his <lb/>
            ancestors, but was not equally capable of imitating them. <lb/>
            Yet in spite of these shortcomings, his life was more vir­ <lb/>
            tuous than that of any statesman of his time, with the <lb/>
            exception of Phokion. He used plainer language to the <lb/>
            people than any one else, opposed their wishes, and sharply <lb/>
            reproved them for their mistakes, as we learn from his <lb/>
            orations. Theopompus has recorded that once when the <lb/>
            Athenians called upon him to impeach some person, and <lb/>
            became riotous when he refused, he rose and said, " Men <lb/>
            of Athens, I will always give you my advice, whether you <lb/>
            bid me or not; but I will not accuse men falsely because <lb/>
            you bid me." His mode of dealing with Antiphon also <lb/>
            was by no means like that of a man who courts the favour <lb/>
            of the people, for when the public assembly acquitted <lb/>
            Antiphon, Demosthenes dragged him before the court of <lb/>
            the Areopagus, and in defiance of the expressed opinion <lb/>
            of the people, proved him guilty of having promised Philip <lb/>
            that he would set fire to the dock-yard. The wretched <lb/>
            man was condemned by the court and executed. He also <lb/>
            impeached the priestess Theoris for various evil practices, <lb/>
            and especially for teaching slaves to cheat their masters. <lb/>
            He obtained a verdict against her, and caused her also to <lb/>
            be put to death.</p>
          <p>XV. It is stated that the speech by which Apollodorus <lb/>
            obtained sentence against the general Timotheus, and had <lb/>
            him condemned to pay a large fine, was written for him <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            by Demosthenes : and he also wrote the speeches against <lb/>
            Phormio and Stephanus, which, as may be supposed, <lb/>
            brought great disgrace upon him. For Phormio actually <lb/>
            used a speech written by Demosthenes to combat Apollodo­ <lb/>
            rus, which was just as if out of one armourer's shop he had <lb/>
            sold them each daggers to kill one another with. Of his <lb/>
            public speeches, those against Androtion, Timokrates and <lb/>
            Aristokrates were written for other persons, as he had not <lb/>
            at the time of their composition began to speak in public, <lb/>
            being only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age. <lb/>
            The oration against Aristogeiton, he himself pronounced, <lb/>
            as he did also that against Leptines, out of regard for <lb/>
            Ktesippus the son of Chabrias, according to his own ac­ <lb/>
            count of the matter, though some say that he was paying <lb/>
            his addresses to the young man's mother at the time. He <lb/>
            did not, however, marry her, but married a Samian <lb/>
            woman, as we learn from the treatise of Demetrius of <lb/>
            Magnesia on Synonyms. It is not clear whether the <lb/>
            oration against Æschines for the dishonest embassage was <lb/>
            ever spoken; although we are told by Idomeneus that <lb/>
            AEschines was only acquitted by thirty votes. This, <lb/>
            however, cannot be true, judging from the speeches of <lb/>
            Demothenes and Æschines " on the Crown:" for neither of <lb/>
            them distinctly alludes to that affair as having ever come <lb/>
            into court. This point, therefore, I shall leave for others <lb/>
            to determine.</p>
          <p>XVI. Before the war broke out no one could doubt <lb/>
            which side Demothenes would take, as he never allowed <lb/>
            any act of the King of Macedonia to pass unnoticed, but <lb/>
            seized every opportunity of rousing and exciting his <lb/>
            countrymen to oppose him. In consequence of this his <lb/>
            name became well known at the court of Philip, and <lb/>
            when he was sent with nine others to Macedonia on an <lb/>
            embassy, Philip listened to the speeches of them all, but <lb/>
            replied to his speech with the greatest care. He did not, <lb/>
            however, pay so much attention to Demosthenes in the <lb/>
            entertainment which he provided for the ambassadors, <lb/>
            but took especial pains to win the favour of Æschines and <lb/>
            Philokrates. Hence, when these men praised Philip as <lb/>
            being more eloquent, more handsome, and to crown all, <lb/>
            able to drink more than any one else, Demosthenes sneer­ <note type="footnote"> it 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            ingly replied that the first of these qualities was excellent <lb/>
            in a sophist, the second in a woman, and the third in a <lb/>
            sponge, but that they were none of them such as became <lb/>
            a king.</p>
          <p>XVII. When war finally broke out, as Philip was <lb/>
            unable to remain quiet, while the Athenians were urged <lb/>
            on by Demosthenes, his first measure was to prevail upon <lb/>
            the Athenians to recover Eubcea, which had been handed <lb/>
            over to Philip by its local rulers. In pursuance of a <lb/>
            decree which bore the name of Demosthenes, the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians crossed into the island and drove out the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians. Next, as Philip was besieging Byzantium and <lb/>
            Perinthus, Demosthenes prevailed upon his countrymen <lb/>
            to lay aside their anger and forget the wrongs which they <lb/>
            had received from the people of those cities in the social <lb/>
            war, and to send them a reinforcement by which they <lb/>
            were saved. After this he travelled through Greece, <lb/>
            exciting a spirit of resistance to Philip by his speeches, <lb/>
            until he succeeded in forming nearly all the Greek cities <lb/>
            into a confederacy against Philip, organised an army of <lb/>
            fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, <lb/>
            besides the local forces of each city, and induced them to <lb/>
            subscribe cheerfully for the maintenance of the mercen­ <lb/>
            aries and the expenses of the war. At this time, we are <lb/>
            told by Theophrastus that, when the allies demanded that <lb/>
            their contributions should be limited to some fixed sum, <lb/>
            Krobylus the Athenian orator answered that war feeds <lb/>
            not by a fixed allowance.* Greece was now in a flutter <lb/>
            of expectation, and the people of Eubœa, Achaia, Corinth, <lb/>
            Megara, Leukas and Korkyra were all in arms. Yet the <lb/>
            hardest task of all still remained for Demosthenes to ac­ <lb/>
            complish, namely, to induce the Thebans to join the <lb/>
            alliance, because their territory bordered upon that of <lb/>
            Athens, and their army was very important, for at that <lb/>
            time Thebes was the most warlike state in Greece. It <lb/>
            was no easy matter to win over the Thebans, who had <lb/>
            just received signal assistance from Philip in their war <lb/>
            against the Phokians, and so were inclined to take his side, <lb/>
            besides which, their being such near neighbours to the <lb/>
            Athenians caused perpetual jealousies and quarrels between <note type="footnote"> See Life of Crassus, ch. it </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            the two countries, which were renewed upon the most <lb/>
            trifling occasions.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Yet when Philip, excited by his success at <lb/>
            Amphissa, suddenly marched to Elatea and made himself <lb/>
            master of Phokis, when all the Athenians were panic- <lb/>
            stricken, and no one dared to ascend the bema, or knew <lb/>
            what to say, Demosthenes alone came forward and advised <lb/>
            them to stand by the Thebans; and after having, after <lb/>
            his wont, encouraged and comforted the people, he was <lb/>
            sent with some others as ambassador to Thebes. We <lb/>
            learn from the historian Marsyas that Philip, too, sent the <lb/>
            Macedonians Amyntas and Klearchus, the Thessalian <lb/>
            Daochus, and Thrasydaeus to Thebes to argue on his <lb/>
            behalf. The Thebans on this occasion saw clearly enough <lb/>
            on which side their interests lay, for the sufferings they <lb/>
            had just endured in the Phokian war were still fresh in <lb/>
            their memories; but we read in the history of Theopompus <lb/>
            that the eloquence of Demosthenes so roused and inflamed <lb/>
            their courage that all cold-blooded calculation of the <lb/>
            chances, fear of the enemy, and considerations of expe­ <lb/>
            diency were entirely lost sight of in the honourable <lb/>
            enthusiasm created by his speech. So powerful did his <lb/>
            oratory prove, that Philip at once sent an embassy to ask <lb/>
            for terms of peace, while Greece stood erect and watchful. <lb/>
            Not only the Athenian generals, but even the Boeotarchs <lb/>
            took their orders from Demosthenes, and he was as power­ <lb/>
            ful in the public assembly of the Thebans as in that of <lb/>
            Athens, being beloved by both nations and possessed of a <lb/>
            power which was not beyond his deserts, as Theopompus <lb/>
            says, but which he well deserved.</p>
          <p>XIX. But some fatal destiny seemed now to have <lb/>
            brought round the hour for the extinction of the liberties <lb/>
            of Greece, and both counteracted his efforts, and also gave <lb/>
            many ominous indications of what was to come. The <lb/>
            Pythia at Delphi uttered terrible predictions, and an old <lb/>
            oracle of the Sibyls was in every one's mouth, which ran <lb/>
            as follows :- <lb/>
            Far from the battle, on that fatal day <lb/>
            Beside Thermodon may I flee away, <lb/>
            Or view it as an eagle from the sky; <lb/>
            There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die." <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            It is said that the Thermodon in a little rivulet near my <lb/>
            own town of Chæronea which runs into the Kephisus. <lb/>
            We Chæroneans nowadays do not know of any rivulet <lb/>
            which is so called, but we suppose that the stream which <lb/>
            we call Hæmon was at that period called the Thermodon; <lb/>
            for it runs past the temple of Herakles, where the Greek <lb/>
            army encamped: and we imagine that when the battle <lb/>
            took place this stream was filled with blood and corpses, <lb/>
            and became known by its present name. Yet the historian <lb/>
            Douris writes that the Thermodon was not a river at all, <lb/>
            but that some men while digging a trench round their <lb/>
            tent found a small stone image, with an inscription saying <lb/>
            that it represented a man named Thermodon carrying a <lb/>
            wounded Amazon in his arms. Concerning this there was <lb/>
            another oracle current, as follows -.­ <lb/>
            " Watch for Thermodon's field, thou sable crow, <lb/>
            There shalt thou feed on human flesh enow."</p>
          <p>XX. It is hard in these matters to determine the exact <lb/>
            truth: but, be this as it may, Demosthenes was greatly <lb/>
            encouraged to see such a force of armed Greeks at his <lb/>
            disposal, and, elated by their confidence and eagerness for <lb/>
            battle would not allow them to pay any attention to <lb/>
            oracles and predictions, but hinted that the Pythia was in <lb/>
            Philip's pay, and reminded the Thebans of Epameinondas, <lb/>
            and the Athenians of Perikles, both of whom regarded <lb/>
            such considerations as mere pretexts for cowardice. Up to <lb/>
            this point he behaved as a brave man should ; but in <lb/>
            the battle - itself he performed no honourable exploit <lb/>
            worthy of his speeches, but left his place in the ranks <lb/>
            and ran away in a most shameful manner, throwing away <lb/>
            his arms that he might run faster, and not hesitating to <lb/>
            disgrace the motto of " Good Luok," which Pytheas <lb/>
            tells us was written in golden letters upon his shield. <lb/>
            Immediately after the victory Philip, in insolent delight <lb/>
            at his success, danced in a drunken revel among the corpses <lb/>
            and sang the opening words of a decree of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            which happened to form an iambio verse, as follows:­ <lb/>
            " Demosthenes Pæanian, son of Demosthenes," &amp;c. <note type="footnote"> * The battle of Chæronea, B.O. 338, in which Philip defeated the <lb/>
            Athenians and Bosotians, and crushed the liberties of Greece </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            When, however, he came to himself, and comprehended how <lb/>
            great his danger had been, he trembled at the ability and <lb/>
            power of an orator who had been able to force him in a <lb/>
            few hours of one day to risk both his empire and his life. <lb/>
            The fame of Demosthenes reached even to the King of <lb/>
            Persia, and he sent letters to the Satraps who governed <lb/>
            the provinces near the sea, bidding them offer money to <lb/>
            Demosthenes, and pay him more attention than any other <lb/>
            Greek, because he was able to effect a diversion in favour <lb/>
            of Persia by keeping the King of Macedonia's hands full. <lb/>
            This was afterwards discovered by Alexander, who found <lb/>
            at Sardis letters from Demosthenes and papers belonging <lb/>
            to the King's lieutenant, containing an account of the <lb/>
            various sums of money which they had transmitted to him.</p>
          <p>XXI. When this great misfortune befel Greece, the <lb/>
            political opponents of Demosthenes at once impeached <lb/>
            him for his conduct; but the people not only acquitted <lb/>
            him of the charges which they brought against him, but <lb/>
            continued to treat him with great honour, and to ask for <lb/>
            his advice. When the remains of those who had fallen at <lb/>
            Cheeronea were brought home and buried, they chose him <lb/>
            to make the funeral oration over them, and generally they <lb/>
            bore their misfortunes with a noble spirit, not being <lb/>
            excessively humbled and cast down, as Theopompus relates <lb/>
            in his history, with a view to dramatic effect, but by <lb/>
            showing especial honour and esteem for their principal <lb/>
            adviser they proved that they did not repent of the policy <lb/>
            which they had followed. Demosthenes pronounced the <lb/>
            funeral oration over the fallen, but he never again pro­ <lb/>
            posed a decree in the popular assembly in his own name, <lb/>
            but always in that of some one of his friends, in order to <lb/>
            avoid the evil omen of his own unlucky name, until he <lb/>
            again took courage at the death of Philip, which took <lb/>
            place shortly after his victory at Chæronea. This, it <lb/>
            seems, was the meaning of the last verse of the oracle, <lb/>
            " There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die."</p>
          <p>XXII. Demosthenes had secret intelligence of Philip's <lb/>
            death, before it was publicly known. In order to inspirit <lb/>
            the Athenians, he went with a cheerful countenance into <lb/>
            the senate, and declared that he had dreamed that some <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            great good fortune was in store for them. Not long after­ <lb/>
            wards messengers arrived with the news of Philip's death. <lb/>
            Upon this the Athenians made sacrifices of thanksgiving <lb/>
            to the gods, and decreed a crown to Pausanias who slew <lb/>
            Philip. Demosthenes also came abroad in a gay dress, <lb/>
            and wearing a garland of flowers on his head, although <lb/>
            his daughter had only been dead seven days. This cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance is reported by iEschines, who reviles him for <lb/>
            his conduct, and calls him an unnatural father, though he <lb/>
            only proves the weakness and vulgarity of his own nature <lb/>
            by supposing that noisy demonstrations of grief show ten­ <lb/>
            derness of heart, and blaming those who bear their sorrows <lb/>
            with dignity and composure. Yet I will not say that the <lb/>
            Athenians did right to wear garlands and make merry at <lb/>
            the death of a king who, after his victory, had dealt so <lb/>
            gently with them when they were at his mercy; for it <lb/>
            deserved the anger of the gods, and was a thoroughly low­ <lb/>
            minded act to honour a man while he lived and elect him <lb/>
            a citizen of Athens, and then when he fell by the hand of <lb/>
            a stranger not to be able to contain themselves for joy, <lb/>
            but to dance over his corpse and to sing paeans of victory, <lb/>
            as if they themselves had done some great feat of arms. <lb/>
            On the other hand, I praise Demosthenes for leaving his <lb/>
            own home troubles to be wept for by the women of his <lb/>
            household, and himself coming forward and doing what <lb/>
            he imagined was best for his country. This shows a manly <lb/>
            and patriotic spirit, which ever looks to the good of the <lb/>
            community at large; and I think that in forcing his pri­ <lb/>
            vate grief to give way to the public joy he acted well, <lb/>
            and even outdid those actors who represent kings and <lb/>
            autocrats on the stage, and who laugh or wail not as their <lb/>
            own feelings bid them, but as the argument of the play <lb/>
            requires. Apart from these considerations, it is our duty <lb/>
            not to forsake a man when he is in sorrow, but to admi­ <lb/>
            nister consolation to him and to turn his thoughts tc <lb/>
            pleasanter subjects, as physicians bid weak-eyed patients <lb/>
            turn their eyes away from a distressing glare of light and <lb/>
            direct them to green and soothing colours; and what <lb/>
            better means of consolation could one possibly find when <lb/>
            one's country is fortunate, than to bid one's friend <lb/>
            merge his private grief in the public joy ? I have been <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            led to make these reflections by observing that this <lb/>
            speech of Æschines has had undue influence with many <lb/>
            persons, because it makes a mistaken appeal to their <lb/>
            tenderer feelings.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now Demosthenes a second time began to rouse <lb/>
            the states of Greece and reorganise the confederacy. The <lb/>
            Thebans attacked their Macedonian garrison, and killed <lb/>
            many of them, with arms furnished by Demosthenes, and <lb/>
            the Athenians began to prepare to fight as their allies. <lb/>
            Demosthenes reigned supreme in the popular assembly, <lb/>
            and wrote to the Persian generals in Asia endeavouring to <lb/>
            induce them to attack Alexander, whom he scoffed at as <lb/>
            a child, and nicknamed Margites.* But when Alexander, <lb/>
            after settling the affairs of his kingdom, marched with his <lb/>
            army into Bœotia, the courage of the Athenians deserted <lb/>
            them. Demosthenes himself quailed in terror, and the <lb/>
            Thebans, forsaken by their allies, fought against Alex­ <lb/>
            ander alone, and were utterly ruined. Upon this the <lb/>
            Athenians, in an agony of terror, sent Demosthenes and <lb/>
            several other orators on an embassy to Alexander; but he, <lb/>
            fearing Alexander's fury, went no further than Mount <lb/>
            Kithæron, and then returned home. Alexander now at <lb/>
            once sent to Athens to demand that ten of her chief orators <lb/>
            should be given up to him, according to the historians <lb/>
            Idomeneus and Douris, though most of the more trust­ <lb/>
            worthy writers say that he only asked for the eight fol­ <lb/>
            lowing :—Demosthenes, Polyeuktus, Ephialtes, Lykurgus, <lb/>
            Mœrokles, Demon, Kallisthenes and Charidemus. On this <lb/>
            occasion Demosthenes told the people the fable of the sheep <lb/>
            who gave up their watch-dogs to the wolves, explaining <lb/>
            that he and the other orators were the watch-dogs who <lb/>
            guarded the people, and calling Alexander the great <lb/>
            wolf of Macedon." "Moreover," said he, "by delivering <lb/>
            us up you really deliver up yourselves also, just as you see <lb/>
            merchants selling whole cargoes of corn by small samples <lb/>
            of a few grains which they carry about in a cup." This <lb/>
            we learn from Aristobulus of Kassandrea.† As the Athe­ <note type="footnote"> * The hero of a mock-heroic poem supposed to have been written by <lb/>
            Homer. </note><note type="footnote"> T Kassander built a new city on the site of Potidæa, on the <lb/>
            narrow isthmus of the promontory of Pallene. Potidæa had been </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            nians were quite at their wit's end, and knew not what to <lb/>
            do, Demades at last agreed with the orators whose extra­ <lb/>
            dition was demanded, that in consideration of a sum of <lb/>
            five talents he would himself go to the king of Macedonia <lb/>
            and intercede for them, either because he trusted in the <lb/>
            friendship which existed between him and Alexander, or <lb/>
            because he thought that he should find him like a lion <lb/>
            that has been satiated with slaughter. Demades succeeded <lb/>
            in saving their lives, and arranged terms of peace between <lb/>
            the Athenians and Alexander.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After Alexander's departure Demades and his <lb/>
            party were all powerful at Athens, and Demosthenes was <lb/>
            completely humbled. He made an effort to assist the <lb/>
            abortive attempts of Agis * King of Sparta, but as the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians would not take part in the proposed rising, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were crushed, he again retired into ob­ <lb/>
            scurity. At this time also the action bought by Æschines <lb/>
            against Ktesiphon about the Crown came on for trial. <lb/>
            This action had been formally begun during the archon­ <lb/>
            ship of Chærondas, a short time before the battle of <lb/>
            Chaeronea, but it was not decided until ten years later, <lb/>
            in the archonship of Aristophon. This, although a private <lb/>
            action, attracted greater interest than any public one, both <lb/>
            on account of the eloquence of the speakers on both sides <lb/>
            and the spirited behaviour of the judges, who refused to <lb/>
            truckle to the party in power, which had banished <lb/>
            Demosthenes and which was slavishly subservient to <lb/>
            Macedonia, but acquitted Demosthenes by such a splendid <lb/>
            majority that Æschines did not obtain the fifth part of the <lb/>
            votes. He in consequence at once left the city, and <lb/>
            spent the remainder of his life at Rhodes and the other <lb/>
            cities of the Ionian coast as a sophist and teacher of <lb/>
            rhetoric.</p>
          <p>XXV. Shortly after this, Harpalus arrived in Athens <lb/>
            from Asia, fleeing from Alexander, whom he feared to <lb/>
            meet, both because he had grossly misconducted himself <note type="footnote"> destroyed by Philip, B.C. 356. The new city of Kassandrea soon <lb/>
            became the most flourishing city in Macedonia. </note><note type="footnote"> * This was Agis III. who at the time of the battle of Issus, BC. 333, <lb/>
            was communicating with the Persian naval commanders in the Ægean, <lb/>
            to obtain supplies for the war against the Macedonians. He was <lb/>
            killed in action about the time of the battle of Arbela, B.C. 331. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            while in command of a province, and because Alexander <lb/>
            had now become a capricious tyrant, terrible even to his <lb/>
            friends. When he sought refuge with the Athenians, <lb/>
            and placed himself, his ships, and his treasure in their <lb/>
            hands, the other orators, casting longing glances at his <lb/>
            wealth, at once pleaded for him, and advised the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to receive and protect the suppliant. Demosthenes <lb/>
            at first advised them to send Harpalus away, and take care <lb/>
            not to involve the city in war by such unjust and uncalled­ <lb/>
            for proceedings: but a few days afterwards when an <lb/>
            inventory was being taken of Harpalus's property, he, <lb/>
            seeing that Demosthenes was admiring a golden Persian <lb/>
            drinking cup and examining the sculptures with which <lb/>
            it was enriched, bade him take it in his hands and observe <lb/>
            the weight of the gold. Demosthenes was surprised at <lb/>
            the weight, and asked how much it would fetch. Harpalus <lb/>
            answered with a smile, " It will fetch you twenty talents : " <lb/>
            and as soon as it was dark he sent the cup and the twenty <lb/>
            talents to the house of Demosthenes. Harpalus had very <lb/>
            cleverly fathomed the character of Demosthenes by <lb/>
            observing the loving and eager glances with which he <lb/>
            eyed this cup; for he received the bribe and went over to <lb/>
            the side of Harpalus, just as if he were a city which <lb/>
            had received a foreign garrison. Next morning he <lb/>
            carefully bandaged his throat with woollen wrappers, and <lb/>
            proceeded to the assembly, where, when called upon to rise <lb/>
            and speak, he made signs that he had lost his voice. Witty <lb/>
            men said that the orator had not caught a sore throat, but <lb/>
            a silver quinsy during the night. Soon the whole people <lb/>
            learned that he had been bribed, and as they would not <lb/>
            listen to him when he rose to explain his conduct, but <lb/>
            hooted and groaned, some one rose and said, " Men of <lb/>
            Athens, will you not listen to a man who has such a golden <lb/>
            tongue?" The people thereupon sent Harpalus away, <lb/>
            and fearing that inquiry might be made after the treasure <lb/>
            which the orators had received, they instituted a vigorous <lb/>
            search through every man's house, except that of Kallikles <lb/>
            the son of Arrhenides, which they would not allow to <lb/>
            be searched because his newly-married wife was there. <lb/>
            These particulars we learn from the history of Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus. <pb n="140"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXVI. Demosthenes, wishing to put a good face on the <lb/>
            matter, passed a decree in the assembly, that the senate of <lb/>
            the Areopagus should enquire into the matter, and punish <lb/>
            those who were found guilty. However he was one of the <lb/>
            first whom the senate found guilty: and, although he <lb/>
            came into court and pleaded his cause, he was condemned <lb/>
            to pay a fine of fifty talents, and was imprisoned in <lb/>
            default. Overwhelmed with shame at this disgrace, and <lb/>
            being also in weak health, he could not bear to remain in <lb/>
            prison, and made his escape with the secret assistance of his <lb/>
            keepers. We read that after he had got a short distance <lb/>
            from Athens he saw that he was being pursued by several of <lb/>
            his political opponents, and tried to hide from them. When, <lb/>
            however, they came up to him, addressed him by his name, <lb/>
            and begged him to receive money for his journey from <lb/>
            them, assuring him that they had brought it to give to <lb/>
            him and had pursued him for no other reason, Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes burst into tears and exclaimed: " I may well be <lb/>
            sorry to leave a home where my very enemies treat me <lb/>
            with more kindness than any friends I am likely to find <lb/>
            abroad will do." Demosthenes was much depressed by <lb/>
            his banishment, and spent most of his time in Trœzene or <lb/>
            Ægina, looking towards Attica with tears in his eyes. <lb/>
            He is said during his exile to have uttered many unmanly <lb/>
            sentiments, very unworthy of his bold speeches when in <lb/>
            power. On leaving the city he stretched out his hands <lb/>
            towards the Acropolis and exclaimed : " Athena, patroness <lb/>
            of Athens, why dost thou delight in those three savage <lb/>
            creatures, the owl, the snake, and the people ? " He used <lb/>
            to dissuade the young men whom he met and conversed <lb/>
            with during his travels from taking part in political life, <lb/>
            and would say that such were the miseries, the fears, the <lb/>
            jealousies, backbitings, and ceaseless struggles by which <lb/>
            a public man is beset, that if at the outset of his life he <lb/>
            had known them, and had been offered his choice between <lb/>
            two courses, one leading to the bema and the public <lb/>
            assembly, and the other to utter annihilation, he would <lb/>
            unhesitatingly have chosen the latter.</p>
          <p>XXVII. While he was in exile Alexander died, and the <lb/>
            Hellenic confederacy was again revived under Leosthenes, <lb/>
            a brave general, who shut up Antipater in Lauria and <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            besieged him there. Now, Pytheas the orator and Kalli. <lb/>
            medon, surnamed the " crab," who were exiled from <lb/>
            Athens, joined Antipater, and travelled about Greece in <lb/>
            company with his friends and ambassadors, urging the <lb/>
            cities not to join the Athenians and revolt from Mace­ <lb/>
            donia. Demosthenes, on the other hand, joined the <lb/>
            embassy sent out by Athens and co-operated with them, <lb/>
            striving to induce the Greeks to rise against the Mace­ <lb/>
            donianis and drive them out of Greece. In Arcadia, <lb/>
            Phylarchus tells us that a wordy battle took place <lb/>
            between Pytheas and Demosthenes at a public meeting <lb/>
            in which Pytheas was advocating the cause of Macedonia, <lb/>
            and Demosthenes that of Greece. Pytheas said that we <lb/>
            may always know that there is sickness in a house if we <lb/>
            see asses' milk carried into it, and that a city must be <lb/>
            in a bad way if it received an embassy from Athens <lb/>
            To this Demosthenes answered by turning his own illus­ <lb/>
            tration against him, for, he said, asses' milk is brought <lb/>
            into houses to cure the sick, and Athenians come into <lb/>
            other cities to save them from ruin. The people of Athens <lb/>
            were so delighted with the conduct of Demosthenes in this <lb/>
            matter that they decreed his restoration. The decree <lb/>
            was proposed by Demon, one of the township of Pæania, <lb/>
            and a cousin of Demosthenes; and a trireme was sent <lb/>
            to Ægina to fetch him home. When he landed at Peiraeus <lb/>
            he was met by the whole people, and by all the priests <lb/>
            and archons, all of whom greeted him warmly. On this <lb/>
            occasion, Demetrius of Magnesia relates that he raised his <lb/>
            hands to heaven and congratulated himself on having <lb/>
            returned home more gloriously than Alkibiades, because <lb/>
            he had persuaded, not forced, his countrymen to receive <lb/>
            him back. As the fine imposed upon him still remained <lb/>
            in force, for the people could not alter a verdict at their <lb/>
            pleasure, they made use of a legal fiction. It was the <lb/>
            custom at the festival of Zeus the Preserver to pay a sum <lb/>
            of money to those who ornamented the altar for the <lb/>
            sacrifice: they charged Demosthenes with this office, and <lb/>
            ordered him to execute it for the sum of fifty talents, <lb/>
            which was the amount of his fine.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. He did not, however, long enjoy his restora­ <lb/>
            tion, for the Greeks were soon utterly ruined. In the <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            month of Metageitnion * the battle of Krannon took place, <lb/>
            in Bœdromion a Macedonian garrison entered Munychia, <lb/>
            and in Pyanepsion Demosthenes was put to death in the <lb/>
            following manner :-As soon as it became known that <lb/>
            Antipater and Kraterus were marching upon Athens, <lb/>
            Demosthenes and his party escaped out of the city, and <lb/>
            the people, at the instance of Demades, condemned them <lb/>
            to death. As they had dispersed to all quarters of Greece, <lb/>
            Antipater sent men in pursuit of them, the chief of whom <lb/>
            was Archias, who was surnamed the Exile-hunter. This <lb/>
            man, who was a citizen of Thurii, is said once to have <lb/>
            been a tragic actor, and to have studied his art under <lb/>
            the celebrated Polus of Ægina. Hermippus reckons Archias <lb/>
            among the pupils of the orator Lakritus, while Demetrius <lb/>
            tells us that he was a student of philosophy of the school <lb/>
            of Anaximenes. This Archias tore away from the shrine <lb/>
            of Æakus at Ægina the orator Hypereides, Aristonikus <lb/>
            of Marathon, and Himeræus, the brother of Demetrius of <lb/>
            Phalerum, who had taken sanctuary there, and sent them <lb/>
            to Antipater at Kleonæ, where they were put to death. <lb/>
            It is even said that Hypereides had his tongue cut out.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Hearing that Demosthenes was sitting as a <lb/>
            suppliant in the temple of Poseidon at Kalauria,† Archias <lb/>
            crossed over thither in some small boats with a guard of <lb/>
            Thracian mercenaries, and tried to persuade Demosthenes <lb/>
            to leave the temple and accompany him to Antipater, <lb/>
            promising that he should not be ill-treated. Demosthenes <lb/>
            had a strange dream the night before that he was con­ <lb/>
            tending with Archias in acting a play, and that although <lb/>
            he acted well and delighted his audience, yet he was <lb/>
            beaten by Archias, who was better furnished with stage <lb/>
            properties and appliances. Wherefore, when Archias tried <lb/>
            to cajole him, Demosthenes looked him full in the face, <lb/>
            and, without rising, said, "Archias, your acting never <note type="footnote"> * The second month of the Attic year, the latter half of August and <lb/>
            first of September. The two next months mentioned in the text <lb/>
            correspond to the latter half of September and the first of October and <lb/>
            the latter half of October and first of November respectively. </note><note type="footnote"> t A small island in the Saronic Gulf off the coast of Argolis and <lb/>
            opposite Troezen, where was a celebrated temple of Poseidon which <lb/>
            was regarded as an inviolable asylum. Hither Demosthenes fled to <lb/>
            avoid Antipater, and here he took poison, B.C. 322, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            affected me on the stage, nor will your promises now." <lb/>
            Upon this Archias became angry, and savagely threatened <lb/>
            him. "Now," said Demosthenes, "you speak like the <lb/>
            true Macedonian that you are; but just now you were <lb/>
            acting a part. So now wait for a little while until I have <lb/>
            sent a letter home." Saying this, he retired into the <lb/>
            inner part of the temple, took his tablets as though about <lb/>
            to write, placed his pen in his mouth and bit it, as he <lb/>
            was wont to do when meditating what he should write, <lb/>
            and after remaining so for some time, covered his head <lb/>
            with his robe and leaned it on his arms. The soldiers <lb/>
            standing at the door of the temple jeered at him for a <lb/>
            coward, and Archias walked up to him and bade him rise, <lb/>
            repeating his assurance that he would make Antipater <lb/>
            his friend. Demosthenes, as soon as he perceived that the <lb/>
            poison was beginning to work upon him, uncovered his <lb/>
            head, and, looking steadfastly at Archias, said, " Now, as <lb/>
            soon as you please, you may play the part of Kreon in <lb/>
            the play, and throw my body to the dogs without burial. <lb/>
            But I, good Poseidon, leave thy temple while I am yet <lb/>
            alive, and will not profane the sanctuary by my death <lb/>
            there, though Antipater and his Macedonians have not <lb/>
            feared to pollute it with murder." Having spoken these <lb/>
            words, he asked them to support him by the arms, as his <lb/>
            strength was fast failing him, and as they were assisting <lb/>
            him to walk past the altar be fell with a groan and died <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>XXX. As for the poison, Ariston says that it was <lb/>
            contained in his pen,* as has been related. But one <lb/>
            Pappas, from whom Hermippus has borrowed his account <lb/>
            of the scene, says that when Demosthenes fell before the <lb/>
            altar, in his tablets were found written the opening words <lb/>
            of a letter, "Demosthenes to Antipater," and nothing <lb/>
            more. All were surprised at the suddenness of his death, <lb/>
            but the Thracian mercenaries at the door declared that they <lb/>
            saw him take the poison out of a little cloth and put it <lb/>
            into his mouth. They imagined that what he swallowed <lb/>
            was gold but a maidservant that waited on him told <lb/>
            Archias, in answer to his inquiries, that Demosthenes <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word signifies a reed, in the upper part of which poison <lb/>
            might easily be placed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            had for a long time carried about a packet containing <lb/>
            poison, to be used in case of need. Eratosthenes himself <lb/>
            writes that Demosthenes carried the poison in a hollow <lb/>
            bracelet which he wore on his arm. It would be tedious <lb/>
            to notice all the discrepancies to be found in the nume­ <lb/>
            rous accounts which have been written of the death of <lb/>
            Demosthenes; but I will mention that Demochares, a <lb/>
            relative of Demosthenes, states his belief that he did <lb/>
            not die by poison, but by the provident care of the gods, <lb/>
            who rescued him from the cruelty of the Macedonians by <lb/>
            a swift and painless death. He perished on the sixteenth <lb/>
            day of the month Pyanepsion, which is observed as a day <lb/>
            of the strictest fasting and humiliation by the women <lb/>
            who celebrate the festival of the Thesmophoria.* The <lb/>
            people of Athens soon afterwards bestowed on Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes the honours which he deserved, by erecting a <lb/>
            brazen statue in memory of him, and decreeing that the <lb/>
            eldest of his family should be maintained in the Prytaneum <lb/>
            for ever. On the base of the statue was inscribed the <lb/>
            celebrated couplet: <lb/>
            "Could'st thou have fought as well as thou could'at speak. <lb/>
            The Macedonian neler had ruled the Greek." <lb/>
            It is a complete mistake to suppose, as some writers do, <lb/>
            that Demosthenes himself composed this couplet in <lb/>
            Kalauria just before he took the poison.</p>
          <p>XXXI. A short time before my own first visit to <lb/>
            Athens, the following incident is said to have taken <lb/>
            place. A soldier, being summoned by his commanding <lb/>
            officer to be tried for some offence, placed all his money <lb/>
            in the hands of the statue of Demosthenes, which are <lb/>
            represented as clasped together. Beside the statue grew <lb/>
            a small plane-tree, and several leaves of this tree, either <lb/>
            blown there by chance, or placed there on purpose by the <lb/>
            soldier, concealed and covered up the money, so that it <lb/>
            remained there a long while. At last the soldier returned <lb/>
            and found it, and as the circumstance became widely <lb/>
            known, many literary men seized the opportunity of <note type="footnote">* A festival in honour of Demeter. For details see Smith Dict. <lb/>
            of Antiq.' </note> <lb/>

            first of the family who got the cognomen of Cicero * must <lb/>
            have been a man of note, and this was the reason why <lb/>
            his descendants did not reject the name, but were well <lb/>
            pleased with it, though it was a matter of jeering to <lb/>
            many : for the Latins call a vetch Cicer, and the first <lb/>
            Cicero had at the end of his nose a cleft or split, slightly <lb/>
            marked as we may suppose, like the cleft in a vetch, <lb/>
            whence he got the cognomen. Indeed Cicero himself, <lb/>
            the subject of this Life, on his friends advising him <lb/>
            when he was first a candidate for office and began to <lb/>
            engage in public life, to get rid of the name and take <lb/>
            another, is reported to have boldly replied that he would <lb/>
            strive to make the name of Cicero more glorious than <lb/>
            that of Scaurus and Catulus. While he was quæstor in <lb/>
            Sicily, and causing a silver offering to the gods to be made, <lb/>
            he had inscribed on it his first two names, Marcus and <lb/>
            Tullius, but in place of the third he jocosely ordered the <lb/>
            artist to cut the figure of a vetch by the side of the <lb/>
            characters. This then is what is recorded about the <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>II. They say that Cicero's mother gave birth t to him, <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">death, but the true reading is undoubtedly " pater a nobis discessit; " <lb/>
            and it is plain that Cicero is simply speaking of his father leaving <lb/>
            Homo for a time (Drumann, Tullii, p. 213). </note><note type="footnote"> * The cognomen Cicero, as already observed, occurs early in Roman <lb/>
            history. Many of the Roman cognomina were derived from some <lb/>
            particular plant which a m an cultivated, or from some personal pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity, or from some other accidental circumstance. The mark on the <lb/>
            nose is just as likely to be the origin of the name as the cultivation of <lb/>
            the cicer; for if the name Fabius comes from faba, "a bean," and <lb/>
            Lentulus, from lens, "pulse;" yet Catulus means "a whelp," and <lb/>
            Scaurus means " knock-knee'd," or something of the kind. </note><note type="footnote"> The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαϭτόλη, διαφύη</foreign> mean what I have translated them. <lb/>
            Kaltwasser has translated the passage thus, according to Reiske's <lb/>
            explanation:-" Jener batte an der spitze der nase tinen kleinen <lb/>
            anwuchs oder warze in form eiDer solelien erbse, woven er den bei­ <lb/>
            namen erhielt." But this is not a translation. Plutarch does not say <lb/>
            that he had a wait at the end of his nose, but that the end of his <lb/>
            nose was like a vetch, because there was a kind of split or cleft in it. <lb/>
            There is no reason for misrepresenting even a man's nose. </note><note type="footnote"> † The third day of the new calends" is the third of January of <lb/>
            the unreformed Roman calendar. Pompeius Magnus was born in the <lb/>
            same year, B.C. 106. Cicero himself mentions his birth-day (Ad Attic. <lb/>
            vii. 5; xiii. 42). Plutarch's stories of his aptitude for learning might <lb/>
            be collected from the mass of anecdotes that existed in his time about </note><note type="footnote"> L 2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            after a painless and easy labour, on the third day of the <lb/>
            new calends, on which the magistrates now offer up <lb/>
            prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the Emperor. It is <lb/>
            said that a vision appeared to his nurse and foretold her <lb/>
            that she was nurturing a great blessing for all Romans. <lb/>
            Such things as these are generally considered to be mere <lb/>
            dreams and idle talk, but in his case Cicero soon showed <lb/>
            that it was a real prophecy when he was of age to be <lb/>
            taught, for he was conspicuous for his natural talent and <lb/>
            got a name and reputation among the boys, so that their <lb/>
            fathers used to visit the schools out of desire to see <lb/>
            Cicero, and to inquire of his famed quickness and capacity <lb/>
            for learning; but the ill-educated part were angry with <lb/>
            their sons when they saw them giving Cicero a place in <lb/>
            the midst of them in the public roads by way of honour. <lb/>
            Cicero, who had a talent, such as Plato* requires in a <lb/>
            nature that loves learning and loves wisdom, for embrac­ <lb/>
            ing all knowledge and undervaluing no kind of learning <lb/>
            and discipline, happened to show a strong inclination to <lb/>
            poetry: and indeed a small poem of his is still preserved, <lb/>
            which was written when he was a boy: it is entitled <lb/>
            Pontius Glaucus,t and is in tetrameter verse. In the <lb/>
            course of time he applied himself to the Muse of such <lb/>
            arts with still more versatility, and got the reputation of <lb/>
            being not only the first orator, but also the best poet ‡ <lb/>
            among the Romans. Now his oratorical reputation con­ <note type="footnote"> all the great Romans of Cicero's period. The story shows at least <lb/>
            what were the traditional stories about Cicero's youth. </note><note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser refers to the passage in Plato's Republic, book v. p. 56, <lb/>

            more appropriate to his new element, though perhaps not to his new <lb/>

            man's property as being one of those who were put to <lb/>

            Antiochus of Askalon, being pleased with the easy flow <lb/>
            of his speech and his graceful manner, but he did not <lb/>
            like his doctrinal innovations. For Antiochus was now <lb/>
            seceding from what is called the New Academy, and <lb/>
            deserting the sect of Karneades; whether it was that he <lb/>
            was influenced by the evidence and by the senses, or as <lb/>
            some say, through rivalry and differences with the <lb/>
            followers of Kleitomachus and the partisans of Philo, he <lb/>
            was changing to be a cultivator of the Stoic principle in <lb/>
            most things. But Cicero liked the other doctrines better, <note type="footnote">* Cicero went to Greece B.O. 79. The reasons for his journey are <lb/>
            stated by himself in his Brutus (c. 91). He speaks of his leanness and <lb/>
            weakness, and of the length and slenderness of his neck. His <lb/>
            physicians recommended him to give up speaking for a time. When <lb/>
            he left Rome he had been engaged for two years in pleading causes. </note><note type="footnote">t Cicero stayed six months at Athens. The New Academy was <lb/>
            founded by Arketilaus. The school taught that certainty was not <lb/>

            and attached himself to them in preference, intending, if <lb/>
            he should altogether be excluded from public affairs, to <lb/>
            remove himself to Athens from the Forum and public <lb/>
            life and live there in tranquillity with philosophy. But <lb/>
            when news came that Sulla was dead and his body <lb/>
            being strengthened by discipline was attaining a vigorous <lb/>
            habit, and his voice being now brought under manage­ <lb/>
            ment had become pleasant to the ear and powerful, and <lb/>
            was suitably adapted to his habit of body, and his <lb/>
            friends from Rome were sending him many letters and <lb/>
            exhortations, and Antiochus strongly urged him to engage <lb/>
            in public affairs, he began anew to fashion his oratorical <lb/>
            power, as If it were an instrument, and to, rouse afresh <lb/>
            his political capacity, by exercising himself in the proper <lb/>
            discipline and attending the rhetoricians of repute. <lb/>
            Accordingly he sailed to Asia and Rhodes; * and among <lb/>
            the Asiatic orators he attended the instruction of Xenokles <lb/>
            of Adramyttium, and Dionysius of Magnesia, and Menip­ <lb/>
            pus of Caria ; and in Rhodes, the rhetorician Apollonius, <lb/>
            the son of Molo, and the philosopher Poseidonius. It is <lb/>
            said that Apollonius, who did not understand the Latin <lb/>
            language, requested Cicero to perform his exercises <lb/>
            in Greek; and that Cicero readily complied, thinking. <lb/>
            that his faults would thus be better corrected. When he <lb/>
            had finished his exercise, all the rest were amazed, and <lb/>
            vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius, <lb/>
            while he was listening to Cicero, showed no approbation, <lb/>
            and when Cicero had finished he sat for a long time <lb/>
            wrapped in thought; and as Cicero showed his dissatis­ <lb/>
            faction, he said, " You indeed, Cicero, I commend and <lb/>
            admire, but I pity the fortune of Greece seeing that <lb/>
            the only excellent things which were left to us have <lb/>
            been transferred to the Romans by you, learning and <lb/>
            eloquence."</p>
          <p>V. Now Cicero, full of hope in his course to a political <lb/>
            career, had his ardour dulled by an oracular answer. For <note type="footnote"> * Cicero was at Rhodes in B.C, 78 (compare his Brutus, c. 91). <lb/>
            Cicero calls this "Apollonius the son of Molo," simply Molo (see the <lb/>

            the Romans among his pupils, C. Julius Cæsar and Cicero. </note><note type="footnote"> Poseidonius was the chief Stoic of his time. </note> <lb/>

            on consulting the god at Delphi * how he might get most <lb/>
            fame, the Pythia bade him make his own nature, and not <lb/>
            the opinion of the many, his guide in life. At first he <lb/>
            lived with reserve at Rome, and was slow in offering <lb/>
            himself for magistracies, and was undervalued, being <lb/>
            called Greek and pedant, names current among and <lb/>
            familiar to the lowest citizens. But as he was naturally <lb/>
            ambitious and was urged on by his father and friends, he <lb/>
            devoted himself to assisting persons in their causes, and <lb/>
            he did not approach the highest distinction by gradual <lb/>
            steps, but at once blazed forth in reputation, and was far <lb/>
            superior to those who exerted themselves in the Forum. <lb/>
            It is said that he was as defective as Demosthenes in <lb/>
            action, and that accordingly he carefully devoted himself <lb/>
            first to Roscius t the comedian, and then to Æsopus the <lb/>
            tragedian. Of this AEsopus it is told, that when he was <lb/>
            representing on the stage Atreus deliberating how he <lb/>
            should revenge himself on Thyestes, and one of the <lb/>
            servants suddenly ran past him, being transported out of <lb/>
            his reason by his feelings he struck the man with his <lb/>
            sceptre and killed him. Cicero derived no small power of <lb/>
            persuasion from his action. ‡ He used scoffingl y to say of <lb/>
            the orators who bawled loud,§ that because of their weak­ <note type="footnote"> * Cicero never mentions this visit to Delphi in his writings, and <lb/>
            Middleton thinks the visit is improbable, because Cicero (De Divinatione, <lb/>
            ii. 56) shows that he knew what was the value of the oracle. But a <lb/>
            man who despises a popular superstition may try to use it for his pur­ <lb/>
            poses, and may be disappointed if be cannot. Perhaps the sounduess <lb/>
            of the oracle's advice may be a good reason for disbelieving the story. <lb/>
            Cicero returned to Rome in B.C. 77. </note><note type="footnote"> † This was Q. Roscius, in whose behalf Cicero made a speech in <lb/>
            B.C. 76, before C. Piso as judex. The subject of the cause is stated in <lb/>

            perfect master of his art, was probably a Greek and a freedman <lb/>
            of some member of the Claudia Gens. He was liberal in his <lb/>
            expenditure, and yet he acquired an enormous fortune, which his <lb/>
            son spent. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκ του̑ ύποκίνεσθαι</foreign>, that is, from " acting." One Greek word for <lb/>
            actor is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύποκριτής</foreign>. Oratorical action was therefore viewed as a part of <lb/>
            the histrionic art; and so it is. But oratorical acting requires to be <lb/>
            kept within narrower limits. </note><note type="footnote"> § Bawling is properly viewed as an effort to accomplish by loudness <lb/>

            ness they had recourse to shouting, like lame men leaping <lb/>
            on horses. His readiness at sarcasm and other sharp <lb/>
            sayings was considered well adapted to courts of justice <lb/>
            and clever, but by over use of it he gave offence to many <lb/>
            and got the character of an ill-disposed person.</p>
          <p>VI. Being elected quaestor * at a time of scarcity of corn, <lb/>
            and having got Sicily as his province, he gave offence to <lb/>
            the people at first by compelling them to send corn to <lb/>
            Home. But afterwards, when they had proof of his care <lb/>
            and justice and mildness, they respected him as they <lb/>
            never had any governor before. And when many young <lb/>
            Romans of good repute and noble birth, who were under a <lb/>
            charge of neglect of discipline and bad behaviour in the <lb/>
            war, were sent up to the prætor of Sicily, Cicero pleaded <lb/>
            for them in a remarkable manner, and gained their <lb/>
            acquittal. Being accordingly greatly elated at all this, on <lb/>
            his journey to Rome, as he tells us, a ludicrous incident <lb/>
            happened to him. In Campania t falling in with a man of <lb/>
            rank, whom he considered to be a friend of his, he asked <lb/>
            him what the Romans said about his conduct in Sicily, <lb/>
            and what they thought of it, supposing that the city was <lb/>
            full of his name and of his measures, and upon the man <lb/>
            replying, " But where have you been all this time <lb/>
            Cicero ? " he was completely dispirited that his fame was <lb/>
            lost in the city as in a boundless sea and had produced no <lb/>
            glorious result to his reputation; but on reflection he <lb/>
            abated much of his ambition, considering that he was <lb/>
            striving for fame as for a thing indefinite and one which <lb/>
            had no attainable limit. However all along there abided <lb/>
            in him an exceeding love of praise and a strong passion <note type="footnote"> ridiculous, and misses the mark that it aims at. "If you mouth it," <lb/>
            says Hamlet to the players, as many of your players do, I had as lief <lb/>
            the town crier had spoke my lines."—"Let your discretion be your <lb/>
            tutor: suit the action to the word, and the word to the action; with <lb/>
            this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature." </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero was elected quæstor BoC. 76, when he was thirty years of <lb/>
            age. He discharged the duties of his office during B.O. 75. He <lb/>
            speaks well of his own quæstorship in his oration for Ch Plancius <lb/>
            &lt;c. 26). </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero tells the story himself in his oration for Cn. Plancius (c. <lb/>
            26). The place of the adventure was Puteoli (Pozzuoli), B.O. 74, a <lb/>
            place to which the Romans used to resort to enjby the natural hot <lb/>
            springs and the agreeable neighbourhood. </note> <lb/>

            for fame, which often disturbed much of his sound <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>VII. But when he began to engage more actively in <lb/>
            public concerns, he thought it a shame that artisans, who <lb/>
            make use of inanimate instruments and tools, should be <lb/>
            acquainted with the name of each and its place and use, <lb/>
            and that the political man, whose public acts are effected <lb/>
            by the agency of men, should be indolent and indifferent <lb/>
            about the knowledge of his fellow-citizens. Accordingly <lb/>
            he not only accustomed himself to remember persons' <lb/>
            names, but he also knew the place in which every man <lb/>
            of note dwelt, and the spot where he had his property, <lb/>
            and the friends with whom he was familiar and his <lb/>
            neighbours ; and whatever road in Italy he was traversing, <lb/>
            Cicero could easily tell and point out the lands and houses <lb/>
            of his friends. As he had only a small property, though <lb/>
            sufficient and adequate to his expenses, he obtained credit <lb/>
            by accepting neither pay nor presents for his services as <lb/>
            an advocate, and most particularly by his undertaking the <lb/>
            prosecution against Verres,* who had been prætor of <lb/>
            Sicily. Verres, who had been guilty of great malversa­ <lb/>
            tion, was prosecuted by the Sicilians, and Cicero caused <lb/>
            his conviction, not by speeches, but in a manner, as one <lb/>
            may say, by not speaking at all. For as the prætors <lb/>
            favoured Verres, and were putting off the trial to the last <lb/>
            day by adjournments and tricks, and it was clear that the <note type="footnote"> * Verres during his prætorship in Sicily, B.C. 73-71, had greatly mis­ <lb/>
            conducted himself. He was prosecuted in B.O. 70, in which year Pom­ <lb/>
            peius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus were consuls (Life of Crassus, <lb/>
            c. 12). Hortensius, the orator, defended Verres. The object of Hor­ <lb/>
            tensius and of these prætors was to prolong or defer the trial to the <lb/>
            next year, for which Hortensius was elected consul. </note><note type="footnote"> There are extant seven orations of Cicero on the matter of Verres, <lb/>
            of which two only were delivered ; that against Caecilius (De Divina­ <lb/>
            tione), who claimed to conduct the prosecution, his object being to get <lb/>
            Verres off, and the Actio Prima, which is an opening of the whole <lb/>
            case. Before the other speeches were delivered, Verres gave up his <lb/>
            defence and went into exile. Cicero, however, published the speeches, <lb/>
            or probably even wrote them entire after the affair was over. </note><note type="footnote"> This Caecilius was Q. Cæcilius Metellus, a Sicilian by birth, and <lb/>
            probably the descendant of a freedman of one of the Metelli. It seems <lb/>
            that he was suspected of being of Jewish origin. Cicero's allusion to <lb/>
            the hog, and many other passages in the Roman writers, show that the <lb/>
            Jews were wsll known in Rjme at this time. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            space of one day would not be sufficient for the speeches <lb/>
            and the trial would not be brought to a conclusion, Cicero <lb/>
            got up and said that the case required no speeches, and <lb/>
            bringing forward the witnesses and taking their evidence <lb/>
            he told the judices to give their vote. Yet many lively <lb/>
            sayings of his at that trial are recorded. The Romans <lb/>
            call a castrated hog " verres." Now when a man of the <lb/>
            class of libertini named Cæcilius, who was under the <lb/>
            imputation of Judaism, wished to put aside the Siceliots <lb/>
            and be the prosecutor of Verres, Cicero said " What has a <lb/>
            Jew to do with a verres ? " Verres also had a son grown <lb/>
            up, who was reputed not to have regard to his youthful <lb/>
            beauty as a person of free birth ought to have. <lb/>
            Accordingly when Cicero was reviled for his effeminacy <lb/>
            by Verres, he replied, " A man should find fault with his <lb/>
            sons at home." * The orator Hortensius did not venture <lb/>
            directly to defend the cause of Verres, yet he was induced <lb/>
            to give him his assistance when the damages were <lb/>
            assessed, for which he had received an ivory sphinx as his <lb/>
            reward. Upon Cicero saying something to him in an <lb/>
            oblique way, and Hortensius replying that he had no <lb/>
            skill in solving ænigmas, Cicero answered, " And yet you <lb/>
            have the sphinx t at home."</p>
          <p>VIII. Verres being convicted, Cicero laid the damages <lb/>
            at seventy-five ten thousands, and yet he fell under <lb/>
            suspicion of having lowered the damages ‡ for a bribe. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">έντὸςθυρω̑ν</foreign> " within doors." Kaltwasser has translated the <lb/>

            Prima (c. 18), which was spoken after Cicero had been in Sicily to <lb/>
            collect evidence, he put the amount at forty millions of sesterces, or <lb/>
            two-fifths of the first sum. If Plutarch's drachmas are Roman denarii, <lb/>

            However the Siceliots were grateful, and during his <lb/>
            ædileship * they came and brought many things from the <lb/>
            island, from none of which did Cicero make any gain, but <lb/>
            he availed himself of the men's desire to honour him so <lb/>
            far as to cheapen the market. He possessed a fine place <lb/>
            at Arpi,t and he had an estate near Naples, and another <lb/>
            near Pompeii,‡ neither of them large: he had also the <lb/>
            marriage portion of his wife Terentia § to the amount of <lb/>
            ten ten thousands, and a bequest which amounted to <lb/>
            nine ten thousands of denarii. With these means he <lb/>
            lived honourably and moderately, enjoying the company <lb/>
            of the Greeks who were familiar with him, and of the <lb/>
            Romans of learning : he rarely, if ever, lay down to table <lb/>
            before sunset, and not so much because of his occupa­ <lb/>
            tions, as because of his health, which suffered much from <lb/>
            the stomach. He was also exact and careful in other <lb/>
            matters that concerned the care of his body, and he <lb/>
            employed both friction and walking a fixed number of <lb/>
            times. By thus regulating his habit of body he main­ <lb/>
            tained it free from disease, and equal to undergo many <lb/>
            and great trials and labours. He gave up his father's <lb/>
            house to his brother, and he fixed his own residence on <lb/>
            the Palatine, in order that those who paid their respects <lb/>
            to him might not be troubled by coming a great distance ; <lb/>
            and people used to come daily to his doors to pay their <lb/>
            respects, no fewer than those who waited on Crassus <lb/>
            because of his wealth, and on Pompeius because of his <lb/>
            influence with the soldiers, which two were at that time <lb/>
            highest in repute and chief of the Romans. Pompeius <note type="footnote"> Corinthian vessels. He was put to death, but he died, it is said, with <lb/>
            great resolution; and he had the satisfaction of hearing that his old <lb/>

            also courted Cicero, and Cicero'a policy contributed greatly <lb/>
            to the power and credit of Pompeius.</p>
          <p>IX. Though there were many candidates with him <lb/>
            for the prætorship,* and men of note, he was proclaimed <lb/>
            first of all; and he was considered to have discharged <lb/>
            his judicial functions with integrity and skill. It is said <lb/>
            that Licinius Macer, a man who of himself had great <lb/>
            weight in the city, and who was also supported by <lb/>
            Crassus, being tried before Cicero for peculation, was so <lb/>
            confident in his power and the exertions made on his <lb/>
            behalf, that while the judices were giving their votes he <lb/>
            went home, and after cutting his hair with all speed, and <lb/>
            putting on a clean dress, as if he had been acquitted, <lb/>
            he was about to return to the Forum; but on Crassus <lb/>
            meeting him near the hall door and telling him that <lb/>
            he was condemned by all the votes, he turned back, took <lb/>
            to his bed and died. And the circumstance brought <lb/>
            Cicero credit for his careful administration of justice. <lb/>
            Vatinius t was a man whose manner was somewhat rough <lb/>
            and contemptuous towards the magistrates when he was <lb/>
            pleading before them, and his neck was full of swellings: <lb/>
            on one occasion when he was before Cicero, he made a <lb/>
            certain demand, and as Cicero did not grant it forthwith, <lb/>
            but deliberated some time, Vatinius said that he should <lb/>
            not hesitate about it if he were prator, on which Cicero <lb/>
            quickly answered, " But I have not such a neck as you." <note type="footnote"> * Cicero was Prætor in the year B.O. 66 and it fell to his lot to <lb/>
            preside at the trials for Repetundæ. This Macor was 0. Licinins <lb/>
            Macer. After he had been prætor he had a province, and during his <lb/>
            administration he was guilty of illegal practices, for which he was <lb/>
            tried and convicted (Cic. Ad Attic, i. 4). Crassus, who also belonged <lb/>
            to the Licinia Gens, felt some sympathy for a man whose crime was <lb/>
            getting money by unlawful means. Macer was an orator and a writer. <lb/>
            A few fragments of his Annals (Krause, Vitæ et Fragm. Vet. Histor. <lb/>
            Rom.) are preserved. </note><note type="footnote"> t P. Vatinius was afterwards consul B.C. 47. There is extant a <lb/>
            speech of Cicero against him, in which of course he has a very bad <lb/>
            character given to him. Kaltwasser says that a thick nook was <lb/>
            considered by the Romans as a sign of a shameless man, and he refers <lb/>
            to the Life of Marius, o. 29, where a like expression is used. Cicero's <lb/>
            neck, according to his own account, was very thin, and he thought <lb/>
            it no good sign of his strength. However this may be as to the <lb/>
            thickness of the neck of Vatinius, it was clearly not a thing that he <lb/>
            could alter. </note> <lb/>

            While Cicero had still two or three days in his office, <lb/>
            some person brought Manilius* before him on a charge of <lb/>
            peculation; but Manilius had the goodwill of the people <lb/>
            and their zeal in his favour, as it was considered that <lb/>
            he was attacked on account of Pompeius, whose friend he <lb/>
            was. On Manilius asking for time Cicero gave him only <lb/>
            one day, which was the next; and the people were angry, <lb/>
            inasmuch as the prætors were accustomed to allow ten <lb/>
            days at least to those who were accused. The tribunes <lb/>
            also brought Cicero to the Rostra and found fault with <lb/>
            him, but he prayed to be heard, and he said that as he <lb/>
            had always behaved to accused persons with forbearance <lb/>
            and kindness, so far as the laws allowed, he thought it <lb/>
            would be harsh not to do so in the case of Manilius, and <lb/>
            accordingly he had purposely limited him to the only <lb/>
            day which was at his disposal as prætor, for that to <lb/>
            throw the trial into the period of another prætor's <lb/>
            jurisdiction was not the part of one who was willing <lb/>
            to help another. These words wrought a wonderful <lb/>
            change in the people, and with many expressions of good­ <lb/>
            will they prayed him to undertake the defence of <lb/>
            Manilius. Cicero readily undertook it, and chiefly for <lb/>
            the sake of Pompeius who was absent, and coming before <lb/>
            the people he again harangued them, in bold terms <lb/>
            censuring the oligarchal faction and the enviers of <lb/>
            Pompeius.</p>
          <p>X. Cicero was invited to the consulship! no less by <lb/>
            the aristocratical party than by the many who for the <lb/>
            interest of the state gave him their aid, and for the <lb/>
            following reason. The changes which Sulla had intro­ <lb/>
            duced into the constitution at first appeared unseasonable, <note type="footnote"> * C. Manilius, a Tribunus Plebis, had in this same year proposed <lb/>
            and carried the law which gave Pompeius the command in the <lb/>
            Mithridatio war, and Cicero had supported the measure in a speech <lb/>
            which is extant (Life of Pompeius, c. 30). This story of the accusation <lb/>
            and defence of Manilius is unintelligible. C. Orcbinins presided at <lb/>
            the trials for peculates, and Manilius should have been brought before <lb/>
            him (Cic. Pro Cluentio, c. 53). See Dion Cassius, 36. c. 27; and <lb/>

            but now they seemed to the many by length of time and <lb/>
            usage to have received a kind of settlement, and not a <lb/>
            bad one ; but there were those who sought to shake and <lb/>
            change the present condition of affairs for the sake of <lb/>
            their own gain and not for the public good, while Pom­ <lb/>
            peius was still fighting with the kings in Pontus and <lb/>
            Armenia, and there was no power in Rome able to resist <lb/>
            those who were for change. These men had for their <lb/>
            head a bold man and an ambitious and one of versatile <lb/>
            temper, Lucius Catilina, who in addition to other great <lb/>
            crimes had once laboured under the imputation of unlaw­ <lb/>
            ful commerce with his virgin daughter, and of murdering <lb/>
            his own brother,. and being afraid of being punished for <lb/>
            this he persuaded Sulla to proscribe his brother among <lb/>
            those who were doomed to die, as if he were still alive. <lb/>
            Him the evil-minded took for their leader, and they gave <lb/>
            various pledges to one another, and among these they <lb/>
            sacrificed a man and ate of his flesh. † Catilina had <lb/>
            corrupted a large part of the youth in the city by <lb/>
            supplying every one of them with pleasure and banquets, <lb/>
            and amours with women, and furnishing unsparingly the <lb/>
            expense for all this. All Etruria was roused to revolt, and <lb/>
            the greater part of Gaul within the Alps: and Rome was <lb/>
            exposed to the greatest hazard of change, on account <lb/>
            of the inequality in properties, for those who had most <lb/>
            reputation and lofty bearing had impoverished themselves <lb/>
            by theatrical expenses and entertainments, and love <lb/>
            of magistracies and building, and the wealth had all come <lb/>
            into the bands of men of mean birth and low persons, <lb/>
            30 that things needed only a slight inclination, and it was <lb/>
            in the power of every man who had courage for the thing <lb/>
            to unsettle the state, which of itself was in a diseased <lb/>
            condition.</p>
          <p>XI. However Catilina, wishing to secure a stronghold, <lb/>
            was a candidate for the consulship, and he was high in <lb/>
            hope that he should be the colleague of Caius Antonius, <lb/>
            a man who of himself was not calculated to be a leader <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Sulla, c. 32. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sallust (BelL Catilin. c. 22) tells a story somewhat to the same <lb/>
            effect, of the conspirators drinking of human blood, but he does not <lb/>
            believe the story, and perhaps few people will. </note> <lb/>

            either for good or bad, but one who would add force <lb/>
            to another who was a leader. It was from seeing this <lb/>
            that the majority of the honourable and the good en­ <lb/>
            couraged Cicero to the consulship, and as the people <lb/>
            readily seconded them, Catilina was rejected, and Cicero <lb/>
            and Caius Antonius were elected. And yet Cicero alone <lb/>
            of the candidates was the son of an eques, not of a <lb/>
            senator.</p>
          <p>XII. Now the designs of Catilina still remained un­ <lb/>
            known to the many, but great struggles awaited the <lb/>
            consulship of Cicero. For in the first place, those who <lb/>
            by the laws of Bulla were excluded from magistracies, <lb/>
            being neither weak nor few, became candidates and <lb/>
            attempted to gain popular favour, and they made many <lb/>
            charges against the tyranny of Bulla which were indeed <lb/>
            true and just, but yet they were disturbing the state of <lb/>
            affairs at an unfit time and out of season; and in the next <lb/>
            place the tribunes brought forward measures to the same <lb/>
            purpose, in which they proposed an administration com­ <lb/>
            posed of ten men * with full powers, whose instructions <lb/>
            were to have authority to sell the public property in all <lb/>
            Italy and in all Syria, and all that had lately been ac­ <lb/>
            quired by Pompeius, to try whom they pleased, to send <lb/>
            them into exile, to colonise cities, to take money from the <lb/>
            treasury, and to maintain and raise as many soldiers as <lb/>
            they might require. Accordingly others of the nobles <lb/>
            were in favour of the law, and especially Antonius, the <lb/>
            colleague of Cicero, who expected to be one of the ten. <lb/>
            It was supposed also that he was acquainted with the <lb/>
            designs of Catilina, and was not averse to them on account <lb/>
            of the magnitude of his debts, which chiefly gave alarm <lb/>
            to the nobles. And this was the first object that Cicero <lb/>
            directed his attention to, and he caused the province of <lb/>
            Macedonia t to be given to Antonius, and Gaul, which was <note type="footnote"> * The measure to which Plutarch alludes was the Agrarian Law of <lb/>
            the tribune P. Servilius Rullus. Cicero made three speeches against <lb/>
            the proposal, which are extant, and he defeated the scheme. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. Antonius went as governor to Macedonia in B.o. 62, where he <lb/>
            took the opportunity of getting all the money that he could. He gave <lb/>
            it out that Cicero was to have a share of it. The evidence of such an <lb/>
            unprincipled man is not worth much : but one of Cicero's letters to <lb/>
            AtHens (i. 12), which he never expected would be read by anybody </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            offered to himself, he declined; and by these favours he <lb/>
            gained over Antunius like a hired actor to play a second <lb/>
            part to himself on behalf of his country. Now when <lb/>
            Antonius was gained and had become tractable, Cicero, <lb/>
            being emboldened, opposed himself to those who were for <lb/>
            making change. Accordingly, in the Senate, he made <lb/>
            an attack upon the law, and so alarmed the promoters of <lb/>
            it that they had nothing to say against him. When they <lb/>
            made a second attempt, and being fully prepared invited <lb/>
            the consuls to appear before the people, Cicero, nothing <lb/>
            alarmed, bade the Senate follow him, and coming forward, <lb/>
            he not only caused the rejection of the law, but made the <lb/>
            tribunes give up even the rest of their measures and to <lb/>
            yield to his overpowering eloquence.</p>
          <p>XIII. For this man moot of all showed the Romans <lb/>
            what a charm eloquence adds to a good thing, and that <lb/>
            justice is invincible if it be rightly expressed in words, <lb/>
            and that it befits him who dulydirects political affairs, <lb/>
            always in his acts to choose the good instead of that which <lb/>
            merely pleases, and in his speech to deprive what is <lb/>
            useful of that which gives pain. And a sample of his­ <lb/>
            persuasiveeloquence was what happened in his consul­ <lb/>
            ship with respect to the public exhibitions.In former <lb/>
            times those of the equestrian class were mingled with <lb/>
            the crowd in the theatres and were spectators among <lb/>
            the people, just as chance would have it; but Marcus <note type="footnote"> else, shows that he knew there was such a rumour; and the manner <lb/>
            in which he treats it is perfectly incomprehensible. A certain Hilarus, <lb/>
            a freedman of Cicero, was then with Antonius in Macedonia, as Cicero <lb/>
            was informed, and Cicero was also informed that Antonius declared <lb/>
            that Cicero was to have some of the money that he was getting, and <lb/>
            that Hilarus had been sent by Cicero to look after his share. Cicero <lb/>
            was a good deal troubled, as he says, though he did not believe the <lb/>
            report; yet, he adds, there was certainly some talk. Cn. Plancius was <lb/>
            I amed to Cicero as the authority for the report. Atticus is requested <lb/>
            to examine into the matter, and-not to apply to Antonius or to <lb/>
            Plancius—but to get the rascal (Hilarus) out of those parts, if in any <lb/>
            way he can. This is a mode ot proceeding that is quite inconsistent <lb/>
            with perfect innocence on the part of Cicero. There was something <lb/>
            between him and Antonius. Cicero says that if Antonius should be <lb/>
            recalled, as was expected, he could not for his character's sake defend <lb/>
            the man ; and what is more, he says, lie felt no inclination; and then <lb/>
            he proceeds to tell Atticus about this awkward report. Yet Cicero did <lb/>
            de end Antonius (B.C. 59) and Antonius was convicted. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>

            Otho* in his prætorship was the first who, for the sake of dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, separated the equites from the rest of the citizens, <lb/>
            and gave them a particular place, which they still retain <lb/>
            The people took this as a disparagement of themselves, <lb/>
            and when Otho appeared in the theatre, they hissed for <lb/>
            the purpose of insulting him, but the equites received <lb/>
            him with loud applause. Again the people began to hiss <lb/>
            louder, and the equites to make still greater plaudits. <lb/>
            Upon this they fell to abusing one another, and kept the <lb/>
            theatre in confusion. When Cicero heard of this he came, <lb/>
            and summoning the people to the temple of Bellona both <lb/>
            rebuked and admonished them, on which they went back <lb/>
            to the theatre and loudly applauded Otho, and vied with <lb/>
            the equites in doing honour to the man and showing their <lb/>
            respect. 0</p>
          <p>XIV. The conspirators with Catilina t at first crouched <lb/>
            and were afraid, but they recovered heart, and assembling <lb/>
            together urged one another to take matters in hand with <lb/>
            more courage before Pompeius returned, who was said <lb/>
            to be now coming home with his force. Catilina was <lb/>
            chiefly stirred up by the old soldiers of Sulla, who were <lb/>
            planted all through Italy, but the greatest number and <lb/>
            the most warlike of them were distributed in the Tuscan <lb/>
            cities, and were again forming visions of robbery and <lb/>
            plunder of the wealth that existed. These men, with <lb/>
            Manlius t for their leader, one of those who had served <note type="footnote"> * It appears from Cicero's oration for Murena, e. 19, that his name <lb/>
            was Lucius Roscius Otho, and he was not Prætor, but Tribunus Plebis. <lb/>
            This Lex Roscia was enacted B.C. 67, in the consulship of M. Acilius <lb/>
            Glabrio and 0. Calpumius Piso (Don Cassius, 36. c. 25). His law <lb/>
            gave to the equites and those who bad the equestrian census a select <lb/>
            place of fourteen rows at the public spectacles, which were next to the <lb/>
            seats of the senators. This unpopular measure was that which Cicero <lb/>
            now spoke in favour of (Ad. Attic. ii 1). Cicero's oration is lost, but <lb/>
            a passage is preserved, says Kaltwasser, by Macrobius (Saturnalia ii. <lb/>
            10). Some also suppose, as Kaltwasser says, that Virgil alludes to it in <lb/>
            the passage in the Æneid (i. 152). There is no extract from this oration <lb/>
            in Macrobius, who appears to suppose that Cicero made an oration to <lb/>
            rebuke the people for making a disturbance while Roscius, the player, <lb/>
            was acting. </note><note type="footnote"> t As to the conspiracy, see the Lives of Cæsar and Cato, and the <lb/>

            with distinction under Bulla, were on the side of Catilina, <lb/>
            and came to Rome to assist at the Comitia; for Catilina <lb/>
            was again a candidate for the consulship, and had resolved <lb/>
            to kill Cicero in the tumult of the elections. The dæmon <lb/>
            also seemed to pre-signify what was going on by earth­ <lb/>
            quakes and lightnings and sights. The information from <lb/>
            human testimony was indeed clear, but not sufficient for <lb/>
            conviction of a man of reputation and great power, like <lb/>
            Catilina. Wherefore Cicero deferred the day of election, <lb/>
            and summoning Catilina to the Senate questioned him <lb/>
            about what was reported. Catilina, thinking that there <lb/>
            were many in the Senate who were desirous of change, <lb/>
            and at the same time wishing to make a display before <lb/>
            the conspirators, gave Cicero an insane answer: “ What <lb/>
            am I doing so strange, if when there are two bodies, one <lb/>
            lean and wasted, but with a head, and the other headless, <lb/>
            but strong and large, I myself furnish it with a head ? "* <lb/>
            This allusion of his was to the Senate and to the people, <lb/>
            which made Cicero more alarmed, and putting on his <lb/>
            armour he was conducted by all the nobles from his house <lb/>
            and by many of the young men to the Campus Martius. <lb/>
            And he purposely let the people have a glimpse of his <lb/>
            armour by loosing his tunic from his shoulders, and he <lb/>
            showed the spectators there was danger. The people <lb/>
            were enraged and rallied round him, and at last by their <lb/>
            votes they again rejected Catilina, and chose Silanus t and <lb/>
            Murena consuls.</p>
          <p>XV. Not long after the men in Etruria came together <lb/>
            to support Catilina, and were forming themselves into <lb/>
            companies; and the appointed day for executing their <note type="footnote"> saying that his true name was Mallius: that was merely a Greek form <lb/>
            of Manlius. He fell in the battle in which Catiline's troops were <lb/>
            defeated. </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero has recorded this answer of Catiline in his oration for <lb/>
            Murena, c. 25: “ duo corpora esse in republica, unum debile, infirmo <lb/>
            capite, alterum firmum, sine capite: huic, cum ita de se meritum <lb/>
            esset, caput se vivo non defuturum." Cicero makes Catiline say that <lb/>
            the weak body had a weak head. Cicero's version of what he said is <lb/>
            obviously the true one. </note><note type="footnote"> t Decimus Junius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena were consuls for <lb/>

            plan was near, when there came to Cicero'a house about <lb/>
            midnight men who were among the first and most power­ <lb/>
            ful in Rome, Marcus Crassus, and Marcus Marcellus,* and <lb/>
            Scipio Metellus; and knocking at the door and calling <lb/>
            the door-keeper, they bade him rouse Cicero and tell him <lb/>
            that they were there. And the matter was thus: after <lb/>
            Crassus had supped, the door-keeper gave him letters <lb/>
            brought by some unknown man, which were addressed <lb/>
            to different persons, and one to Crassus himself without <lb/>
            a signature. Crassus, having read this letter only, and <lb/>
            seeing that the letter intimated that there would be great <lb/>
            bloodshed caused by Catilina and that it urged him to <lb/>
            quit the city, did not open the rest, but went forthwith <lb/>
            to Cicero in alarm at the danger, and desiring to acquit <lb/>
            himself somewhat of the blame which he bore on account <lb/>
            of his friendship with Catilina. Accordingly Cicero after <lb/>
            deliberating convened the Senate at daybreak, and taking <lb/>
            the letters gave them to the persons to whom they were <lb/>
            directed, and bade them read the letters aloud: and all <lb/>
            the letters alike gave notice of a conspiracy. When <lb/>
            Quintus Arrius, a man of praetorian rank, reported the <lb/>
            forming of armed companies in Etruria, and news arrived <lb/>
            that Manlius with a large force was hovering about those <lb/>
            cities expecting every moment something new from Rome, <lb/>
            a decree of the Senate was made to put affairs in the hands <lb/>
            of the consuls, and that the consuls on receiving this com­ <lb/>
            mission should administer the state as they best could, <lb/>
            and save it. The Senate is not used to do this frequently, <lb/>
            but only when they apprehend great danger.</p>
          <p>XVI. Cicero upon receiving this authority intrusted <lb/>
            affairs out of the city to Quintus Metellus; he undertook <lb/>
            the care of the city himself, and he daily went forth <lb/>
            guarded by so large a body of men, that when he entered <lb/>
            the Forum those who accompanied him occupied a large <lb/>
            part of the ground, whereupon Catilina, no longer enduring <lb/>
            delay, resolved to make his escape to Manlius, and he corn­ <note type="footnote"> * This affair is not mentioned by Sallustius in his history of the <lb/>
            conspiracy of Catiline. The usual form in which the Senate gave this <lb/>
            extraordinary power is mentioned by Sallustius (c. 29) : "dent operam <lb/>
            consules nequid Res Publica detriment! capiat." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            missioned Malcius * and Cethegus to arm themselves with <lb/>
            swords, and going to Cicero's door in the morning on <lb/>
            pretence of paying their respects, to fall on him and kill <lb/>
            him. Fulvia.t a woman of rank, reported this to Cicero <lb/>
            by night, and exhorted him to be on his guard against <lb/>
            Cethegus and his associate. The men came at daybreak, <lb/>
            and as they were not permitted to enter, they fell to rail­ <lb/>
            ing and abuse at the doors, which made them still more <lb/>
            suspected. Cicero going out called the Senate to the <lb/>
            temple of Jupiter the Stayer, whom the Romans call <lb/>
            Stator, which is situated at the commencement of the <lb/>
            Sacred Road as you go up to the Palatine. Catilina also <lb/>
            came there with the rest to make his defence, but none of <lb/>
            the senators would sit down with him, and all moved <lb/>
            from the bench. Catilina began to speak, but he was <lb/>
            interrupted by cries, and at last Cicero got up and bade <lb/>
            him leave the city; for he said it was fit that as he was <lb/>
            administering affairs with words and Catilina with arms, <lb/>
            there should be a wall t between them. Accordingly <lb/>
            Catilina immediately left the city with three hundred <lb/>
            armed men, and surrounding himself with fasces and axes <lb/>
            as if he were a magistrate, and raising standards he <lb/>
            marched to Manlius; and as about twenty thousand men <lb/>
            altogether were collected, he visited the cities and en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to persuade them to revolt, so that there was <note type="footnote"> * The assassins, according to Sallustius, were C. Cornelius and L. <lb/>

            hunted in his authorities only after anecdotes and traits of character <lb/>
            in order to paint his heroes: the names of the subordinate persons <lb/>
            were indifferent to him; with such frivolous and one-bided views <lb/>
            he could not fail to confound persons." “ Frivolous," is perhaps <lb/>
            hardly the translation of Drumann's " leichtsinnig,” but it comes <lb/>
            pretty near to it. And vet the fact of the design to assassinate is <lb/>
            the main feature in the history: the actors in the intended assassina­ <lb/>
            tion are subordinate to the design. A painstaking compiler is entitled <lb/>
            to grumble at such a blunder, but Plutarch does not merit reproach in <lb/>

          <p>XVII. Those who remained in the city of the persona <lb/>
            who had been corrupted by Catilina were assembled and <lb/>
            encouraged by Cornelius Lentulus Sura,* a man of illus­ <lb/>
            trious birth, but who had lived a bad life and been already <lb/>
            expelled from the Senate on account of his licentious <lb/>
            habits. Ho was then prætor for the second time, as is <lb/>
            the custom for those who recover the senatorial dignity. <lb/>
            It is said that he got the name Sura from the following <lb/>
            circumstance. In the times of Sulla he was quaestor, and <lb/>
            lost and wasted much of the public money. Sulla was <lb/>
            angry at this, and called him to account before the Senate; <lb/>
            but Lentulus, coming forward in a very indifferent and <lb/>
            contemptuous way, said that he had no account to give, <lb/>
            but he offered his leg, as boys were wont to do when they <lb/>
            had made a miss in playing at ball. From this he got <lb/>
            the nickname of Sura, for the Romans call the leg ‛ sura.' <lb/>
            Again, being brought to trial he bribed some of the <lb/>
            judices, and was acquitted by two votes only, whereon he <lb/>
            said that what he had given to one of the judices was <lb/>
            fairly wasted, for it was enough to be acquitted by a <lb/>
            single vote. Such being the character of the man, and <lb/>
            being stirred up by Catilina, he was further corrupted by <lb/>
            the vain hopes held out by false prophets and jugglers, <lb/>
            who recited forged verses and predictions, alleged to be <lb/>
            from the Sibylline books, which declared that it was the <lb/>
            law of fate that three Cornelii should be monarchs in <lb/>
            Rome, two of whom had fulfilled their destiny, Cinnat and <lb/>
            Sulla, and that the daemon was come and had brought the <lb/>
            monarchy to him the third of the Cornelii, and he ought <lb/>
            by all means to accept it, and not to spoil the critical <lb/>
            opportunity by delay like Catilina.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Accordingly Lentulus designed nothing small <lb/>
            or trivial, but he determined to kill all the senators, and <note type="footnote"> * L. Cornelius Lentulus Sura was consul B.O. 71. H e had been <lb/>
            put out of the Senate by the censors for his irregular life. His restora­ <lb/>
            tion to his rank and the matter of the prætorship are mentioned by <lb/>
            Dion Cassius (37, c. SO, and the note of Reimarus). The meaning of <lb/>
            the story about the ball is obvious enough ; but Lentulus was not the <lb/>
            first who had the name Sura, and Plutarch's story is so far untrue. <lb/>

            as many of the rest of the citizens as he could, and to burn <lb/>
            the city, and spare nobody except the children of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, whom they intended to seize and keep in their <lb/>
            power as securities for coming to terms with Pompeius, <lb/>
            for already there was strong and sure report of his return­ <lb/>
            ing to Rome from his great expedition. A night had been <lb/>
            fixed for the attempt, one of the Saturnalia,. and they took <lb/>
            and hid in the house of Cethegus swords and tow and brim­ <lb/>
            stone. They also appointed a hundred men, and assigned by <lb/>
            lot as many parts of Rome to each, in order that by means of <lb/>
            many incendiaries the city might be in a blaze in a short <lb/>
            time on all sides.! Others were to stop up the water con­ <lb/>
            duits and to kill those who attempted to get water. <lb/>
            While this was going on, there happened to be at Rome <lb/>
            two ambassadors of the Allobroges,t a nation which espe­ <lb/>
            cially at that time was in a bad condition and oppressed <lb/>
            by the supremacy of Rome. The partizans of Lentulus, <lb/>
            considering them suitable persons for stiring up Gaul to <lb/>
            revolt, made them privy to the conspiracy. They gave <lb/>
            these men letters to their Senate and letters to Catilina, <lb/>
            promising liberty to the Senate, and urging Catilina to <lb/>
            free the slaves and to march upon Rome. They also sent <lb/>
            with them to Catilina one Titus § of Croton to carry the <lb/>
            letters. But inasmuch as the conspirators were unsteady <lb/>
            men, who for the most part met one another over wine and <lb/>
            in company with women, and Cicero followed up their <lb/>
            designs with labour and sober consideration and unusual <lb/>
            prudence, and had many men out of their body to keep <lb/>
            watch and to help him in tracking out their doings, and <lb/>
            as he had secret conversation with many of those who <note type="footnote"> * It was a period of festivity, and considered suitable for the purpose <lb/>

            According to Cæsar's description (BeU. Gall. i. 6.) the Rhodanus in the <lb/>
            upper part of its course separated the Helvetii from the Allobroges. <lb/>
            The remotest town of the Allobroges, on the side of the Helvetii, was <lb/>
            Geneva. Caesar describes the Allobroges as recently (B.O. 58) brought <lb/>
            to friendly terms with the Romans. </note><note type="footnote"> § This Titus of Croton is named Titus Volturciua by Sallustius . </note> <lb/>

            trusted, he became acquainted with their communication <lb/>
            with the strangers, and laying an ambuscade by night he <lb/>
            seized the man of Cretan and the letters, with the secret <lb/>
            assistance of the Allobroges.</p>
          <p>XIX. At daybreak* Cicero, assembling the Senate at tho <lb/>
            temple of Concord, read the letters and examined the <lb/>
            informers. Silanus Junius also said that some persons <lb/>
            had heard Cethegus say, that three consuls and four <lb/>
            prefers were going to be killed. Piso, a man of consular <lb/>
            rank, gave evidence to the same effect. Caius Sulpicius, <lb/>
            one of the prætors, being sent to the house of Cethegus, <lb/>
            found there many missiles and arms, and a great quantity <lb/>
            of swords and knives newly sharpened. At length tho <lb/>
            Senate having by a vote promised a pardon to the man of <lb/>
            Croton on condition of his giving information, Lentulus <lb/>
            being convicted abdicated his office, for he happened to be <lb/>
            prætor, and laying down his robe with the purple hem <lb/>
            before the Senate assumed a dress suitable to the occasion. <lb/>
            Lentulus and his associates were delivered up to the <lb/>
            prætors to be kept in custody, but without chains. It <lb/>
            was now evening, and the people in crowds were waiting <lb/>
            about the temple, when Cicero came forth and told the <lb/>
            circumstance to the citizens, by whom he was conducted <lb/>
            to the house of a neighbouring friend, for his own house <lb/>
            was occupied by the women who were celebrating the <lb/>
            mysterious rites to a goddess whom the Romans called <lb/>
            Bona,t and the Greeks call Gynæceia. A sacrifice is made <lb/>
            to the goddess annually in the house of the consul by his <lb/>
            wife or his mother in the presence of the Vestal Virgins. <lb/>
            Cicero, going into the house, deliberated with a very few <lb/>
            persons what he should do with the men: for he had some <lb/>
            scruples about inflicting the extreme punishment and that <lb/>
            which was due to such great crimes; and he hesitated <lb/>
            about it both from the humanity of his disposition, and <lb/>

            in the State ; and if he treated them leniently, he dreaded <lb/>
            danger from them. For he considered that they would <lb/>
            not be well content if they were punished short of death, <lb/>
            but would break forth in all extravagance of audacity and <lb/>
            add fresh indignation to their old villainy; and that he <lb/>
            should be judged a coward and a weak man, especially as <lb/>
            the many had by no means a good opinion of his courage.</p>
          <p>XX. While Cicero was thus doubting, there was a sign <lb/>
            to the women who were sacrificing: for though the fire <lb/>
            seemed to have gone out, the altar sent forth from the <lb/>
            ashes and burnt bark a large and brilliant blaze.* This <lb/>
            alarmed the women, except the sacred virgins, who urged <lb/>
            Terentia, the wife of Cicero, to go with all speed to her <lb/>
            husband and tell him to take in hand what he had <lb/>
            resolved on behalf of his country, for the goddess was <lb/>
            displaying a great light to lead him to safety and honour. <lb/>
            Terentia, who generally was not a woman of a mild <lb/>
            temper nor naturally without courage, but an ambitious <lb/>
            woman, and as Cicero himself says,t more ready to share <lb/>
            in his political perplexities than to communicate to him <lb/>
            her domestic matters, reported this to her husband and <lb/>
            stimulated him against the conspirators : in like manner <lb/>
            too his brother Quintus and Publius Nigidius, one of his <lb/>
            philosophical companions, whose advice he used in the <lb/>
            most and chiefest of his political measures. On the <lb/>
            following day ‡ there was a discussion in the Senate about <lb/>
            the punishment of the conspirators, when Silanus, who <lb/>
            was first asked his opinion, said that they ought to be <lb/>
            taken to prison and suffer the extreme punishment: and <note type="footnote"> * Compare Dion Cassius, 37, o. 35. Fabia, the sister of Terentia, <lb/>
            was one of the Vestals, and Drumann supposes that this fact confirms <lb/>
            his supposition that Cicero had arranged all this affair with hiis wife, <lb/>
            in order to work on the popular opinion. Middleton made the same <lb/>
            supposition a long time ago. It requires no great penetration to make <lb/>
            such a conjecture; but it may not be true. </note><note type="footnote"> t It is said that this does not appear in any of Cicero'a extant <lb/>
            writings. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The Senate assembled on the fourth of December in the temple of <lb/>
            Concord; and again on the fifth to pass judgment on the conspirators. <lb/>
            Ad to the speeches delivered on the occasion, see the Lives of Cæsar <lb/>
            and Cato, and the notes. The whole matter of the conspiracy is treated <lb/>
            with great minuteness and tedious prolixity by Drumann (Tullii, <lb/>
            uu ler the year B.C. 63). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            all who spoke in succession acceded to this opinion, till it <lb/>
            came to the turn of Caius Cæsar, who was afterwards <lb/>
            Dictator. Cæsar, who was then a young man and in the <lb/>
            very beginning of his rise to power, and already in his <lb/>
            policy and his hopes had entered on that road by which <lb/>
            he changed the state of Rome into a monarchy, though he <lb/>
            eluded the penetration of the rest, caused great suspicion <lb/>
            to Cicero, without however giving him any hold for <lb/>
            complete proof; but there were some heard to say that <lb/>
            he came near being caught and yet had escaped from <lb/>
            Cicero. However, some say that Cicero purposely over­ <lb/>
            looked and neglected the information against Cæsar <lb/>
            through fear of his friends and his power, for it was plain <lb/>
            to every man, that the conspirators would rather become <lb/>
            an appendage- to Caesars acquittal, than Cæsar would <lb/>
            become an appendage to their punishment.</p>
          <p>XXI. When, then, it came to Cæssar's†turn to deliver his <lb/>
            opinion, he rose and expressed it against putting the men <lb/>
            to death, but he proposed to confiscate their property and <lb/>
            remove them to the cities of Italy of which Cicero might <lb/>
            approve, and there keep them confined till Catilina was <lb/>
            defeated. The proposal was merciful and the speaker <lb/>
            most eloquent, and Cicero added to it no small weight, for <lb/>
            when Cicero rose‡ he handled the matter both ways, partly <note type="footnote"> * I believe that I have translated this correctly. I suppose that <lb/>
            Plutarch means to say, that if Cæsar had been accused as a member <lb/>
            of the conspiracy, he would have been acquitted, and the conspirators <lb/>
            would have had a chance of escaping also. There was no chance of <lb/>
            securing the condemnation of the conspirators and involving Cæsar in <lb/>
            their fate. On the contrary, if Cæsar was accused, all might escape. <lb/>
            It was better, therefore, not to touch him. Kaltwasser has made the <lb/>
            passage unintelligible. The explanation of Coraës, as corrected by <lb/>
            Schäfer, is right </note><note type="footnote"> t Sallustius (Bell. Cat. c. 51, &amp;c.) states Cæsar's proposal to have <lb/>
            been the confiscation of the property of the conspirators and their <lb/>
            perpetual confinement in the chief municipia of Italy, and that the <lb/>
            Senate should make a declaration that any man who proposed to set <lb/>
            them at liberty, or to mitigate their punishment, should be considered <lb/>
            an enemy of the State. Cicero (In Catilin .iv. 5) states the opinion of <lb/>
            Cæsar to the same effect. Cæsar had urged the illegality of con lemn­ <lb/>
            ing Roman citizens to death without a trial, and this was provided by <lb/>
            a Lex Sempronia of C. Gracchus. But Cicero replies that Cæsar's <lb/>
            measure was as severe. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The speech which he delivered on the occasion is the fourth </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            arguing in favour of the first opinion and partly in favour <lb/>
            of Cæsar's; and all his friends thinking that Cæsar's <lb/>
            opinion was for the advantage of Cicero, for he would be <lb/>
            subject to less blame if he did not condemn the men to <lb/>
            death, chose the second opinion rather, so that even <lb/>
            Silanus himself changed and made his explanation, saying <lb/>
            that neither had he delivered his opinion for death, for <lb/>
            that the extreme punishment to a Roman senator was the <lb/>
            prison. After the opinion was given, Catulus Lutatius <lb/>
            was the first to oppose it; and he was followed by Cato, <lb/>
            who in his speech vehemently urged suspicion against <lb/>
            Cæsar, and so filled the Senate with passion and resolution <lb/>
            that they passed a vote of death against the men. With <lb/>
            respect to the confiscation of their property Cæsar made <lb/>
            opposition, for he did not think it fair that they should <lb/>
            reject the merciful part of his proposition and adopt the <lb/>
            most severe part. As many of them made violent resist­ <lb/>
            ance, he invoked the tribunes, who however paid no <lb/>
            attention to the call, but Cicero himself gave way and <lb/>
            remitted that part of the vote which was for confisca­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>XXII. Cicero went with the Senate to the conspirators, <lb/>
            who were not all in the same place, but kept by the <lb/>
            different prætors. He first took Lentulus * from the <lb/>
            Palatine and led him through the Sacred Road and the <lb/>
            middle of the Forum, with the men of highest rank in a <lb/>
            body around him as his guards, the people the while <lb/>
            shuddering at what was doing and passing by in silence, <lb/>
            and chiefly the youth, who felt as if they were being <lb/>
            initiated with fear and trembling in certain national rites <note type="footnote"> oration against Catiline. Some critics maintain that it is not genuine. <lb/>
            Drumann, who maintains that it is, has a long note on the subject <lb/>
            (Tullii, p. 512). </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch likens the feelings of the youth at the sight of the <lb/>
            prisoners being led to execution to the solemn ceremonies of initiation <lb/>
            in some mysterious rites. The conspirators were taken to the only <lb/>
            prison that Rome then had, the Tullianum, where they were strangled. <lb/>
            Five men were put to death. Nine had been condemned to death, but <lb/>
            four had escaped being seized. Appian (Civil Wars, ii. 6) seems to <lb/>
            say that Cicero saw the men put to death. If he did not see the execu­ <lb/>
            tion, we may safely assume that he took care to see that the men really <lb/>
            were dead. Their bodies were delivered to their kinsfolk for inter­ <lb/>
            ment. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            of a certain aristocratical power. When Cicero had passed <lb/>
            through the Forum and come to the prison, he delivered <lb/>
            Lentulus to the executioner and told him to put him to <lb/>
            death ; he then took down Cethegus and every one of the <lb/>
            rest in order and had them put to death. Seeing that <lb/>
            there were still many members of the conspiracy standing <lb/>
            together in the Forum, who did not know what had been <lb/>
            done and were waiting for the night, supposing that the <lb/>
            men were still alivo and might be rescued, Cicero said to <lb/>
            them in a loud voice, “ They have lived.”In these terms <lb/>
            the Romans are used to speak of death when they do not <lb/>
            choose to use words of bad omen. It was now evening, <lb/>
            and Cicero went up from the Forum to his house, the <lb/>
            citizens no longer accompanying him in silence or in order, <lb/>
            but receiving him with shouts and clapping as he passed <lb/>
            along and calling him the saviour and founder of his <lb/>
            country. And numerous lights illuminated the streets, <lb/>
            for people placed lamps and torches at their doors. The <lb/>
            women too showed lights from the roofs to honour the <lb/>
            man and in order to see him going home, honourably <lb/>
            attended by the nobles ; most of whom, having brought to <lb/>
            an end great wars and entered the city in triumph, and <lb/>
            added to the Roman possessions no small extent of land <lb/>
            and sea, walked along confessing to one another that the <lb/>
            Roman people were indebted for wealth and spoils and <lb/>
            power to many living commanders and generals, but for <lb/>
            their security and safety to Cicero alone, who had removed <lb/>
            from them so great a danger. For it was not the prevent­ <lb/>
            ing of what was in preparation and the punishing of the <lb/>
            doers which appeared worthy of admiration, but that he <lb/>
            had quenched the greatest of dangers that ever threatened <lb/>
            the State with the least evils, and without disturbance <lb/>
            and tumult. For most of those who had flocked to <lb/>
            Catilina* as soon as they heard of the fate of Lentulus and <lb/>
            Cethegus left him and went away: and Catilina, after <note type="footnote"> * Antonius did not command in the battle. He was ill, or pretended <lb/>
            to be ill. His legatus, Petreius, an able officer, commanded the troops. <lb/>
            The battle wits fought early in B.O. 62, probably near Pistoria (Pistoia) <lb/>
            in Etruria. It was a bloody struggle, hand to hand, and the loss on <lb/>
            the victorious side was great. Dion says tl at Antonius sent the head <lb/>
            of Catilina to Rome. According to Roman usage, he was entitled to <lb/>
            the honour of the victory, because Petreius was his inferior officer. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            fighting a battle with those who remained with him <lb/>
            against Antonius, perished and his army with him.</p>
          <p>XXIII. However there were some who were ready to <lb/>
            abuse Cicero for this and to do him harm, and they had for <lb/>
            their leader among those who were going to hold magis­ <lb/>
            tracies, Cæsar as prætor, and Metellus * and Bestia as <lb/>
            tribunes. Upon entering on office, while Cicero had still <lb/>
            a few days in authority, they would not let him address <lb/>
            the people, and placing their seats above the Rostra they <lb/>
            would not permit him to come forward to speak ; they told <lb/>
            him that he might, if he chose, take the oath usual on <lb/>
            giving up office and then go down. Upon this Cicero <lb/>
            came forward as if he were going to take the oath, and when <lb/>
            he had procured silence, he swore not the usual oath, but <lb/>
            one of his own and a new oath, to the effect that he had <lb/>
            saved his country and preserved the supremacy of Rome: <lb/>
            and the whole people confirmed the truth of his oath. At <lb/>
            this Cæsar and the tribunes, being still more vexed, con­ <lb/>
            trived other cavils against Cicero, and a law was brought <lb/>
            forward by them that Pompeius and his army should be <lb/>
            recalled on the pretext of putting down the power of <lb/>
            Cicero. But Cato, who was then tribune, was a great help <lb/>
            to Cicero and to the whole State, and he opposed himself to <lb/>
            Caesar's measures with equal authority and greater good <lb/>
            opinion. For he easily stopped other measures, and he so <lb/>
            extolled the consulship of Cicero in a speech to the people, <lb/>
            that they voted to him the greatest honours that had ever <lb/>
            been conferred and called him the father of his country; <lb/>
            for it seems that Cicero was the first on whom this title <lb/>
            was conferred, upon Cato having so entitled him before the <lb/>
            people. <note type="footnote"> * Metellus Nepos and the other tribunes began to exercise their <lb/>
            functions on the tenth of December. The consuls began to exercise <lb/>
            their functions on the first of January. The oath that Cicero had to <lb/>
            swear was, that he had obeyed the laws. He alludes to the oath that <lb/>
            he did swear on the last day of December on giving up his office, in a <lb/>
            letter to Q. Metellus Celer, the brother of Nepos (Ad Diversos, v. 2), <lb/>
            and in his oration against Piso, c. 3. Manutius (Comment. in Cic. Ep. <lb/>
            Ad Divers. v. 2) shows that Bestia was a tribune during Cicero's <lb/>
            consulship, and as he had gone out of office on the ninth of December <lb/>
            he could not have acted with Metellus on the thirty-first of December. </note><note type="footnote"> As to Metellus Nepos, see the Life of Cato, c. 2° </note></p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p>XXIV. Cicero, who had at that time the chief power in <lb/>
            the State, made himself generally odious, not by any ill <lb/>
            acts, but by always praising and glorifying himself to the <lb/>
            great annoyance of many people. For there was neither <lb/>
            assembly of Senate nor people nor court of justice in which <lb/>
            a man had not to hear Catilina talked of and Lentulus. <lb/>
            Finally, he filled his books and writings with his own. <lb/>
            praises, and though his oratory was most agreeable and <lb/>
            had the greatest charm, he made it wearisome and odious <lb/>
            to the hearers by his unseemly habit, which stuck to him <lb/>
            like a fatality. However, though he had such unmingled <lb/>
            ambition, he was far removed from envying others, for he <lb/>
            was most bountiful in his praises of those before him and <lb/>
            those of his own time, as we may see from his writings. <lb/>
            There are also many sayings of his recorded; for instance, <lb/>
            he said of Aristotle, that he was a river of flowing gold, <lb/>
            and of the dialogues of Plato, that Jupiter, if it were his <lb/>
            nature to use language, would speak like him. Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus he was used to call his own special luxury. <lb/>
            Being asked about the speeches of Demosthenes,* which he <lb/>
            thought the best, he answered, the longest. Yet some of <lb/>
            those who pretend to be imitators of Demosthenes, dwell <lb/>
            on an expression of Cicero, which is used in a letter to one <lb/>
            of his friends, that Demosthenes sometimes nodded in his <lb/>
            speeches; but the great and admirable praise which he <lb/>
            often bestows on the man, and that he entitled his own <lb/>
            orations on which he bestowed most labour, those against <lb/>
            Antonius, Philippics, they say nothing about. Of the men <lb/>
            of his own time who gained a reputation for eloquence and <lb/>
            learning, there is not one whose reputation he did not <lb/>
            increase either by speaking or writing in favourable terms <lb/>
            of him. When Cæsar was in power he obtained from him <lb/>
            the Roman citizenship for Kratippust the Peripatetic, and <note type="footnote"> * It is said that this does not occur in the extant letters of Cicero. </note><note type="footnote"> t In the beginning of his treatise De Officiis, which is addressed to <lb/>
            his son, then at Athens (B.C. 44), Cicero speaks of the youth having <lb/>
            then been a year under the instruction of Kratippus. Kratippus was <lb/>
            a native of Mitylene, and he was living there when Pompeius touched <lb/>
            at the island after the battle of Pharsalia (Life of Pompeius, c. 75). <lb/>
            Cicero's son was attached to his master, and in an extant letter to Tiro <lb/>
            (Cic. Ad Diversos, xvii. 21) he expresses his affection for him. Kratippus </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            he prevailed on the Areopagus to pass a vote and to <lb/>
            request him to stay in Athens and instruct the young, as <lb/>
            being an ornament to the city. There are letters from <lb/>
            Cicero to Herod es,* and others to his son, in which he <lb/>
            exhorts to the study of philosophy under Kratippus. He <lb/>
            charged Gorgias t the rhetorician with leading the young <lb/>
            man to pleasure and drinking, and banished him from his <lb/>
            society. This and a letter to Pelops of Byzantium are <lb/>
            almost the only Greek letters of his which are written <lb/>
            with any passion, in which he properly rebukes Gorgias, <lb/>
            if he was worthless and intemperate, as he was considered <lb/>
            to be; but his letter to Pelops is in a mean and complain­ <lb/>
            ing tone, and charges Pelops with having neglected to <lb/>
            procure for him certain honours and public testimonials <lb/>
            from the Byzantines.</p>
          <p>XXV. All this proceeded from his ambition, and also <lb/>
            the circumstance that he was often carried away by the <lb/>
            impetuosity of his oratory to disregard propriety. He once <lb/>
            spoke in favour of Munatius,t who after being acquitted <lb/>
            prosecuted Sabinus, a friend of Cicero, who is said to have <lb/>
            been so transported with passion as to say, “ Do you <lb/>
            suppose, Munatius, that you were acquitted on your trial <lb/>

            applause by a panegyric on Marcus Crassus from the <lb/>
            Rostra, and a few days after he abused him, on which <lb/>
            Crassus observed, “ Did you not lately praise me in the <lb/>
            same place ? " to which Cicero replied, “ Yes, for practice <lb/>
            sake, exercising my eloquence on a mean subject." Crassus <lb/>
            having remarked on one occasion that none of the Crassi <lb/>
            had lived in Rome to be more than sixty years of age, and <lb/>
            afterwards denying that he had said so, and observing, <lb/>
            What could have led him to say this ? Cicero replied, <lb/>
            “ You know that the Romans would be glad to hear it and <note type="footnote"> was more than a philosopher: he was a pleasant companion, and per­ <lb/>
            haps young Cicero liked his table-talk as much as his philosophy. </note><note type="footnote"> * He is mentioned by Cicero in his Letters to Atticus (xiv. 16, 18, <lb/>
            and xv. 16). </note><note type="footnote"> † Cicero, in the letter to Tiro (xvi. 21) above referred to, says that <lb/>
            Gorgias was useful to him in his declamatory exercises, but he had <lb/>

            so you wished to get their favour." When Crassus ob­ <lb/>
            served that he liked the Stoics, because they proved that <lb/>
            the good man was rich,. “ Consider," said Cicero, " if they <lb/>
            do not rather prove that the wise man possesses every­ <lb/>
            thing." Now Crassus was charged with being fond of <lb/>
            money. One of the sons of Crassus who was considered to <lb/>
            resemble a certain Anus, and so to attach ill fame to his <lb/>
            mother in respect to Axius, had made a speech in the <lb/>
            Senate with applause, and Cicero being asked what he <lb/>
            thought of him said, He is Axius Crassus.t</p>
          <p>XXVI. When Crassus t was about to set out for Syria, he <lb/>
            wished Cicero to be his friend rather than his enemy, and <lb/>
            lie said in a friendly manner that he wished to sup with <lb/>
            him, and Cicero received him readily. A few days after <lb/>
            when some of his friends spoke with him about Vatinius, <lb/>
            and said that Vatinius sought a recollection and to be on <lb/>
            good terms with him, for he was then at enmity with <lb/>
            Cicero. “ Surely," said Cicero, “ Vatinius too does not <lb/>
            want to sup with me." Such was his behaviour to <lb/>
            Crassus. As to Vatinius, who had tumours in his neck. <lb/>
            and was on one occasion pleading a cause, Cicero called <lb/>
            him a tumid orator. Hearing that Vatinius was dead, <lb/>
            and being shortly after certainly informed that he was <lb/>
            still living, “ Ill betide the man," said he, “ who lied so <lb/>
            ill." Many of the senators were dissatisfied with Cæsar's <lb/>
            carrying a measure for the distribution of the land in <lb/>
            Campania among the soldiers, and Lucius Gellius,§ who <lb/>
            was also one of the oldest of them, said, that it should <note type="footnote"> * Crassus could not well misunderstand the Stoical doctrine, but be <lb/>

            that' good " is the more comprehensive term : Crassus therefore was <lb/>
            not“ good," because he was “ rich." </note><note type="footnote"> t This is a frigid joke. Axius in Greek (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άξιος</foreign>) signifies “ worthy <lb/>

            if we take Axius as a Greek word. They can also mean, lie is " Axius <lb/>
            son of Crossus.” The wit lay in associating the name of Axius and <lb/>
            Crassus; but the joke is only made duller by the explanation. </note><note type="footnote"> A Roman Sinator named Axius is mentioned by Cicero (Ad Attic. <lb/>

            native of Libya, and on the occasion of a certain trial he <lb/>
            .mid that he could not hear Cicero. “ And yet," said Cicero, <lb/>
            “ your ear is not without a hole in it." Metellus N epos <lb/>
            observing that Cicero by giving testimony against persons <lb/>
            had caused more to be condemned than he had caused <lb/>
            to be acquitted by undertaking their cause, " Well," said <lb/>
            he, " I admit that I have more credit than eloquence." A <lb/>
            certain youth who was charged with giving poison to his <lb/>
            father in a cake, spoke with great confidence, and said <lb/>
            that he would abuse Cicero; “I would rather have this <lb/>
            from you," said Cicero, “ than a cake." Publius Sextius t <lb/>
            had Cicero with others as his advocate in a cause, but he <lb/>
            chose to say everything himself and would let nobody <lb/>
            else speak, and when it was plain that he would be <lb/>
            acquitted and the judices were giving their votes, Cicero <lb/>
            said, “ Make the most of your opportunity to-day, for <lb/>
            to-morrow you will be a mere nobody." One Publius <lb/>
            Consta,t who set up for a lawyer, but was an ignorant <lb/>
            and stupid fellow, was called as a witness by Cicero <lb/>
            on a trial. On Consta saying that he knew nothing, <lb/>
            “ Perhaps," said Cicero, “ you suppose that you are asked <lb/>
            about legal matters." Metellus Nepos during a dispute <note type="footnote">* It is uncertain who this man was. The allusion to the hole in his <lb/>
            ear signifies that his ears were bored to carry pendants or earrings <lb/>
            after the fashion of some nations at that time. Cicero meant to imply <lb/>
            that he was not of genuine Italian stock. Juvenal alludes to a man s <lb/>
            foreign origin being shown by his ears being bored, in the following <lb/>
            terms:— <lb/>
            “ quamvis <lb/>

            exerted himself to accomplish the recall of Cicero. There is extant an <lb/>

            was tried in the year after Cicero's return on a charge of raising a <lb/>
            tumult (de vi) at the popular meeting in which Cicero's recall was <lb/>
            proposed. Cicero speaks of the acquittal of Publius in a letter to his <lb/>

            which Cicero said, “ As for yourself, your mother has <lb/>
            made this answer rather difficult for you." Now the <lb/>
            mother of Nepos was considered to be an unchaste <lb/>
            woman, and himself a fickle kind of man. On one <lb/>
            occasion he suddenly deserted his office of tribune and <lb/>
            sailed off to join Pompeius * in Syria, whence he returned <lb/>
            with just as little reason. Nepos had buried his teacher <lb/>
            Philagrus with more than usual respect, and set upon <lb/>
            his tomb a raven of stone: "In this, said Cicero, “you <lb/>
            have acted wiser than your wont, for he taught you to <lb/>
            fly rather than to speak." Marcus Appius in a certain <lb/>
            trial prefaced his speech with saying that his friend had <lb/>
            prayed him to exhibit vigilance and judgment and <lb/>
            fidelity: “Are you then," said Cicero, "so iron-hearted <lb/>
            as to exhibit not one of such great qualities as your friend <lb/>
            prayed you to do ? "</p>
          <p>XXVII. Now the use of bitterish taunts against enemies <lb/>
            or opposing advocates may be considered as belonging to <lb/>
            the orator's business; but the attacking of any persons <lb/>
            whom he fell in with, for the purpose of making them <lb/>
            ridiculous, brought great odium upon him. I will record <lb/>
            a few instances of this also. He called Marcus Aquinius,t <lb/>
            Adrastus,‡ because he had two sons-in-law who were in <lb/>
            exile. Lucius Cotta,§ who held the office of censor, was <lb/>
            very fond of wine, and it happened that Cicero during <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cato, o. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> t Kaltwasser conjectures that the name should be Manias Aquiliua, <lb/>
            who acted as Proconsul in the Servile war in Sicily B.C. 100. In B.C. <lb/>
            88 he conducted the war against Mithridates in Asia. He fell into the <lb/>
            hands of Mithridates, who put him to death. </note><note type="footnote"> But this cannot be the person meant by Plutarch, who evidently <lb/>
            means a person who may be called a contemporary of Cicero. A <lb/>

            proposed the Lex Aurelia, which determined that the judices for <lb/>
            public trials should be chosen from the Senators, Equites and Tribuni <lb/>
            Ærarii. Notwithstanding this joke, Cotta was a friend of Cicero, <lb/>

            his canvass for the consulship was athirst, and as his <lb/>
            friends stood around him while he was drinking, “You <lb/>
            have good reason to be afraid," said he, “ lest the censor <lb/>
            should deal harshly with me for drinking water." Meet­ <lb/>

            daughters, he said aloud: <lb/>
            “'Gainst Phoebus' will his children he begat." <lb/>
            Marcus Gellius,t who was supposed not to be the son of <lb/>
            free parents, was once reading some letters to the Senate <lb/>
            with a clear and loud voice, when Cicero said, “ Don't be <lb/>
            surprised; he too is one of those who have practised their <lb/>
            voices.” When Faustus,‡ the son of Sulla who had been <lb/>
            dictator in Rome and proscribed many to the death, <lb/>
            having got into debt and squandered most of his substance, <lb/>
            advertised his household stuff for sale, Cicero said that he <lb/>
            liked this proscription better than his father's.</p>
          <p>XXVIII.§ He thus became odious to many, and the par­ <lb/>
            tizans of Clodius combined against him on the following <lb/>
            occasion. Clodius was a man of noble birth, young in <lb/>
            years, but bold and impudent in his designs. Being in love <lb/>
            with Pompeia, Cæsar's wife, he got into his house secretly <lb/>
            by assuming the dress and the guise of a lute-player; for <lb/>
            the women were celebrating in Caesar's house those <lb/>
            mysterious rites which the men were not allowed to see ; <lb/>
            and as there was no man there, Clodius being still a youth <lb/>
            and not yet bearded hoped to slip through to Pompeia <lb/>
            with the women. But as it was night when he got into <lb/>
            a large house, he was perplexed by the passages; and as <note type="footnote"> * It is uncertain who this Voconius was. The verse, which is <lb/>
            apparently from some Greek tragedian, is conjectured to allude to <lb/>
            Laius, who begat Œdipus contrary to the advice of the oracle of <lb/>

            he was rambling about a female slave of Aurelia, Cæsar's <lb/>
            mother, saw him and asked him his name. Being <lb/>
            compelled to speak, he said that he was looking for a <lb/>
            servant of Pompeia, named Abra, but the woman perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing that it was not a female voice cried out and called <lb/>
            the women together. They shut the doors and searching <lb/>
            every place found Clodius, who had hid himself in the <lb/>
            chamber of the girl with whom he came into the house. <lb/>
            The affair being noised abroad Cæsar put away Pompeia, <lb/>
            and a prosecution - for an offence against religion was <lb/>
            instituted against Clodius.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Now Cicero was a friend of Clodius, and in the <lb/>
            affair of Catilina found him a most zealous assistant and <lb/>
            guardian of his person; but as Clodius in answer to the <lb/>
            charge relied on not having been in Rome at the time, <lb/>
            and maintained that he was staying in places at a very <lb/>
            great distance, Cicero bore testimony that Clodius had <lb/>
            come to his house t and spoken with him on certain <lb/>
            matters; which was true. However people did not <lb/>
            suppose that Cicero gave his testimony from regard to <lb/>
            truth, but by way of justifying himself to his wife <lb/>
            Terentia.‡ For Terentia had a grudge against Clodius on <lb/>
            account of his sister Clodia, who was supposed to wish to <lb/>
            marry Cicero, and to be contriving this by the aid of one <lb/>
            Tullus, who was one of the nearest companions and <lb/>
            intimates of Cicero, and as Tullus was going to Clodia, <lb/>
            who lived near, and paying attention to her, he excited <note type="footnote"> * There is something wanting in the Greek text; but the meaning <lb/>
            is not obscure. See the note of Sintenis. </note><note type="footnote"> t Of course on the day on which Clodius pretended that he was not <lb/>
            at Rome. Kaltwasser has inserted the words “ on that day;” but they <lb/>
            are not in the original. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ So it is in the MSS., though it should probably be Tertia. A <lb/>
            confusion may easily have arisen between the Dame Terentia, which <lb/>
            has already been mentioned in this chapter, and the name Tertia <lb/>
            (third), though the wife of Q. Marcius Rex is said to have been the <lb/>
            oldest of the three sisters. Quadranteria is a misprint for Quadran­ <lb/>
            taria. This lady was the wife of Q. Metellus Oeler, and was suspected <lb/>
            of poisoning him. Cicero vents unbounded abuse upon her; and he <lb/>
            also preserved the name Quadrantaria (Or. Pro Cælio, c. 26). The <lb/>
            Roman word Quadrans, a fourth, signified a fourth part of a Roman as, <lb/>
            and was a small copper coin. The way in which one of her lovers is <lb/>
            reported to have paid her in copper coin seems to have circulated in <lb/>
            Rome as a good practical joke. </note> <lb/>

            suspicion in Terentia. Now as Terentia was of a sour <lb/>
            temper and governed Cicero, she urged him to join in <lb/>
            the attack on Clodius and to give testimony against him. <lb/>
            Many men also of the highest character charged Clodius <lb/>
            by their testimony with perjury, disorderly conduct, <lb/>
            bribing of the masses, and debauching of women. Lucul­ <lb/>
            lus also produced female slaves to testify that Clodius <lb/>
            had sexual commerce with his youngest sister when she <lb/>
            was the wife of Lucullus. There was also a general <lb/>
            opinion that Clodius debauched his other two sisters, of <lb/>
            whom Marcius Rex had Torentia and Metellus Celer <lb/>
            had Clodia to wife, who was called Quadrantaria, because <lb/>
            one of her lovers put copper coins for her in a purse pre­ <lb/>
            tending they were silver and sent them to her; now the <lb/>
            smallest copper coin the Romans called Quadrans. It <lb/>
            was with regard to this sister that Clodius was most <lb/>
            suspected. However as the people on that occasion set <lb/>
            themselves against those who bore testimony and com­ <lb/>
            bined against Clodius, the judices being afraid procured <lb/>
            a guard for their protection, and most of them gave in <lb/>
            their tablets with the writing on them confused.- It <lb/>
            turned out that those who were for acquitting him were <lb/>
            the majority, and some bribery was also said to have been <lb/>
            used. This led Catulus to say when he met the judices, <lb/>
            “ Indeed you did ask for a guard to protect you, for you <lb/>
            were afraid that some one should take your money from <lb/>
            you." Upon Clodius saying to Cicero that his evidence <lb/>
            had no credit with the judices, Cicero replied, " However, <lb/>
            five-and-twenty t of the judices gave me credit, for so <lb/>
            many of them voted against you; but thirty of them <lb/>
            gave you no credit, for they did not vote for your acquittal <lb/>
            till they had received their money." Cæsar, however, <lb/>
            when called, gave no evidence against Clodius, and he <lb/>
            denied that ho had convicted his wife of adultery, but <lb/>
            that he had put her away, because Cæsar's wife ought <lb/>
            not only to be free from a shameful act, but even the <lb/>
            report of it. <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of CaiM, c. 10, and the notes. </note><note type="footnote"> † The number twenty-five agrees with the common text in Cicero'a <lb/>

            Gabinius, and he contrived to associate many of the poor <lb/>
            citizens in his designs and kept armed slaves about him. <lb/>
            Of the three men who then had the chief power, <lb/>
            Crassus was openly at enmity with Cicero, and Pompeius <lb/>
            was playing an affected part towards both; and as Caesar <lb/>
            was about to march into Gaul t with his army, Cicero pay­ <lb/>
            ing court to him, though he was not his friend, but an <lb/>
            object of suspicion owing to the affair of Catilina, asked to <lb/>
            accompany him as a legatus. Cæsar accepted the proposal, <lb/>
            but Clodius, seeing that Cicero was escaping from his <lb/>
            tribunitian power, pretended to be disposed to come to <lb/>
            terms with him, and by laying most blame on Terentia, <lb/>
            and always speaking of Cicero in moderate terms and <lb/>
            using words which imported a favourable disposition, as a <lb/>
            man who had no hatred or ill feeling towards him, but <lb/>
            had certain reasonable grounds of complaint to be urged <lb/>
            in a friendly way, he completely stopped Cicero's fears, so <lb/>
            that he declined a legation under Cæsar and again applied <lb/>
            himself to public affairs. At which Cæsar, being irritated, <lb/>
            encouraged Clodius against Cicero, and completely <lb/>
            alienated Pompeius from him, and he himself declared <lb/>
            before the people that he did not consider it right or law­ <lb/>
            ful for men to be put to death without trial, like Lentulus <lb/>
            and Cethegus. For this was the charge, and to this <lb/>
            Cicero was called to answer. Being therefore in danger <lb/>
            and under prosecution he changed his dress and with his <lb/>
            hair unshorn went about supplicating the people. But <lb/>
            Clodius met him everywhere in the streets with violent <note type="footnote">* Clodius was tribunus plebis in B.O. 58. The consuls of the year <lb/>
            were L. Calpurnius Piso, the father of Calpurnia, Cæsar's wife, and <lb/>
            Aulus Gabinius, a tool of Pompeius. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dion Cassius (38, o. 15) says that Cæsar proposed to Cicero to go <lb/>
            to Gaul with him; and Cicero, in a letter to Attius (i. 19), speaks of <lb/>
            Cæsar's proposal to him to go as his legatus. It is difficult to imagine <lb/>
            that Cesar made such a proposal, or at least that he seriously intended <lb/>
            to take Cicero with him. He would have been merely an incumbrance.</note> <lb/>

            and audacious men about him, who, with many insolent <lb/>
            jeers at Cicero's reverse and attire, and after pelting <lb/>
            him with mud and stones, hindered his suppliant <lb/>
            applications.</p>
          <p>XXXI. However at first nearly all the body of equites <lb/>
            changed their dress when Cicero did, and not less than <lb/>
            twenty thousand young men accompanied him with their <lb/>
            hair uncut and joined in his suppliant entreaties. When <lb/>
            the Senate had met in order to pass a vote that the people <lb/>
            should change their dress as a public calamity,. and the <lb/>
            consuls opposed it, and Clodius was in arms about the <lb/>
            Senate-house, no small number of the senators ran out <lb/>
            tearing their clothes and calling aloud. But as this sight <lb/>
            neither procured respect nor pity, and Cicero must either <lb/>
            go into exile or try force and the sword against Clodius, <lb/>
            he entreated Pompeius to aid him, who had purposely gone <lb/>
            out of the way and was staying on his estate at the Alban <lb/>
            hills. And first he sent his son-in-law Pisof to entreat for <lb/>
            him, and then he went himself. Pompeius hearing of his <lb/>
            coming did not wait to see him, for he had a strong feeling <lb/>
            of shame towards a man who had made great efforts on <lb/>
            his behalf, and had carried many public measures to please <lb/>
            him, but as he was Cassar's son-in-law, he gave up old <lb/>
            obligations at his request, and slipping out by a different <lb/>
            door evaded meeting with Cicero. Cicero being thus <lb/>
            betrayed by him and left deserted, fled for refuge to the <lb/>
            consuls. Gabinius still maintained his hostility, but <lb/>
            Piso spoke ‡ more kindly, and advised him to go out of the <lb/>
            way and to yield to the impetuosity of Clodius and to <lb/>
            submit to the change in circumstances, and again to be <lb/>
            the saviour of his country, which was involved in civil <lb/>
            commotion and misfortune through Clodius. Having got <note type="footnote"> * Read “ as in a public calamity." Cicero speaks of this affair in his <lb/>
            oration for Cn. Plancius, o. 35; in the latter part of which oration he <lb/>

            this answer Cicero consulted with his friends, of whom <lb/>
            Lucullus advised him to stay and said that he would gain <lb/>
            the superiority; but others advised him to fly, inasmuch <lb/>
            as the people would soon long for him when they were <lb/>
            satiated with the madness and desperation of Clodius. <lb/>
            This was Cicero'a own judgment; and he carried to the <lb/>
            Capitol the statue of Athene,* which for a long time had <lb/>
            stood in his house, and to which he paid especial honour, <lb/>
            and dedicated it with the inscription, “ To Athene the <lb/>
            guardian of Rome; " and receiving from his friends persons <lb/>
            to conduct him safely, he left the city about midnight <lb/>
            and went by land through Lucania, designing to stay-in <lb/>
            Sicily.</p>
          <p>XXXII. When it was known that he had fled, Clodius <lb/>
            put to the vote the question of his banishment, and issued <lb/>
            an edict to exclude him from fire and water, and that no <lb/>
            one should furnish him with a shelter within five hundred <lb/>
            miles t of Italy. Now others paid not the slightest regard <lb/>
            to the edict, for they respected Cicero, and showed him all <lb/>
            manner of kindness and set him on his way: but in <lb/>

            from Cicero's friendship and had been præfect of the <lb/>
            Fabri during his consulship, would not receive Cicero in <lb/>
            his house, but sent him word that he would assign him a <lb/>
            spot of ground ; and Caius Vergilius,§ the prætor of Sicily, <lb/>
            who had been most intimate with Cicero, wrote to tell <note type="footnote"> * Compare Cicero Do Legibus, iL 17, ed. Bakius; and Ad Attic. <lb/>

            set out for Brundusium, and thence attempted to pass over <lb/>

            against him when he was out at sea, he came back the <lb/>
            day after, and again set sail. It is said that when he had <lb/>
            reached Dyrrachium and was going to land, there was a <lb/>
            shaking of the earth and a violent motion in the sea at <lb/>
            the same time; from which the diviners prognosticated <lb/>
            that his flight would not be lasting, for these were signs <lb/>
            of change. And though many men visited him from good <lb/>
            will and the Greek cities vied in sending deputations to <lb/>
            him, yet he passed his time in despondencyt and exceeding <lb/>
            grief, for the most part looking to Italy, like those who <lb/>
            are desperately in love, and in his bearing became very <lb/>
            mean and humbled by reason of his calamity, and so <lb/>
            downcast as no one would have expected from a man who <lb/>
            had spent his life in such philosophical pursuits. And <lb/>
            yet he often asked his friends to call him not an orator, but <lb/>
            a philosopher, ‡ for he said that he had chosen philosophy <lb/>
            as his occupation, but that he employed oratory as an <lb/>
            instrument for his purposes in his public life. But opinion <lb/>

            capacity of quæstor to L. Apuleius, Prætor of Macedonia. He reached <lb/>
            Thessalonica on the 23rd of May (x. Kal. Jun.), and there is a letter <lb/>
            extant addressed to Atticus (ii. 8), which is dated from Thessalouica <lb/>

            bids us “ Look within; for within is the source of good, and it sends <lb/>
            up a continuous stream to those who will always dig there " (vii. 59). <lb/>
            Cicero did not reverence his own soul, but he placed his happiness “ in <lb/>
            the opinion of others" (i. 6). Perhaps however he was not weaker <lb/>

          <p>XXXIII. Clodius, after driving out Cicero, burnt his <lb/>
            villas, and burnt his house, and built on the ground a <lb/>
            temple to Liberty : the rest of Cicero's property. he offered <lb/>
            for sale, and announced it daily, but nobody would buy. <lb/>
            In consequence of these measures being formidable to the <lb/>
            aristocratical party, and dragging along with him the <lb/>
            people, who were let loose to great violence and daring, he <lb/>
            made an attack on Pompeius, ripping up some of the <lb/>
            things that were settled by him in his military command. <lb/>
            By which Pompeius losing some of his reputation blamed <lb/>
            himself for giving up Cicero ; and changing again he used <lb/>
            every effort in conjunction with Cicero s friends to effect <lb/>
            his return. As Clodius resisted this, the Senate resolved <lb/>
            to ratify nothing in the mean time and to do no public <lb/>
            business, unless Cicero was restored. When Lentulus† was <note type="footnote"> not the soul, but they are out of it, and passive; perturbations come <lb/>

            statesman showed his feebleness by his arrogance in prosperity and his <lb/>
            abjectness in adversity. </note><note type="footnote"> * These proceedings are described by Cicero in his oration (Pro <lb/>
            Domo, c. 24). The marble columns were removed from his house on <lb/>
            the Palatine to the premises of the father-in-Jaw of the consul Piso, <lb/>
            in the presence of the people. Gabinius, the other consul, who was <lb/>
            Cicero's neighbour at Tusculum, removed to his own land the stock <lb/>
            that was on Cicero's estate and the ornaments of the house, and even <lb/>
            the trees. </note><note type="footnote"> t In B.O. 57, P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and Q. Cæcilius <lb/>
            Metellus Nepos were consuls. Cicero alludes to the di turbance which <lb/>
            preceded his recall in his oration for P. Sextius, c. 35: “Caedem in <lb/>
            foro maximam faciunt, universique destrictis glad its et cruentis in <lb/>
            omnibus fori partibus fratrem menm, virum optimum, fortissimum, <lb/>
            meique amantissimum oculis quaerebant, voce poscebant." Cicero adds <lb/>
            that his brother being driven from the Rostra lay down in the Comitium, <lb/>
            and protected himself “ with the bodies of slaves and freedmen;” by <lb/>
            which Cicero seems to mean that his slaves and freedmen kept watch <lb/>
            over him till he made his escape at night. Plutarch appears to have <lb/>
            misunderstood the passage or to have had some other authority. In <lb/>
            this dreadful tumult “ the Tiber was filled with the dead bodies of the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            consul, and the disorder went on increasing so that tribunes <lb/>
            were wounded in the Forum, and Quintus the brother of <lb/>
            Cicero only escaped by lying among the bodies as if he <lb/>
            were dead, the people began to undergo a change of opinion, <lb/>
            and one of the tribunes, Annius Milo, was the first to <lb/>
            venture to bring Clodius to trial for violence, and many <lb/>
            sided with Pompeius both from among the people and the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities. Coming forward with them and <lb/>
            driving Clodius from the Forum, he called the citizens to <lb/>
            the vote: and it is said that the people never confirmed <lb/>
            any measure with so much unanimity. The Senate vying <lb/>
            with the people passed a decree in honour of those cities <lb/>
            which had served Cicero in his exile, and for the restora­ <lb/>
            tion * at the public expense of his house and villas, which <lb/>
            Clodius had destroyed. Cicero was restored in the <lb/>
            sixteenth month t after his exile, and so great was the joy <lb/>
            of the cities and the zeal of all men to meet him, that <lb/>
            what was afterwards said by Cicero fell short of the truth : <lb/>
            for he said that Italy bore him on her shoulders and carried <lb/>
            him into Rome. On which occasion Crassus also, who was <lb/>
            his enemy before his exile, readily met him, and was re­ <lb/>
            conciled to him, to please his son Publius, as he said, who <lb/>
            was an admirer of Cicero,</p>
          <p>XXXIV. After the lapse of no long time, watching the <lb/>
            opportunity when Clodius was away, Cicero went with a <lb/>
            number of persons to the Capitol and pulled down and <lb/>
            broke the tribunitian tablets if which contained the records <lb/>
            of the administration. When Clodius made this a charge <lb/>
            against him, Cicero said that Clodius had illegally passed <note type="footnote"> citizens, the drains were choaked, and the blood was wiped up from <lb/>
            the Forum with sponges." This looks somewhat like rhetorical <lb/>
            embellishment. </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero in a letter to Atticus (iv. 2) gives an account of the com­ <lb/>
            pensation which he received. The valuation of his house at Rome <lb/>
            (superficies aedium) was fixed at HS. vicies, or two million sesterces. <lb/>
            lie seems not to have objected to this, but he complains of the valua­ <lb/>

            suis humeris reportarit." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See the Life of Cato, c. 40, and Dion Cassius, 39, o. 21. </note> <lb/>

            from the patrician body to the tribunate, and that none of <lb/>
            his acts were valid, at which Cato took offence and spoke <lb/>
            against him, not indeed in commendation of Clodius, but <lb/>
            expressing his mortification at his measures; however he <lb/>
            showed that it was an unusual and violent measure for the <lb/>
            Senate to vote for the rescinding of so many decrees and <lb/>
            acts, among which was his own administration at Cyprus <lb/>
            and Byzantium. This led to a collision between him and <lb/>
            Cicero, which did not proceed to anything open, but the <lb/>
            consequence was that their friendly disposition to one <lb/>
            another was weakened.</p>
          <p>XXXV. After this Clodius * was killed by Milo, who <lb/>
            being prosecuted for murder got Cicero for his advocate. <lb/>
            But the Senate, being afraid lest there should be some <lb/>
            disturbance in the city on the trial of Milo, who was a <lb/>
            man of high repute and bold spirit, intrusted to Pompeius <lb/>
            the superintendence of this and other trials, and com­ <lb/>
            missioned him to provide for the security of the city and <lb/>
            of the courts of justice. Pompeius in the night surrounded <lb/>
            the Forum with soldiers on the heights, and Milo, fearing <lb/>
            that Cicero might be disturbed at the unusual sight and <lb/>
            manage his case worse, persuaded him to be carried in a <lb/>
            litter to the Forum and to rest there till the judices met <lb/>
            and the court was formed. But Cicero, as it appears, was <lb/>
            not only without courage in arms, but was timid even <lb/>
            when he commenced speaking, and hardly ceased shaking <lb/>
            and trembling in many trials till his eloquence had reached <lb/>
            its height and attained steadiness. When he was the <lb/>
            advocate of Murena, on his prosecution by Cato, he was <lb/>
            ambitious to surpass Ilortensius, who spoke with great <lb/>
            applause, and he took no rest the night before, in <lb/>
            consequence of which exceeding anxiety and wakefulness, <lb/>
            his powers were impaired and he was considered to have <lb/>
            fallen short of his fame. On this occasion when he came <note type="footnote"> * Clodius was killed B.C. 52, the year in which Pompeius was chosen <lb/>
            sole consul. Cicero's speech for Milo is extant, or at least a speech <lb/>
            which he wrote after the trial. Milo was condemned and went an <lb/>
            exile to Massilia. His property was sold and it went cheap. Cicero <lb/>
            was under some suspicion of being a purchaser; but the matter is <lb/>
            quite unintelligible (Drumann, Annii, p. 49, and the references). There <lb/>
            could be no reason why Cicero should write in such obscure terms to <lb/>
            Atticus, if his conduct in this matter was fair. </note> <lb/>

            out of the litter to the trial of Milo and saw Pompeius <lb/>
            seated on an elevated place as in a camp and arms flashing <lb/>
            all around the Forum, he was confounded and scarcely <lb/>
            commenced his speech for trembling and hesitation, <lb/>
            though Milo himself bravely and courageously assisted at <lb/>
            the trial and would not deign to let his hair grow or to <lb/>
            change his dress for a dark one, which seems in no small <lb/>
            degree to have contributed to his condemnation. But <lb/>
            Cicero in all this was considered rather to have shown <lb/>
            his attachment to his friend than any cowardice.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Cicero became also one of the priests, whom <lb/>
            the Romans called Augurs,* in place of the younger <lb/>
            Crassus after his death among the Parthians. The <lb/>
            province of Cilicia t being allotted to him and an army of <lb/>
            twelve thousand legionary soldiers and two thousand six <lb/>
            hundred horse, he set sail with instructions to keep <lb/>
            Cappadocia friendly and obedient to Ariobarzanes.t He <lb/>
            accomplished this, and arranged it without any blame and <note type="footnote"> * Crasdus perished B.C. 54. See the Life of Crassus. </note><note type="footnote"> t His province also comprehended Pisidia, Pamphylia, and Cyprus. <lb/>
            The preconsulship of Cicero was in B.C. 51, though he had been consul <lb/>
            in B.C. 63. Cicero went to Cilicia against his will (Ad Diversos, iii. 2). <lb/>
            Pompeius had got the Senate (B.O. 52) to pass an order that no person <lb/>
            should hold a province within five years after being consul or prætor. <lb/>
            This was aimed at Cæsar, if he should get a second consulship. Pom­ <lb/>
            peius also wished to have Cicero out of the way, and the provinces were <lb/>
            to be supplied with governors from among those who did not come <lb/>
            within the terms of the new rule: and Cicero was one of them (Cicero, <lb/>
            Ad Diversos, ii. 2; Ad Attic, vi. 6). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ He was the third Cappadocian king of this name. This unlucky <lb/>
            king was a debtor of Cn. Pomppius and AT. Junius Brutus, the most <lb/>
            distinguished Roman money-lender of his day (Cicero, Ad Attic. vi. <lb/>
            1-3). Both Pompeius and Brutus were pressing the king for money. <lb/>
            Deiotarus also sent to Ariobarzanes to try to get some money out of <lb/>
            him for Brutus. The king's answer was that he had none, and Cicero <lb/>
            says that he beHoved he told the truth, for that no country was in a <lb/>
            more impoverished state and nobody more beggared than the king. <lb/>
            Cicero dunned the king continually with letters, but he was not par­ <lb/>
            ticularly well pleased with his commission (Ad Attic. vi. 2). The end <lb/>
            was that the king provided for the payment of about one hundred <lb/>
            talents to Brutus during Cicero's year of government. He had <lb/>
            promised Pompeius two hundred in six months, which, as a judicious <lb/>
            commentator remarks, is not worth so much as a security for one <lb/>
            hundred. These money doings of the supposed patriot Brutus should <lb/>
            be well examined by those who still retain an opinion of the virtues of <lb/>
            this Republican hero. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            without war; and as he observed that the Cilicians were <lb/>
            inclined to a rising on occasion of the defeat of the Romans <lb/>
            by the Parthians and the movements in Syria, he pacified <lb/>
            them by a mild administration. Nor would he receive <lb/>
            any presents when the kings offered them, and he relieved <lb/>
            the provincials from giving entertainments: and he <lb/>
            himself daily received those who were agreeable to him at <lb/>
            banquets, not in a costly way, but liberally. And there <lb/>
            was no doorkeeper to his house, nor was he ever seen by <lb/>
            any one lying down, but in the morning he would be <lb/>
            standing or walking about in front of his chamber, where <lb/>
            he received those who paid their respects * to him. It is <lb/>
            said that he neither punished any one with rods nor <lb/>
            allowed any man's garment to be rent, nor vented abuse <lb/>
            in passion, nor inflicted any penalty accompanied with <lb/>
            contumelious treatment. By discovering that much of <lb/>
            the public property was embezzled he enriched the cities, <lb/>
            and he maintained in their civil rights those who made <lb/>
            restoration, without letting them suffer anything <lb/>
            further. He engaged also in a war in which he defeated <lb/>
            the robbers of Mount Amanus, for which he was saluted <lb/>
            by his soldiers with the title of Imperator.† When <lb/>
            Cæcilius t the orator requested Cicero to send him panthers <lb/>
            from Cilicia to Rome for a certain spectacle, Cicero, who was <lb/>
            proud of his exploits, wrote in reply that there were no <lb/>
            panthers in Cilicia, for they had fled into Caria, indignant <note type="footnote"> * There seems no reason to doubt that Cicero's administration of his <lb/>
            province was just and mild. Plutarch has apparently derived some of <lb/>
            the facts here mentioned from Cicero himself (Ad Attic, vi. 2): “ Aditus <lb/>
            autem ad me minime provinciales; nihil per cubicularium: ante lueem <lb/>
            inambulabam domi, ut olim candidatus." </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero's exploits were such as would not have been recorded, if be <lb/>
            bad not been his own historian. In a letter to Cato (Ad Diversos, xv. <lb/>
            4), he gives a pretty full account of his operations ; and he asks Cato <lb/>
            to use his influence to get him the honour of a Supplicatio or Public <lb/>
            Thanksgiving. Cato's short reply, which he says is longer than his <lb/>
            letters usually are, is a model in its way. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ So it is in Plutarch's text: it may be the blunder of Plutarch, or <lb/>
            the blunder of his copyists. The true name is M. Cælius (Cic. Ad <lb/>
            Diversos, ii. 11), who was curule ædile B.C. 51. The saying about the <lb/>
            panthers is in this letter of Cicero, who had set the panther-hunters to <lb/>
            work. </note><note type="footnote"> Cicero returned to Rome in B.O. 50. He mentions (Ad Attic. vi 7) <lb/>
            his intention to cull at Rhodes, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            that they were the only things warred upon, while all others <lb/>
            were enjoying peace. On his voyage back from his province <lb/>
            he first put in at Rhodes, and next tarried at Athens with <lb/>
            gladness out of the pleasant recollection of his former <lb/>
            residence. After associating with men the first for <lb/>
            wisdom, and visiting his old friends and intimates and re­ <lb/>
            ceiving due honours from Greece, he returned to Rome at <lb/>
            a time when affairs, as if from violent inflammation, were <lb/>
            bursting out into the Civil War.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. In the Senate, when they were proposing to <lb/>
            vote him a triumph, he said that he would more gladly <lb/>
            follow Cæsar in his triumph, if a settlement could be <lb/>
            effected; and he privately gave much advice by writing <lb/>
            to Cæsar, and much by entreating Pompeius, and <lb/>
            attempting to mollify and pacify both of them. But when <lb/>
            things were past remedy, and Cæsar was advancing, and <lb/>
            Pompeius did not stay, but quitted the city with many <lb/>
            men of character, Cicero did not join in this flight, and it <lb/>
            was supposed that he was attaching himself to Cæsar. And <lb/>
            it is plain that in his resolves he was much perplexed both <lb/>
            ways and suffered much ; for he says in his letters * that <lb/>
            he did not know which way to turn himself, and that <lb/>
            Pompeius had an honourable and good cause to fight for, <lb/>
            but that Cæsar managed things better and was better able <lb/>
            to save himself and the citizens, so that he knew whom to <lb/>
            fly from, but not whom to fly to. Trebatius, one of Cæsar's <lb/>
            friends, wrote to the purport, that Cæsar thought that <lb/>
            before all things Cicero ought to put himself on Caesar's <note type="footnote"> * The events of this chapter, which belong to B.C. 49, are told at <lb/>
            length in the Lives of Pompeius and Cæsar. Cicero's irresolution is <lb/>
            well marked in his own letters; in one of which (Ad Attic, viii. 7, <lb/>
            referred to by Kaltwasser) he says:—“ Ego quern fugiam habeo, quern <lb/>
            sequar non habeo.” </note><note type="footnote"> There are no letters extant of Trebatius to the purport which <lb/>
            Plutarch states, but Cæsar wrote to Cicero and begged him to stay at <lb/>
            Rome. Cicero (Ad Attic. ix. 16) has given a copy of Cæsar's letter; <lb/>
            and a copy of another letter from Cæsar (Ad Attic. x. 8), in which he <lb/>
            urges Cicero to keep quiet. There seems to be no doubt that <lb/>
            Trebatius had been employed by Cæsar to write to Cicero and speak <lb/>
            to him about remaining neutral at least. Cicero had an interview with <lb/>
            Cæsar at Formiæ, after Cæsar's return from Brundusium (Ad <lb/>
            Atticum, ix. 18, 19; Ad Diversos, iv. 1). The letter last referred to is <lb/>
            addressed to Servius Sulpicius. </note> <lb/>

            side and to share his hopes, but if he declined by reason of <lb/>
            his age, he advised him to go to Greece and there to seat <lb/>
            himself quietly out of the way of both ; but Cicero, being <lb/>
            surprised that Cæsar himself did not write, replied in <lb/>
            passion that he would do nothing unworthy of his political <lb/>
            life. What appears in his letters is to this effect.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. When Cæsar had set out to Iberia, Cicero <lb/>
            immediately sailed to Pompeius. The rest were well <lb/>
            pleased that he was come, but Cato on seeing him rated <lb/>
            him in private greatly for joining Pompeius: he said it <lb/>
            was not seemly in himself to desert that line of policy <lb/>
            which he had chosen from the first; but that Cicero, though <lb/>
            he could do more good to his country and his friends if <lb/>
            he remained at Rome an indifferent spectator and shaped <lb/>
            his conduct by the result, without any reason or necessity <lb/>
            had become an enemy of Cæsar and had come there to <lb/>
            share in great danger. These words disturbed the resolve <lb/>
            of Cicero, and also that Pompeius did not employ him in <lb/>
            anything of weight. But he was the cause of this him­ <lb/>
            self, inasmuch as he made no secret of repenting of what <lb/>
            he had done, and depreciated the resources of Pompeius, <lb/>
            and privately showed his dissatisfaction at his plans, and <lb/>
            abstained not from scoffing and saying any sharp thing <lb/>
            of the allies, though he himself always went about in the <lb/>
            camp without a smile and with sorrowful countenance; <lb/>
            but he gave cause of laughter to others who had no occa­ <lb/>
            sion for it. It is better to mention a few of these things. <lb/>
            Domitius. was placing in a post of command a man of no <lb/>
            warlike turn, and said, How modest he is in his manner <lb/>
            and how prudent; “ Why then," said Cicero, "do you <lb/>
            not keep him to take care of your children?" When <lb/>
            some were commending Theophanes t the Lesbian, who <lb/>
            was a Præfectus of Fabri in the camp, for his excellent <lb/>
            consolation of the Rhodians on the loss of their fleet, <lb/>
            “ What a huge blessing it is," he said, “ to have a Greek <lb/>
            Præfect!” When Cæsar was successful in most things <lb/>
            and in a manner was blockading them, he replied to the <lb/>
            remark of Lentulus that he heard that Cæsar's friends <lb/>
            were dispirited, “ You mean to say that they are ill­ <note type="footnote"> * L. Domitius Ahenobarbus. See the I iCe of Cæsar, c. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Pompeius, c. 37, notes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            disposed * to Caesar ?” One Marcius, who had just arrived <lb/>
            from Rome, said that a report prevailed in Rome that <lb/>
            Pompeius was blockaded. “ I suppose you sailed hither <lb/>
            then," said Cicero, “ that you might see it with your own <lb/>
            eyes and believe." After the defeat Nonnius observed <lb/>
            that they ought to have good hopes, for that seven eagles <lb/>
            were left in the camp of Pompeius, “ Your advice would <lb/>
            be good," said Cicero, “ if we were fighting with jack­ <lb/>
            daws." When Labienus was relying on certain oracular <lb/>
            answers, and saying that Pompeius must get the victory, <lb/>
            " Yes," said Cicero, “ it is by availing ourselves of such <lb/>
            generalship as this that we have lost the camp."</p>
          <p>XXXIX. After the battle at Pharsalus, in which he <lb/>
            was not present by reason of illness, and when Pompeius <lb/>
            had fled, Cato, who had a large army at Dyrrachium and <lb/>
            a great fleet, asked Cicero to take the command according <lb/>
            to custom, and as he had the superior dignity of the <lb/>
            consulship. But as Cicero rejected the command and al­ <lb/>
            together was averse to joining the armament, he narrowly <lb/>
            escaped being killed, for the young Pompeius and his <lb/>
            friends called him a traitor and drew their swords, but <lb/>
            Cato stood in the gap and with difficulty rescued Cicero <lb/>
            and let him go from the army. Having put in at Brun­ <lb/>
            dusium he stayed there waiting for Cæsar, who was <lb/>
            delayed by affairs in Asia and in Egypt. But when <lb/>
            news came that Cæsar was landed at Tarentum t and was <lb/>
            coming round by land to Brundusium, Cicero went to <lb/>
            him, not being altogether without hope, but feeling shame <lb/>
            in the presence of many persons to make trial of a marl <lb/>
            who was his enemy and victorious. However there was <lb/>
            no need for him to do or say anything unworthy of him­ <lb/>
            self; for when Cæsar saw Cicero coming to meet him at <note type="footnote"> * Smart sayings are not generally improved by explanation, and <lb/>
            they ought not to require it. Cicero apparently meant to say that it <lb/>
            was as absurd to talk of men being dispirited after a victory, as if one <lb/>
            were to say that Cæsar's friends disliked him. </note><note type="footnote"> t After defeating Pharnaces Cæsar landed in Italy, in September, <lb/>
            B.C. 47, of the unreformed calendar. Cicero had received a letter from <lb/>
            Cæsar before Cæsar's arrival in Italy. The letter was written in <lb/>
            Egypt (Cicero, Ad Diversos, xiv. 23; Pro Q. Ligario, o. 3). Compare <lb/>
            Dion Cassius, 46, c. 12, 22, as to the conduct of Cicero to Cæsar, <lb/>

            a great distance before all the rest, he got down and <lb/>
            embraced him and talking with him alone walked several <lb/>
            stadia. From this time he continued to show respect to <lb/>
            Cicero and friendly behaviour, so that even in his reply <lb/>
            to Cicero, who had written a panegyric on Cato, he com­ <lb/>
            mended his eloquence and his life, as most resembling <lb/>
            those of Perikles and Theramenes.* Cicero's discourse was <lb/>
            called Cato, and Caesar's was entitled Anticato. It is <lb/>
            said also that when Quintus Ligarius t was under prose­ <lb/>
            cution, because he had been one of Cæsar’s enemies and <lb/>
            Cicero was his advocate, Cæsar said to his friends, “ What <lb/>
            hinders us listening after so long an interval to Cicero's <lb/>
            speech, since the man has long been adjudged a villain <lb/>
            and an enemy ? " But when Cicero had begun to speak <lb/>
            and was making a wonderful sensation, and his speech <lb/>
            as he proceeded was in feeling varied and in grace admir­ <lb/>
            able, the colour often changed in Cæsar’s face, and it was <lb/>
            manifest that he was undergoing divers emotions in his <lb/>
            mind; but at last when the orator touched upon the battle <lb/>
            at Pharsalus, he was so affected that his body shook and <lb/>
            he dropped some of the writings from his hands. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he acquitted the man of the charge perforce.</p>
          <p>XL. After this, as the constitution was changed to a <lb/>
            monarchy, Cicero ‡ detaching himself from public affairs <lb/>
            applied himself to philosophy with such young men as <lb/>
            were disposed; and mainly from his intimacy with the <lb/>
            noblest born and the first in rank, he again got very <lb/>
            great power in the state. His occupation was to compose <lb/>
            philosophical dialogues and to translate and to transfer <lb/>
            into the Roman language every dialectical or physical <note type="footnote"> * It is difficult to see what was the resemblance between Perikles <lb/>
            and Cicero. Theramenes was somewhat more like him, for he tried to <lb/>
            be on more sides than one, and met with the usual fate of such people. <lb/>
            He was one of the so-called Thirty Tyrants of Athens, and he was <lb/>
            sacrificed by his colleagues. </note><note type="footnote"> t The speech of Cicero is extant. The allusion of Plutarch is par­ <lb/>

            for the Romans the terms Phantasia, Syncatathesis, <lb/>
            Epoche, and Catalepsis, and also Atom, and Indivisible, <lb/>
            and Vacuum, and many other like terms, some of which <lb/>
            by metaphor, and others by other modes of assimilation <lb/>
            he contrived to make intelligible and to bring into <lb/>
            common use: and he employed his ready turn for poetry <lb/>
            to amuse himself. For it is said that when he was dis­ <lb/>
            posed that way, he would make five hundred verses in <lb/>
            a night. The greatest part of his time he now spent <lb/>
            in his lands at Tusculum, and he used to write to his <lb/>
            friends that he was living the life of Laertes,* whether <lb/>
            it was that he said this in jest, as his manner was, or <lb/>
            whether from ambition he was bursting with desire to <lb/>
            participate in public affairs and was dissatisfied with <lb/>
            matters as they were. He seldom went down to the <lb/>
            city, and when he did, it was to pay court to Caesar, and <lb/>
            he was foremost among those who spoke in favour of the <lb/>
            honours given to him and were eager always to be saying <lb/>
            something new about the man and his acts. Of this kind <lb/>
            is what he said about the statues of Pompeius, which <lb/>
            Cæsar ordered to be set up after they had been taken <lb/>
            away and thrown down, and they were set up again. For <lb/>
            Cicero said that by this mild behaviour Cæsar placed the <lb/>
            statues of Pompeius, but firmly fixed his own.</p>

            with it much of Greek affairs and in fine to place there <lb/>
            the stories and myths which he had collected, he was <lb/>
            prevented by public and many private affairs contrary to <lb/>
            his wish, and by troubles, most of which seem to have <lb/>
            been of his own causing. For first of all, he divorced his <lb/>
            wife Terentia,t because he had been neglected by her <note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to the story of Laertes in the Odyssey, i. 190, and <lb/>

            Gicero was then on his road from Brundusium to Tusculanum. He <lb/>
            orders his wife to have everything ready for him; some friends would <lb/>
            probably be with him, and they might stay some time. The bath was <lb/>
            to be got ready, and eatables, and everything else. A gentleman <lb/>

            necessaries for his journey, and did not even on his return <lb/>
            to Italy find her well-disposed to him. For she did not <lb/>
            go to him, though he was staying some time in Brundusium, <lb/>
            and when her daughter, who was a young woman, was <lb/>
            going so long a journey, she did not supply her with suit­ <lb/>
            able attendance, nor any means, but she even made Cicero'a <lb/>
            house void of everything and empty, besides incurring <lb/>
            many great debts. These are the most decent reasons for <lb/>
            the separation which are mentioned. But Terentia denied <lb/>
            that these were the reasons, and Cicero made her defence <lb/>
            a complete one by marrying no long time after a maid; * <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">In a letter to Cn. Plancius (Ad Diversos, ix. 14), who congratulates <lb/>
            Cicezo on his new marriage, he says that nothing would have induced <lb/>
            him to take such a step at such a time, if he had not found on his <lb/>
            return his domestic affairs even worse than public affairs. According <lb/>
            to his own account he was hardly safe in his own house, and it was <lb/>
            necessary to strengthen himself by new alliances against the perfidy <lb/>
            of old ones. Terentia may have been a bad housekeeper, and her <lb/>
            temper was not the sweetest. She could not have any feeling for her <lb/>
            husband except contempt, and he repaid it by getting rid of her. <lb/>
            Cicero had to repay the Dos of Terentia, but she never got it back, so <lb/>
            far as we can learn. </note><note type="footnote"> It is not known what was the age of Terentia when she was divorced, <lb/>
            but she could not be young. Yet there are stories of her marrying <lb/>
            Sallustius, the historian, and after him Messala Corvinus, but the <lb/>
            authority for these marriages is weak. She is said to have attained <lb/>
            the age of one hundred and three. Terentia had a large property of <lb/>
            her own. There is no imputation on her character, which, for those <lb/>
            times, is much in her favour. She had courage in danger and firmness <lb/>
            of purpose, both of which her husband wanted. “ Her husband," says <lb/>
            Drumann,“ who always looked for and needed some support, must often <lb/>
            have acted under her influence: for him it was a fortunate thing <lb/>
            to have such a woman by his side, and a scandal that he put her <lb/>
            away." </note><note type="footnote"> * Her name was Publilia. Cicero was now sixty years of age. <lb/>
            Various ladies had been recommended to Cicero. He would not marry <lb/>
            the daughter of Pompeius Magnus, the widow of Faustus Sulla, <lb/>
            perhaps for fear that it might displease Cæsar ; another who was <lb/>
            recommended to him was too ugly (Ad Attic. xiv. 11). Publilia was <lb/>
            young and rich: her father had left her a large fortune, but in order <lb/>
            to evade the Lex Voconia, which limited the amount that a woman <lb/>
            could take by testament, the property was given to Cicero in trust to <lb/>
            give it to her. The marriage turned out unhappy. In a letter to <lb/>
            Atticus (xiv. 32), written when Cicero was alone in the country, he <lb/>
            says that Publilia had written to pray that she might come to him <lb/>
            with Ler mother; but he had told her that he preferred being alone, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            as Terentia charged it, through passion for her beauty, <lb/>
            but as Tiro * the freedman of Cicero has recorded it, to <lb/>
            get means for paying his debts. For the young woman <lb/>
            was very rich and Cicero had the care of her property, <lb/>
            being left fiduciary heir. Being in debt to the amount of <lb/>
            many ten thousands he was persuaded by his friends and <lb/>
            relatives to marry the girl, not withstanding the disparity <lb/>
            of age, and to get rid of his creditors by making use of her <lb/>
            property. But Antonius, who made mention of the <lb/>
            marriage in reply to the Philippics, says that he put out <lb/>
            of doors his wife with whom he had grown old, and at <lb/>
            the same time he made some cutting jibes on the house­ <lb/>
            keeping habits of Cicero as a man unfit for action and for <lb/>
            arms. No long time after his marriage Cicero's daughter <lb/>
            died in child-birth, for she had married Lentulus after <lb/>
            the death of her former husband Piso. The philosophers <lb/>
            from all quarters came together to console Cicero, but h3 <lb/>
            bore his misfortune very ill, and even divorced his wife <lb/>
            because he thought that she was pleased at the death of <lb/>
            Tullia.† <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">and he begs Atticus to let him know how long he could safely stay in <lb/>
            the count y without a visit from his young wife. Tullia died in B.C. <lb/>
            45, and Cicero had now no relief except in his studies; his new wife <lb/>
            was a burden to him, and he divorced her.. He had the Dos of Publilia <lb/>
            now to repay, and Terentia was not settled with ; thus, in addition to <lb/>
            his other troubles, he was troubled about money (Ad Attic. xiv. 34, <lb/>
            47). </note><note type="footnote"> Dion Cassius (57. 15) says that Vibius Rufus, who was consul A D. <lb/>

            to him. Cicero's letters to him are in the sixteenth book of the Mis­ <lb/>
            cellaneous Collection. It is said that Tiro collected the letters of <lb/>
            Cicero after Cicero's death, by doing which he has rendered a great <lb/>
            service to history, and little to his master. </note><note type="footnote"> t Tullia's first husband was C. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died <lb/>
            probably early in B.C. 57. In B.C. 56 Tullia married Furius Crassipes, <lb/>
            from whom she was divorced, but the circumstances are not known. <lb/>
            Her third husband was P. Cornelius Dolabella, a patrician. It seems <lb/>
            that she was separated from Dolabella before she died. Tullia did not <lb/>
            die in Rome, but at her father's house at Tusculum, in February, B.C. <lb/>
            45. Tullia left one son by Dolabella, who was named Lentulus. His <lb/>
            father, Dolabella, is also named Lentulus, whence it is concluded that <lb/>
            be had been adopted by a Lentulus. The Leutuli were Cornelii. </note></p><pb n="198"/>
            
          <p>XLII.* Such were Cicero's domestic affairs. He had <lb/>
            no share in the design that was forming against Cæsar, <lb/>
            though he was one of the most intimate friends of Brutus <lb/>
            and was supposed to be annoyed at the present state of <lb/>
            affairs and so long for the old state more than anybody <lb/>
            else. But the men feared his temper as being deficient in <lb/>
            daring, and the occasion was one in which courage fails <lb/>
            even the strongest natures. When the deed was accom­ <lb/>
            plished by the partisans of Brutus and Cassius, and Cæsar’s <lb/>
            friends were combining againt the conspirators, and there <lb/>
            was fear of the city again being involved in civil <lb/>
            wars, Antonius, who was consul, brought the Senate <lb/>
            together and said a few words about concord; and Cicero, <lb/>
            after speaking at length and suitably to the occasion, <lb/>
            persuaded the Senate to imitate the Athenians and decree <lb/>
            an amnestyt for what had been done to Cæsar, and to give <lb/>
            provinces to Brutus and Cas sius. But none of these <lb/>
            things came to a conclusion. For the people of themselves <lb/>
            being transported to pity, when they saw the corpse <lb/>
            carried through the Forum, and Antonius showed them <lb/>
            the garments filled with blood and slashed in every part <lb/>
            by the swords, maddened by passion sought for the men <lb/>
            in the Forum and ran with tire in their hands to their <lb/>
            houses to burn them. The conspirators escaped the <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar was murdered on the Ides of March, B.C. 44. The circum­ <lb/>
            stances of Cæsar’s death, and the events which follow, are told in the <lb/>
            Lives of Cæsar and Antonius. Cicero saw Cæsarfall (Ad Attic. xiv. <lb/>
            14), and he rejoiced. </note><note type="footnote"> t An “oblivion " or “ non-remembrance" is a declaration of those <lb/>
            who have the sovereign power in a state, that certain persons shall be <lb/>

            subjection to them, or have not the political power which the authors <lb/>
            of the amnesty assume. After Thrasybulus at Athens had overthrown <lb/>

            other great dangers, they quitted the city.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Antonius was forthwith elated, and was for­ <lb/>
            midable to all, as about to become sole ruler; but to <lb/>
            Cicero most formidable. For Antonius seeing that <lb/>
            Cicero's power was recovering strength in the State, and <lb/>
            knowing that he was closely allied with Brutus, was <lb/>
            annoyed at his presence. And there existed even before <lb/>
            this some ill-will between them on account of the unlike­ <lb/>
            ness and difference in their lives. Cicero fearing these <lb/>
            things, first made an attempt to go with Dolabella* to <lb/>
            Syria as legatus: but the consuls for the next year, Irtius <lb/>
            and Pansa,t who were good men and admirers of Cicero, <lb/>
            prayed him not to desert them, and they undertook if he <lb/>
            were present to put down Antonius. Cicero, neither dis­ <lb/>
            trusting altogether nor trusting gave up his design as to <lb/>
            Dolabella, and agreed with Irtius to spend the summer in <lb/>
            Athens, and when they had entered on their office, to <lb/>
            come back, and he sailed off by himself. But as there was <lb/>
            some delay about the voyage, and new reports, as the <lb/>
            wont is, reached him from Rome that Antonius had under­ <lb/>
            gone a wonderful change, and was doing and administer­ <lb/>
            ing everything conformably to the pleasure of the Senate, <lb/>
            and that matters only required his presence to be brought <lb/>
            to the best arrangement, himself blaming his excessive <note type="footnote"> * P. Cornelius Dolabella, once the husband of Tullia, Cicero's <lb/>
            daughter. He was consul, after Cæsar’s death, with M. Antonius, and <lb/>
            in the next year, B.O. 43, he was in Syria as governor. Cassius, who <lb/>
            was also in Syria, attacked Dolabella and took Laodicea, where Dula­ <lb/>
            bella was. To avoid falling into the hands of his enemy, Dolabella <lb/>
            ordered a soldier to kill him. </note><note type="footnote"> t A. Hirtius, or as Plutarch writes the name Irtius, and C. Vibius <lb/>
            Pansa were the consuls of B.C. 53. Cicero set out from Rome soon <lb/>
            after Cesar’s death with the intention of going to Greece (Ad Attic. <lb/>
            xiv.). He went as far as Syracuse, whence he returnodto Rome, which <lb/>
            he reached on the last day of August (Ad Diversos, xii. 25; Ad Attic. <lb/>
            xvi. 7; Philipp. i. 5; v. 7). Cicero in the passage last referred to <lb/>
            speaks of the violent measures of Antonius; “ hue etiam nisi venirem <lb/>
            Kal. Sept. fabros Be missurum et domum meam disturbaturum esse <lb/>
            dixit." On the second of September he delivered his first Philippic in <lb/>
            the Senate. It is an evidence of Cicero's great mental activity that he <lb/>
            wrote his Topica, addressed to Trebatius, on shipboard after he had set <lb/>
            sail from Velia with the intention of going to Greece. He says that <lb/>
            he had no books with him (Topica, c. 1, &amp;c.). </note> <lb/>

            caution turned back to Rome. And he was not deceived <lb/>
            in his first expectations, so great a crowd of people through <lb/>
            joy and longing for him poured forth to meet him, and <lb/>
            near a whole day was taken up at the gates and upon his <lb/>
            entrance with greetings and friendly reception. On the <lb/>
            following day Antonius summoned a Senate and invited <lb/>
            Cicero, who did not come, but was lying down pretending <lb/>
            to be indisposed from fatigue. But the truth appeared to <lb/>
            be that he was afraid of some design against him, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of certain suspicions and of information which <lb/>
            reached him on the road. Antonius was irritated at the <lb/>
            calumny and sent soldiers with orders to bring Cicero or <lb/>
            burn his house, but as many persons opposed Antonius <lb/>
            and urged him by entreaties he took securities only and <lb/>
            desisted. And henceforward they continued to pass by <lb/>
            without noticing one another and to be mutually on their <lb/>
            guard, till the young Cæsar* having arrived from Apollonia <lb/>
            took possession of the inheritance of the elder Cæsar, and <lb/>
            came to a quarrel with Antonius about the two thousand <lb/>
            five hundred ten thousands t which Antonius detained of <lb/>

            Cæsar should give to Cicero the security that could be <lb/>
            derived from money and from arms. For the young man <lb/>
            had about him many of those who had served under <lb/>
            Cæsar.* There appeared also to have been some stronger <lb/>
            reason for Cicero readily accepting the friendship of <lb/>
            Cæsar. For, as the story goes, while Pompeius and <lb/>
            Caesar were living, Cicero dreamedt that some one sum­ <lb/>
            moned the sons of the senators to the Capitol, as Jupiter <lb/>
            was going to appoint one of them chief of Rome, and that <lb/>
            the citizens ran eagerly and placed themselves around the <lb/>
            temple and the youths seated themselves in their prætextæ <lb/>
            in silence. The doors opened suddenly and one by one <lb/>
            the youths rising walked round before the god, who <lb/>
            looked at them all and dismissed them sorrowing. But <lb/>
            when young Cæsar was advancing towards him, the god <lb/>
            stretched out his hand and said, " Romans, there is an end <note type="footnote"> correctly states the time at ten months (Life of Antonius, o. 31). If <lb/>
            Octavia was then with child, as Dion Cassius says (48. c. 3), the <lb/>
            reason for the rule did not exist. In later times, at least, the rule was <lb/>
            dispensed with when the reason for it ceased, as when a pregnant <lb/>
            widow was delivered of a child before the end of the ten months. Teu <lb/>
            months was the assumed time of complete gestation (Savigny, System, <lb/>
            &amp;c. ii. 181). </note><note type="footnote"> * Young Cæsar had raised troops in Campania, and chiefly at Capua <lb/>
            among the veteran soldiers of the dictator, who had been settle i on <lb/>
            lands there (Dion Cassius, 45. c. 12; Cicero, Ad Atticum, xvi. 8). He <lb/>
            tave the men five hundred denarii apiece, about eighteen pounds <lb/>
            sterling, by way of bounty, and led them to Rome. These men were <lb/>
            old soldiers, well trained to their work. The youth who did this was <lb/>
            nineteen years of age, a boy, as Cicero calls him; but a boy who out­ <lb/>
            witted him and everybody else, and maintained for more than half a <lb/>
            century the power which he now seized. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dreams were viewed in a sort as manifestations of the will of the <lb/>
            gods. This dream happened, as Dion Cassius tells (45. c. 2), to <lb/>
            Catulus; and he makes Cicero dream another dream. Cicero drummed <lb/>
            that Octavius was let down from heaven by a chain of gold, anti was <lb/>
            presented with a whip by Jupiter. Suetonius (Octav. Cæsar, c. 94) <lb/>
            agrees with Dion Cassius. The whip was significant. Jupiter meant <lb/>
            that somebody required whipping, and he put the whip in the hands of <lb/>
            a youth who knew how to use it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            to civil wars when this youth becomes your leader." They <lb/>
            say that Cicero having had such a dream as this had im­ <lb/>
            printed on his memory the appearance of the youth and <lb/>
            retained it distinctly, but he did not know him. The <lb/>
            following day as he was going down to the Campus <lb/>
            Martius, the boys who had taken their exercise were <lb/>
            returning, and the youth was then seen by Cicero for the <lb/>
            first time just as he appeared to him in his dream, and <lb/>
            being struck with surprise Cicero asked who were his <lb/>
            parents. Now his father was Octavius, not a man of <lb/>
            very illustrious station, but his mother was Atia, a niece? <lb/>
            of Cæsar. Accordingly Cæsar, who had no children of <lb/>
            his own, gave the youth his property and family name by <lb/>
            his will. After this they say that Cicero took pains to <lb/>
            notice the youth when he met him, and the youth received <lb/>
            well his friendly attentions; for it had also happened <lb/>
            that he was born in Cicero's consulship.</p>
          <p>XLV. These were the reasons which were mentioned; <lb/>
            but his hatred of Antonius in the chief place, and then his <lb/>
            disposition, which was governed by ambition, attached, <lb/>
            him to Cæsar in the expectation of adding to his own <lb/>
            political influence Caesar's power. For the young man <lb/>
            went so far in paying his court to Cicero as to call him <lb/>
            father.- At which Brutus being much annoyed blamed <lb/>
            Cicero in his letters to Atticus, that through fear of <lb/>
            Antonius he was courting Caesar and was thus manifestly <lb/>
            not procuring liberty for his country, but wooing for <lb/>
            himself a kind master. However Cicero's son,† who was <lb/>
            studying philosophy at Athens, was engaged by Brutus <lb/>
            and employed in command in many things which he did <lb/>
            successfully. Cicero's power in the city was then at its <note type="footnote"> * The young man cajoled the old one and made a tool of him. Like <lb/>
            all vain men, Cicero was ready to be used by those who knew how to <lb/>
            handle him. There is a letter from Brutus to Cicero (Ad Brutum, 16), <lb/>
            and one of Brutus to Atticus (Ad Brutum, 17), to the purport here <lb/>
            stated by Plutarch. But these letters may be spurious. </note><note type="footnote"> t He was at Athens in B.O. 44, when Cicero addressed to him his <lb/>
            Officia. He had been a year there (De Offic. i. 1) at the time when <lb/>
            the first chapter was written. The poet Horatius was there at the <lb/>
            same time. When M. Brutus came to Athens in the autumn of B.O. 41, <lb/>
            Cicero joined Brutus, who gave him a command in his cavalry <lb/>

            height, and as he could do what he liked, he drove <lb/>
            Antoni as out and raised a faction against him and sent <lb/>
            out the two consuls Irtius and Pansa* to fight against him, <lb/>
            and he persuaded the Senate by a vote to give Cæsar <lb/>
            lictors and the insignia of a prætor, as if he were fighting <lb/>
            in defence of their country. But when Antonius had <lb/>
            been defeated and on the death of the two consuls after <lb/>
            the battle the forces joined Caesar, and the Senate through <lb/>
            fear of a youth who had enjoyed splendid success was <lb/>
            attempting by honours and gifts to call away from him <lb/>
            the armies, and to divide his power, on the ground that <lb/>
            there was no need of troops to defend the state now that <lb/>
            Antonius was fled, under these circumstances Cæsar being <lb/>
            alarmed secretly sent messengers to Cicero, to entreat and <lb/>
            urge Cicero to get the consulship for the two, but to <lb/>
            manage matters as he thought best, and to have the <lb/>
            power, and to direct the young man who was only desi­ <lb/>
            rous of a name and reputation. And Cæsar himself ad­ <lb/>
            mitted that it was through fear of his troops being dis­ <lb/>
            banded and the danger of being left alone, that he had <lb/>
            availed himself in a time of need of Cicero's love of power <lb/>
            by urging him to take the consulship, and promising that <lb/>
            he would act with him and assist in the canvass at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>XLVI. In this way indeed Cicero being very greatly <lb/>
            pushed on, he an old man by a young one, and cajoled, <lb/>
            assisted at the canvass of Cæsar t and got the Senate in his <lb/>
            favour, for which he was blamed by his friends at the <lb/>
            time, and he shortly after saw that he had ruined himself <lb/>
            and betrayed the liberty of the people. For when the <note type="footnote"> * The consuls were sent to relieve Mutina (Modena), in which <lb/>
            Decimus Brutus, the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, was besieged by <lb/>
            Antonius. Cicero had recommended the Senate to give Cæsar the <lb/>
            authority of a commander. Cæsar received a command with the <lb/>
            insignia of a prætor. There were two battles at Mutina, in April, B.c. <lb/>
            43, in which the two consuls fell. </note><note type="footnote"> t It is stated by various authorities that Cicero was cajoled with <lb/>
            the hopes of the consulship (Dion Cassius, 46. c. 42 ; Appian, Civil <lb/>
            Wars, iii. 82). The testimony of the tenth letter to Brutus (Cicero <lb/>
            Ad Brutum, 10) is not decisive against other evidence. Cessar came <lb/>
            to Rome in August, B.C. 43, with his army, and through the alarm <lb/>
            which he created, was elected consul with Q. Pedius (Dion Cassius, <lb/>
            46. c. 43, &amp;c.; Appian, Civil Wars, iii. 94). </note> <lb/>

            youth was strengthened and had got the consulship, he <lb/>
            gave himself no concern about Cicero, but making friends <lb/>
            with Antonius and Lepidus* and uniting his forces with <lb/>
            theirs, he divided the chief power with them, just as if <lb/>
            it were a piece of property. And a list of above two <lb/>
            hundred men was made out, who were doomed to die. <lb/>
            The proscription of Cicero caused most dispute among <lb/>
            them in their discussions, for Antonius was not inclined <lb/>
            to come to any terms unless Cicero was the first to be <lb/>
            doomed to death, and Lepidus sided with Antonius, but <lb/>
            Cæsar held out against both. They held their meeting by <lb/>
            themselves in secret near the city Bononia† for three days, <lb/>
            and they met in a place at some distance from the camps <lb/>
            which was surrounded by a river. It is said that during <lb/>
            the first two days Cæsar struggled in behalf of Cicero, <lb/>
            but that he yielded on the third and gave up the man. And <lb/>
            the matter of their mutual surrender was thus. Cæsar was <lb/>
            to give up Cicero, and Lepidus his brother Paulus,‡ and <lb/>
            Antonius was to give up Lucius Cæsar, who was his <note type="footnote"> * After he was elected consul, Cæsar left the city for North Italy, <lb/>
            and was joined by Antonius and Lepidus (Appian, Civil War, iii. 96, <lb/>
            &amp;c.). M. Æmilius Lepidus, son of M. Lepidus, consul B.C. 78, was <lb/>
            consul in B.C. 46, with C. Julius Cæsar. He was elected Pontifex <lb/>
            Maximus after Cesar’s death : he had been declared an enemy of the <lb/>
            State by the Senate, but Cæsar had compelled the Senate to annul their <lb/>
            declaration against Antonius and Lepidus, as a preparatory step to the <lb/>
            union with them which he meditated. Lapidus is painted to the life <lb/>
            by Shakespeare (Julius Cæsar, iv. 2): <lb/>

            is also described by Dion Cassius (46. c. 45), and here they formed a <lb/>
            triumvirate for five years. The number of the proscribed, according <lb/>
            to Appian, was three hundred senators and two thousand equites. The <lb/>
            power of the triumvirate was confirmed at Rome in legal form (Appian, <lb/>
            Civil Wars, iv. 7). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ L. AEmilius Paulus, consul B.O. 50, who is said to have sold him­ <lb/>

          <p>XLVII.* While this was going on, Cicero was on his <lb/>
            lands at Tusculum, and his brother with him; and on <lb/>
            hearing of the proscriptions they determined to remove <lb/>
            to Astura,t a place belonging to Cicero on the sea-coast, <lb/>
            and thence to sail to Macedonia to Brutus, for there was <lb/>
            already a rumour about him that he had a force. They <lb/>
            were conveyed in litters, being worn out by grief; and <lb/>
            halting by the way and placing their litters side by side <lb/>
            they lamented to one another. Quintus‡ was the more <lb/>
            desponding, and he began to reflect on his needy condi­ <lb/>
            tion, for he said that he had brought nothing from home; <lb/>
            and indeed Cicero was but scantily provided for his <lb/>
            journey ; it was better then, he said, for Cicero to hurry <lb/>
            on in his flight, and for him to hasten back and to pro­ <lb/>
            vide himself from home with what he wanted. This was <lb/>
            agreed, and embracing one another with tears they sepa­ <lb/>
            rated. Now Quintus, not many days after, was betrayed <lb/>
            by his slaves to those who were in search of him and put <lb/>
            to death with his son. Cicero arrived at Astura, and <lb/>
            finding a vessel he immediately embarked, and sailed <lb/>
            along the coast to Circæum,§ the wind in his favour. <note type="footnote"> * The circumstances of Cicero'a death are told more minutely by <lb/>
            Plutarch than by any other writer. He left the city before the arrival <lb/>
            of the Triumviri in November, and apparently when the bloody work <lb/>
            of the proscription had commenced. He had probably heard of his <lb/>

            When the sailors were wishing to set sail immediately <lb/>
            from thence, whether it was that he feared the sea, or had <lb/>
            not quite despaired of all trust in Cæsar, he landed, and <lb/>
            went on foot about a hundred stadia on the road to Rome. <lb/>
            But again perplexed and changing his mind he went <lb/>
            down to the sea of Astura ; and there he spent the night <lb/>
            in dreadful and desperate reflections, so that he even <lb/>
            formed a design to get secretly into Caesaris house, and <lb/>
            by killing himself on the hearth to fasten on him an <lb/>
            avenging daemon. But the fear of tortures drove him <lb/>
            from this measure also; and after perplexing himself <lb/>
            with other schemes and shifting from one to another, <lb/>
            he put himself in the hands of his slaves to convey him <lb/>
            by sea to Capitæ,* for he had lands there and a place <lb/>
            of retreat which was very agreeable in bummer, when the <lb/>
            Etesian winds blow most softly. The place has also a <lb/>
            temple of Apollo, a little above the sea. A flock of crows <lb/>
            winging their flight from thence with loud cawing <lb/>
            approached the vessel of Cicero as it was rowing to land, <lb/>
            and settling at each end of the sail-yard some made a <lb/>
            noise, and others gnawed the end of the ropes, and all <lb/>
            were of opinion that the omen was bad. Cicero landed, <lb/>
            and going to the villa he lay down to rest. But most of <lb/>
            the crows perched themselves on different parts of the <lb/>
            window, cawing clamorously; and one of them, going down <lb/>
            to the couch where Cicero lay wrapped up, by degrees <lb/>
            removed with its beak the covering from his face. The <lb/>

            helpers came on, Herennius* a centurion, and Popilius a <lb/>
            tribune, who had once been prosecuted for parricide <lb/>
            and Cicero was his advocate. Finding the doors closed <lb/>
            they broke them open, and as Cicero was not seen and <lb/>
            those who were within denied that they knew where he <lb/>
            was, it is said that a youth who had been brought up by <lb/>
            Cicero in liberal studies and learning, and was a freedman <lb/>
            of Cicero's brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the <lb/>
            tribune that the litter was being conveyed through the <lb/>
            wooded and shady paths to the sea. Accordingly the <lb/>
            tribune, taking a few men with him, ran round to the out­ <lb/>
            let. And as Herennius was running along the paths, <lb/>
            Cicero saw him and bade the slaves place down the litter <lb/>
            there; and, as his wont was, holding his chin with his <lb/>
            left hand he looked steadily on the murderers, being all <lb/>
            squalid and unshorn, and his countenance wasted by care, <lb/>
            so that most of them covered their faces while Herennius <lb/>
            was killing him. He stretched his neckt out of the litter <lb/>
            and was killed, being then in his sixty-fourth year. <lb/>
            Herennius cut off his head and the hands, pursuant to the <lb/>
            command of Antonius, with which he wrote the Philippies. <lb/>
            For Cicero himself entitled Philippics the speeches which <lb/>
            he wrote against Antonius, and to the present day they <lb/>
            are called Philippics.</p>

            Rome, Antonius happened to be holding an election of <lb/>
            magistrates, and when he heard the news and saw what <lb/>
            had been done, he called out that the proscriptions were <lb/>
            now at an end. He ordered the head and hands to be <lb/>
            placed above the Rostra on the place whence the orators <lb/>
            spoke, a sight that made the Romans shudder, who thought <lb/>
            that they saw, not the face of Cicero, but an image of the <lb/>
            soul of Antonius. Still he showed herein one sentiment <lb/>
            of just dealing, for he delivered up Philologus to Pomponia <lb/>
            the wife of Quintus, who having got him into her power, <lb/>
            inflicted terrible vengeance upon him, and among other <lb/>
            things compelled him to cut off his flesh bit by bit, and to <lb/>
            roast and eat it. Thus some of the historians have told <lb/>
            the story, but Tiro, who was Cicero's freedman, makes no <lb/>
            mention at all of the treachery of Philologus.* I have <lb/>
            heard that Caesar a long time after once went to see one of <lb/>
            his daughter's sons,t and as the youth had in his hands one <lb/>
            of Cicero's writings, he was afraid and hid it in his vest; <lb/>
            the which Caesar observing took the book and read a good <lb/>
            part of it while he was standing, and then returning the <lb/>
            book to the boy said, “ A wise man, my boy, a wise man <lb/>
            and a lover of his country." As soon as Cæsar had finally <lb/>
            defeated Antonius, he took Cicero's son‡ to be his colleague <note type="footnote"> Antonius placed the bead of Cicero on a tablet at a banquet (Appian, <lb/>
            Civil Wars, iv. 20). Though he hated Cicero and with good reason, <lb/>
            such a brutal act is not credible of him, nor is it consistent with the <lb/>
            story of the head being fixed on the Rostra; not to mention other <lb/>
            reasons against the story that might be urged. Dion Cassius (47. c. 8) <lb/>
            says that Fulvia, the wife of Antonius, pierced the tongue of Cicero <lb/>
            with one of the pins which women wore in their hair, and added other <lb/>
            insults. To make his story probable, he says that it was done before <lb/>
            the head was fixed on the Rostra. </note><note type="footnote"> * His name was Philogonus. The story about Philogonus is refuted <lb/>
            by the silence of Tiro. </note><note type="footnote"> Pomponia, the wife of Quintus, was the sister of T. Pomponius <lb/>
            Atticus, the friend of Cicero. She and her husband did not live in <lb/>
            harmony. </note><note type="footnote"> t These were Caius and Lucius, the sons of Cæsar's daughter Julia <lb/>

            death is unknown. Cicero's son had neither ambition nor ability. <lb/>
            All that is certainly known of him is that he loved eating and </note> <lb/>

            no Antonius should bear the name of Marcus. That <lb/>

            vengeance on Antonius. <note type="footnote"> drinking, for neither of which had his father any inclination. There <lb/>

            his literary merit. But there is not a single great defect in his moral <lb/>
            character that is not touched, nor a virtue that has not been sig­ <lb/>
            nalized. Those who would do justice to him and have not time to <lb/>
            examine for themselves, may trust Plutarch at least as safely as any <lb/>
            modern writer. </note><note type="footnote"> If in these notes I have occasionally expressed an unfavourable <lb/>
            opinion directly or indirectly, I have expressed none that I do not <lb/>
            believe true, and none for which abundant evidence cannot be pro­ <lb/>
            duced, even from Cicero's own writings. It is a feeble and contemp­ <lb/>
            tible criticism that would palliate or excuse that which admits not <lb/>
            of excuse. It is a spurious liberality that would gloss over the vices <lb/>
            and faults of men because they have had great virtues, and would <lb/>
            impute to those who tell the whole truth a malignant pleasure in <lb/>
            detaining and vilifying exalted merit. This assumed fair dealing and <lb/>
            magnanimity would deprive us of the most instructive lessons that <lb/>
            human life teaches-that all men have their weakness, their failings <lb/>
            and their vices, and that no intellectual greatness is a security against <lb/>
            them. " It is not absolutely railing against anything to proclaim its <lb/>
            defects, because they are in all things to be found, how beautiful or <lb/>
            how much to be coveted soever " (Montaigne). The failings of a great <lb/>
            man are more instructive than those of an obscure man. They exhibit <lb/>
            the weak points at which any man may be assailed, and in some of <lb/>
            which no man is impregnable. Cicero's writings have made us as <lb/>
            familiar with him as with the writers of our own country, and there is <lb/>
            hardly a European author of modern times who is more universally <lb/>
            read than Cicero in some or other of his numerous compositions. His <lb/>
            letters alone, which were never intended for publication, and were <lb/>
            written to a great variety of persons as the events of the day prompted, <lb/>
            furnish a mass of historical evidence, which, if we consider his position <lb/>
            and the times in which he lived, is not surpassed by any similar collec­ <lb/>
            tion. He is thus mixed up with the events of the most stirring and <lb/>
            interesting period of his country's history; and every person who <lb/>
            studies that history must endeavour to form a just estimate of the <lb/>
            character of a man who is both a great actor in public events and an <lb/>
            impoitant witness. </note><note type="footnote"> The Life of Cicero by Middleton is a partial work: the evidence is </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> P </note> <pb n="210"/>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF DEMOSTHENES AND CICERO.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. The above is all I have been able to find out that is <lb/>
            worth being recorded about Demosthenes and Cicero. With­ <lb/>
            out attempting to compare their different styles of oratory, <lb/>
            I think it necessary to remark that Demosthenes devoted <lb/>
            all his powers, natural and acquired, to the study of <lb/>
            eloquence alone, so that he surpassed all his rivals in <lb/>
            the law courts and public assembly in perspicuity and <lb/>
            ability, all the writers of declamations in splendour and <lb/>
            pomp of diction, and all the professional sophists in <lb/>
            accuracy and scientific method. Cicero, on the other <lb/>
            hand, was a man of great learning and various literary <lb/>
            accomplishments. He wrote a considerable number of <lb/>
            philosophic treatises modelled on the works of the <lb/>
            Academic school, and in all his forensic and political <lb/>
            speeches we can detect a desire to let his audience know <lb/>
            that he was a man of letters. In their speeches, too, we <lb/>
            can discern the impress of their respective characters. <lb/>
            The eloquence of Demosthenes never stoops to jest, and <lb/>
            is utterly without ornament, but has a terrible concen­ <lb/>
            trated earnestness, which does not smell of the lamp, as <lb/>
            Pytheas sneeringly said, but which reminds us of the <lb/>
            ungenial, painstaking, acrimonious nature of the man: <lb/>
            while Cicero often is carried by his love of jesting to the <lb/>
            verge of buffoonery, and in his pleadings treats serious <lb/>
            matters in a tone of most unbecoming levity and flippancy, <lb/>
            as in the oration for Cæcilius he argues that in an age of such <lb/>
            luxury and extravagance there can be nothing to wonder <lb/>
            at if a man takes his pleasure; for not to help oneself to <lb/>
            the pleasures which are within one's reach is the part of <lb/>
            a madman, seeing that the most eminent philosophers <lb/>
            have declared the chief felicity of man to consist in <note type="footnote">p a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            pleasure. It is related that when Cato prosecuted Murena, <lb/>
            Cicero, who was consul at the time, defended him, and <lb/>
            cracked many jokes on Cato as an adherent of the Stoic <lb/>
            philosophy, and on the absurdity of the paradoxes which <lb/>
            it maintains. The audience, and even the judges, laughed <lb/>
            heartily; but Cato merely remarked to those near him, <lb/>
            with a quiet smile, "Gentlemen, what a witty consul we <lb/>
            have.” Cicero, indeed, seems to have been fond of <lb/>
            laughter and mirth, and his countenance was calm and <lb/>
            smiling; while that of Demosthenes always bore the <lb/>
            marks of gloomy, anxious thought, which caused his <lb/>
            enemies, as he himself tells us, to call him disagreeable <lb/>
            and ill-natured.</p>
          <p>II. In their speeches we may observe that Demosthenes <lb/>
            praises himself with great moderation, in a manner which <lb/>
            can offend no one, and only when he has some more <lb/>
            important object in view, while he is usually modest and <lb/>
            cautious in his language; whereas Cicero's show a ridi­ <lb/>
            culous amount of egotism and craving for applause, when <lb/>
            he demands that “ arms shall yield to the toga, and the <lb/>
            triumphal laurel. give place to his tongue." At last <lb/>
            he took to praising not only his own deeds, but even his <lb/>
            spoken and written t orations, as though he were engaged <lb/>
            in some contest with professional rhetoricians like Isokrates <lb/>
            or Anaximenes, rather than endeavouring to lead and <lb/>
            reform the Roman people­ <lb/>
            . SavAge and rude, whose sole delight <lb/>
            Was with their foes to strive in tight." <lb/>
            A politician must of necessity be a powerful speaker, but <lb/>
            it is a contemptible thing for him to be too greedy and <lb/>
            covetous of applause for his fine speeches. Wherefore, in <lb/>
            this respect Demosthenes appears far graver, and of a <lb/>
            nobler nature; for he himself declared that his eloquence <lb/>
            came only by practice, and depended on the favour of his <lb/>
            audience, and that he regarded those who boasted of their <lb/>
            oratorical powers as vulgar and despicable characters.</p>
          <p>III. They were both alike in their power and influence <note type="footnote">* is Cedant arma togæ, concedat laurea linguæ.” </note><note type="footnote"> t “ Written,” because many of them were never spoken. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            with the people, which caused even the commanders ot <lb/>
            armies in the field to look to them for support; for Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes was courted by Chares, Diopeithes, and Leosthenes, <lb/>
            as was Cicero by Pompeius and the younger Cæsar,* as <lb/>
            Cæsar himself admits in his memoirs addressed to Mæcenas <lb/>
            and Agrippa. We cannot judge of Demosthenes by that <lb/>
            which is said to afford the most certain test of a man's <lb/>
            true character-his conduct when in power-for he has <lb/>
            not afforded us any opportunity of doing so, as he would <lb/>
            not even take the command of the confederacy which he <lb/>
            himself organised to oppose Philip. Now Cicero was sent <lb/>
            to Sicily as quæstor, and to Cilicia and Cappadocia as <lb/>
            proconsul, at a period when the love of wealth was at <lb/>
            its height, and when the Roman generals and governors, <lb/>
            thinking it beneath them to steal money, used to resort <lb/>
            to open robbery. It was not thought discreditable to <lb/>
            plunder a province, but he who did so with moderation <lb/>
            was esteemed as an excellent governor. Cicero on these <lb/>
            occasions gained great credit by the many proofs which <lb/>
            he gave of indifference to money, and of goodness and <lb/>
            kindness of heart. At Rome itself also, he was elected <lb/>
            nominally consul, but really dictator with unlimited <lb/>
            powers to deal with Catilina's conspiracy, and he then <lb/>
            proved the truth of Plato's aphorism, that a state finds <lb/>
            rest from its misfortunes when by good luck a powerful <lb/>
            and able man is found to rule it with justice. Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes again is said to have made money dishonourably <lb/>
            by writing speeches for other men, as in the case of the <lb/>
            speeches with which he secretly furnished Phormio and <lb/>
            Apollodorus, when they were opposed to one another. <lb/>
            He also was suspected of receiving bribes from the King <lb/>
            of Persia, and was caught in the act of taking a bribe <lb/>
            from Harpalus. Even if we suppose these charges, sup­ <lb/>
            ported as they are by the testimony of so many writers, <lb/>
            to be false, yet it is impossible to deny that Demosthenes, <lb/>
            who trafficked in that peculiarly discreditable form of <lb/>
            usury, marine insurances,t would not have been able to <lb/>
            refuse a present offered in all honour by a king, while we <lb/>
            have already related how Cicero refused to take money <note type="footnote"> * Augustus. </note><note type="footnote"> t For some account of the evil repute of those who dealt in these <lb/>
            insurances, see vol. ii.. Life of Cato Major, ch. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            from the Sicilians when he was quæstor,* and from the <lb/>
            Cappadocians when he was proconsul, and even from his <lb/>
            friends, who pressed him to accept large sums when he <lb/>
            was exiled from Rome.</p>
          <p>IV. Moreover, Demosthenes was exiled in great dis­ <lb/>
            grace, after he had been convicted of having received a <lb/>
            bribe, while Cicero's banishment was the consequence of <lb/>
            the noblest action of his life, the ridding his country of <lb/>
            wicked men. Wherefore, no one could plead for Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes when he left the country, but the Senate publicly <lb/>
            put on mourning for Cicero, grieved for his absence, and <lb/>
            refused to transact any business before voting that he <lb/>
            should be restored to Rome. Yet Cicero spent his exile <lb/>
            idly in Macedonia, while Demosthenes carried out an <lb/>
            important part of his policy while in exile; for, as has <lb/>
            been related, he accompanied the Athenian embassy to <lb/>
            the various states of Greece, discomfited the Macedonian <lb/>
            ambassadors, and proved himself a far better citizen than <lb/>
            Themistokles or Alkibiades under similar circumstances: <lb/>
            moreover, after his restoration to Athens, he continued to <lb/>
            pursue the same policy of unceasing opposition to Anti­ <lb/>
            pater and the Macedonians, while Lælius reproached <lb/>
            Cicero for sitting silent in the senate-house when young <lb/>
            Octavius Cæsar, before his beard was grown, petitioned <lb/>
            to be allowed to sue for the consulship in spite of the <lb/>
            law. Brutus also blamed him for having fostered a <lb/>
            greater and harsher tyranny than that which put <lb/>
            down.</p>
          <p>V. In conclusion, we must regard the death of Cicero <lb/>
            as most pitiable, that an old man, through cow. <unclear>rice</unclear> <lb/>
            should be carried hither and thither by his slaves, seeking <lb/>
            to escape death, and hiding himself from his foes, although <lb/>
            he could in any case have but a short time to live, and <lb/>
            then be murdered after all; while Demosthenes, though <lb/>
            he did beg somewhat for his life, must be admired for his <lb/>
            forethought in providing himself with the poison, and <lb/>
            also for the use which he made of it, to escape from the <lb/>
            cruelty of Antipater even when surrounded by his soldiers, <lb/>
            and to betake himself to a greater sanctuary, as that of <lb/>
            the god was unable to protect him. <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch uses the equivalent Greek word for maile. but we know <lb/>
            that Cicero went to Sicily as quæstor. </note> <lb/>

            to me to have especially alluded to the power which they <lb/>
            both exhibit of dealing with objects of completely con­ <lb/>
            trary qualities. In this respect they coincide; but they <lb/>
            differ in respect of the use and purpose of the object of <lb/>
            which they take cognisance. Our senses are influenced <lb/>
            indifferently by things white or black, sweet or bitter, <lb/>
            soft or hard, for the proper function of each sense is <lb/>
            merely to receive all these impressions and to convey <lb/>
            them to the mind. But the arts, which have been in­ <lb/>
            vented in order to cultivate the qualities proper to their <lb/>
            own nature and to eschew those which are foreign to it, <lb/>
            view some with especial favour, as partaking of their own <lb/>
            essence, and avoid others as mere untoward accidents. <lb/>
            Thus the art of medicine deals with diseases and the art <lb/>
            of music deals with discord merely with a view to <lb/>
            produce their respective opposites; while self-control, <lb/>
            justice and wisdom, which are the most perfect of all arts, <lb/>
            because they decide not only what is honourable, righteous <lb/>
            and useful but likewise what is hurtful, shameful, and <lb/>
            unjust, do not praise innocency which prides itself upon <lb/>
            inexperience of evil, but think it to be folly and ignorance <lb/>
            of what all who intend to live as becomes them ought to <lb/>
            know. The ancient Spartans at their feasts used to com­ <lb/>
            pel their helots to drink a large quantity of wine, and <lb/>
            then brought them into the banqueting-hall, in order to <lb/>
            show the young Spartans what drunkenness was like. I <lb/>
            think that to instruct one class of men by the ruin of <lb/>
            another is neither humane nor politic, yet I conceive that <lb/>
            it may be useful to insert among my Parallel Lives some <lb/>
            examples of men who have been careless of their own <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            reputation, and who have used their great place and <lb/>
            power only to make themselves notorious for evil. The <lb/>
            description of such men's lives is not indeed an agreeable <lb/>
            task, or a pleasant mode of employing my leisure, still, as <lb/>
            Ismenias the Theban, when instructing his scholars how <lb/>
            to play the flute, used to say, “ Thus you should play; ” <lb/>
            and again, " Thus you should not play," while Antigen­ <lb/>
            ides even thought that the young would take more pleasure <lb/>
            in listening to good flute-players, if they had first heard <lb/>
            bad ones, so I think that we shall be more inclined both <lb/>
            to admire and to imitate the lives of good men, if we are <lb/>
            well acquainted with those of bad ones. This book, then, <lb/>
            will contain the lives of Demetrius, surnamed the City- <lb/>
            taker, and of Antonius the Triumvir, men who bear signal <lb/>
            witness to the truth of Plato's remark, that great men <lb/>
            have great vices as well as great virtues. Both alike <lb/>
            loved passionately, drank deep, and fought bravely; both <lb/>
            were freehanded, extravagant and arrogant. Fortune <lb/>
            served them both alike, not only in their lives, for each <lb/>
            of them had great successes and great disasters, each won <lb/>
            great empire and lost it again, each unexpectedly fell <lb/>
            and rose again; but also in their deaths, as the one was <lb/>
            captured by his enemies, and the same fate all but betel <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>II. Antigonus * had two sons by Stratonike the <lb/>
            daughter of Korragus, one of whom he named Demetrius <lb/>
            after his brother, and the other Philip after his father. <lb/>
            This is the account given by most historians, though <lb/>
            some say that Demetrius was not the son, but the nephew, <lb/>
            of Antigonus; but that, as his father died while he was <lb/>
            still an infant and his mother at once married Antigonus, <lb/>
            he was commonly regarded as his son. His brother <lb/>
            Philip, who was a few years younger than himself, died <lb/>
            soon, but Demetrius grew up to be a tall man, though <lb/>
            not so tall as his father. His face and figure were of extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary beauty, which baffled all the attempts of painters <lb/>
            and sculptors to do it justice. His expression was at once <lb/>
            sweet, commanding and terrible; and his countenance <note type="footnote"> * Antigonus, surnamed the one-eyed, King of Asia, was the son of <lb/>
            Philip of Elymiotis. He was one of the generals of Alexander tho <lb/>
            Great. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            showed all the eagerness and fire of youth combined with <lb/>
            the calm dignity of a hero and a king. In like manner <lb/>
            his disposition was one which was equally capable of <lb/>
            inspiring terror or love. He was the pleasantest of <lb/>
            companions, more given to wine-drinking and the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of luxurious idleness than any other king of his age, <lb/>
            and yet he displayed remarkable energy and persistent e <lb/>
            in action; so that he emulated the fame of the god <lb/>
            Dionysius,* being like him a famous warrior, and when <lb/>
            the war was over most capable of thoroughly enjoying the <lb/>
            arts of peace.</p>
          <p>III. He was remarkably fond of his father; and the <lb/>
            love and respect which he paid to his father and mother <lb/>
            seem to have been prompted by true affection, not by a <lb/>
            wish to stand well with those in power. Once when <lb/>
            Antigonus was receiving an embassy from some foreign <lb/>
            state, Demetrius, who had been out hunting, came up to <lb/>
            his father, kissed him, and sat down beside him just as he <lb/>
            was, with his javelins still in his hand. When the <lb/>
            ambassadors had transacted their business and were about <lb/>
            to leave his presence, Antigonus said to them in a loud <lb/>
            voice, " And, gentlemen, you may carry home this news <lb/>
            about me and my son, that these are the terms on which <lb/>
            we live," thinking that so great a proof of his trust in his <lb/>
            son's loyalty would add considerable strength to his throne. <lb/>
            So much mistrust and suspicion is bred by absolute power, <lb/>
            and so hard a thing is it for a king to have a companion, <lb/>
            that the eldest and greatest of the successors of Alexander <lb/>
            publicly boasted that he was not afraid to have his own <lb/>
            son sitting by his side with a spear in his hand. Indeed, <lb/>
            this was the only royal family which through many <lb/>
            generations remained unpolluted by this species of crime, <lb/>
            for of all the successors of Antigonus only one, Philip, <lb/>
            assassinated his son. All the records of other dynasties <lb/>
            are full of murders of sons, mothers and wives; for the <lb/>
            murder of brothers had grown to be considered, like an <lb/>
            axiom in mathematics, as a necessary precaution to be <lb/>
            taken by all kings on ascending to the throne.</p>
          <p>IV. The following anecdote seems to prove that <lb/>
            Demetrius when young was of a kind and loving nature. <note type="footnote"> * Her. Carm. ii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            Mithlidates, the son of Ariobarzanes, was his friend and <lb/>
            companion, and was a good subject of Antigonus, of <lb/>
            thorough and unsuspected loyalty, but at length incurred <lb/>
            the suspicion of Antigonus in consequence of a dream. <lb/>
            Antigonus dreamed that he walked over a large and fair <lb/>
            plain, sowing it with gold dust; and that shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards, returning that way again, he found nothing but <lb/>
            stubble left. While grieving over this he heard some <lb/>
            men say that Mithridates had gone away to Pontus on <lb/>
            the Euxine, after having gathered the golden harvest. <lb/>
            Antigonus was much disturbed at this vision, and after <lb/>
            having compelled his son to swear that he would keep <lb/>
            silence about it, told him of the vision, and added that he <lb/>
            had made up his mind to make away with the man. <lb/>
            Demetrius was greatly grieved at hearing this, and when <lb/>
            the young man, as he was wont to do, again joined him, <lb/>
            and spent the day with him, Demetrius dared not tell him <lb/>
            by word of month what danger he was in, because of the <lb/>
            oath ; but he drew him aside into a quiet place, and there, <lb/>
            as soon as they were alone together, he wrote on the ground <lb/>
            with the but-end of his spear, in sight of the other, the <lb/>
            words “ Fly, Mithridates " Mithridates understood his <lb/>
            meaning, and ran away that very night to Cappadocia. <lb/>
            Not long afterwards, he showed Antigonus what was the <lb/>
            real meaning of his dream ; for he made himself master of <lb/>
            an extensive territory, and became the founder of the <lb/>
            dynasty of the kings of Pontus, which was overthrown by <lb/>
            the Romans in about the eighth generation after him. <lb/>
            By this example we may perceive the noble and loyal <lb/>
            nature of Demetrius.</p>
          <p>V. As the elements, because of their mutual attraction <lb/>
            and repulsion, are, according to Empedokles, always at <lb/>
            variance with one another, and especially with those with <lb/>
            which they happen to be in contact, so, while all the <lb/>
            successors of Alexander were always at war, circumstances <lb/>
            from time to time caused hostilities between two or more <lb/>
            of them to take an especially active form. At this time <lb/>
            Antigonus was at war with Ptolemy, and, hearing that <lb/>
            Ptolemy had left the island of Cyprus, had landed in <lb/>
            Syria and was ravaging that country, he himself remained <lb/>
            in Phrygia, but sent his son Demetrius to oppose him. <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            Dometrius was now two and twenty years of age, and <lb/>
            was now for the first time entrusted with the sole manage­ <lb/>
            ment of an important campaign. As might be expected <lb/>
            of so young and untried a commander, when pitted against <lb/>
            a man trained to war under Alexander, and who had <lb/>
            since his death waged many wars with success, Demetrius <lb/>
            was defeated near the city of Gaza with a loss of fifteen <lb/>
            thousand killed and eight thousand prisoners. He also <lb/>
            lost his own tent, his property, and all his personal <lb/>
            attendants. These, however, were restored to him, with <lb/>
            all his captured friends, by Ptolemy, who sent him a <lb/>
            kindly-worded message to the effect that they ought not <lb/>
            to fight as mortal foes, but only for honour and empire.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, after receiving this message and his property, <lb/>
            prayed to the gods that he might not long remain in <lb/>
            Ptolemy's debt, but that he might soon recompense him <lb/>
            in like manner. He did not behave himself like a youth <lb/>
            who has received a check at the outset of his first cam­ <lb/>
            paign, but repaired his failure like an old and wary <lb/>
            commander, enrolling fresh soldiers, providing new <lb/>
            supplies of arms, keeping a firm hold over the cities near <lb/>
            him and carefully drilling his new levies.</p>
          <p>VI. Antigonus when he heard of the defeat remarked <lb/>
            that Ptolemy had conquered beardless boys, but that <lb/>
            he would have to fight his next battle with grown men. <lb/>
            He yielded however to his son's entreaty to be allowed <lb/>
            to repair his fault by himself, and, as he did not wish <lb/>
            to damp his spirits, left him in sole command. Soon <lb/>
            after this Killes, Ptolemy's lieutenant, arrived in Syria <lb/>
            with a large force, meaning to chase Demetrius, whom <lb/>
            he supposed to be disheartened by his defeat, quite <lb/>
            out of Syria. But Demetrius by a sudden attack sur­ <lb/>
            prised his army and struck it with panic. He cap­ <lb/>
            tured the enemy's camp and their general, and took <lb/>
            eight thousand prisoners and a great quantity of booty. <lb/>
            He was overjoyed at this, not because he meant to <lb/>
            keep what he had won, but to give it back, and did <lb/>
            not so much value the glory and wealth which he <lb/>
            had gained as the opportunity now offered him for <lb/>
            repaying the courtesy of Ptolemy. He did not presume <lb/>
            to do this on his own responsibility, but wrote first <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            to his father. On receiving permission from him to deal <lb/>
            as he pleased with the fruits of his victory, he gave <lb/>
            costly presents to Killes and his friends, and sent them <lb/>
            back to Ptolemy. This battle forced Ptolemy to retire <lb/>
            from Syria, and brought Antigonus from Kelænæ re­ <lb/>
            joicing at the victory and eager to see his son.</p>
          <p>VII. After this Demetrius was sent to subdue the <lb/>
            Nabathean Arabs, in performing which service he incurred <lb/>
            great danger by journeying through waterless deserts; <lb/>
            but his intrepid courage overawed the barbarians, and <lb/>
            he returned loaded with plunder, having captured seven <lb/>
            hundred camels.</p>
          <p>Seleukus had once lost his capital city, Babylon, which <lb/>
            Antigonus took from him ; but he had since recovered it by <lb/>
            his own arms, and at this time was marching with an army <lb/>
            to attempt the conquest of the nations bordering upon <lb/>
            India, and the provinces near mount Caucasus. Demetrius, <lb/>
            hoping that he might find Mesopotamia in a defenceless <lb/>
            condition, suddenly crossed the Euphrates, took Babylon <lb/>
            by surprise, and made himself master of one of its two <lb/>
            citadels, driving out the garrison placed there by Seleukus. <lb/>
            Demetrius placed seven thousand of his own troops in the <lb/>
            citadel, ordered his troops to enrich themselves by the <lb/>
            plunder of the surrounding country, and then returned <lb/>
            to the sea-coast, leaving Seleukus more firmly established <lb/>
            on his throne than before; for by plundering the country <lb/>
            he seemed to admit that he had no claim to it. As <lb/>
            Ptolemy was now besieging Halikarnassus, he quickly <lb/>
            marched thither and succeeded in saving the city.</p>
          <p>VIII. As the glory which he won by this action was <lb/>
            very great, he and his father Antigonus conceived a <lb/>
            strong desire to liberate the whole of Greece from the <lb/>
            tyranny of Ptolemy and Kassander. None of the suc­ <lb/>
            cessors of Alexander ever waged a more just or honourable <lb/>
            war than this; for Demetrius and Antigonus, to gain <lb/>
            themselves honour by freeing the Greeks, spent upon­ <lb/>
            them the treasure which they had won in their victories <lb/>
            over the barbarians. They determined first of all to <lb/>
            attack Athens, and when one of the friends of Antigonus <lb/>
            advised him, if he captured that city, to keep it in his <lb/>
            own hands because it was the key of Greece, Antigonus <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            replied that the best key to a country was the goodwill <lb/>
            of its people, and that Athens was the watch-tower of the <lb/>
            world, from whence the glory of his deeds should shine <lb/>
            like a beacon-light to all mankind.</p>
          <p>Demetrius now set sail for Athens with five thousand <lb/>
            talents of silver, and a fleet of two hundred and fifty <lb/>
            vessels. At this time Demetrius of Phalerum governed the <lb/>
            city as Kassander's lieutenant, and a garrison was placed <lb/>
            in Munychia. By good fortune and good management the <lb/>
            fleet arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the month Thar­ <lb/>
            gelion, without anyone being aware of its coming. When <lb/>
            the ships were seen, they were thought to form part of <lb/>
            Ptolemy's fleet, and preparations were made to give them <lb/>
            a friendly reception. At last the officers in command <lb/>
            discovered their mistake, and a scene of great confusion <lb/>
            ensued, as they hastily made preparations to resist the <lb/>
            enemy, who were already in the act of disembarking; for <lb/>
            Demetrius, finding the mouths of the harbours open, sailed <lb/>
            straight in, and could be seen distinctly by all standing <lb/>
            on the deck of the ship, and making signs to the Athenians <lb/>
            to be quiet and keep silence. When this was done, he <lb/>
            bade a herald proclaim that his father Antigonus had sent <lb/>
            him thither in an auspicious hour to liberate the Athenians, <lb/>
            drive out their Macedonian garrison, and restore to them <lb/>
            their own laws and ancient constitution.</p>
          <p>IX. Upon hearing this proclamation the greater part of <lb/>
            the people laid down their shields at their feet, clapped <lb/>
            their hands, and shouted to Demetrius to come ashore, call­ <lb/>
            ing him their saviour and benefactor; while Demetrius of <lb/>
            Phalerum thought it necessary to admit so powerful a man <lb/>
            to the city, even though he might have no intention of <lb/>
            performing any of his promises. He therefore sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to make their submission. Demetrius received <lb/>
            them graciously and sent back with them Aristodemus of <lb/>
            Miletus, one of his father's friends. As the Phalerean, In <lb/>
            consequence of this sudden turn of fortune, was more afraid <lb/>
            of his own countrymen than of the enemy, Demetrius, who <lb/>
            admired his courage and public spirit, took care to have <lb/>
            him conveyed in safety to Thebes, to which town he <lb/>
            himself wished to go. Demetrius himself now declared <lb/>
            that, although he was very eager to view the city, he <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            would not do so until he had completely set it free and <lb/>
            expelled its garrison. He therefore surrounded Munychia <lb/>
            with a ditch and rampart, cutting it off from the rest of <lb/>
            the city, and then sailed to attack Megara, which town <lb/>
            was held by a garrison of Kassander's troops.</p>
          <p>As he heard that Kratesipolis, the wife of Alexander the <lb/>
            son of Polysperchon, a celebrated beauty, was at Patræ, <lb/>
            and was not unwilling to grant him an interview, he <lb/>
            left his army encamped in the territory of Megara and <lb/>
            proceeded thither with only a few lightly equipped <lb/>
            followers. When he was near the place, he pitched his <lb/>
            own tent apart from his men, that the lady might not be <lb/>
            seen when she came to visit him. Some of the enemy dis­ <lb/>
            covered this, and made a sudden attack upon him. He <lb/>
            only escaped by putting on a mean cloak and running <lb/>
            away alone; so that his licentiousness very nearly ex­ <lb/>
            posed him to ignominious capture. When Megara was <lb/>
            taken the soldiers were about to plunder the city, but the <lb/>
            Athenians with great difficulty prevailed upon Demetrius <lb/>
            to spare it. He drove out the Macedonian garrison and <lb/>
            made the city independent. While he was doing this he <lb/>
            remembered Stilpon the philosopher, who was reputed to <lb/>
            have chosen for himself a life of retirement and study. <lb/>
            Demetrius sent for him, and inquired whether anything <lb/>
            had been stolen from him. “ Nothing," replied Stilpon. <lb/>
            " I saw no one taking away any knowledge." As, however, <lb/>
            nearly all the slaves were stolen, after Demetrius had <lb/>
            talked graciously to Stilpon and at length dismissed him <lb/>
            with the words, " My Stilpon, I leave you a free city;" <lb/>
            " Quite true," replied Stilpon, “ for you have not left us a <lb/>
            single slave."</p>
          <p>X. Demetrius now returned to Munychia, encamped <lb/>
            before it, dislodged the garrison, and demolished the fort. <lb/>
            And now at the invitation of the Athenians he proceeded <lb/>
            into the city, where he assembled the people and re- <lb/>
            established the ancient constitution. He also promised <lb/>
            that his father Antigonus would send them one hundred <lb/>
            and fifty thousand bushels of wheat and timber enough to <lb/>
            build a fleet of one hundred ships of war. Thus did the <lb/>
            enians recover their democratic constitution fifteen <unclear/> <lb/>
            after it had been dissolved: for during the period <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            between the Lamian war and the battle of Krannon their <lb/>
            government had nominally been an oligarchy, but practi­ <lb/>
            cally had been a despotism, on account of the great power <lb/>
            of Demetrius of Phalerum.</p>
          <p>The benefits which Demetrius conferred upon the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians rendered him indeed great and glorious; but they <lb/>
            rendered his fame invidious by the extravagant honours <lb/>
            which they conferred upon him. They were the first of <lb/>
            all men who bestowed upon Antigonus and Demetrius the <lb/>
            title of Kings, a name which they greatly disliked because <lb/>
            of its association, and which moreover belonged at that <lb/>
            time in an especial manner to the descendants of Philip <lb/>
            and Alexander, being the only one of their ensigns of <lb/>
            royalty which had not been adopted by other princes <lb/>
            The Athenians too were the only people who styled <lb/>
            Antigonus and Demetrius their saviour gods, and they <lb/>
            even abolished the ancient office of the archon from whom <lb/>
            the year received its name, and elected in his place every <lb/>
            year a priest to minister at the altar of the saviour <lb/>
            gods. They also decreed that their images should be <lb/>
            woven into the sacred peplus of Athena,* with those of <lb/>
            the gods. They consecrated the spot where Demetrius <lb/>
            first set his foot on the ground when he alighted from his <lb/>
            chariot, and built an altar upon it which was called the <lb/>
            altar of “ The Descending Demetrius." They added two <lb/>
            to the number of their tribes, and called them Demetrias <lb/>
            and Antigonis; and consequently they raised the number <lb/>
            of the senators from five to six hundred, because each <lb/>
            tribe supplied it with fifty members.</p>
          <p>XI. But the most outrageous of these devices of Strato­ <lb/>
            kles, for it was he who invented all these new extrava­ <lb/>
            gancies of adulation, was a decree that ambassadors sent <lb/>
            to Antigonus or to Demetrius should wear the same holy <lb/>
            title which had hitherto been given to the envoys who <lb/>
            conducted the public sacrifices to the great festivals at <lb/>
            Olympia and at Delphi. Indeed, in all other respects <lb/>
            Stratokles was a man of shameless effrontery and <lb/>
            debauched life, who appeared to imitate the scurrility of <lb/>
            Kleon in ancient times by the reckless contempt with <note type="footnote"> * This was the holy robe of Athena, carried in procession through <lb/>
            Athens at the Panathenaic festival. See Smith's ‘Dict. of Antiq.,' s.v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            which he treated the people. He publicly kept a cour <lb/>
            tesan named Phylakion; and one day when she had <lb/>
            bought some necks and brains in the market, he said to <lb/>
            her, " Why, you have bought us the same things for <lb/>
            dinner which we politicians play at ball with.".</p>
          <p>When the Athenians were defeated in the great sea- <lb/>
            fight at Amorgos, he reached Athens before the news of the <lb/>
            disaster, and drove though the Kerameikus with a garland <lb/>
            on his head, telling all the people that a victory had been <lb/>
            won. He decreed a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and had <lb/>
            meat publicly distributed among the tribes for entertain­ <lb/>
            ments. Shortly afterwards the scattered ships began to <lb/>
            arrive, coming home as well as they could after the defeat. <lb/>
            When the people angrily turned upon him, resenting the <lb/>
            trick which he had played them, he met their clamour <lb/>
            with the utmost impudence, and said, “ What harm have <lb/>
            I done you, in giving you two days of happiness ? " Such <lb/>
            was the audacity of Stratokles.</p>
          <p>XII. There were, however, other marks of servility, <lb/>
            “ hotter than fire,” as Aristophanes calls it. One Athenian <lb/>
            surpassed Stratokles himself by passing a decree that <lb/>
            Demetrius, whenever he visited Athens, should be received <lb/>
            with the same divine honours which were paid to Demeter <lb/>
            and Dionysius, and that money should be granted from <lb/>
            the public treasury to the person who should celebrate <lb/>
            the festival of the reception with the greatest magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence, in order that with it he might erect some memorial <lb/>
            of his success. At last the name of the month Munychion <lb/>
            was changed to Demetrion, and the first day of it named <lb/>
            Demetrias, while the name of the festival of the Dionysia <lb/>
            was changed to Demetria.</p>
          <p>Most of these acts produced manifest signs of the dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure of the gods. The peplus, upon which, according <lb/>
            to the decree, the images of Zeus and Athena were woven <lb/>
            together with those of Antigonus and Demetrius, was <lb/>
            rent in two by a violent gust of wind as it was being <lb/>
            conveyed in procession through the Kerameikus, while <lb/>
            a great quantity of hemlock grew up round the altars <lb/>
            which were erected in their honour, although it was not <lb/>
            a common plant in the neighbourhood. On the day of <lb/>
            the festival of Dionysius the procession was put a stop <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            to by excessive cold, which came entirely out of season, <lb/>
            and a severe frost not only destroyed all the fig-trees and <lb/>
            vines, but even cut off a great part of the corn in the <lb/>
            blade. In consequence of this, Philippides, who was an <lb/>
            enemy of Stratokles, made the following allusion to him <lb/>
            in one of his comedies: <lb/>
            is Who was it caused the peplus to be rent ? <lb/>
            Who was it caused the frost to blight our vines? <lb/>
            The wretch, who worships mortals like to gods, <lb/>
            His crimes destroy is, not my harmless rhymes?” <lb/>
            This Philippides was a friend of Lysimachus, who for <lb/>
            his sake conferred many benefits on the Athenians. Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus imagined that the sight of Philippides before any <lb/>
            campaign or expedition was a certain omen of good luck; <lb/>
            while Philippides was beloved by him on other grounds, <lb/>
            because he gave no trouble and never veiled his thoughts <lb/>
            in courtly periphrases. Once Lysimachus, meaning to <lb/>
            be very civil to him said, “ Philippides, which of my <lb/>
            possessions shall I bestow upon you ? " " Whichever you <lb/>
            please," answered he, " except your secrets." I have <lb/>
            mentioned these incidents in the life of Philippides, in <lb/>
            order to mark the distinction between the comic poet an <lb/>
            the mob-orator.</p>
          <p>XIII. The most extraordinary of all the honours con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon Demetrius was the proposal made by Demo­ <lb/>
            kleides of Sphettus to go and ask for an oracular response <lb/>
            from him about the consecration of the shields at Delphi. <lb/>
            I will write down the exact words of the law as it was <lb/>
            proposed. " In a happy hour the people decree that one <lb/>
            man shall be chosen from the citizens of Athens, who <lb/>
            shall go to our saviour, and after he has done sacrifice <lb/>
            unto him, shall ask Demetrius, our saviour, in what <lb/>
            manner the people may, with greatest holiness and with­ <lb/>
            out delay, make consecration of their offerings; and <lb/>
            whatever oracle it shall please him to give them, the <lb/>
            people shall perform it." By this absurd flattery the <lb/>
            intellect of Demetrius, at no time very powerful, was <lb/>
            thrown completely off its balance.</p>
          <p>XIV. While he was living at Athens he married <lb/>
            Eurydike, a descendant of the ancient hero Miltiades, <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            who was the widow of Opheltas, King of Cyrene, and <lb/>
            had returned to Athens after her husband's death. The <lb/>
            Athenians were greatly delighted at this marriage, which <lb/>
            they regarded as an honour to their city; though Deme­ <lb/>
            trius made no sort of difficulty about marriage, and had <lb/>
            many wives at the same time. The chief of his wives, <lb/>
            and the one whom he most respected, was Phila, the <lb/>
            daughter of Antipater, and the widow of Kraterus, who <lb/>
            was the most popular with the Macedonians of all the <lb/>
            successors of Alexander during his life, and the most <lb/>
            lamented by them after his death. Demetrius when <lb/>
            very young was forced by his father to marry this <lb/>
            woman, who was too old to be a suitable match for him. <lb/>
            It is said that when Demetrius expressed his un willing­ <lb/>
            ness to marry her, his father whispered in his ear the line <lb/>
            of Euripides: <lb/>
            "To gain a fortune, marriage must be dared." <lb/>
            substituting the word " marriage " for “ bondage," which <lb/>
            occurs in the original. However, the respect which <lb/>
            Demetrius paid to her and to his other wives did not <lb/>
            prevent his intriguing with various courtesans and <lb/>
            mistresses, but he had a worse reputation in this respect <lb/>
            than any other king of his age.</p>
          <p>XV. His father now ordered him to proceed to Cyprus, <lb/>
            and to attack Ptolemy, who was in possession of that <lb/>
            island. He was forced to obey ths summons, but as he <lb/>
            was very unwilling to desist from the war in defence of <lb/>
            the liberties of Greece, a much more noble and glorious <lb/>
            struggle, he first endeavoured to bribe Ptolemy's lieutenant <lb/>
            in command of the garrison of Sikyon and Corinth to <lb/>
            evacuate those cities and render them independent. As <lb/>
            this attempt failed he quickly set sail, collected a large <lb/>
            force, and proceeded to Cyprus. Here he fought a battle <lb/>
            with Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, and at once defeated <lb/>
            him. Shortly afterwards Ptolemy himself came to Cyprus <lb/>
            with an immense fleet and army. The two commanders <lb/>
            now interchanged messages of scornful defiance. Ptolemy <lb/>
            bade Demetrius put to sea before his own host assembled <lb/>
            and overwhelmed him, while Demetrius offered to permit <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            Ptolemy to withdraw from Cyprus on condition that he <lb/>
            would give up Corinth and Sikyon. The battle which <lb/>
            ensued was one of the deepest interest, not merely to the <lb/>
            combatants themselves, but to all the other princes, since <lb/>
            its issue would determine not only the fate of Cyprus <lb/>
            and Syria, but would at once render the victor the most <lb/>
            powerful man in all the world.</p>
          <p>XVI. Ptolemy advanced with a fleet of one hundred <lb/>
            and fifty sail, and ordered Menelaus, when the battle <lb/>
            was at its hottest, to sally out from Salamis with his <lb/>
            sixty ships and throw the fleet of Demetrius into disorder <lb/>
            by attacking it in the rear. Demetrius sent ten ships <lb/>
            to oppose these sixty, for the mouth of the harbour (of <lb/>
            Salamis) was so narrow that this number sufficed to close <lb/>
            it. He himself now got his land force under arms, <lb/>
            disposed it upon several neighbouring promontories, and <lb/>
            put to sea with one hundred and eighty ships. He bore <lb/>
            straight down upon the enemy's fleet, and completely <lb/>
            defeated it. Ptolemy himself, when all was lost, escaped <lb/>
            with only eight ships, the sole survivors of his fleet. <lb/>
            All the rest were sunk, except seventy which were <lb/>
            captured with their crews on board. All his numerous <lb/>
            train of servants, friends and wives, all his arms, money <lb/>
            and military engines, which were stationed near the fleet <lb/>
            in transports, were captured by Demetrius, who at once <lb/>
            conveyed them to his own camp.</p>
          <p>Among the spoil was the celebrated Lamia, who had <lb/>
            at first been brought into notice by her musical skill, <lb/>
            for she was an admirable flute-player, and who had <lb/>
            afterwards become notorious by her amours. Her beauty <lb/>
            was at this time somewhat faded, yet, although Demetrius <lb/>
            was much younger than herself, she so fascinated and <lb/>
            enslaved him by her charms, that, though many other <lb/>
            women wished for his love, he cared only for her.</p>
          <p>After the sea-fight, Menelaus held out no longer, but <lb/>
            surrendered Salamis to Demetrius, with all his ships, and <lb/>
            a land army of twelve hundred cavalry and twelve <lb/>
            thousand heavy-armed infantry.</p>
          <p>XVII. Demetrius added to the glory of this brilliant <lb/>
            victory by his generous and humane conduct in burying <lb/>
            the enemy's dead with great honour, and in setting free <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            all his prisoners. He sent a present to the Athenians <lb/>
            of twelve hundred complete suits of armour from the <lb/>
            spoils which he had taken. He also sent Aristodemus <lb/>
            of Miletus to bear the news of the victory to his father. <lb/>
            Of all his courtiers, this man was the boldest flatterer, <lb/>
            and on this occasion he surpassed himself. After his <lb/>
            passage from Cyprus, he would not allow his ship to <lb/>
            approach the land, but cast anchor, bade all the crew <lb/>
            remain on board, and himself rowed ashore in a small <lb/>
            boat. He now walked up to the palace of Antigonus, <lb/>
            who was in a state of great excitement and impatience <lb/>
            to learn the issue of the battle, as may easily be imagined, <lb/>
            considering the importance of the stake. When he heard <lb/>
            that Aristodemus was come, his anxiety reached its <lb/>
            highest pitch. He could scarcely keep himself indoors, <lb/>
            and sent messenger after messenger, both servants and <lb/>
            his own friends, to learn from Aristodemus what had <lb/>
            taken place. Aristodemus returned no answer to any of <lb/>
            them, but walked leisurely on with immovable counte­ <lb/>
            nance. Antigonus could bear the suspense no longer, <lb/>
            but came to the door of his palace to meet Aristodemus, <lb/>
            who was now accompanied by a large crowd. When he <lb/>
            came near, he stretched forth his right hand, and in a <lb/>
            loud voice exclaimed, “ Hail, King Antigonus. We have <lb/>
            defeated Ptolemy in a sea-fight. We are masters of <lb/>
            Cyprus, and have taken sixteen thousand eight hundred <lb/>
            prisoners." To this Antigonus answered, “ Hail to you, <lb/>
            also; but you shall pay the penalty of having tortured <lb/>
            us so long: you shall wait long before you receive the <lb/>
            reward for your good news."</p>
          <p>XVIII. After this success, the people for the first time <lb/>
            saluted Antigonus and Demetrius with the title of kings. <lb/>
            The friends of Antigonus at once placed a diadem upon <lb/>
            his head, and he sent one to Demetrius, with a letter in <lb/>
            which he addressed him as king. The Egyptians, when <lb/>
            they heard of this, also proclaimed Ptolemy king, that they <lb/>
            might not appear to be dispirited by their defeat. Their <lb/>
            example was soon followed by the other successors of <lb/>
            Alexander, out of rivalry, for Lysimachus and Seleukus <lb/>
            now began to wear the diadem in the presence of Greeks, <lb/>
            though Seleukus had long before adopted the royal style <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            in his dealings with Asiatics. Kassander, however, <lb/>
            although every one both in interviews and letters addressed <lb/>
            him as king, never used the title in his own letters, but <lb/>
            signed them simply with his own name as he had been <lb/>
            wont to do.</p>
          <p>The assumption of this title produced more important <lb/>
            results than a mere empty change of name and style. <lb/>
            It caused its bearers to be more exalted in their ideas, <lb/>
            more extensive in their ambition, and more pompous and <lb/>
            stately in their demeanour, just as actors when they put <lb/>
            on royal robes adopt also the lofty port and the haughty <lb/>
            voice and carriage of a king. They also became more <lb/>
            severe in their administration of justice, because they <lb/>
            now laid aside that dissimulation by which they had <lb/>
            hitherto concealed their power, and which had rendered <lb/>
            them so much more lenient and gentle in their treatment <lb/>
            of their subjects. So great was the power of the voice <lb/>
            of one flatterer, and such great changes did it effect in <lb/>
            the entire world.</p>
          <p>XIX. Antigonus, elated by the successes of Demetrius <lb/>
            at Cyprus, at once marched to attack Ptolemy. He him­ <lb/>
            self led the land force, while Demetrius accompanied him <lb/>
            along the coast with an enormous fleet. But Medius, a <lb/>
            friend of Antigonus, was warned in a dream of what was <lb/>
            destined to be the issue of the campaign. He dreamed <lb/>
            that Antigonus with all his army was running a race <lb/>
            in the circus. At first he appeared to be running strongly <lb/>
            and fast, but soon his strength seemed to be ebbing away, <lb/>
            and at last when he turned round the extreme point of <lb/>
            the course and began to return, he was so weak and out <lb/>
            of breath that he could hardly recover himself.</p>
          <p>Indeed Antigonus by land met with many disasters, <lb/>
            while Demetrius at sea met with a terrible storm, and <lb/>
            narrowly escaped being driven ashore upon an iron-bound <lb/>
            coast. He lost many ships, and returned without having <lb/>
            accomplished anything. Antigonus was now very near <lb/>
            eighty years of age, and was incapacitated for active <lb/>
            service by his size and unwieldiness rather than by his age. <lb/>
            He consequently entrusted the management of the war to <lb/>
            Demetrius, who had already by his good fortune and skill <lb/>
            conducted several most important campaigns with success.</p><pb n="230"/>
            
          <p>Antigonus was not alarmed at his amours, his extrava­ <lb/>
            gancies, or his carousals, for he knew that, although in <lb/>
            time of peace Demetrius used to indulge unrestrainedly <lb/>
            in these pleasures, yet that in war he was as sober as <lb/>
            though it were natural to him to be so. It is said that, <lb/>
            in allusion to the empire which Lamia had now gained <lb/>
            over Demetrius, once when he affectionately embraced his <lb/>
            father on his return from a journey, Antigonus said, “ My <lb/>
            boy, you seem to think that you are caressing Lamia." <lb/>
            Another time, when Demetrius spent several days in <lb/>
            drinking, and excused himself by saying that he had been <lb/>
            laid up with a severe cold, Antigonus answered, “So I <lb/>
            understood, but was the cold Chian or Thasian ? " Once <lb/>
            Antigonus heard that Demetrius had a fever, and went to <lb/>
            see him. At the door he met one of his favourites coming <lb/>
            out. He went in, sat down by his bedside, and took him <lb/>
            by the hand. When Demetrius said that the fever had <lb/>
            just left him, Antigonus answered, “ Yes, I met it just <lb/>
            now at the door." So gently did he deal with the vices <lb/>
            of Demetrius, because of his many other good qualities. <lb/>
            The Scythians have a custom of twanging their bows <lb/>
            while they are drinking and carousing, as though to <lb/>
            recall their courage while it is melting away in pleasure; <lb/>
            but Demetrius used to give up his whole thoughts at one <lb/>
            time to pleasure, and at another to serious work, concen­ <lb/>
            trating his entire attention upon the matter in hand, so <lb/>
            that his amusements never interfered with his preparations <lb/>
            for war.</p>
          <p>XX. He appears indeed to have been better able to <lb/>
            make preparations for war than to use them, for he always <lb/>
            liked to be more than sufficiently provided with stores of <lb/>
            every kind, and always wished to construct larger ships, <lb/>
            and more powerful battering engines, in the working of <lb/>
            which he took an especial delight. He was intelligent <lb/>
            and clever, and did not waste his mechanical ingenuity in <lb/>
            mere pastime, like other princes, who have amused them­ <lb/>
            selves by playing on the flute, painting, or working in <lb/>
            metal. Æropus, king of Macedonia, used to employ his <lb/>
            leisure time in making little tables and lamps; while <lb/>
            Attains, surnamed Philometor, amused himself by culti­ <lb/>
            vating poisonous herbs, not merely hyoscyamus and helle­ <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            bore, but even hemlock, aconite and dorycnium.* These <lb/>
            he used to plant and tend with his own hands in the royal <lb/>
            gardens, and made it his business to know their various <lb/>
            juices and fruit, and to gather it in due season. The kings <lb/>
            of Parthia, too, used to pride themselves upon sharpening <lb/>
            the points of their own javelins. But the mechanics of <lb/>
            Demetrius were always upon a royal scale, and his engines <lb/>
            were of enormous size, showing by their admirable and <lb/>
            ingenious construction the grand ideas of their inventor; <lb/>
            for they appeared worthy not only of the genius and <lb/>
            wealth, but of the hand of a king. Their size astonished <lb/>
            his friends, while their beauty charmed even his enemies, <lb/>
            and this praise is far from being as exaggerated as it <lb/>
            sounds; for his enemies actually stood in crowds along <lb/>
            the sea-shore to admire his ships of fifteen and sixteen <lb/>
            banks of oars, while his " city-takers ” t were regarded as <lb/>
            wonders even by the towns against which they were em­ <lb/>
            ployed, as we may see in a notable example. Lysimachus, <lb/>
            who of all the kings of his time was the bitterest enemy <lb/>
            of Demetrius, when he was endeavouring to force Deme­ <lb/>
            trius to raise the siege of Soli in Cilicia, sent a message to <lb/>
            him asking to be allowed to see his siege engines and his <lb/>
            ships of war. Demetrius indulged his curiosity, and after <lb/>
            viewing them he retired home. The Rhodians also, after <lb/>
            they had stood a long siege, when they came to terms with <lb/>
            Demetrius, begged for some of his machines, which they <lb/>
            wished to keep both as a memorial of his power and of <lb/>
            their own courage.</p>
          <p>XXI. Demetrius went to war with the Rhodiana because <lb/>
            they were the allies of Ptolemy, and brought up to their <lb/>
            walls his largest " city-taker," a machine with a square <lb/>
            base, each side of which measured eight-and-forty cubits <lb/>
            at the bottom. It was sixty-six cubits in height, and its <lb/>
            upper part was much narrower than the base. Within, 24, <lb/>
            was divided into many separate storeys and chambers, <lb/>
            with windows on each storey opening towards the enemy, <lb/>
            through which missiles of every kind could be shot, as it <note type="footnote"> * A poisonous plant of the convolvulus kind. </note><note type="footnote"> t An engine described by Amm. Marcell. 28. 4. 10, and also in <lb/>
            Smith's 'Diet. of Antiq.' art. ‘Helepolis.’ See also Athen. v. p. 206. <lb/>
            d. for a description of these machines </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            was full of soldiers armed with every kind of weapon. It <lb/>
            never shook nor trembled, but rolled steadily onwards, <lb/>
            upright and firm, with a regular, equable motion, which <lb/>
            filled all spectators with terror and delight. Two steel <lb/>
            corslets were brought from Cyprus for Demetrius to use <lb/>
            in this war, each of which weighed forty minæ.* The <lb/>
            maker, Zoilus, in order to show their strength and power <lb/>
            of resisting a blow, bade Demetrius shoot a dart out of a <lb/>
            catapult at one of them at a distance of twenty paces. <lb/>
            Where it struck, the iron remained unbroken, and only <lb/>
            showed a trifling scratch, such as might be made by a <lb/>
            stilus, or iron pen for writing on wax. This corslet <lb/>
            Demetrius wore himself. He gave the other to Alkimus <lb/>
            of Epirus, the bravest and most warlike man in all his <lb/>
            army, who wore a suit of armour weighing two talents,t <lb/>
            while that of all the rest weighed only one talent. This <lb/>
            man fell during the siege of Rhodes, in a battle near the <lb/>
            theatre.</p>
          <p>XXII. The Rhodians defended themselves with great <lb/>
            spirit, and Demetrius was unable to accomplish anything <lb/>
            against them; but he still continued the siege out of <lb/>
            anger, because they had captured a ship in which his wife <lb/>
            Phila had sent him letters, clothes and bedding, and had <lb/>
            sent it at once to Ptolemy, just as it was. In this they <lb/>
            were far from imitating the courtesy of the Athenians, <lb/>
            who, when Philip was at war with them, captured a mes­ <lb/>
            senger and read all the letters which he carried except one <lb/>
            written by Olympias, which they did not open, but sent <lb/>
            it on to him with the seal unbroken. However, although <lb/>
            Demetrius was much nettled by the conduct of the Rho­ <lb/>
            dians, he did not stoop to retaliation upon them, although <lb/>
            be soon had an opportunity of doing so. Protogenes of <lb/>
            Kaunus happened at that time to be painting a picture of <lb/>
            lalysus ‡ for the Rhodians, and Demetrius found the <lb/>
            picture very nearly completed in one of the suburbs of <note type="footnote"> * A mina weighed 100 drachmæ, 15•2 oz. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Attic talent, which is probably meant, weighed about 57 Ibs. <lb/>
            avoird. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This is the famous picture of lalysus and his dog, spoken of by <lb/>
            Cicero and Pliny, in which the foam on the dog's mouth was made by <lb/>

            off his previous unsuccessful attempts. (Clough.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            the city. The Rhodians sent a herald and begged him to <lb/>
            spare the work, and not destroy it, to which he answered, <lb/>
            that he would rather burn his father's statues than such <lb/>
            a precious work of art. Apelles tells us that when he saw <lb/>
            this picture, the sight at first took away his breath; and <lb/>
            that at last he said, " Indeed this is a wonderful piece of <lb/>
            work, and must have cost great labour." Yet it has not <lb/>
            that grace which gives so divine a charm to the works of <lb/>
            Apelles himself. This picture shared the common lot of <lb/>
            all Greek works of art, being taken to Rome, where it was <lb/>
            destroyed by fire. As the Rhodians gallantly held their <lb/>
            own in the war, Demetrius became weary of the siege, <lb/>
            and gladly accepted the offer of the Athenians to act as <lb/>
            mediators. They made peace between them on condition <lb/>
            that the Rhodians should act as the allies of Antigonus <lb/>
            and Demetrius, except against Ptolemy.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The Athenians now invited Demetrius to come <lb/>
            to their aid, as Kassander was besieging Athens. Deme­ <lb/>
            trius arrived with three hundred and thirty ships, and a <lb/>
            large land force. He not only drove Kassander out of <lb/>
            Attica, but pursued him as far as Thermopylae, where he <lb/>
            defeated him in a battle, and gained possession of the <lb/>
            city of Heraklea, which voluntarily surrendered to him. <lb/>
            A body of six thousand Macedonians also deserted from <lb/>
            Kassander and joined him. On his return he freed the <lb/>
            Greeks south of Thermopylae from Macedonian domina­ <lb/>
            tion, formed an alliance with the Boeotians and took <lb/>
            Kenchreæ. He destroyed the forts at Phyle and Panak­ <lb/>
            turn in Attica, which had been garrisoned by Kassander's <lb/>
            troops, and restored them to the Athenians. They, al­ <lb/>
            though they appeared to have exhausted every possible <lb/>
            form of adulation during his former visit, yet contrived to <lb/>
            flatter him by the invention of fresh honours. They <lb/>
            assigned the interior of the Parthenon to him for his <lb/>
            lodging; and there he dwelt with the title of “ the guest <lb/>
            of Athena," though he was a very ill-behaved guest <lb/>
            to be quartered in the house of a virgin goddess. Yet <lb/>
            once, when his father heard that his brother Philip <lb/>
            was staying in a house where there were three young <lb/>
            women, he said nothing to Philip, but in his presence <lb/>
            sent fur the quartermaster and said to him, “ Will you <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            be so good as to find some less crowded quarters for <lb/>
            my son."</p>
          <p>XXIV. Demetrius, however, without paying the least <lb/>
            respect to Athena, although he was wont to call her his <lb/>
            elder sister, filled the Acropolis with such a series of <lb/>
            outrages on well-born youths and women of the upper <lb/>
            classes that the place became comparatively decent when <lb/>
            he contented himself with holding an orgie in the society <lb/>
            of the celebrated courtesans, Chrysis, Lamia, Demo and <lb/>
            Antikyra. For the sake of the city I will say no more <lb/>
            about his other debaucheries, but I cannot refrain from <lb/>
            mentioning the virtue and chastity shown by Demokles. <lb/>
            He was very young, and his beauty did not escape the <lb/>
            notice of Demetrius; indeed his nickname betrayed him, <lb/>
            for he was always spoken of as Demokles the Handsome. <lb/>
            He turned a deaf ear to all advances, presents, or threats, <lb/>
            and at last ceased to frequent the gymnasium and the <lb/>
            palæstra, and used only a private bath. Demetrius <lb/>
            watched his opportunity, and surprised him there alone. <lb/>
            The boy, when he saw that he was caught where no one <lb/>
            could help him, rather than suffer violence, took off the <lb/>
            lid of the copper, leaped into the boiling water, and <lb/>
            destroyed himself. He deserved a better fate, but the <lb/>
            spirit which prompted the act was worthy of his country <lb/>
            and of his beauty, and was very different to that of <lb/>
            Kleaenetus the son of Kleomedon, who, when his father <lb/>
            was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, obtained a <lb/>
            remission of it from Demetrius, and showed a letter from <lb/>
            Demetrius to the Athenian people signifying his pleasure <lb/>
            in the matter; by which conduct Kleaenetus not only <lb/>
            disgraced himself, but threw the whole city into a fer­ <lb/>
            ment. Kleomedon's fine was remitted, but the people <lb/>
            decreed that no citizen should ever again bring them a <lb/>
            letter from Demetrius. However, as Demetrius was <lb/>
            greatly incensed at this, and did not conceal his dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure, the Athenians in terror not only reversed <lb/>
            the decree, but put to death some of those who had <lb/>
            advocated it, and banished others. Moreover, they <lb/>
            actually decreed that “ the entire people of Athens should <lb/>
            regard anything which King Demetrius might be pleased <lb/>
            to command as both righteous in respect of the gods, and <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            legal as regards men." When one of the better class of, <lb/>
            citizens observed that Strategies must be mad to propose <lb/>
            such a decree, Demochares* of Leukonoe answered “ He <lb/>
            would be mad not to be mad,”† for Stratokles made a <lb/>
            great fortune by his flattery of Demetrius. This speech <lb/>
            was reported to Stratokles, and Demochares was forced to <lb/>
            go into exile. Such was the conduct of the Athenians <lb/>
            when they were relieved of their Macedonian garrison <lb/>
            and were thought to have become a free people.</p>
          <p>XXV. Demetrius now proceeded to Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            where he met with no resistance, as the enemy fled before <lb/>
            him, and surrendered their cities to him. He made <lb/>
            himself master of the district known as Akte, and of the <lb/>
            whole of Arcadia, except Mantinea, while he set free <lb/>
            Argos, Sikyon and Corinth, by bribing their garrisons <lb/>
            to evacuate them with a hundred talents. At Argos he <lb/>
            acted as president of the games at the festival of Hera, <lb/>
            which took place whilst he was there. On this occasion <lb/>
            he held a solemn assembly of all the Greeks, and publicly <lb/>
            married Deidameia, a daughter of Æakides, king of the <lb/>
            Molossi, and sister of Pyrrhus. He remarked to the <lb/>
            people of Sikyon that they lived out of their proper city, <lb/>
            and prevailed upon them to remove to the spot which <lb/>
            they now inhabit. He changed the name as well as the <lb/>
            situation of the city, and instead of Sikyon named it <lb/>
            Demetrias.</p>
          <p>At a largely attended meeting held at the Isthmus, <lb/>
            Demetrius was proclaimed chief of Greece, as Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander had been in former days; though Demetrius <lb/>
            considered himself to be not a little superior to either of <lb/>
            them, being elated by his good fortune and the immense <lb/>
            force at his disposal. Alexander never deprived a king <lb/>
            of his title, nor did he ever call himself king of kings, <lb/>
            though he raised many to the dignity and style of kings; <lb/>
            but Demetrius scoffed at those who called any one king, <lb/>
            except himself and his father, and was much pleased at <lb/>
            his carousals to hear toasts drunk to the health of Deme­ <lb/>
            trius the King, Seleukus the Commander of the Elephants, <note type="footnote"> * A nephew of Demosthenes. </note><note type="footnote"> t Meaning that Stratokles would be mad not to continue his flattery <lb/>
            of Demetrius, because it was so profitable to himself. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            Ptolemy the Admiral, Lysimachus the Treasurer, and <lb/>
            Agathokles of Sicily the Lord of the Isles. The other <lb/>
            princes laughed at these sallies of Demetrius, and only <lb/>
            Lysimachus was angry that Demetrius should think him <lb/>
            a eunuch ; for it was a pretty general custom to appoint <lb/>
            eunuchs to the post of treasurer. Indeed Lysimachus <lb/>
            hated him more bitterly than all of the rest, and, sneering <lb/>
            at his passion for Lamia, used to declare that he had <lb/>
            never before seen a whore act in a tragedy : to which <lb/>
            Demetrius retorted that his whore was a more respectable <lb/>
            woman than Lysimachus's Penelope.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Demetrius now set out for Athens, and sent a <lb/>
            letter to the Athenians informing them that he desired <lb/>
            to be initiated, and that he wished to go through the <lb/>
            whole course, including both the lesser and the greater <lb/>
            mysteries. This is not lawful, and never took place <lb/>
            before, as the minor initiation used to take place in the <lb/>
            month Anthesterion, and the greater in Boedromion. <lb/>
            When the letter was read, no one ventured to offer any <lb/>
            opposition except Pythodorus the torchbearer,* and he <lb/>
            effected nothing; for, at the instance of Stratokles, the <lb/>
            Athenians decreed that the month Munychion should be <lb/>
            called Anthesterion, and in it celebrated the mysteries of <lb/>
            Demeter which are held at Agræ.† After this the name <lb/>
            of the month Munychion was changed again from Anthes­ <lb/>
            terion to Bœdromion, and Demetrius was admitted to the <lb/>
            second degree, and allowed the privileges of an “epoptes." <lb/>
            In allusion to this Philippides rails at Stratokles in his <lb/>
            verses as the man <lb/>
            “Who crowds into one month the entire year." <lb/>
            And, in allusion to the lodging of Demetrius in the Par­ <lb/>
            thenon, he wrote <lb/>
            “ Who treats Acropolis as t'were an inn <lb/>
            And makes the Virgin's shrine a house of sin."</p>
          <p>XXVII. But of all the outrages and illegal acts of <lb/>
            which Demetrius was guilty at this period, nothing seems <lb/>
            to have enraged the Athenians so much as his ordering <note type="footnote"> * Hereditary chief minister in the mysteries. </note><note type="footnote"> t The minor rite. See Smith's ‘Diet. of Autiq.' s.v. ‘Eleusinia.’ </note> <lb/>

            them speedily to levy a sum of two hundred and fifty <lb/>
            talents, which, when it had been raised by a most harsh <lb/>
            and pitiless series of exactions, was publicly presented by <lb/>
            Demetrius to Lamia and her sisterhood to furnish their <lb/>
            toilet-tables. It was the disgrace of the whole business <lb/>
            and the scorn which it brought upon them, which stung <lb/>
            them to the quick, more than the loss of the money. <lb/>
            Some writers say that it was the people of Thessaly, not <lb/>
            the Athenians, whom he treated in this manner. How­ <lb/>
            ever, besides this, Lamia extorted money from many <lb/>
            citizens on pretence of providing a supper for the king. <lb/>
            This supper was so famous on account of the enormous sum <lb/>
            which it cost, that a history of it was written by Lynkeus <lb/>
            of Samoa. For this reason one of the comic poets very <lb/>
            cleverly called Lamia a "city-taker." Demochares of <lb/>
            Soli called Demetrius himself “Mythus,” or " Fable,” <lb/>
            because he too had his Lamia.*</p>
          <p>Indeed the passion of Demetrius for Lamia caused not <lb/>
            only his wives but his friends to dislike her and be jealous <lb/>
            of her. Some of them went on an embassy to Lysimachus, <lb/>
            and he when at leisure showed them on his thighs and <lb/>
            arms the scars of deep wounds caused by a lion's claws, <lb/>
            telling them of how King Alexander had fastened him <lb/>
            in the same cage with the beast, and the battle he had <lb/>
            fought with it. On hearing this they laughingly said <lb/>
            that their master also frequently showed upon his neck <lb/>
            the marks of a savage beast called Lamia, which he kept. <lb/>
            The wonder was that Demetrius, who had objected to <lb/>
            Phila as being past her first youth, should yet be so <lb/>
            captivated by Lamia, who was now far advanced in years. <lb/>
            Once when Lamia was playing on the flute at a banquet, <lb/>
            Demetrius asked the courtesan Demo, who was surnamed <lb/>
            Mania, what she thought of her. “ I think her an old <lb/>
            woman, my king, replied she. Again when the sweet­ <lb/>
            meats were placed on the table, Demetrius said to Demo, <lb/>
            " Do you see what fine things Lamia sends me ? " " My <lb/>
            mother," answered Demo, “ will send you many more if <lb/>
            only you will sleep with her." A saying of Lamia's about <lb/>
            the well-known judgment of Bocchoris has been recorded. <note type="footnote"> * Lamia in Greek is the name of a fabulous monster, a bugbear to <lb/>
            children. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            A certain Egyptian became enamoured of the courtesan <lb/>
            Thonis, but she set too high a price upon her favours for <lb/>
            him. Afterwards he dreamed that he had enjoyed her, <lb/>
            and his passion for her cooled. Upon this Thonis sued <lb/>
            him in court for the money, and Bocchoris, having heard <lb/>
            the case argued, ordered the man to place the exact sum <lb/>
            which she demanded in a glass vessel, and to wave it <lb/>
            backwards and forwards while she clutched at the shadow, <lb/>
            because the young man's dream had been a shadow of the <lb/>
            reality.- Lamia said that she did not think this decision <lb/>
            a just one, because the woman's desire for the gold was <lb/>
            not satisfied by the shadow, as the young man's passion <lb/>
            had been by his dream.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But now the fortunes and deeds of the subject <lb/>
            of our narrative force us to pass from a comic to a tragic <lb/>
            scene, for all the other kings conspired against Antigonus, <lb/>
            and united their forces together. Demetrius hereupon <lb/>
            sailed away from Greece and joined his father, who was <lb/>
            making wonderful exertions for a man of his age, and <lb/>
            who was greatly encouraged by his son's arrival. Yet <lb/>
            it appears as though Antigonus, if only he would have <lb/>
            made some small concessions and restrained his excessive <lb/>
            love of power, might have enjoyed his supreme dignity <lb/>
            to the end of his life, and might have bequeathed to his <lb/>
            son his position of chief of all the successors of Alexander. <lb/>
            Being, however, by nature haughty and disdainful, and <lb/>
            even harsher in word than in deed, he alienated from <lb/>
            himself and exasperated many young and powerful men; <lb/>
            and even now he boasted that he would scatter the con­ <lb/>
            federacy by which he was menaced as easily as a man <lb/>
            scares a flock of birds away from a field. He took the <lb/>
            field with more than seventy thousand infantry, ten <lb/>
            thousand cavalry, and seventy-five elephants, while his <lb/>
            enemies' army numbered sixty-four thousand infantry, <lb/>
            five hundred more cavalry than his own, four hundred <lb/>
            elephants, and one hundred and twenty war-chariots. <lb/>
            When they drew near he became less hopeful rather than <lb/>
            less determined. He was always wont to show a lofty <lb/>
            and boastful spirit in the hour of danger, speaking in a <note type="footnote"> * A much more decent version of this story will be found in <lb/>
            Rabelais, book iiL chi. 37. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            loud tone, using confident language, and after making <lb/>
            some jest when in the presence of the enemy, to show his <lb/>
            own assurance of success and contempt for his opponents. <lb/>
            Now, however, he was thoughtful and silent, and presented <lb/>
            his son to the army as his successor. But what astonished <lb/>
            every one most of all was that he held council with Deme­ <lb/>
            trius alone in the tent, although he never before had shared <lb/>
            his secret thoughts even with his son, but had always <lb/>
            privately formed his own plans, and publicly carried them <lb/>
            out on his own responsibility. It is said that Demetrius, <lb/>
            when still very young, once asked him at what hour he <lb/>
            proposed to march, to which Antigonus angrily answered, <lb/>
            “ Do you fear, that you alone will not hear the sound cf <lb/>
            the trumpet?"</p>
          <p>XXIX. On this occasion it appears that they were also <lb/>
            disheartened by sinister omens. Demetrius dreamed that <lb/>
            Alexander appeared before him in shining armour, and <lb/>
            inquired what would be their watch-word for the battle. <lb/>
            When Demetrius answered “ Zeus and victory," Alexander <lb/>
            replied, ”I will go away now, and tell this to the enemy; <lb/>
            for I am going over to them." Antigonus, too, as he <lb/>
            stepped out of his tent to see his line formed stumbled and <lb/>
            fell heavily upon his face. When he rose, he lifted his <lb/>
            hands to heaven and prayed to the gods that they would <lb/>
            either grant him victory or a painless death before his <lb/>
            army was routed.</p>
          <p>When the battle began, Demetrius with the flower of <lb/>
            the cavalry charged Antiochus the son of Seleukus, and <lb/>
            brilliantly routed the enemy, but he lost the day by his <lb/>
            headstrong eagerness to pursue too far. He was unable <lb/>
            to rejoin the infantry, for the enemy's elephants interposed <lb/>
            between him and the phalanx, which was thus left without <lb/>
            any cavalry to cover its flanks. Seeing this, Seleukus <lb/>
            kept the rest of his cavalry ever threatening to charge, <lb/>
            but never actually doing so, hovering near the phalanx <lb/>
            and both terrifying it and giving the men an opportunity of <lb/>
            changing sides, which indeed took place; for a great mass <lb/>
            of Antigonus's infantry came over to Seleukus, and the <lb/>
            rest fled. Many enemies now beset Antigonus, and one of <lb/>
            his attendants said to him, “ My king, it is you whom <lb/>
            they are making for." “ Why," replied he, “ what other <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            mark could they have but me? But Demetrius will <lb/>
            soon be here to the rescue." While he looked round <lb/>
            hoping in vain to see his son, a shower of darts fell, and <lb/>
            laid him low. All his friends and attendants now fled, <lb/>
            except one named Thorax, a native of Larissa, who <lb/>
            remained by the corpse.</p>
          <p>XXX. After this battle the victorious kings proceeded <lb/>
            to divide the empire of Antigonus and Demetrius amongst <lb/>
            them, each annexing the portion which lay nearest to his <lb/>
            own dominions, as though they were cutting slices out of <lb/>
            some huge slaughtered beast. Demetrius fled with five <lb/>
            thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry, and <lb/>
            directed his march with the utmost speed towards <lb/>
            Ephesus. All imagined that in his distress for money he <lb/>
            would not spare the rich temple there, and he himself, <lb/>
            fearing lest his soldiers should do so, set sail as quickly as <lb/>
            possible for Greece, as his chief hopes now lay in Athens. <lb/>
            Indeed he had left there a part of his fleet, some treasure <lb/>
            and his wife Deidameia, and imagined that he could find <lb/>
            no surer refuge in his adversity than Athens, where he <lb/>
            felt assured of the loyalty of the people. But while he <lb/>
            was passing the Cyclades he met an embassy from Athens <lb/>
            begging him not to approach that city, since the people <lb/>
            had decreed that none of the kings should be admitted <lb/>
            within its walls. The ambassadors added that his wife <lb/>
            Deidameia had been escorted with due honour and respect <lb/>
            to Megara. On hearing this, Demetrius, who had borne <lb/>
            the rest of his misfortunes with the utmost serenity, and <lb/>
            had never hitherto allowed an unworthy expression to <lb/>
            escape him, became transported with anger. He was, in <lb/>
            truth, bitterly grieved at being thus unexpectedly betrayed <lb/>
            by the Athenians, and at finding that their apparent <lb/>
            enthusiasm in his cause had all the while been unreal and <lb/>
            fictitious. Apparently the bestowal of excessive honours <lb/>
            upon kings and potentates by the people is but a poor <lb/>
            test of their real loyalty, for the essence of these honours <lb/>
            lies in their being freely offered, and they are worthless <lb/>
            if prompted by fear; and men fawn upon those they fear <lb/>
            just as they do upon those whom they really love. For <lb/>
            this reason sensible man know how to value the erection of <lb/>
            their statues, flattering decrees, and other public honours, <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            by reflecting upon what they themselves have done for <lb/>
            their admirers; for by this means they can discern <lb/>
            whether these are really genuine expressions of respect, or <lb/>
            are extorted by terror; for peoples frequently confer <lb/>
            these very distinctions upon men whom they hate and <lb/>
            abhor, but whom they are forced to honour against their <lb/>
            will.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Demetrius, although he considered that he had <lb/>
            been very badly treated by the Athenians, was powerless <lb/>
            to resent their conduct. He sent an embassy to Athens, <lb/>
            gently complaining of their conduct, and requesting that <lb/>
            they would restore his ships, one of which was a vessel of <lb/>
            thirteen banks of oars. Having received them he coasted <lb/>
            along as far as the Isthmus, where he found that all his <lb/>
            garrisons had been driven out of the cities, and that the <lb/>
            whole country had gone over to his enemies. He now <lb/>
            left Pyrrhus to act as his lieutenant in Greece, and himself <lb/>
            sailed to the Chersonese.* Here he enriched his troops at <lb/>
            the expense of Lysimachus by plundering the country, <lb/>
            and soon found means again to collect a very consider­ <lb/>
            able army. The other kings paid no regard to Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus, thinking that he was no better a man than Demetrius, <lb/>
            and more to be feared because he was more powerful.</p>
          <p>Not long after this Seleukus sent an embassy to Deme­ <lb/>
            trius to make proposals for the hand of Stratonike, the <lb/>
            daughter of Demetrius by his wife Phila. Seleukus <lb/>
            already had one son named Antiochus by his wife Apama, <lb/>
            a Persian lady, but he thought that his empire would <lb/>
            suffice for more than one heir, and he desired to form an <lb/>
            alliance with Demetrius, because Lysimachus had recently <lb/>
            married one of Ptolemy's daughters himself, and taken <lb/>
            the other for his son Agathokles. To Demetrius this <lb/>
            offer of marriage from Seleukus was a most unexpected <lb/>
            piece of good fortune. He placed his daughter on board <lb/>
            ship, and sailed with his entire fleet to Syria. On his <lb/>
            way he was forced to land several times to obtain supplies, <lb/>
            especially on the coast of Cilicia, which province, after <lb/>
            the battle in which Antigonus fell, had been bestowed <lb/>
            upon Pleistarchus, the brother of Kassander. Pleistarchus <lb/>
            took umbrage at the intrusion of Demetrius into his <note type="footnote"> * The Thracian Chersonese. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            territory, and retired to Macedonia to complain to his <lb/>
            brother that Seleukus was betraying the other kings by <lb/>
            making terms with the common enemy of them all.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Demetrius, when he discovered the intentions <lb/>
            of Pleistarchus, proceeded at once to Quinda, where he <lb/>
            found the sum of twelve hundred talents still remaining. <lb/>
            Having made himself master of this, he quickly reem­ <lb/>
            barked and put to sea. He was now joined by his wife <lb/>
            Phila, and met Seleukus at Rhossas. Here the two princes <lb/>
            conversed together in a truly royal style, without the <lb/>
            least suspicion or fear of treachery. First Seleukus feasted <lb/>
            Demetrius in his tent in the midst of his camp, and after­ <lb/>
            wards Demetrius entertained him at a banquet on board <lb/>
            his great thirteen-banked ship. They also talked freely <lb/>
            together for a long time, spending several days in <lb/>
            friendly intercourse without any body-guard or arms, till <lb/>
            at length Seleukus took Stratonike, and escorted her with <lb/>
            great pomp to Antiocheia.* Demetrius now made himself <lb/>
            master of Cilicia, and sent his wife Phila to her brother, <lb/>
            Kassander, to answer the accusations brought against him <lb/>
            by Pleistarchus. During this time Deidameia sailed from <lb/>
            Greece and joined Demetrius, but not long after her <lb/>
            arrival she sickened and died. By the good offices of <lb/>
            Seleukus, Demetrius was now reconciled with Ptolemy, <lb/>
            and arranged to take Ptolemäis, Ptolemy's daughter, for <lb/>
            his wife. So far Seleukus behaved very well; but he <lb/>
            could not prevail upon Demetrius to give up Cilicia to <lb/>
            him for a sum of money, and when he angrily demanded <lb/>
            the surrender of Tyre and Sidon, his conduct appears very <lb/>
            overbearing and ungenerous, as though he, who had made <lb/>
            himself master of all the country between the Red Sea <lb/>
            and the Mediterranean, were so poor and needy as to be­ <lb/>
            obliged to squabble with his father-in-law about two <lb/>
            cities, at a time, too, when the latter was suffering from a <lb/>
            great reverse of fortune. How strongly does this bear out <lb/>
            the truth of Plato's maxim, that he who wishes to be <lb/>
            really rich ought to lessen his desires rather than increase <lb/>
            his property, because if a man places no bounds to his <lb/>
            covetousness, he never will be free from want and <lb/>
            misery. <note type="footnote"> *The capital city of Seleukus, now Antioch. </note> <pb n="243"/>
             </p>
          <p>XXXIIL Demetrius on this occasion showed no want <lb/>
            of spirit. He declared that not if he had lost ten thousand <lb/>
            fields like Ipsus would he consent to buy Seleukus for his <lb/>
            son-in-law. He strengthened the garrisons of the cities,. <lb/>
            and hearing that Lachares, taking advantage of the factions <lb/>
            into which the Athenians were divided, had made himself <lb/>
            despot of that city, he thought that if he only were to show <lb/>
            himself before Athens he might easily obtain possession of <lb/>
            it. He crossed the sea in safety with a large fleet, but <lb/>
            when off the coast of Attica he encountered a violent storm, <lb/>
            in which he lost most of his ships and a great number of <lb/>
            his men. He himself escaped unhurt, and at once began <lb/>
            to make war against the Athenians. As, however, he could <lb/>
            not effect anything, he sent his lieutenants to collect an­ <lb/>
            other fleet, and meanwhile proceeded to Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            Here he laid siege to Messene, and during an assault nearly <lb/>
            lost his life, for he was struck full in the face by a dart <lb/>
            from a catapult, which pierced through his jaw into his <lb/>
            mouth. He recovered from his wound, received the sub­ <lb/>
            mission of several insurgent cities, and returned to Attica, <lb/>
            where he made himself master of Eleusis and Rhamnus, <lb/>
            and ravaged the country. He captured a ship loaded with <lb/>
            wheat bound for Athens, and hanged the captain and pilot, <lb/>
            which measure terrified the other merchants so much that <lb/>
            they avoided Athens, and a terrible famine took place there, <lb/>
            and the want of food brought about a scarcity of everything <lb/>
            else. A medimnus t of salt was sold for forty drachmas, <lb/>
            and a modius ‡ of corn sold for three hundred drachmas.</p>
          <p>The Athenians gained a short respite from their sufferings <lb/>
            by the appearance near Ægina of a fleet of a hundred and <lb/>
            fifty sail, which was sent by Ptolemy to aid them. Soon, <lb/>
            however, Demetrius collected from Peloponnesus and Cyprus <lb/>
            a fleet of three hundred ships, before which those of Pto­ <lb/>
            lemy were forced to retire. Upon this the despot Lachares <lb/>
            made his escape and abandoned the city to its fate.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The Athenians, although they had decreed <lb/>

            terms with Demetrius should be put to death, now at once <lb/>
            opened their nearest gates and sent an embassy to him; <lb/>
            not that they expected to be well treated by him, but <lb/>
            acting under the pressure of starvation. It was said that, <lb/>
            among other painful incidents, it happened that a father <lb/>
            and a son were sitting in the same room, without any <lb/>
            hopes of surviving, when a dead mouse fell from the roof, <lb/>
            upon which they both started up and began to fight for <lb/>
            it. We are told that during this time the philosopher <lb/>
            Epikurus kept his disciples alive by counting out to them <lb/>
            a fixed allowance of beans every day. This was the con­ <lb/>
            dition of the city when Demetrius made his entry into it. <lb/>
            He ordered all the Athenians to assemble in the theatre, <lb/>
            occupied the stage with armed men, placing his own body- <lb/>
            guard round the part usually reserved for the actors, and <lb/>
            made his appearance, like a tragic actor, through the <lb/>
            entrance at the back.- The Athenians were greatly <lb/>
            terrified at these proceedings, but the first words of his <lb/>
            address put an end to their fears. He spoke in a mild <lb/>
            and conciliatory tone, briefly and gently complained of <lb/>
            their conduct towards him, and announced his forgive­ <lb/>
            ness of them. He distributed among them one hundred <lb/>
            thousand medimni of wheat, and appointed the most <lb/>
            popular men in the city to the vacant magistracies. <lb/>
            Dromokleides the orator, seeing that the people could <lb/>
            scarcely find enough means to express their delight, and <lb/>
            that they were eager to outdo the panegyrics which were <lb/>
            being lavished upon Demetrius from the bema, proposed <lb/>
            that the ports of Peiræus and Munychia should be handed <lb/>
            over to King Demetrius. When this was agreed to, <lb/>
            Demetrius himself placed a garrison in the Museum, by <lb/>
            which he intended to curb the people in case they should <lb/>
            grow restive and take off his attention from his other <lb/>
            enterprises.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Being now master of Athens, Demetrius at <lb/>
            once began to attack Lacedæmon. He met the King of <lb/>
            Sparta, Archidamus, near Mantinea, defeated him, and <lb/>
            invaded Laconia, driving the beaten army before him. <lb/>
            He fought a second battle before the walls of Sparta itself, <note type="footnote"> * By the entrance commonly assigned to the principal person in a <lb/>
            drama. - Thirlwall. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            In which he killed two hundred Spartans, and took five <lb/>
            hundred prisoners; and he very nearly took the city <lb/>
            itself, which up to that time had never been taken, <lb/>
            Fortune, however, seems to have introduced greater and <lb/>
            more sudden vicissitudes into the life of Demetrius than <lb/>
            into that of any other prince, for he was constantly rising <lb/>
            from the most abject poverty to the highest pinnacles of <lb/>
            wealth and power, and then being as suddenly cast down <lb/>
            again. He himself is said, when his fortunes were at <lb/>
            their lowest, to have quoted the verse of Æschylus, <lb/>
            " Thou raisest up, and thou dost biing me down." <lb/>
            So at this time, when everything seemed to be succeeding, <lb/>
            and his empire and power constantly increasing, Demetrius <lb/>
            received the news that Lysimachus had taken all the <lb/>
            cities in Asia which had bel. onged to him, and that Ptolemy <lb/>
            had made himself master of Cyprus with the exception of <lb/>
            Salamis, which he was besieging, in which city was the <lb/>
            mother and the children of Demetrius. Yet, like the <lb/>
            woman spoken of by the poet Archilochus, who deceitfully <lb/>
            offers water in one hand, while she holds a firebrand in <lb/>
            the other, the fortune of Demetrius, after scaring him <lb/>
            away from the conquest of Sparta by these terrifying <lb/>
            pieces of intelligence, at once offered him hopes of accom­ <lb/>
            plishing a new and mighty enterprise, in the following <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. After the death of Kassander, his eldest son <lb/>
            Philip ascended the throne, but not long afterwards died. <lb/>
            Upon this Kassander's two younger sons each aspired to <lb/>
            the crown. One of them, Antipater, murdered his mother <lb/>
            Thessalonike, upon which the other * invited Pyrrhus to <lb/>
            come from Epirus, and Demetrius from Peloponnesus, to <lb/>
            support his claims. Pyrrhus was the first to arrive, and <lb/>
            demanded so large a portion of the kingdom of Macedonia <lb/>
            as the price of his assistance, that he soon became an object <lb/>
            of terror to Alexander. When Demetrius, in answer to <lb/>
            the appeal of Alex ander, arrived with his army, Alexander <lb/>
            was even more terrified, because of his great renown. He <lb/>
            met Demetrius near Dium, and welcomed him as an <lb/>
            honoured guest, but gave him to understand that he uc <note type="footnote"> * Alexander, Antipater's younger brother. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            longer stood in need of his services. Upon this each <lb/>
            began to suspect the other, and Demetrius, when he was <lb/>
            proceeding to a banquet to which he had been invited by <lb/>
            the young prince, was warned that his host intended to <lb/>
            assassinate him while they were drinking after dinner. <lb/>
            Demetrius was not in the least disturbed at this intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, but merely delayed going to the banquet for a <lb/>
            short time, while he ordered his officers to keep their men <lb/>
            under arms, and bade his personal followers and pages, <lb/>
            who far out-numbered the retinue of Alexander, to enter <lb/>
            the banqueting hall with him, and to remain there until <lb/>
            he left the table. Alarmed by these precautions, Alex­ <lb/>
            under did not venture to offer him any violence; and <lb/>
            Demetrius soon left the room, excusing himself on the <lb/>
            ground that his health would not permit him to drink <lb/>
            wine. On the following day Demetrius made preparations <lb/>
            for departure, announcing that he had received news <lb/>
            which made this necessary. He begged Alexander to <lb/>
            pardon him for so sudden a retreat, and promised that <lb/>
            when he was more at leisure he would pay him another <lb/>
            visit. Alexander was delighted at this, thinking that <lb/>
            Demetrius was leaving the country of his own free-will, <lb/>
            and not as an enemy; and he escorted him as far as the <lb/>
            borders of Thessaly. When they reached Larissa, each <lb/>
            again invited the other to a banquet, each intending to <lb/>
            murder the other. This decided the fall of Alexander, <lb/>
            who fell into his own trap, being loth to show any <lb/>
            distrust of Demetrius, lest Demetrius should distrust him. <lb/>
            He accepted Demetrius's invitation to a banquet, during <lb/>
            which Demetrius suddenly rose. Alexander in alarm also <lb/>
            started to his feet, and followed Demetrius towards the <lb/>
            door. Demetrius as he passed the door said to his body- <lb/>
            guard, " Kill the man who follows me," and walked on. <lb/>
            Alexander, who followed him, was cut down by the guard, <lb/>
            as were his friends, who rushed to his assistance. One of <lb/>
            these men when dying is said to have remarked that <lb/>
            Demetrius had got the start of them by one day.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. The night was spent in tumult and alarm. <lb/>
            At daybreak the Macedonians, who had feared an attack <lb/>
            from the army of Demetrius, became reassured, as nothing <lb/>
            of the kind took place; and when Demetrius intimated <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            to them his wish to address them and to explain his <lb/>
            conduct, they received him in a friendly manner. When <lb/>
            he appeared, he had no need to make a long speech, for <lb/>
            the Macedonians, who hated Antipater for having <lb/>
            murdered his mother, and who knew not where to look <lb/>
            for a better sovereign, saluted Demetrius as King of the <lb/>
            Macedonians, and at once conducted him into Macedonia. <lb/>
            The new reign was not displeasing to the remainder of <lb/>
            the Macedonians, who had never forgotten the disgraceful <lb/>
            couduct of Kassander after the death of Alexander. If <lb/>
            any remembrance of the moderation of their old governor <lb/>
            Antipater still remained amongst them, Demetrius reaped <lb/>
            the benefit of it, as his wife Phila was the daughter of <lb/>
            Antipater, and his son,* by her, who was nearly grown <lb/>
            up, and accompanied his father on this campaign, was <lb/>
            now the heir to the throne.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After this brilliant piece of good fortune, <lb/>
            Demetrius received the news that his mother and children <lb/>
            had been set at liberty by Ptolemy, who had given them <lb/>
            presents and treated them with respect; while he also <lb/>
            heard that his daughter, who had been given in marriage <lb/>
            to Seleukus, was living with his son Antiochus, with the <lb/>
            title of " queen of the native tribes of the interior." It <lb/>
            appears that Antiochus fell violently in love with Strata­ <lb/>
            nike, who was quite a young girl, though she had already <lb/>
            borne a child to Seleukus. After making many fruitless <lb/>
            efforts to resist his passion, he reflected upon the wicked­ <lb/>
            ness of indulging a love which he was unable to restrain, <lb/>
            and decided that he would put an end to his life. Under <lb/>
            pretence of illness he refused to take nourishment, neg­ <lb/>
            lected his person, and was quietly sinking. Erasistratus, <lb/>
            his physician, had without nuch difficulty perceived <lb/>
            that he was in love, but could not guess with whom. <lb/>
            He consequently spent the entire day in the same room <lb/>
            with Antiochus, and whenever any young persons came <lb/>
            to visit him, narrowly watched his countenance and those <lb/>
            parts by which emotion is especially betrayed. He found <lb/>
            that his condition was unaltered except when Stratonike <lb/>
            came to see him, either alone or with her husband, <lb/>
            Seleukus, and that then all the symptoms mentioned by <note type="footnote"> * Antigonus, surnamed Gouatas, afterwards King of Macedonia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            Sappho were visible in him, such as stammering, fiery <lb/>
            blushes, failure of eyesight, violent perspiration, disturbed <lb/>
            and quickened pulse, and at length, as his passions gained <lb/>
            the mastery over him, pallor and bewilderment. Erasis­ <lb/>
            tratus, after making these observations, reflected that it <lb/>
            was not probable that the king's son would starve himself <lb/>
            to death in silence for love of any other woman than his <lb/>
            mother-in-law. He judged it to be a perilous enterprise to <lb/>
            explain the real state of the case, but, nevertheless, trusting <lb/>
            to the love of Seleukus for his son, he one day ventured to <lb/>
            tell him that love was really the disorder from which <lb/>
            young Antiochus was suffering, and that it was a hopeless <lb/>
            and incurable passion. " How incurable ? " inquired Seleu­ <lb/>
            kus. "Because," answered Erasistratus, " he is in love <lb/>
            with my wife." " Well, then," said Seleukus, " will you <lb/>
            not give her up, Erasistratus, and marry her to my son, <lb/>
            who is your friend, especially as that is the only way out <lb/>
            of this trouble for us ? " " No," said Erasistratus, " I will <lb/>
            not. Why, you yourself, although you are his father, <lb/>
            would not do this, if Antiochus were enamoured of Strato­ <lb/>
            nike." To this Seleukus replied, "My friend, I would <lb/>
            that by any means, human or divine, his passion could <lb/>
            be directed to her; for I would willingly even give up <lb/>
            my crown if I could thereby save Antiochus."</p>
          <p>When Seleukus, in a tone of deep feeling and with tears <lb/>
            in his eyes, made this avowal, Erasistratus took him by <lb/>
            the hand, in token of good faith, and declared that his <lb/>
            own services were quite useless, for that Seleukus himself <lb/>
            was best able to heal the disorders which had arisen in <lb/>
            his household. After this Seleukus convoked a general <lb/>
            assembly of his people, and declared to them that he had <lb/>
            determined to nominate Antiochus king, and Stratonike <lb/>
            queen of all the nations of the interior, and that they were <lb/>
            to be married. He believed, he said, that his son, who <lb/>
            had always been accustomed to obey him, would raise no <lb/>
            objection to the marriage; and that if his wife was dis­ <lb/>
            contented with it on the ground of its illegality, he begged <lb/>
            his friends to argue with her and persuade her to regard <lb/>
            everything as legal and honourable which the king decided <lb/>
            upon as expedient. In this manner it is said to have come <lb/>
            to pass that Antiochus was married to Stratonike.</p><pb n="249"/>
            
          <p>XXXIX. After obtaining Macedonia, Demetrius made <lb/>
            himself master of Thessaly also. As he possessed the <lb/>
            greater part of Peloponnesus, besides Megara and Athens, <lb/>
            he now marched against Bœotia. At first the Bœotians <lb/>
            came to terms, and formed an alliance with him, but <lb/>
            afterwards, when Kleonymus of Sparta came to Thebes <lb/>
            with an army, and Pisis, the most influential citizen of <lb/>
            Thespiæ, encouraged them to recover their liberty, they <lb/>
            revolted from Demetrius. Upon this, Demetrius brought <lb/>
            up his famous siege train to attack their cities.. Kleony­ <lb/>
            mus was so terrified that he secretly withdrew, and the <lb/>
            Bœotians were scared into submission. Demetrius, though <lb/>
            he garrisoned all their cities with his own troops, levied <lb/>
            a large sum of money, and left Hieronymus t the historian <lb/>
            as governor of the province, was thought to have dealt <lb/>
            very mildly with the Bœotians, especially because of his <lb/>
            treatment of Pisis; for he not only dismissed him un­ <lb/>
            harmed when brought before him as a prisoner, but <lb/>
            conversed with him in a friendly manner, and nominated <lb/>
            him polemarch of Thespiæ.</p>
          <p>- Not long after these events, Lysimachus was taken <lb/>
            prisoner by Dromichætus. Upon this, Demetrius at once <lb/>
            hurriedly marched towards Thrace, hoping to find it <lb/>
            unguarded. The Bœotians seized the opportunity of his <lb/>
            absence to revolt, while news was brought to Demetlius <lb/>
            that Lysimachus had been dismissed by his captors. <lb/>
            Enraged at this, he speedily returned, and finding that <lb/>
            the Boeotians had been defeated in a pitched battle by <lb/>
            his son Antigonus, he a second time laid siege to Thebes.</p>
          <p>XL. However, as Pyrrhus was now overrunning Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, and had pushed even as far as Thermopylae, Deme­ <lb/>
            trius left Antigonus to prosecute the siege, and himself <lb/>
            marched to attack Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus beat a hasty retreat, <lb/>
            and Demetrius, leaving ten thousand infantry and a <lb/>
            thousand cavalry in Thessaly, returned to press the siege <lb/>
            of Thebes. He now brought up his great machine, called <lb/>
            the " City-taker," which was moved by levers with great <lb/>
            difficulty on account of its enormous weight; so that it <note type="footnote"> * He laid siege to Thebes, the only important city in Bœotia, which <lb/>
            seems to have quickly recovered itself after its destruction by <lb/>
            Alexander. </note><note type="footnote">† O. Kardia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            is said that in two months it hardly moved two furlongs. <lb/>
            The Bœotians made a vigorous defence, and Demetrius <lb/>
            frequently forced his soldiers to engage in battle with <lb/>
            them, more out of arrogance than through any real neces. <lb/>
            sity for fighting. After one of these battles, Antigonus, <lb/>
            grieved at the number of men who had fallen, said, " My <lb/>
            father, why do we allow all these men to perish, when <lb/>
            there is no occasion for it?" Demetrius sharply an­ <lb/>
            swered, " Why do you take offence at this ? Do you have <lb/>
            to pay the dead ? " Yet Demetrius, not wishing it to be <lb/>
            thought that he was lavish of other men's blood and not <lb/>
            of his own, but being anxious to fight among the foremost, <lb/>
            was wounded by a dart thrown from a catapult, which <lb/>
            pierced through his neck. He suffered much from this <lb/>
            wound, but still continued the siege, and at length took <lb/>
            Thebes for the second time. When he entered the city, <lb/>
            he inspired the citizens with the most intense terror, as <lb/>
            they expected to be treated with the greatest severity. <lb/>
            He was satisfied, however, with putting to death thirteen <lb/>
            of the citizens, and banishing a few others. Thus was <lb/>
            Thebes taken twice within less than ten years since it was <lb/>
            first rebuilt.</p>
          <p>As the time for the Pythian games had now come <lb/>
            round, Demetrius took upon himself to make a most <lb/>
            startling innovation. As the passes leading to Delphi <lb/>
            were held by the Ætolians, he celebrated the games in <lb/>
            Athens, declaring that it was right that especial honour <lb/>
            should be paid there to Apollo, who is the tutelary god <lb/>
            of the Athenians, and is said to have been the founder of <lb/>
            their race.</p>
          <p>XLI. Demetrius now returned to Macedonia. As he <lb/>
            could not bear a life of repose, and found that his subjects <lb/>
            were more easily governed on a campaign, since they <lb/>
            were troublesome and turbulent when at home, he <lb/>
            marched against the Ætolians. After laying waste their <lb/>
            country he left Pantauchus there with a large portion of <lb/>
            his army, and with the rest marched to attack Pyrrhus. <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was equally eager to meet him, but they missed <lb/>
            each other, so that Demetrius invaded and ravaged <lb/>
            Epirus, while Pyrrhus * fell in with Pantauchus and <note type="footnote"> * See vol. iL. Life of Pyrrhus, ch. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            fought with him. He himself exchanged blows with <lb/>
            Pantauchus and put him to flight, killing many of his <lb/>
            followers, and taking five thousand prisoners. This did <lb/>
            more damage to the cause of Demetrius than anything <lb/>
            else ; for Pyrrhus was not so much disliked for the harm <lb/>
            which he had done them, as he was admired for his <lb/>
            personal prowess. His fame became great in Macedonia <lb/>
            after this battle, and many Macedonians were heard to <lb/>
            say that he alone, of all the princes of the time, revived <lb/>
            the image of Alexander's daring courage, while the rest, <lb/>
            and especially Demetrius, only imitated his demeanour <lb/>
            by their threatrical pomp and trappings of royalty. <lb/>
            Indeed, Demetrius gave himself the most extravagant <lb/>
            airs, wearing magnificent purple robes and hats with a <lb/>
            double crown, and even wore shoes of purple felt em­ <lb/>
            broidered with gold. There was a cloak which was for <lb/>
            a long time being embroidered for his use, a most <lb/>
            extravagantly showy piece of work, upon which was <lb/>
            depicted a figure of the world and of the heavenly bodies. <lb/>
            This cloak was left unfinished when Demetrius lost his <lb/>
            crown, and none of his successors on the throne of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia ever presumed to wear it, although some of them <lb/>
            were very ostentatious princes.</p>
          <p>XLII. The spectacle of this unusual pomp irritated the <lb/>
            Macedonians, who were not accustomed to see their kings <lb/>
            thus attired, while the luxury and extravagance of <lb/>
            Demetrius's mode of life also gave offence to them. They <lb/>
            were especially enraged at his haughty reserve, and the <lb/>
            difficulty of obtaining access to him ; for he either refused <lb/>
            to grant an interview, or else treated those who were <lb/>
            admitted to his presence with harshness and insolence. <lb/>
            He kept an embassy of the Athenians, whom he respected <lb/>
            beyond all other Greeks, waiting for two years for an <lb/>
            audience; and when one ambassador arrived from Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, he construed it as a mark of disrespect, and was <lb/>
            angry. But when Demetrius said to the ambassador:— <lb/>
            " What is this that you tell me ? the Lacedæmonians have <lb/>
            sent one ambassador! " " Yes," answered he cleverly and <lb/>
            laconically, " one ambassador to one king."</p>
          <p>One day when Demetrius came out of his palace he <lb/>
            appeared to be in a more affable humour than usual, and <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            willing to converse with his subjects. Upon this, many <lb/>
            persons ran to present him with written statements of <lb/>
            their grievances. As he received them all and placed <lb/>
            them in the folds of his cloak, the petitioners were greatly <lb/>
            delighted, and accompanied him; but when he came to <lb/>
            the bridge over the Axius, he emptied them all out of his <lb/>
            cloak into the river. This conduct greatly exasperated <lb/>
            the Macedonians, who declared that they were insulted <lb/>
            instead of being governed by him, and who remembered <lb/>
            or were told by older men how gentle and easy of access <lb/>
            Philip was always wont to be.</p>
          <p>Once an old woman met him when he was walking, and <lb/>
            begged repeatedly for a hearing. When he replied that <lb/>
            he had no leisure to attend to her, she loudly cried out, <lb/>
            " Then be king no more." Stung by this taunt he re­ <lb/>
            turned to his palace, and gave audiences to all who wished <lb/>
            it, beginning with the old woman, and so continued for <lb/>
            many days. Indeed nothing becomes a king so much as <lb/>
            to do justice to his subjects. As Timotheus the poet has <lb/>
            it, Ares is a despot, but Pindar tells us that law is lord of <lb/>
            all. Homer also says that kings have been entrusted by <lb/>
            Zeus, not with City-takers or brazen-bound ships, but with <lb/>
            justice, which they must keep and respect; and that Zeus <lb/>
            does not love the most warlike or the most unjust of kings, <lb/>
            but the most righteous, and calls him his friend and dis­ <lb/>
            ciple. Demetrius however rejoiced in being called by a <lb/>
            name most unlike that of the Lord of Heaven, for his title <lb/>
            is " The Preserver of Cities," while Demetrius was known <lb/>
            as " The Besieger." Thus through the worship of mere <lb/>
            brute force, the bad gradually overcame the good side of <lb/>
            his character, and his fame became sullied by the unworthy <lb/>
            acts with which it was associated.</p>
          <p>XLIII. While Demetrius lay dangerously ill at Pella, <lb/>
            he very nearly lost his kingdom, as Pyrrhus invaded the <lb/>
            country and briskly overran it as far as Edessa. However, <lb/>
            on his recovery, Demetrius easily drove Pyrrhus out of <lb/>
            Macedonia, and then made terms with him, because he <lb/>
            did not wish to be entangled in a border warfare, which <lb/>
            would interfere with the realisation of his more important <lb/>
            projects. He meditated a colossal enterprise indeed, <lb/>
            nothing less than the recovery of the whole of his father's <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            empire. His preparations were on a commensurate scale, <lb/>
            for he had collected a force of ninety-eight thousand foot <lb/>
            soldiers and nearly twelve thousand horse, while at <lb/>
            Peiræus, Corinth, Lhalkis, and the ports near Pella he <lb/>
            was engaged in the construction of a fleet of five hundred <lb/>
            ships. He himself personally superintended the works, <lb/>
            visiting each dockyard and giving directions to the <lb/>
            artificers; and all men were astounded not only at the <lb/>
            number, but at the size of the vessels which were being <lb/>
            built. Before his time no one had ever seen a ship of <lb/>
            fifteen or sixteen banks of oars, although in later times <lb/>
            Ptolemy Philopator built a ship of forty banks of oars, <lb/>
            which measured two hundred and eighty cubits in length, <lb/>
            and forty-eight cubits in height. This ship was navigated <lb/>
            by four hundred sailors, four thousand rowers, and, besides <lb/>
            all these, had room upon its decks for nearly three thou­ <lb/>
            sand soldiers. But this ship was merely for show, and <lb/>
            differed little from a fixed building, being totally useless, <lb/>
            and only moved with great risk and labour; whereas the <lb/>
            beauty of-the ships of Demetrius did not render them less <lb/>
            serviceable, nor was their equipment so elaborate as to <lb/>
            interfere with their use, but they were no less admirable <lb/>
            for speed and strength as for greatness of size.</p>
          <p>XLIV. When this great armament, the largest ever <lb/>
            collected since the death of Alexander, began to menace <lb/>
            Asia, the three princes, Ptolemy, Seleukus, and Lysimachus, <lb/>
            formed a confederation to oppose it. They next sent a <lb/>
            joint letter to Pyrrhus, in which they urged him to attack <lb/>
            Macedonia, and not to pay any regard to a peace by which <lb/>
            Demetrius had not made any engagement not to go to war <lb/>
            with him, but had merely obtained time to attack the <lb/>
            others first. Pyrrhus agreed to this proposal, and Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, before his preparations were completed, found him­ <lb/>
            self involved in a war of considerable magnitude: for <lb/>
            Ptolemy sailed to Greece with a large fleet and caused it <lb/>
            to revolt from Demetrius, while Lysimachus from Thrace <lb/>
            and Pyrrhus from Epirus invaded Macedonia and ravaged <lb/>
            the country. Demetrius left his son to command in <lb/>
            Greece, and himself marched to attack Lysimachus, in <lb/>
            order to free Macedonia from the enemy. He shortly, <lb/>
            however, received the news that Pyrrhus had taken the <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            city of Berœa, and when the Macedonians heard this, <lb/>
            there was an end to all discipline, for the camp was full <lb/>
            of tears and lamentations, and abuse of Demetrius. The <lb/>
            men no longer cared to remain with him, but became <lb/>
            eager to go away, nominally to their homes, but really to <lb/>
            desert to Lysimachus. Demetrius upon this determined <lb/>
            to place the greatest possible distance between Lysimachus <lb/>
            and himself, and accordingly marched to attack Pyrrhus; <lb/>
            reasoning that Lysimachus was a native of Macedonia, <lb/>
            and was popular with many of the Macedonians because <lb/>
            he had been a companion of Alexander, while he thought <lb/>
            that the Macedonians would not prefer a foreigner like <lb/>
            Pyrrhus to himself. However, in this expectation he was <lb/>
            freatlydeceived: for as soon as he encamped near <lb/>
            yri hus, his soldiers had a constant opportunity of admir­ <lb/>
            ing his personal prowess in battle, and they had from the <lb/>
            most ancient times been accustomed to think that the best <lb/>
            warrior is the best king. When besides this they learned <lb/>
            how leniently Pyrrhus had dealt with the captives, as <lb/>
            they had long been determined to transfer their allegiance <lb/>
            from Demetrius to some one else, they now gladly agreed <lb/>
            that it should be to Pyrrhus. At first they deserted to <lb/>
            him secretly and few at a time; but soon the whole camp <lb/>
            became excited and disturbed, and at last some had the <lb/>
            audacity to present themselves before Demetrius, and bid <lb/>
            him seek safety in flight, for the Macedonians were tired <lb/>
            of fighting to maintain his extravagance. Compared with <lb/>
            the harsh language held by many other Macedonians, <lb/>
            this appeared to Demetrius to be very reasonable advice, <lb/>
            and so proceeding to his tent, as though he were really a <lb/>
            play-actor and not a king, he changed his theatrical cloak <lb/>
            for one of a dark colour, and made his way out of the <lb/>
            camp unobserved. Most of his soldiery at once betook <lb/>
            themselves to plundering, and while they were quar­ <lb/>
            relling with one another over the spoils of the royal tent, <lb/>
            Pyrrhus appeared, encountered no resistance, and made <lb/>
            himself master of the camp. Pyrrhus and Lysimachus <lb/>
            now divided between them the kingdom of Macedonia, <lb/>
            which had for seven consecutive years been ruled by <lb/>
            Demetrius.</p>
          <p>XLV. After this great disaster, Demetrius retired to <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            Kassandreia. His wife Phila was greatly grieved at his <lb/>
            fall, and could not bear to see Demetrius a miserable fugi­ <lb/>
            tive and exile after having been a king. Despairing of <lb/>
            ever seeing better days, and bitterly reflecting how far her <lb/>
            husband's good luck was outweighed by his misfortunes, <lb/>
            she ended her life by poison. Now Demetrius, anxious to <lb/>
            save what he could from the wreck of his fortunes, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Greece, and there collected his generals and <lb/>
            forces. The verses spoken by Menelaus in Sophokles's <lb/>
            play­ <lb/>
            . But ever whirling on the wheel of fate <lb/>
            My fortune changes, like the changing moon <lb/>
            That never keeps her form two nights the same. <lb/>
            At first she comes with flattering countenance <lb/>
            And fills her orb; but when she is most bright <lb/>
            She wanes again, and loses all her light," <lb/>
            seem to express very well the strange waxing and waning <lb/>
            of the fortunes of Demetrius, who, as in the present in­ <lb/>
            stance, sometimes appeared to be quite extinguished, and <lb/>
            then burst forth again as brilliant as ever, as little by little <lb/>
            his power increased until he was able to carry out his plans. <lb/>
            At first he visited the various cities of Greece dressed as <lb/>
            a private man, without any of the insignia of royalty. <lb/>
            One of the Thebans seeing him in this guise, cleverly <lb/>
            applied to him the verses of Euripides: <lb/>
            "A god no more, but dressed in mortal guise, <lb/>
            He comes to where the springs of Dirké rise."</p>
          <p>XLVI. When he again hoped to regain the style of <lb/>
            royalty, and began to gather around him the form and <lb/>
            substance of an empire, he permitted the Thebans to <lb/>
            remain independent. The Athenians, however, revolted <lb/>
            from him. They erased the name of Diphilus, who was <lb/>
            inscribed upon the rolls as " priest of the Saviours," * and <lb/>
            decreed that archons should be elected after their ancestral <lb/>
            custom; and they also sent to Macedonia to invite Pyrrhus <lb/>
            to come and help them, as they perceived that Demetrius <lb/>
            was becoming more powerful than they had expected. <lb/>
            Demetrius indeed angrily marched upon Athens, and began <lb/>
            to besiege the city, but the philosopher Krates, an able <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>*See OIL It </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            and eloquent man, who was sent to make terms with him <lb/>
            by the Athenian people, partly by entreaties, and partly <lb/>
            by pointing out in what quarter his true interests lay, <lb/>
            prevailed upon him to raise the siege. Demetrius now <lb/>
            collected what ships he could, and with eleven thousand <lb/>
            infantry and a few cavalry soldiers sailed to Asia, intending <lb/>
            to detach the provinces of Lydia and Karia from Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus's dominions. At Miletus he was met by Eurydike,* <lb/>
            the sister of Phila, who brought him her daughter Ptole­ <lb/>
            mais, who had been long before promised to him in the <lb/>
            treaty concluded by the mediation of Seleukus. Demetrius <lb/>
            married her, and immediately after the wedding betook <lb/>
            himself to gaining over the cities of Ionia, some of which <lb/>
            joined him of their own accord, while others were forced <lb/>
            to yield to his arms. He also captured Sardis, and several <lb/>
            of the officers of Lysimachus deserted to him, bringing <lb/>
            him both soldiers and money. When, however, Lysi­ <lb/>
            uiachus's son Agathokles came to attack him with a large <lb/>
            force, he withdrew into Phrygia, meaning if possible to <lb/>
            gain possession of Armenia, stir up Media to revolt, and <lb/>
            make himself master of the provinces in the interior, <lb/>
            among which a fugitive could easily find an abundance <lb/>
            of places of refuge. Agathokles pressed him hard, and <lb/>
            Demetrius, although victorious in all the skirmishes which <lb/>
            took place, was reduced to great straits, as he was cut <lb/>
            off from his supplies of provisions and forage, while his <lb/>
            soldiers began to suspect him of meaning to lead them to <lb/>
            Armenia and Media. Famine now began to distress his <lb/>
            army, and he also lost a large body of men, who were <lb/>
            swept away in crossing the river Lykus through mis­ <lb/>
            taking the ford. Yet the men did not cease to joke; <lb/>
            and one of them wrote before the tent of Demetrius the <lb/>
            first verses of the play of CEdipus at Kolonus, slightly <lb/>
            altered: <lb/>
            " Child of Antigonus, the blind old man, <lb/>
            What place is this, at which we have arrived ?"</p>
          <p>XLVII. At last famine, as usually happens, produced a <lb/>
            pestilence, because the men ate whatever they could find; <lb/>
            and Demetrius, after losing no less than eight thousand, <note type="footnote"> * Wife of Ptolemy, King of Egypt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            gave up his project, and led back the remainder. He <lb/>
            proceeded to Tarsus, and would, if possible, have abstained <lb/>
            from living on the neighbouring country which belonged. <lb/>
            to Seleukus, and so giving him an excuse for attacking him. <lb/>
            However, this was impossible, as his soldiers were reduced <lb/>
            to the last extremities of want, and Agathokles had forti­ <lb/>
            fled the passes of the Taurus range of mountains. Deme­ <lb/>
            trius now wrote a letter to Seleukus, containing a long and <lb/>
            piteous account of his misfortunes, and begging Seleukus <lb/>
            as a relative to take pity on one who had suffered enough <lb/>
            to make even his enemies feel compassion for him. Seleukus <lb/>
            seems to have been touched by this appeal. He wrote to <lb/>
            his generals, ordering them to show Demetrius the respect <lb/>
            due to royalty, and to supply his troops with provisions; <lb/>
            but now Patrokles, who was thought to be a man of great <lb/>
            wisdom, and who was a friend of Seleukus, pointed out to <lb/>
            him that the expense of feeding the troops of Demetrius <lb/>
            was not a matter of great importance, but that it was a <lb/>
            grievous error to allow Demetrius himself to remain in his <lb/>
            territory. He reminded him that Demetrius had always <lb/>
            been the most turbulent and enterprising of princes, and <lb/>
            that he was now in a position which would urge the most <lb/>
            moderate and peaceable of men to deeds of reckless daring <lb/>
            and treachery. Struck by this reasoning, Seleukus started <lb/>
            for Cilicia in person, at the head of a large army. Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, astonished and alarmed at this rapid change in <lb/>
            Seleukus's attitude, retreated to a strong position at the <lb/>
            foot of the Taurus mountains, and in a second letter <lb/>
            requested Seleukus to allow him to conquer some native <lb/>
            territory occupied by independent tribes, in which he <lb/>
            might repose after his wanderings, or at least to let him <lb/>
            maintain his forces in Cilicia during the winter, and not <lb/>
            to drive him out of the country and expose him to his <lb/>
            enemies in a destitute condition.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. Seleukus viewed all these proposals with sus­ <lb/>
            picion, and offered to let him pass two months of the winter <lb/>
            in Cataonia, but demanded his chief officers as hostages, <lb/>
            and at the same time began to secure the passes leading <lb/>
            into Syria. Demetrius, who was now shut up like a wild <lb/>
            beast in a trap, was driven to use force, overran the <lb/>
            country, and fought several slight actions successfully <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            with Seleukup. On one occasion he withstood a charge of <lb/>
            scythed chariots, and routed the enemy, and he also drove <lb/>
            away the garrison of one of the passes, and gained the <lb/>
            command of the road to Syria. He now became elated <lb/>
            by success, and perceiving that his soldiers had recovered <lb/>
            their confidence, he determined to fight Seleukus for his <lb/>
            kingdom. Seleukus himself was now in difficulties. He <lb/>
            had refused Lysimachus's offer of assistance, through SUB­ <lb/>
            picion, and he feared to engage with Demetrius in battle, <lb/>
            dreading the effects of his despair and the sudden turns <lb/>
            of his fortune. However, at this crisis Demetrius was <lb/>
            seized by a disorder which nearly carried him off, and <lb/>
            utterly ruined his prospects; for some of his soldiers <lb/>
            deserted to the enemy, and some dispersed to their own <lb/>
            homes. After forty days he was able to place himself at <lb/>
            the head of the remaining troops, and with them marched <lb/>
            so as to lead the enemy to suppose that he meant to return <lb/>
            to Cilicia; but as soon as it was dark he started without <lb/>
            any sound of trumpet in the opposite direction, crossed <lb/>
            the pass of Amanus, and began to plunder the plain of <lb/>
            Kyrrhestis.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Shortly afterwards Seleukus made his appear­ <lb/>
            ance, and pitched his camp hard by. Demetrius now got <lb/>
            his men under arms in the night and started to surprise <lb/>
            Seleukus, whose army expected no attack, and was for the <lb/>
            most part asleep. When he was informed of his danger <lb/>
            by some deserters he leaped up in terror, and began putting <lb/>
            on his boots and shouting to his friends that a savage beast <lb/>
            was coming to attack them. Demetrius, observing from <lb/>
            the noise which filled the enemy's camp that they had <lb/>
            notice of his attempt, quickly marched back again. He <lb/>
            was attacked at daybreak by Seleukus, and gained some <lb/>
            advantage by a flank attack. But now Seleukus himself <lb/>
            dismounted, took off his helmet, and with only a small <lb/>
            shield in his hand went up to the mercenary troops of <lb/>
            Demetrius, showing himself to them and inviting them to <lb/>
            join him. They knew that he had for a long time refrained <lb/>
            from attacking them out of a wish to spare their lives, and <lb/>
            not for the sake of Demetrius; and they all greeted him, <lb/>
            saluted him as King, and joined his army. Demetrius, <lb/>
            who had seen so many turns of good and ill fortune, felt <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            that this blow was final. He fled towards the pass of <lb/>
            Amanus, and with a few friends and attendants took <lb/>
            refuge in a thick wood for the night, hoping to be able to <lb/>
            gain the road to Kaunus and so to reach the sea, where he <lb/>
            hoped to find his fleet assembled. But when he found <lb/>
            that his party had not enough money to procure them pro­ <lb/>
            visions even for one day, he was forced to adopt other <lb/>
            plans. Soon, however, he was joined by Sosigenes, one of <lb/>
            his friends, who had four hundred gold pieces in his belt, <lb/>
            and with this treasure they hoped to be able to reach the <lb/>
            sea, and started as soon as it grew dark to make their way <lb/>
            over the mountains. But when they saw the enemy's <lb/>
            watch-fires blazing all along the heights, they despaired <lb/>
            of effecting their passage by that route, and returned to <lb/>
            the place whence they had set out, diminished in numbers, <lb/>
            for some had deserted, and greatly disheartened. When <lb/>
            one of them ventured to hint that Demetrius ought to <lb/>
            surrender himself to Seleukus, Demetrius seized his sword <lb/>
            and would have made away with himself, but his friends <lb/>
            stood round him, and at length talked him over into giving <lb/>
            himself up. He sent a messenger to Seleukus, putting <lb/>
            himself unreservedly in his hands.</p>
          <p>L. Seleukus, when he heard what had happened, said <lb/>
            that it was his own good fortune, not that of Demetrius, <lb/>
            which had saved Demetrius's life, and had given himself <lb/>
            an opportunity of displaying his clemency and goodness <lb/>
            as well as his other virtues. He at once sent for his ser­ <lb/>
            vants and bade them construct a royal tent, and make <lb/>
            every preparation for the reception of Demetrius in a mag­ <lb/>
            nificent fashion. There was one Apollonides at the court <lb/>
            of Seleukus, who had been an intimate friend of Demetrius, <lb/>
            and Seleukus at once sent him to Demetrius, to bid him be <lb/>
            of good cheer, and not fear to meet his friend and relative <lb/>
            Seleukus. When the King's pleasure became known, a few <lb/>
            at first, but afterwards the greater part of his followers, <lb/>
            eagerly flocked to pay their court to Demetrius, who they <lb/>
            imagined would become the second man in the kingdom. <lb/>
            This ill-judged zeal of theirs turned the compassion of <lb/>
            Seleukus into jealousy, and enabled mischief-makers to <lb/>
            defeat his kindly intentions by warning him that as soon <lb/>
            as Demetrius was seen in his camp all his troops would <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            rise in mutiny against him. Apollonides had just reached <lb/>
            Demetrius in high spirits, and others were arriving with <lb/>
            wonderful stories about the goodness of Seleukus. Deme­ <lb/>
            trius himself was just recovering his spirits after his dis­ <lb/>
            aster, was beginning to think that he had been wrong in <lb/>
            his reluctance to surrender himself, and was full of hope <lb/>
            for the future, when Pausanias appeared with about a <lb/>
            thousand horse and foot-soldiers. He suddenly surrounded <lb/>
            Demetrius with these troops, separated him from his <lb/>
            friends, and, instead of bringing him into the presence of <lb/>
            Seleukus, conducted him to the Syrian Chersonese, where, <lb/>
            though strongly guarded, he was supplied by Seleukus <lb/>
            with suitable lodging and entertainment, and allowed to <lb/>
            take the air and hunt in the royal park which adjoined his <lb/>
            dwelling. He was permitted to associate with any of the <lb/>
            companions of his exile whom he wished to see, and many <lb/>
            polite messages were sent to him from Seleukus to the <lb/>
            effect that as soon as Antiochus and Stratonike arrived, <lb/>
            they would come to some amicable arrangement.</p>
          <p>LI. Demetrius now despatched letters to his son, and to <lb/>
            the commanders of his garrisons at Athens and Corinth, <lb/>
            warning them not to pay any attention to any despatches <lb/>
            which they might receive in his name, or even to his royal <lb/>
            signet, but to regard him as practically dead, and to hold <lb/>
            the cities in trust for his heir Antigonus. His son was <lb/>
            much grieved at hearing of his father's capture, put on <lb/>
            mourning, and sent letters to all the other kings, and to <lb/>
            Seleukus himself, begging for his father's liberation. He <lb/>
            offered to give up all the places which he still held, and <lb/>
            even proposed to surrender himself as a hostage in place <lb/>
            of his father. Many cities and princes supported his <lb/>
            request, except Lysimachus, who offered to give Seleukus <lb/>
            a large sum of money if he would put Demetrius to death. <lb/>
            But Seleukus, who had always disliked Lysimachus, now <lb/>
            regarded him with abhorrence as a savage villain, and still <lb/>
            continued to keep Demetrius in captivity, under the pre­ <lb/>
            text that he was waiting for the arrival of his son Antio- <lb/>
            ChUB and Stratonike, that they might have the pleasure of <lb/>
            restoring him to liberty.</p>
          <p>LI I. Demetrius at first bore up manfully against his <lb/>
            misfortunes, and learned to endure captivity, taking exer­ <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            cise as well as he could, by hunting in the park, and by <lb/>
            running; but, little by little, he neglected these amuse­ <lb/>
            ments, addicted himself to drinking and dicing, and thus <lb/>
            spent most of his time; either in order to escape from the <lb/>
            thoughts of his present condition by intoxication, or else <lb/>
            because he felt that this was the life which he had always <lb/>
            wished to lead, and that he had caused great suffering <lb/>
            both to himself and to others by fighting by sea and land <lb/>
            in order to obtain that comfort which he had now unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly discovered in repose and quiet. What, indeed, is <lb/>
            the object of the wars and dangers which bad kings <lb/>
            endure, in their folly, unless it be this? although they <lb/>
            not only strive after luxury and pleasure, instead of virtue <lb/>
            and honour, but do not even understand in what real <lb/>
            luxury and enjoyment consist. Be that as it may, Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, after living in confinement in the Chersonese for <lb/>
            three years, died of laziness, surfeit and over-indulgence <lb/>
            in wine, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.- Seleukus <lb/>
            was greatly blamed for the suspicions which he had enter­ <lb/>
            tained about Demetrius, and greatly repented that he had <lb/>
            not imitated the wild Thracian Dromichætes, who dealt <lb/>
            so kindly and royally with Lysimachus when he had taken <lb/>
            him prisoner.</p>
          <p>LIII. Even the funeral of Demetrius had an air of <lb/>
            tragedy and theatrical display. His son Antigonus, as <lb/>
            soon as he heard that the ashes of his father were being <lb/>
            brought to him., collected all his fleet and met the vessels <lb/>
            of Seleukus near the Cyclades. Here he received the relics <lb/>
            in a golden urn on board of his own flagship, the largest <lb/>
            of his fleet. At every port at which they touched the <lb/>
            citizens laid garlands upon the urn, and sent deputies in <lb/>
            mourning to attend the funeral. When the fleet arrived <lb/>
            at Corinth, the urn was beheld in a conspicuous place upon <lb/>
            the stem of the ship, adorned with a royal robe and diadem, <lb/>
            and surrounded by armed soldiers of the king's body- <lb/>
            guard. Near it was seated the celebrated flute-player <lb/>
            Xenophantus, playing a sacred hymn; and the measured <lb/>
            dip of the oars, keeping time to the music, sounded like <lb/>
            the refrain of a dirge. The crowds who thronged the sea- <lb/>
            shore were especially touched by the sight of Antigonus <note type="footnote"> * B.C. 284. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            himself, bowed down with grief and with his eyes full of <lb/>
            tears. After due honours had been paid to the relics at <lb/>
            Corinth, he finally deposited them in the city of Demetrias, <lb/>
            which was named after his father, and which had been <lb/>
            formed by amalgamating the small villages in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Iolkos. Demetrius, by his wife Phila, left <lb/>
            one son, Antigonus, and one daughter, Stratonike. He also <lb/>
            had two sons named Demetrius, one, known as Leptus, by <lb/>
            an Illyrian woman, and the other, who became ruler of <lb/>
            Cyrene, by Ptolemais. By Deidameia he had a son named <lb/>
            Alexander, who spent his life in Egypt. It is said, too, <lb/>
            that he had a son named Korrhagus by Eurydike. His <lb/>
            family retained the throne of Macedonia for many genera­ <lb/>
            tions, until it ended in Perseus, during whose reign the <lb/>
            Romans conquered that country. So now that we have <lb/>
            brought the career of the Macedonian hero to a close, it is <lb/>
            time for us to bring the Roman upon the stage.</p><pb n="263"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. The grandfather of Antonius was the orator Antonius,* <lb/>
            who belonged to the party of Sulla and was put to death <lb/>
            by Marius. His father was Antonius, surnamed Creticus, † <lb/>
            not a man of any great note or distinction in political <lb/>
            affairs, but of good judgment and integrity, and also liberal <lb/>
            in his donations, as one may know from a single instance. <lb/>
            He had no large property and for this reason he was <lb/>
            prevented by his wife from indulging his generous dis­ <lb/>
            position. On one occasion when an intimate friend came <lb/>
            to him who was in want of money, and Antonius had none, <lb/>
            he ordered a young slave to put some water into a silver <lb/>
            vessel and to bring it; and when it was brought, he <lb/>
            moistened his chin as if he were going to shave himself. <lb/>
            The slave being sent away on some other business, Antonius <lb/>
            gave the cup to his friend and bade him make use of it , <lb/>
            but as a strict inquiry was made among the slaves, and <lb/>
            Antonius saw that his wife was vexed and intended to <lb/>
            torture them one by one, he acknowledged what he had <lb/>
            done and begged her pardon.</p>
          <p>II. His wife was Julia of the family of the Cæsars, a <note type="footnote">* His death is told in the Life of Marius, c. 44. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Antonia Gens contained both Patricians and Plebeians. The <lb/>
            cognomen of the Patrician Antonii was Merenda. M. Antonius <lb/>
            Creticus, a sou of Antonius the orator, belonged to the Patricians. In <lb/>
            B.c. 74 he commanded a fleet in the Mediterranean against the pirates, <lb/>
            lie attacked the Cretans on the ground of their connection with <lb/>
            Mithridates; but he lost a large part of his fleet, and his captured <lb/>
            men were hung on the ropes of their own vessels. He died shortly <lb/>
            after of shame and vexation. The surname Creticus was given him by <lb/>
            way of mockery. According to Dion Cassius (xlv. 47) he died deeply <lb/>
            in debt. He left three sons, Marcus, Cuius and Lucius. His eldest <lb/>
            son Mucus was probably born in B.C. 83.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            woman who could compare with the noblest and most <lb/>
            virtuous of that day. She brought up her son Antonius, <lb/>
            having married after his father's death Cornelius Lentulus,* <lb/>
            who was one of the conspirators with Catilina and was put <lb/>
            to death by Cicero. This appears to be the reason and the <lb/>
            foundation of the violent enmity between Antonius and <lb/>
            Cicero. Now Antonius says that even the corpse of <lb/>
            Lentulus was not given up to them until his mother begged <lb/>
            it of the wife of Cicero. But this is manifestly false, for <lb/>
            no one of those who were then punished by Cicero was <lb/>
            deprived of interment. Antonius was of distinguished <lb/>
            appearance in his youth, but his friendship and intimacy <lb/>
            with Curiof fell upon him, as they say, like some pestilence, <lb/>
            for Curio himself was intemperate in his pleasures, and he <lb/>
            hurried Antonius, in order to make him more manageable, <lb/>
            into drinking and the company of women and extravagant <lb/>
            and licentious expenditure. All this brought on him a <lb/>
            heavy debt, and out of all bounds for his age, of two hun­ <lb/>
            dred and fifty talents. Curio became security for all this, <lb/>
            and when his father heard of it he banished Antonius from <lb/>
            the house. Antonius for a short time mixed himself up <lb/>
            with the violence of Clodius, the most daring and scandalous <lb/>
            of the demagogues of the day, which was throwing every <lb/>
            thing into confusion ; but becoming soon satiated with that <lb/>
            madness and being afraid of those who were combining <lb/>
            against Clodius, he left Italy for Greece and spent some <lb/>
            time there, exercising his body for military contests and <lb/>
            practising oratory. He adopted what was called the <lb/>
            Asiatic style of oratory, which flourished most at that time, <lb/>
            and bore a great resemblance to his mode of life, which <lb/>
            was boastful and swaggering and full of empty pride and <lb/>
            irregular aspiration after distinction.</p>
          <p>III. When Gabinius, ‡ a man of consular rank, was sailing <lb/>
            for Syria, he endeavoured to persuade Antonius to join tho <lb/>
            expedition. Antonius said that he would not go out with <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cicero, c. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> † 0. Scribonius Cur o, the son of a father of the same name. See <lb/>

            him as a private individual, but on being appointed <lb/>
            commander of the cavalry, lie did go with him. In the <lb/>
            first place he was sent against Aristobulus,* who was stir­ <lb/>
            ring the Jews to revolt, and he was the first man to mount <lb/>
            the largest of the fortifications; and he drove Aristobulus <lb/>
            from all of them. lIe next joined battle with him and <lb/>
            with the few men that he had put to flight the forces of <lb/>
            Aristobulus, which were much more numerous, and killed <lb/>
            all but a few; and Aristobulus was captured with his son. <lb/>
            After this Ptolemæus † attempted to persuade Gabinius for <lb/>
            ten thousand talents to join him in an invasion of Eygpt <lb/>
            and to recover the kingdom for him; but most of the <lb/>
            officers opposed the proposal, and Gabinius himself was <lb/>
            somewhat afraid of the war, though he was hugely taken <lb/>
            with the ten thousand talents; but Antonius, who was <lb/>
            eager after great exploits and wished to gratify the request <lb/>
            of Ptolemæus, persuaded Gabinius and urged him to the <lb/>
            expedition. They feared more than the war the march to <lb/>
            Pelusium, which was through deep sand where there was <lb/>
            no water along the Ecregma ‡ and the Serbonian marsh, <lb/>
            which the Egyptians call the blasts of Typhon,§ but which <lb/>
            really appears to be left behind by the Red Sea|| and to be <lb/>

            the internal sea. Antonius being sent with the cavalry <lb/>
            not only occupied the straits, but taking Pelusium also, <lb/>
            a large city, and the soldiers in it, he at the same time <lb/>
            made the road safe for the army and gave the general <lb/>
            sure hopes of victory. Even his enemies reaped advantage <lb/>
            from his love of distinction ; for when Ptolemæus entered <lb/>
            Pelusium, and through his passion and hatred was moved <lb/>
            to massacre the Egyptians, Antonius stood in the way and <lb/>
            stopped him. And in the battles and the contests which <lb/>
            were great and frequent, he displayed many deeds of daring <lb/>
            and prudent generalship, but most signally in encircling <lb/>
            and surrounding the enemy in the rear, whereby he secured <lb/>
            the victory to those in front, and received the rewards of <lb/>
            courage and fitting honours. Nor did the many fail to <lb/>
            notice his humanity towards Archelaus* after his death; for <lb/>
            Antonius, who had been his intimate and friend, fought <lb/>
            against him during his lifetime of necessity, but when he <lb/>
            found the body of Archelaus, who had fallen, he interred <lb/>
            it with all honours and in kingly fashion. He thus left <lb/>
            among the people of Alexandria the highest reputation, <lb/>
            and was judged by the Roman soldiers to be a most illus­ <lb/>
            trious man.</p>
          <p>IV. With these advantages he possessed a noble dignity <lb/>
            of person; and his well-grown beard, his broad forehead <lb/>
            and hooked noset appeared to express the manly character <lb/>
            which is observed in the paintings and sculptures of Her­ <lb/>
            cules. And there was an old tradition that the Antonii <lb/>
            were Herakleidæ, being sprung from Anton, a son of Her­ <lb/>
            cules. This tradition Antonius thought that he strength­ <lb/>
            ened by the character of his person, as it has been observed, <lb/>
            and by his dress. For on all occasions, when he was going <lb/>
            to appear before a number of persons, he had his tunic <lb/>
            girded up to his thigh, and a large sword hung by his <lb/>
            side, and a thick cloak thrown round him. Besides, that <note type="footnote"> * He was the son of Archelaus, the general of Mithridates. See the <lb/>
            Life of Sulla, c. 23. He had become the husband of Berenice and <lb/>
            shared the regal power with her. Probably Antonius had known <lb/>
            Archelaus in his youth, for Archelaus the father went over from <lb/>
            Mithridates to the Romans. Dion Cassius (xxxiv. 58) says that <lb/>
            Gabinius put Archelaus to dea h after the capture of Alexandria. <lb/>

            which appeared to others to be offensive, his great boasting <lb/>
            and jesting and display of his cups, and his sitting by the <lb/>
            soldiers when they were eating, and his eating himself as <lb/>
            he stood by the soldiers' table -it is wonderful how much <lb/>
            affection and attachment for him it bred in the soldiers. <lb/>
            His amorous propensities, too, had in them something that <lb/>
            was not without a charm, but even by these he won the <lb/>
            favour of many, helping them in their Jove affairs and <lb/>
            submitting to be joked with good humour about his own <lb/>
            amours. His liberality and his habit of gratifying the <lb/>
            soldiers and his friends in nothing with a stinted or <lb/>
            Sparing hand, both gave him a brilliant foundation for <lb/>
            power, and, when he had become great, raised his power <lb/>
            still higher, though it was in danger of being subverted <lb/>
            by ten thousand other faults. I will relate one instance <lb/>
            of his profusion. He ordered five-and-twenty ten thou­ <lb/>
            sands to be given to one of his friends; this sum the <lb/>
            Romans express by Decies.* But as his steward wondered <lb/>
            thereat, and to show him how much it was, placed the <lb/>
            money out, he asked as he was passing by, What that <lb/>
            was. The steward replying that this was what he had <lb/>
            ordered to be given, Antonius, who conjectured his <lb/>
            trickery; said, "I thought a Decies was more: this is <lb/>
            a small matter; and therefore add to it as much more."</p>
          <p>V. Now these things belong to a later period. But <lb/>
            when matters at Rome came to a split, the aristocratical <lb/>
            party joining Pompeius who was present, and the popular <lb/>
            party inviting Cæsar from Gaul, who was in arms, Curio, <lb/>
            the friend of Antonius, † changing sides in favour of Cæsar, <note type="footnote">* Decies is literally " Ten times." The phrase is " Decies sestertium," <lb/>
            which is a short way of expressing "ten times a hundred thousand <lb/>
            sesterces." When Plutarch says " five-and-twenty thousand," he means <lb/>
            drachmæ, as observed in previous notes, and he considers drachmæ as <lb/>
            equivalent to Roman Denarii. Now a Denarius is four sesterces, and <lb/>
            25,000 Denarii= 1,000,000 sesterces, Kaltwasser suggests that in the <lb/>
            Greek text " sestertium " has been accidentally omitted after " decies;" <lb/>
            but " decies" is the reading of all the MSS., and it is sufficient. </note><note type="footnote">t Antonius, after returning from Egypt in B.O. 54, went to Cæsar in <lb/>
            Gaul, who was then in winter-quarters after his return from the second <lb/>
            British expedition. In B.O. 53 Antonius was again at Rome, and in <lb/>
            B. C. 52 he was a Quarter, and returned to Cæsar in Gaul. In B.O. 50 <lb/>
            be was again in Rome, in which year he was made Augur, and was <lb/>
            elected Tribunus Plebia for the following year. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            brought Antonius over; and as he had great influence <lb/>
            among the many by his eloquence, and spent money <lb/>
            lavishly, which was supplied by Cæsar, he got Antonius <lb/>
            appointed tribune, and then one of the priests over the <lb/>
            birds, whom the Romans call Augurs. As soon as An­ <lb/>
            tonius entered on his office, he was of no small assistance <lb/>
            to those who were directing public affairs on Cæsar's <lb/>
            behalf. In the first place, when Marcellus the consul <lb/>
            attempted to give to Pompeius the troops that were <lb/>
            already levied, and to empower him to raise others, An­ <lb/>
            tonius opposed him by proposing an order, that the col­ <lb/>
            lected force should sail to Syria and assist Bibulus, who <lb/>
            was warring with the Parthians, and that the troops which <lb/>
            Pompeius was levying should not pay any regard to him: <lb/>
            and, in the second place, when the Senate would not receive <lb/>
            Cæsar's letters, nor allow them to be read, Antonius, whose <lb/>
            office gave him power, did read them, and he changed the <lb/>
            disposition of many, who judged from Cæsar's letters that <lb/>
            he only asked what was just and reasonable. Finally, when <lb/>
            two questions were proposed in the Senate, of which one <lb/>
            was, whether Pompeius should disband his troops, and the <lb/>
            other, whether Cæsar should do it, and there were a few <lb/>
            in favour of Pompeius laying down his arms, and all but <lb/>
            a few were for Cæsar doing so, Antonius arose and put the <lb/>
            question, Whether the Senate was of opinion that Pom­ <lb/>
            peius and Cæsar at the same time should lay down their <lb/>
            arms and disband their forces. All eagerly accepted this <lb/>
            proposal, and with shouts praising Antonius, they urged <lb/>
            to put the question to the vote. But as the consuls would <lb/>
            not consent, the friends of Cæsar again made other pro­ <lb/>
            posals, which were considered reasonable, which Cato <lb/>
            resisted, and Lentulus, who was consul, ejected Antonius <lb/>
            from the Senate. Antonius went out uttering many im­ <lb/>
            precations against them, and assuming the dress of a slave, <lb/>
            and in conjunction with Cassius Quintus* hiring a chariot <note type="footnote"> Compare with this chapter the Life of Pompeius, o. 58, and the Life <lb/>

            he hurried to Caesar ; and as soon as they were in sight, <lb/>
            they called out that affairs at Rome were no longer in any <lb/>
            order, since even tribunes had no liberty of speech, but <lb/>
            every one was driven away and in danger who spoke on <lb/>
            the side of justice.</p>
          <p>VI. Upon this Cæsar with his army entered Italy. <lb/>
            Accordingly Cicero, in his Philippica, said that Helen- was <lb/>
            the beginning of the Trojan war, and Antonius of the civil <lb/>
            war, wherein he is manifestly stating a falsehood. For <lb/>
            Caius Cæsar was not such a light person, or so easy to be <lb/>
            moved from his sound judgment by passion, if he had not <lb/>
            long ago determined to do this, as to have made war on <lb/>
            his country all of a sudden, because he saw Antonius in a <lb/>
            mean dress and Cassius making their escape to him in a <lb/>
            hired chariot; but this gave a ground and specious reason <lb/>
            for the war to a man who had long been wanting a pretext. <lb/>
            He was led to war against the whole world, as Alexander <lb/>
            before him and Cyrus of old had been, by an insatiable <lb/>
            love of power and a frantic passion to be first and greatest: <lb/>
            and this he could not obtain, if Pompeius was not put down. <lb/>
            He came then and got possession of Rome, and drove Pom­ <lb/>
            peius out of Italy; and determining to turn first against <lb/>
            the forces of Pompeius in Iberia, and then, when he had <lb/>
            got ready a fleet, to cross over to attack Pompeius, he <lb/>
            entrusted Rome to Lepidus, who was prætor, and the forces <lb/>
            and Italy to Antonius, who was tribune. Antonius forth­ <lb/>
            with gained the favour of the soldiers by taking his exer­ <lb/>
            cises with them, and by generally living with them, and <lb/>
            making them presents out of his means ; but to everybody <lb/>
            else he was odious. For owing to his carelessness he paid <lb/>
            no attention to those who were wronged, and listened with <lb/>
            ill-temper to those who addressed him, and had a bad <lb/>
            repute about other men's wives. In fine, Cæsar's friends <lb/>
            brought odium on Cæsar's power, which, so far as con­ <lb/>
            cerned Cæsar's acts, appeared to be anything rather than <note type="footnote"> * This expression of Cicero occurs in his Second Philippic, c. 22: <lb/>
            “ut Helena Trojanis, sic iste huic reipublicæ causa belli, causa pestis <lb/>

            is just. </note><note type="footnote"> As to the events mentioned in this chapter, compare the Life of <lb/>

            a tyranny: and of those friends Antonius, who had the <lb/>
            chief power and committed the greatest excesses, had most <lb/>
            of the blame.</p>
          <p>VII. However, upon his return from Iberia, Cæsar* over­ <lb/>
            looked the charges against him, and employing him in <lb/>
            war because of his energy, his courage, and his military <lb/>
            skill, he was never disappointed in him. Now Caesar, <lb/>
            after crossing the Ionian Gulf from Brundusium with a few <lb/>
            men, sent his ships back, with orders to Gabinius f and <lb/>
            Antonius to put the troops on board and carry them over <lb/>
            quickly to Macedonia. Gabinius was afraid of the voyage, <lb/>
            which was hazardous in the winter season, and led his <lb/>
            army by land a long way about; but Antonius being <lb/>
            alarmed for Cæsar, who was hemmed in by many enemies, <lb/>
            repulsed Libo,‡ who was blockading the mouth of the <lb/>
            harbour, by surrounding his gallies with many light boats, <lb/>
            and embarking in his vessels eight thousand legionary <lb/>
            soldiers he set sail. Being discovered by the enemy and <lb/>
            pursued, he escaped all danger from them in consequence <lb/>
            of a strong south wind bringing a great swell and <lb/>
            tempestuous sea upon his gallies; but as he was carried <lb/>
            in his ships towards precipices and cliffs with deep water <lb/>
            under them, he had no hope of safety. But all at once <lb/>
            there blew from the bay a violent south-west wind and <lb/>
            the swell ran from the land to the sea, and Antonius <lb/>
            getting off the land and sailing in gallant style saw the <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar returned from Iberia (Spain) before the end of B.C. 49. <lb/>
            Early in B.C. 48 he crossed over from Brundusium to the Illyrian <lb/>
            coast, where he was joined by Antonius and Funus Calenus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Gabinius took his troops by land, and consequently had to march <lb/>
            northwards along the Adriatic and round the northern point of it to <lb/>
            reach Illyricum. From Plutarch's narrative it would appear that he <lb/>
            set out about the same time as Antonius. Drumann (Cornificii, 3) <lb/>
            states that the time of his leaving Italy is incorrectly stated by <lb/>
            Plutarch, Appian, and Dion Cassius (xlii. 11), and he places it after <lb/>
            the battle of Pharsalus (B.O. 48). Gabinius, after a hard march, <lb/>
            reached Salonæ in Dalmatia, where he was besieged by M. Octavius <lb/>
            and died of disease. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ L. Scribonius Libo commanded the ships before Brundusium with <lb/>

            gallies that were in pursuit of him and no small number <lb/>
            of them was destroyed; and Antonius made many prisoners <lb/>
            and much booty, and he took Lissus, and he gave <lb/>
            Caesar great confidence by coming at a critical time with so <lb/>
            great a force.</p>
          <p>VIII. There were many and continuous fights, in all of <lb/>
            which Antonius was distinguished: and twice he met and <lb/>
            turned back the soldiers of Caesar, who were flying in dis­ <lb/>
            order, and by compelling them to stand and to fight again <lb/>
            with their pursuers he gained the victory. There was <lb/>
            accordingly more talk of him in the camp than of any one <lb/>
            else after Cæsar. And Cæsar showed what opinion he had <lb/>
            of him ; for when he was going to fight the last battle and <lb/>
            that which decided everything at Pharsalus,* he had the <lb/>
            right wing himself, but he gave the command of the left <lb/>
            to Antonius as being the most skilful and bravest officer <lb/>
            that he had. After the battle Cæsar was proclaimed <lb/>
            dictator, and he set out in pursuit of Pompeius, but he <lb/>
            appointed Antonius master of the horse and sent him to <lb/>
            Rome: this is the second office in rank when the dictator is. <lb/>
            present; but if he is not, it is the first and almost the only <lb/>

            nation has a permanent court for “ the relief of insolvent debtors;” and <lb/>
            a few years ago a statute was passed in England (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 96), <lb/>
            which had the direct effect of cancelling all debts under 20l.; the <lb/>
            debtors for whose relief it was passed were well pleased, but the <lb/>
            cieditors grumbled loudly, and it was amended. Those who blame <lb/>
            the Roman system of an occasional settlement of debts, should examine <lb/>
            the operation of a permanent law which has the same object; and they <lb/>
            will be assisted in comparing English and Roman morality on this <lb/>
            point by J. H. Elliott's ‘Credit the Life of Commerce,’ London. <lb/>

            annulling of debts, and he persuaded Antonius,* who was <lb/>
            a friend of his and always wished to please the many, to <lb/>
            work with him and to take a part in this political measure. <lb/>
            But Asinius and Trebellius gave him the contrary advice, <lb/>
            and it happened that a strong suspicion came on Antonius, <lb/>
            that he was wronged in the matter of his wife by <lb/>
            Dolabella. And as he was much annoyed thereat, he not <lb/>
            only drove his wife from his house, who was his cousin, <lb/>
            for she was the daughter of Caius Antonius who was <lb/>
            consul with Cicero, but he joined Asinius and resisted <lb/>
            Dolabella. Dolabella occupied the Forum with the design <lb/>
            of carrying the law by force, but Antonius, after the <lb/>
            Senate had declared by a vote that it was needful to oppose <lb/>
            Dolabella with arms, came upon him and joining battle <lb/>
            killed some of the men of Dolabella and lost some of his own. <lb/>
            This brought on Antonius the hatred of the many, and he <lb/>
            was not liked by the honest and sober on account of his <lb/>
            habits of life, as Cicero says, but was detested; for people <lb/>
            were disgusted at his drunkenness at unseasonable hours, <lb/>
            and his heavy expenditure, and his intercourse with women, <lb/>
            and his sleeping by day, and walking about with head <lb/>
            confused and loaded with drink, and by night his revellings <lb/>
            and theatres and his presence at the nuptials of mimi and <lb/>
            jesters. It is said indeed that after being present at the <lb/>
            entertainment on the marriage of Hippias the mime, and <lb/>
            drinking all night, when the people summoned him early <lb/>
            in the morning to the Forum, he came there still full of <lb/>
            food and vomited, and one of his friends placed his vest <lb/>
            under to serve him. Sergius the mime was one of those <lb/>
            who had the greatest influence over him, and Cytheris† from <lb/>
            the same school, a woman whom he loved, and whom when <lb/>
            he visited the cities he took round with him in a litter; <lb/>
            and there were as many attendants to follow the litter as <lb/>
            that of his mother. People were also vexed at the sight <lb/>
            of golden cups carried about in his excursions as in pro­ <note type="footnote"> * Fadia was the first wife of Antonius. His cousin Antonia was <lb/>
            the second. Cicero's chief testimony against Antonius is contained <lb/>

            cessions, and fixing of tents in the ways, and the laying <lb/>
            out of costly feasts near groves and rivers, and lions yoked <lb/>
            to chariots, and houses of orderly men and women used as <lb/>
            quarters for prostitutes and lute-players. For it was con­ <lb/>
            sidered past all endurance that, while Caesar was lodging <lb/>
            in the open field out of Italy, clearing up the remnant of <lb/>
            war with great labour and danger, others, through means <lb/>
            of Caesar's power, were indulging in luxury and insulting <lb/>
            the citizens.</p>
          <p>X. These things appear also to have increased the dis­ <lb/>
            order and to have given the soldiers licence to commit <lb/>
            shameful violence and robbery. Wherefore, when Cæsar <lb/>
            returned, he pardoned Dolabella; and being elected consul <lb/>
            for the third time he chose not Antonius, but Lepidus <lb/>
            for his colleague. Antonius bought the house of Pompeius <lb/>
            when it was sold, but he was vexed when he was asked <lb/>
            for the money; and he says himself that this was the <lb/>
            reason why he did not join Caesar in his Libyan expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, having had no reward for his former successes. How­ <lb/>
            ever Cæsar is considered to have cured him of the chief <lb/>
            part of his folly and extravagance by not allowing his <lb/>
            excesses to pass unnoticed. For he gave up that course of <lb/>
            life and turned his thoughts to wedlock, taking for his <lb/>
            wife Fulvia, who had been the wife of the demagogue <lb/>
            Clodius, a woman who troubled herself not about domestic <lb/>
            industry or housekeeping, nor one who aspired to rule a <lb/>
            private man, but her wish was to rule a ruler and <lb/>
            command a general: so that Cleopatra was indebted to <lb/>
            Fulvia * for training Antonius to woman-rule, inasmuch as <lb/>
            Cleopatra received him quite tamed and disciplined from <lb/>
            the commencement to obey women. However Antonius <lb/>
            attempted by sportive ways and youthful sallies to make <lb/>
            Fulvia somewhat merrier; as for example, on the occasion <lb/>
            when many went to meet Caesar after his victory in Iberia, <note type="footnote"> * Her first husband was P. Clodius, and she was his second wife. <lb/>
            She had two children by Clodius, a son and a daughter. The daughter <lb/>
            married Cæsar Octavianus B.o. 43 (c. 20). After the death of Clodius <lb/>
            she married C. Scribonius Curio, the friend of Antonius, by whom she <lb/>
            had one son, who was put to death by Cæsar after the battle of Actium. <lb/>
            Curio perished in Africa B.C. 49. In B.O. 46 Antonius married Fulvia, <lb/>
            after divorcing Antonia, and he had two sons by her. Fulvia was very <lb/>
            rich. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            Antonius also went; but as a report suddenly reached <lb/>
            Italy that Cæsar was dead and the enemy wei e advancing, <lb/>
            he returned to Rome, and taking a slave's dress he came <lb/>
            to the house by night, and saying that he brought a letter <lb/>
            from Antonius to Fulvia, he was introduced to her wrapped <lb/>
            up in his dress. Fulvia, who was in a state of anxiety, <lb/>
            asked, before she took the letter, whether Antonius was <lb/>
            alive; but without speaking a word he held out the letter <lb/>
            to her, and when she was beginning to open and read it, <lb/>
            he embraced and kissed her. These few out of many <lb/>
            things I have produced by way of instance.</p>
          <p>XI. When Cæsar was returning from Iberia* all the <lb/>
            first people went several days' journey to meet him; but <lb/>
            Antonius was specially honoured by Cæsar. For in his <lb/>
            passage through Italy he had Antonius in the chariot <lb/>
            with him, and behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavianus <lb/>
            the son of his niece, who was afterwards named Cæsar and <lb/>
            ruled the Romans for a very long time. When Cæsar was <lb/>
            appointed consul for the fifth time, he immediately chose <lb/>
            Antonius for his colleague, and it was his design to ab­ <lb/>
            dicate the consulship and give it to Dolabella; and this <lb/>
            he proposed to the Senate. But as Antonius violently <lb/>
            opposed this, and vented much abuse of Dolabella and <lb/>
            received as much in return, Cæsar, being ashamed of these <lb/>
            unseemly proceedings, went away. Afterwards when he <lb/>
            came to proclaim Dolabella, upon Antonius calling out <lb/>
            that the birds were opposed to it, Cæsar yielded and gave <lb/>
            up Dolabella, who was much annoyed. But it appeared <lb/>
            that Caesar abominated Dolabella as much as he did <lb/>
            Antonius; for it is said, that when some person was <lb/>
            endeavouring to excite his suspicions against both, Cæsar <lb/>
            said that he was not afraid of those fat and long-haired <lb/>
            fellows, but those pale and thin ones, meaning Brutus and <lb/>
            Cassius, who afterwards conspired against him and slew <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>XII. And Antonius without designing it gave them a <lb/>
            most specious pretext. It was the feast of the Lykæa <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar returned from Iberia in the antumn of B.C. 45, after gaining <lb/>
            the battle of Munda. He was consul for the fifth time in B.O. 44 with <lb/>
            Antonius: and also Dictator with M. Æmilius Lepidus for his <lb/>
            Magister Equitum. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            among the Romans, which they call Lupercalia,* and Cæsar <lb/>
            dressed in a triumphal robe and sitting on the Rostra in <lb/>
            the Forum viewed the runners. Now many youths of <lb/>
            noble birth run the race, and many of the magistrates, <lb/>
            anointed with oil, and with strips of hide they strike by <lb/>
            way of sport those whom they meet. Antonius running <lb/>
            among them paid no regard to the ancient usage, but <lb/>
            wrapping a crown of bay round a diadem he ran to the <lb/>
            Rostra, and being raised up by his companions in the race <lb/>
            he placed it on Cæsar's head, intimating that he ought to <lb/>
            be King. But as Cæsar affected to refuse it and put his head <lb/>
            aside, the people were pleased and clapped their hands; <lb/>
            then Antonius again offered the crown, and Cæsar again <lb/>
            rejected it. This contest went on for some time, only a <lb/>
            few of the friends of Antonius encouraging him in his <lb/>
            pressing the offer, but all the people shouted and clapped <lb/>
            when Cæsar refused; which indeed was surprising, that <lb/>
            while in reality they submitted to be ruled over with <lb/>
            kingly power they eschewed the name of King as if it were <lb/>
            the destruction of their freedom. Accordingly Cæsar rose <lb/>
            from the Rostra much annoyed, and taking the robe from <lb/>
            his neck called out that he offered his throat to any one <lb/>
            who would have it. The crown which was placed on one <lb/>
            of his statues certain tribunes tore off, and the people fol­ <lb/>
            lowed them with loud expressions of goodwill and clap­ <lb/>
            ping of hands ; but Cæsar deprived them of their office.</p>
          <p>XIII. This confirmed Brutus and Cassius, and when <lb/>
            they were enumerating the friends whom they could <lb/>
            trust in the undertaking, they deliberated about Antonius. <lb/>
            The rest were for adding Antonius to their number, but <lb/>
            Trebonius opposed it; for he said that at the time when <lb/>
            they went to meet Cæsar on his return from Iberia, and <lb/>
            Antonius was in the same tent with him and journeyed <lb/>
            with him, he tried his disposition in a quiet way and <lb/>
            with caution, and he said that Antonius understood him, <lb/>
            though he did not respond to the proposal, nor yet did he <lb/>
            report it to Cæsar, but faithfully kept the words secret. <lb/>
            Upon this they again deliberated whether they should <lb/>
            kill Antonius after they had killed Cæsar; but Brutus <lb/>
            opposed this, urging that the act which was adventured <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cæsar, c. 61. </note> <note type="footnote"> T a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            in defence of the laws and of justice must be pure and <lb/>
            free from injustice. But as they were afraid of the <lb/>
            strength of Antonius and the credit that his office gave <lb/>
            him, they appointed some of the conspirators to look after <lb/>
            him in order that when Cæsar entered the Senate house <lb/>
            and the deed was going to be done, they might detain <lb/>
            him on the outside in conversation about some matter and <lb/>
            on the pretence of urgent business.</p>
          <p>XIV. This being accomplished according as it was <lb/>
            planned and Cæsar having fallen in the Senate house, <lb/>
            Antonius immediately put on a slave's attire and hid <lb/>
            himself. But when he learned that the men were not <lb/>
            attacking any one, but were assembled in the Capitol, he <lb/>
            persuaded them to come down after giving them his son <lb/>
            as a hostage; and he entertained Cassius at supper, and <lb/>
            Brutus entertained Lepidus. Antonius having summoned <lb/>
            the Senate spoke about an amnesty and a distribution of <lb/>
            provinces among Brutus and Cassius and their parti zans, <lb/>
            and the Senate ratified these proposals, and decreed not to <lb/>
            alter anything that had been done by Caesar.* Antonius <lb/>
            went out of the Senate the most distinguished of men, <lb/>
            being considered to have prevented a civil war and to <lb/>
            have managed most prudently and in a most statesmanlike <lb/>
            manner circumstances which involved difficulties and no <lb/>
            ordinary causes of confusion. But from such considera­ <lb/>
            tions as these he was soon disturbed by the opinion that <lb/>
            he derived from the multitude, that he would certainly be <lb/>
            the first man in Rome, if Brutus were put down. Now it <lb/>
            happened that when Cæsar's corpse was carried forth, as <lb/>
            the custom was, he pronounced an oration over it in the <lb/>
            Forum ;† and seeing that the people were powerfully led <lb/>
            and affected, he mingled with the praises of Caesar coin­ <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 67, and of Brutus, c. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> t Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 68, and of Brutus, c. 20. Dion <lb/>
            Cassius.(Xliv. 36-49) has given a long oration which Antonius made on <lb/>
            the occasion. It is not improbable that Dion may have had before <lb/>
            him an oration attributed to Antonius; nor is it at all improbable that <lb/>
            the speech of Antonius was published (Cic. Ad Attic xiv. 11). Meyer <lb/>
            (Oratorum Romanorum Frag. p. 455) considers this speech a fiction of <lb/>
            Dion and to be pure declamation. He thinks that which Appian has <lb/>
            made (Civil Wars, ii. 144, &amp;c ) tolerably well adapted to the character <lb/>
            of Antonius. Appian, we know, often followed very closely genuine </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            miseration and mighty passion over the sad event, and at <lb/>
            the close of his speech, shaking the garments of the dead, <lb/>
            which were blood-stained and hacked with the swords, <lb/>
            and calling those who had done these things villains and <lb/>
            murderers, he inspired so much indignation in the men <lb/>
            that they burnt the body of Cæsar in the Forum, heaping <lb/>
            together the benches and the tables; and snatching burn­ <lb/>
            ing faggots from the pile they ran to the houses of the <lb/>
            assassins and assaulted them.</p>
          <p>XV. For this reason Brutus and his party left the city, <lb/>
            and the friends of Cæsar joined Antonius; and Caesar's <lb/>
            wife Calpurnia trusting to him had the chief part of the <lb/>
            treasures transferred to Antonius from her house, to the <lb/>
            amount in all of four thousand talents. He received also <lb/>
            the writings of Cæsar, in which there were entries made <lb/>
            of what he had determined and decreed; and Antonius <lb/>
            inserting entries in them, named many to offices just as <lb/>
            he pleased, and many he named senators, and he restored <lb/>
            some who were in exile and released others who were in <lb/>
            prison, as if Cæsar had determined all this. Wherefore <lb/>
            the Romans by way of mockery named all these persons <lb/>
            Charonitæ,* because when they were put to the proof they <lb/>
            had to take refuge in the memoranda of the deceased. <lb/>
            And Antonius managed everything else as if he had full <lb/>
            power, being consul himself, and having his brothers also <lb/>
            in office, Caius as prætor and Lucius as tribune.</p>
          <p>XVI. While affairs were in this state, young Cæsar† <lb/>
            arrived at Rome, being the son of the niece of the deceased, <note type="footnote"> documents. Shakespero has made a speech for Antonius (Julius Cæsar) <lb/>

            The Romans' expression was Orciui, from Orcus (Sueton. August c. 35). </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Cicero, o. 43, and Dion Cassius (xlv. 5) as to the <lb/>
            matter of the inheritance. A person who accepted a Roman inheritance <lb/>
            (hereditas) took it with all the debts : the heir (heres), so far as con­ <lb/>
            earned the deceased's property, credits and debts, was the same person <lb/>
            as himself. There was no risk in taking the inheritance on account <lb/>
            of debts, for Cæsar left enormous sums of money: the risk was in <lb/>
            taking the name and with it the wealth and odium of the deceased. <lb/>
            Cæsur might have declined the inheritance, for he was not bound by <lb/>
            law to take it. Cæsar had three-fourths of the Dictator's property, <lb/>
            and Q. Pedius, also a great-nephew of the Dictator, had the remainder. </note> <lb/>

            AS it has been told, and left the heir of his substance; and <lb/>
            he was staying in Apollonia at the time of Cæsar's assas­ <lb/>
            sination. He went forthwith to pay his respects to <lb/>
            Antonius, as being his father's friend, and reminded him <lb/>
            of the money deposited with him; for he had to pay to <lb/>
            every Roman seventy-five drachmas, which Cæsar had <lb/>
            given by his will. Antonius, at first despising his youth, <lb/>
            said that he was not in his senses, and that being destitute <lb/>
            of all sound reason and friends he was taking up the suc­ <lb/>
            cession of Cæsar, which was a burden too great for him <lb/>
            to bear; but as Cæsar did not yield to these arguments <lb/>
            and demanded the money, Antonius went on saying and <lb/>
            doing many things to insult him. For he opposed him in <lb/>
            seeking a tribuneship, and when he was preparing to set <lb/>
            up a golden chair of his father, as it had been voted by <lb/>
            the Senate, he threatened to carry him off to prison, if he <lb/>
            did not stop his attempts to win the popular favour. But <lb/>
            when the youth, by giving himself up to Cicero and the <lb/>
            rest who hated Antonius, by means of them made the <lb/>
            Senate his friends, and he himself got the favour of the <lb/>
            people and mustered the soldiers from the colonies,* An­ <lb/>
            tonius being alarmed came to a conference with him in <lb/>
            the Capitol, and they were reconciled. Antonius in his <lb/>
            sleep that night had a strange dream ; he thought that his <lb/>
            right hand was struck by lightning; and a few days after <lb/>
            a report reached him that Cæsar was plotting against him. <lb/>
            Cæsar indeed made an explanation, but he did not convince <lb/>
            Antonius; and their enmity was again in full activity, <lb/>
            and both of them roaming about Italy endeavoured to stir <lb/>
            up by large pay the soldiers who were planted in the <lb/>
            colonies, and to anticipate one another in gaining over <lb/>
            those who were still under arms.</p>
          <p>XVII. Of those in the city Cicero had the greatest <lb/>
            influence; and by inciting everybody against Antonius <lb/>
            he finally persuaded the Senate to vote Antonius to be an <lb/>
            enemy, and to send Caesar lictors and the insignia of a <lb/>
            prætor, and to despatch Pansa and Hirtins† to drive An­ <lb/>
            tonius out of Italy. They were consuls for that year; <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cicero, c. 44 </note><note type="footnote"> t Consuls in B.O. 43. See the Life of Cicero, c. 45. As to the speech <lb/>

            and engaging with Antonius near the city of Mutina, on <lb/>
            which occasion Cæsar was present and fought with them, <lb/>
            they defeated the enemy, but fell themselves. Many <lb/>
            great difficulties befell Antonius in his flight; but the <lb/>
            greatest was famine. But it was the nature of Antonius <lb/>
            to show his best qualities in difficulties, and in his mis­ <lb/>
            fortune he was as like as may be to a good man ; for it is <lb/>
            common to those who are hard pressed by straits to per­ <lb/>
            ceive what virtue is, but all have not strength enough in <lb/>
            reverses to imitate what they admire and to avoid what <lb/>
            they do not approve; but some rather give way to their <lb/>
            habits through weakness and let their judgment be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. Now Antonius in these circumstances was a <lb/>
            powerful pattern to the soldiers, for though he was fresh <lb/>
            from the enjoyment of so much luxury and expense, he <lb/>
            drank foul water without complaining, and ate wild fruits <lb/>
            and roots. Bark too was eaten, as it was said, and in their <lb/>
            passage over the Alps they fed on animals that had never <lb/>
            been eaten before.</p>
          <p>XVIII. His design was to fall in with the troops there <lb/>
            which Lepidus* commanded, who was considered to be a <lb/>
            friend of Antonius and to have derived through him much <lb/>
            advantage from the friendship of Cæsar. Having arrived <lb/>
            there and encamped near, he found no friendly signs, on <lb/>
            which he resolved to try a bold stroke. Antonius had <lb/>
            neglected his hair and he had allowed his beard to grow <lb/>
            long immediately after his defeat; and putting on a dark <lb/>
            garment he approached the lines of Lepidus and began to <lb/>
            speak. As many of the soldiers were moved at the sight <lb/>
            and affected by his words, Lepidus in alarm ordered the <lb/>
            trumpets to sound all at once and so to prevent Antonius <lb/>
            from being heard. But the soldiers pitied the more, and t <lb/>
            held communication with him by means of Lælius and <lb/>
            Clodius, whom they secretly sent to him in the dress of <lb/>
            women who followed the camp, and the messengers urged <note type="footnote"> * Lepidus was in Gallia Narbonensis. He advanced to wards <lb/>
            Antonius as far as Forum Vocontiorum, and posted himself on the <lb/>
            Argenteus, now the Argens. (Appian, Civil Wars, iii. 83; Dion. Cass. <lb/>
            xlvi. 51, &amp;c.; Letter of Munatius Plancus to Cicero, Ad Div. x. 17; <lb/>
            Letter of Lepidus to Cicero, Ad Div. x. 34.) Lepidus and Antonius <lb/>
            joined their forces on the 29th of May, and Lepidus informed the <lb/>
            Senate of the event in a letter, which is extant (Uio. Ad Div. x. 35). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            Antonius boldly to attack the lines, for there were many, <lb/>
            they said, would undertake even to kill Lepidus, if he <lb/>
            wished. Antonius would not consent to their touching <lb/>
            Lepidus, but on the next day he began to cross the river <lb/>
            with his army. Antonius entered the river first and ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to the opposite bank, for he saw already many of <lb/>
            the soldiers of Lepidus stretching out their hands to him <lb/>
            and tearing down the ramparts. When he had entered <lb/>
            and made himself master of all, he approached Lepidus <lb/>
            with the greatest kindness, for he embraced him and <lb/>
            called him father; and in fact he was master of all, but <lb/>
            he continued to preserve to Lepidus the name and honour <lb/>
            of an Imperator. This caused also Plancus Munatius to <lb/>
            join him, for Plancus was at no great distance with a <lb/>
            large force. Being thus raised anew to great power he <lb/>
            crossed the Alps into Italy at the head of seventeen <lb/>
            legions of infantry and ten thousand cavalry; besides <lb/>
            this he left to guard Gaul six legions with Varius, one <lb/>
            of his intimates and boon companions, whom they called <lb/>
            Cotylon.*</p>
          <p>XIX. Now Cæsar no longer cared for Cicero when he <lb/>
            saw that he clung to liberty, but he invited Antonius <lb/>
            through the mediation of his friends to come to terms. <lb/>
            The three met together in a small islandt in the middle of <lb/>
            a river and sat together for three days. All the rest was <lb/>
            easily agreed on, and they distributed the empiret among <lb/>
            them as if it were a p aternal inheritance, but the discus­ <lb/>
            sion about the men who were destined to perish caused <lb/>
            them most trouble, each claiming to get rid of his enemies <lb/>
            and to save his relations. But at length surrendering to <lb/>
            their passion against those whom they hated both the <lb/>
            honour duo to their kinsmen and their goodwill to their <lb/>
            friends, Cæsar surrendered Cicero to Antonius, and An­ <lb/>
            tonius surrendered to him Lucius Cæsar, who was his <lb/>
            uncle on the mother's side; Lepidus also was allowed to <lb/>
            put to death his brother Paulus; but others say that <note type="footnote"> * Cotylon is “ cupman," or any equivalent term that will express a <lb/>
            drinker. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Cicero, c. 46. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Appian (Civil Wars, iv. 2) states how they divided the empire <lb/>
            ameng them; and Diou Cassius, xlvi. 55. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            Lepidus gave up his brother to Cæsar and Antonius, who <lb/>
            required his death. I think nothing could be more cruel <lb/>
            or savage than this exchange; for by exchanging murder <lb/>
            for murder they equally destroyed those whom they sur­ <lb/>
            rendered and those whom they put to death, but they <lb/>
            acted more unjustly to their friends, whom they caused to <lb/>
            die even without bearing them any hatred.</p>
          <p>XX. After this settlement, the soldiers, who were <lb/>
            around them, required that Caesar should strengthen <lb/>
            their friendship by marriage, and should take to wife <lb/>
            Clodia,* the daughter of Fulvia, the wife of Antonius. <lb/>
            This also being agreed to, three hundred persons were <lb/>
            by proscription put to death by them.t When Cicero was <lb/>
            murdered, Antonius ordered the head to be cut off and the <lb/>
            right hand, with which Cicero wrote the speeches against <lb/>
            him. When they were brought, Antonius looked on them <lb/>
            with delight and broke out a laughing several times <lb/>
            through joy; then being satiated with the sight he <lb/>
            ordered them to be placed above the Rostra in the Forum, <lb/>
            as if he were insulting the dead, and not showing his <lb/>
            own arrogance in his good fortune and abusing his power. <lb/>
            His uncle Cæsar being sought and pursued fled for refuge <lb/>
            to his sister, who, when the assassins were standing by <lb/>
            and trying to force their way into her chamber, fixing <lb/>
            herself at the door and spreading out her arms, called out <lb/>
            repeatedly, " You shall not kill Cæsar Lucius, unless you <lb/>
            kill me first, me the mother of the Imperator." By such <lb/>
            her conduct she rescued and saved her brother.</p>
          <p>XXI. The dominion of the three was in most respects <lb/>
            hateful to the Romans; but Antonius had most of the <note type="footnote"> * Cæsar was already betrothed to Servilia, the daughter of P. <lb/>
            Servilius Isauricus. When he quarrelled with Fulvia, he sent her <lb/>
            back to her mother, still a ma d. (Dion Cass. xlvi. 56.) </note><note type="footnote"> t The number that was put to death was much larger than three <lb/>
            hundred. Appian (Civil Wars, iv. 5) states the number of those who <lb/>
            were proscribed and whose property was confiscated at about 300 <lb/>
            senators and 2000 equites. The object of the proscription was to get <lb/>
            rid of troublesome enemies and to raise money. The picture which <lb/>
            Appian gives of the massacre is as horrible as the worst events of the <lb/>
            French Revolution. He has drawn a striking picture by giving many <lb/>
            individual instances. Dion Cassius (xlvii. 3-8) has also described the <lb/>
            events of the proscription. </note> <lb/>

            blame, as he was older than Cæsar, and had more influence <lb/>
            than Lepidus, and threw himself without restraint into <lb/>
            his former luxurious and intemperate habits as soon as <lb/>
            he had shaken off all trouble about affairs. There <lb/>
            was added to his general bad repute the hatred against <lb/>
            him on account of the house that he inhabited, which had <lb/>
            been the house of Pompeius Magnus, a man no less admired <lb/>
            for his temperance and his orderly and citizenlike mode <lb/>
            of life than for his three triumphs. For they were vexed <lb/>
            to see his house generally closed to commanders, magis­ <lb/>
            trates and ambassadors, who were insolently thrust from <lb/>
            the doors, while it was filled with mimi and jugglers and <lb/>
            drunken flatterers, upon whom was expended most of the <lb/>
            money which was got by the most violent and harsh <lb/>
            means. For the three not only sold the substance of <lb/>
            those who were murdered, bringing false charges against <lb/>
            their kinsmen and wives, and tried all kinds of imposts; <lb/>
            but hearing that there were deposits * with the Vestal <lb/>
            Virgins made both by strangers and citizens, they went <lb/>
            and seized them. Now as nothing was enough for <lb/>
            Antonius, Cæsar claimed to share the money with him; <lb/>
            and they also distributed the army between them, and <lb/>
            both went together into Macedonia to oppose Brutus <lb/>
            and Cassius ; and they intrusted Rome to Lepidus.</p>
          <p>XXII. Crossing over the sea they commenced the <lb/>
            campaign and encamped by the enemy, Antonius being <lb/>
            opposed to Cassius, and Caesar to Brutus,t wherein no great <lb/>
            deed was performed on the part of Cæsar, but it was <lb/>
            Antonius who gained all the victory and had all the success. <lb/>
            In the first battle, Caesar, being completely routed by <lb/>
            Brutus, lost his camp and narrowly escaped from his <lb/>
            pursuers; but, as he says in his Memoirs, he retired before <lb/>
            the battle in consequence of one of his friends having had <lb/>
            a dream. But Antonius defeated Cassius; though some <lb/>
            have written that Antonius was not in the battle, but <note type="footnote"> * This was a crime which would shook the Romans, for the Three <lb/>
            not only seized deposits, which the depositary was legally bound to <lb/>

            came up after the battle to join in the pursuit. Pindarus, <lb/>
            one of the faithful freedmen of Cassius, killed him at his <lb/>
            request and order, for Cassius did not know that Brutus was <lb/>
            victorious. After an interval of a few days they fought a <lb/>
            second battle, in which Brutus being defeated killed <lb/>
            himself, and Antonius carried off the chief credit of the <lb/>
            victory, inasmuch as Cæsar was sick. Standing over the <lb/>
            corpse of Brutus he upbraided it gently for the death of <lb/>
            his brother Caius,* for Brutus had put Caius to death <lb/>
            in Macedonia to revenge Cicero; but declaring that he <lb/>
            blamed Hortensius more than Brutus for the murder of <lb/>
            his brother, Antonius ordered him to be massacred on his <lb/>
            tomb; and he threw over the body of Brutus his own <lb/>
            purple cloak, which was of great value, and commanded <lb/>
            one of his freedmen to look after the interment. He <lb/>
            afterwards found out that this fellow did not burn the <lb/>
            cloak with the corpse and that he had purloined a large <lb/>
            part of the expenditure destined for the interment, whereon <lb/>
            he put him to death.</p>
          <p>XXIII. After this Cæsar went back to Rome, and it <lb/>
            was supposed that he would not live long on account of <lb/>
            his illness. Antonius crossed over into (Greece with a <lb/>
            large army, intending to levy money in all the eastern <lb/>
            provinces; for as they had promised to every soldier five <lb/>
            thousand drachmae, they required more vigorous measures <lb/>
            for raising money and collecting contributions. Towards <lb/>
            the Greeks his conduct was neither unusual nor oppres­ <lb/>
            sive at first, but his love of amusment led him to listen to <lb/>
            the discourses of the learned and to the sight of games <lb/>
            and religious solemnities; and in his decisions he was <lb/>
            equitable, and was delighted at being called a Philhellen, <lb/>
            but still more in being addressed as Philathenæus; and he <lb/>
            made rich gifts to the city. The people of Megara also <lb/>
            wishing to show him something fine, by way of rivalry <lb/>
            with Athens, and requesting him to see the Senate-house, <lb/>
            he went up and looked at if, and on their asking what he <lb/>
            thought of it: " Small, it is true," he said, “ and yet all in <lb/>
            decay.” He also caused the temple of the Pythian Apollo <lb/>
            to be surveyed, as if he intended to repair it; for he made <lb/>
            this promise to the Senate. <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Brutus, a. 26, &amp;c. </note></p><pb n="284"/>
            
          <p>XXIV.* Leaving Lucius Censorinus† over the affairs of <lb/>
            Greece he crossed to Asia; and when he had touched the <lb/>
            wealth there, and kings used to come to his door, and <lb/>
            wives of kings vying with one another in their presents <lb/>
            and their beauty let themselves be corrupted in order to <lb/>
            win his favour, and while Cæsar at Rome was worn out <lb/>
            with civil commotions and war, he enjoying perfect leisure <lb/>
            and tranquillity was carried back by his passions to his <lb/>
            usual habits of life, and Anaxenor t a lute-player and <lb/>
            Xuthus a piper and Metrodorus a dancer, and other such <lb/>
            rout of Asiatic theatrical folks who surpassed in impudence <lb/>
            and shamelessness the pests from Italy, had crept in and <lb/>
            managed his residence-it was past all bearing, for <lb/>
            everything was waited on these extravagancies. For <lb/>
            all Asia, like that city in Sophocles,§ at the same time was <lb/>
            filled with incense burning, <lb/>
            “ With pæans too 'twas filled and heavy groans.” <lb/>
            Thus, when he was entering Ephesus, women clothed <lb/>
            like Bacchæ, and men and boys equipped like Satyrs and <lb/>
            Pans led the way; and the city was filled with ivy and <lb/>
            thyrsi and psalteries and pipes and flutes, the people call­ <lb/>
            ing him Dionysus, Giver of Joy and Beneficent. He was <lb/>
            this, it is true, to some; but to the many Omestesll and <lb/>
            Agrionius. For he took their property from well-born <lb/>
            men and gave it to worthless men and flatterers; and <lb/>
            certain persons got the substance of many who were still <lb/>
            alive by asking for it as if they were dead. He gave the <lb/>
            house of a citizen of Magnesia to a cook, who, as it is said, <note type="footnote"> * Antonius crossed over to Asia in B.C. 41. In the latter part of B.C. 42, <lb/>
            Cæsar was ill at Brundusium, and in a O. 41 he was engaged in a civil <lb/>
            war with L. Antonius, the brother of Marcus, and Fulvia the wife of <lb/>
            Antonius. These are the civil commotions to which Plutarch alludes. <lb/>
            Cæsar besieged L. Autonius in Perusia in B.O. 41, and took bun <lb/>

             <pb n="285"/>
            had distinguished himself by a single entertainment. <lb/>
            Finally, when he was imposing a second contribution on <lb/>
            the citizens, Hybreas* was bold enough in speaking on <lb/>
            behalf of Asia to use these words, which were indeed such <lb/>
            as the common folks would have in their mouths, but were <lb/>
            not ill adapted to flatter† the vanity of Antonius, “ If thou <lb/>
            canst take contributions twice in one year, thou canst also <lb/>
            make for us summer twice and harvest-time twice but <lb/>
            he concluded with these practical and bold words, that <lb/>
            Asia had given twenty ten thousands of talents; and “if <lb/>
            thou hast not had them, demand them of those who have <lb/>
            received the money ; but if thou hast received and hast <lb/>
            them not, we are undone." By these words he made a <lb/>
            strong impression on Antonius, for he was ignorant of the <lb/>
            greater part of what was going on; and not so much <lb/>
            because he was indolent, as because in his simplicity he <lb/>
            trusted those abc ut him. For there was in his character <lb/>
            simplicity and slow perception; but when he did perceive <lb/>
            his errors, there was strong repentance, and acknowledg­ <lb/>
            ment to those who had been wronged, and excess both in <lb/>
            the restitution that he made and the punishment that he <lb/>
            inflicted. Yet he was considered to surpass the bounds of <lb/>
            moderation rather in conferring favours than in punishing. <lb/>
            His rudeness in mirth and bantering carried its own <lb/>
            remedy with it; for a man might return him as good as he <lb/>
            gave; and he took as much pleasure in being laughed at <lb/>
            as in laughing at others. And this did him mischief in <lb/>
            most things; for he could not believe that those who <note type="footnote"> * He was an orator, and also something of a soldier, for he success­ <lb/>
            fully opposed Labienus, B.c. 40, when he invaded Asia (c. 28). </note><note type="footnote"> t There are many ways of flattery, as there are many ways of doing <lb/>
            various things. Plutarch here gives a hint, which persons in high <lb/>
            places might find useful. Open flattery can only deceive a fool, and <lb/>
            it is seldom addressed to any but a fool, unless the flatterer himself be <lb/>
            so great a fool as not to know a wise man from a foolish: which is <lb/>
            sometimes the case. But there is flattery, as Plutarch intimates, which <lb/>
            addresses itself, not in the guise of flattery, but in the guise of truth, <lb/>
            one of the characters of which is plain speaking. It is hard for a man <lb/>
            in an exalted station to be always proof against flattery, for it is often <lb/>
            Dot easy to detect it. Nor in the intercourse of daily life is it always <lb/>
            easy to distinguish between him who gives you his honest advice and <lb/>
            opinion, and him who gives it merely to please you, or, what is often <lb/>
            Worse, merely to please himself. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            spoke so freely in jest, could flatter him in earnest, and so <lb/>
            he was easily caught by praise, not knowing that some <lb/>
            persons by mingling freedom of expression, like a sharpish <lb/>
            sauce, with flattery, took away from flattery its nauseating <lb/>
            insipidity, by their boldness and babbling over their cups <lb/>
            striving to make their yielding in matters of business and <lb/>
            their assent appear, not the way of persons who keep <lb/>
            about a man merely to please him, but of those who are <lb/>
            overpowered by superior wisdom.</p>
          <p>XXV. Such was the disposition of Antonius, upon which <lb/>
            a crowning evil the love for Cleopatra supervening, and <lb/>
            stirring up and maddening many of the passions that were <lb/>
            still concealed in him and lying quiet, caused to vanish <lb/>
            and utterly destroyed whatever of goodness and of a saving <lb/>
            nature still made resistance in him. And he was captured <lb/>
            in this fashion. When he was preparing for the Parthian <lb/>
            war, he sent her orders to meet him in Cilicia to give an <lb/>
            account of the charges made against her of supplying <lb/>
            Cassius with much money and contributions for the war. <lb/>
            Dellius,* who was sent, observing her person and marking <lb/>
            her cleverness in speaking and her versatility, soon per­ <lb/>
            ceived that Antonius would never even think of doing such <lb/>
            a woman any harm, but that she would have the greatest <lb/>
            influence with him ; and he applied himself to paying his <lb/>
            court to her, and he encouraged the Egyptian, in the <lb/>
            words of Homer,t to go to Cilicia bedecked in her best <lb/>
            fashion and not to be afraid of Antonius, who was the most <lb/>
            pleasant and kindest of generals. Being persuaded by. <lb/>
            Dellius, and collecting from the proofs of her charms upon <lb/>
            Caius Cæsar and Cnæus the son of Pompeius, she had <lb/>
            hopes that she should more easily win over Antonius. <lb/>
            For they knew her when she was yet a girl and inex­ <lb/>
            perienced in affairs, but she was going to visit Antonius at <lb/>
            an age in which women have the most brilliant beauty and <lb/>
            their understanding has attained its perfection. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly she got together many presents and money and <lb/>
            ornaments, such as one might suppose that she could bring <note type="footnote"> * Nothing is known of him, unless he be the person mentioned in <lb/>
            a. 59. Kaltwasser conjectures that he may be the Dellius or Delius <lb/>
            to whom Horace has addressed an ode. (Carm. iii. 2). See c. 1, note. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch alludes to the passage in Homer (Iliad, xiv. 162) where <lb/>

             <pb n="287"/>
            from the greatness of her estate and the wealth of her <lb/>
            kingdom, but she went to Cilicia relying chiefly on herself <lb/>
            and the seductions and charms of her own person,</p>
          <p>XXVI. Though Cleopatra * received many letters of sum­ <lb/>
            mons both from Antonius t and his friends, she so despised <lb/>
            and mocked the man, that she sailed up the Cydnus in a <lb/>
            vessel with a gilded stern, with purple sails spread, and <lb/>
            rowers working with silver oars to the sound of the flute <lb/>
            in harmony with pipes and lutes. Cleopatra reclined <lb/>
            under an awning spangled with gold, dressed as Venus is <lb/>
            painted, and youths representing the Cupids in pictures <lb/>
            stood on each side fanning her. In like manner the hand­ <lb/>
            somest of her female slaves in the dress of Nereids and <lb/>
            Graces, were stationed some at the rudders and others at <lb/>
            the ropes. And odours of wondrous kind from much incense <lb/>
            filled the banks. Some of the people accompanied her im­ <lb/>
            mediately from the entrance of the river on both sides, and <lb/>
            others went down from the city to see the sight. As the <lb/>
            crowd from the Agora also poured forth, Antonius was <lb/>
            finally left on the tribunal sitting alone. A rumour went <lb/>
            abroad that Venus was coming to revel with Bacchus for <lb/>
            the good of Asia. Now Antonius sent to invite Cleopatra <lb/>
            to supper, but she on her part said that he should rather <lb/>
            come to her. Antonius accordingly, wishing to display <lb/>
            some good nature and kindness, obeyed and came. He <lb/>
            found a preparation greater than he expected, but he was <lb/>
            most surprised at the number of the lights : for it is said <lb/>
            that so many lights were hung down and shewn on all <lb/>
            sides at once and arranged and put together in such in­ <lb/>
            clinations and positions with respect to one another in the <lb/>
            form of squares and circles, that of the few things that are <lb/>
            beautiful and worthy of being seen this sight was one. <note type="footnote"> * She was now about twenty-eight years of age. Kaltwasser sug­ <lb/>
            gests that the words " and Cnæus the son of Pompeius" must be an inter­ <lb/>
            polation, because nothing is known of his amours with Cleopatra. But <lb/>
            it this be so, other words which follow in the next sentence must have <lb/>
            been altered when the interpolation was made. </note><note type="footnote"> t Antonius was at Tarsus on the river Cydnus when Cleopatra paid <lb/>
            him this visit, B.o. 41. Shakespere has used this passage of Plutarch <lb/>

            “The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throng <lb/>
            Burnt on the water," &amp;c. </note> <pb n="288"/>
             </p>
          <p>XXVII. On the following day when Antonius feasted <lb/>
            her in turn he was ambitious to surpass her splendour and <lb/>
            taste, but he was left behind and inferior in both, and in <lb/>
            these very things he was the first to scoff at the coarse­ <lb/>
            ness and rusticity of his own entertainment. Cleopatra, <lb/>
            observing in the jests of Antonius much of the soldier and <lb/>
            the unpolished man, adopted the same manner towards <lb/>
            him freely and boldly. Now her beauty, as they say, was <lb/>
            not in itself altogether incomparable nor such as to strike <lb/>
            those who saw her; but familiarity with her had an irre­ <lb/>
            sistible charm, and her form, combined with her persuasive <lb/>
            speech and with the peculiar character which in a manner <lb/>
            was diffused about her behaviour, produced a certain <lb/>
            piquancy. There was a sweetness also in the sound of <lb/>
            her voice when she spoke; and as she could easily turn <lb/>
            her tongue, like a many-stringed instrument, to any lan­ <lb/>
            guage that she pleased, she had very seldom need of an <lb/>
            interpreter for her communication with barbarians, but <lb/>
            she answered most by herself, as Ethiopians,* Troglodytes, <lb/>
            Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Medes, Parthians. She is said <lb/>
            also to have learned the language of many other peoples, <lb/>
            though the kings her predecessors had not even taken the <lb/>
            pains to learn the Egyptian language, and some of them <lb/>
            had even given up the Macedonian dialect.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Now she so captivated Antonius, that though <lb/>
            his wife Fulvia was carrying on war at Rome against <lb/>
            Cæsar on behalf of the interests of Antonius, and a <lb/>
            Parthian army was hovering about Mesopotamia, of which <lb/>
            the king's generals had named Labienus t Parthian <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch has given a long list of languages which this learned <lb/>
            queen spoke. With Arabic and all the cognate dialects, it is probable <lb/>
            enough that she was familiar, but we can hardly believe that she took <lb/>
            pains to learn the barbarous language of the wretched Troglodytes, <lb/>
            who lived in holes on the west coast of the Red Sea. Diodorus (iii. 32) <lb/>

            Parthia to get assistance from king Orodes. He heard of the battle of <lb/>
            Philippi while he was in Parthia and before he had accomplished his </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            governor, and they were about to enter Syria, he allowed <lb/>
            himself to be carried off by her to Alexandria; and there <lb/>
            staying and amusing himself like a young man who had <lb/>
            leisure, he consumed and expended upon pleasure the most <lb/>
            costly of all things, as Antiphon said, Time. They had a <lb/>
            kind of company called Inimitable Livers; and they daily <lb/>
            feasted one another, making an incredible profusion in <lb/>
            their expenditure. Now Philotas of Amphissa,* a physi­ <lb/>
            cian, used to relate to my grandfather Lamprias, that he <lb/>
            was then in Alexandria learning his profession, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing got acquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was <lb/>
            persuaded by him, as was natural in a young man, to view <lb/>
            the costliness and the preparation for the table. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he was introduced into the kitchen, where he saw <lb/>
            everything in great abundance, and eight wild boars <lb/>
            roasting, which made him wonder at the number of the <lb/>
            guests. Hereupon the cook laughed and said, the party <lb/>
            at supper was not large, only about twelve ; but it was <lb/>
            necessary that everything which was served up should be <lb/>
            in perfection, which a moment of time would spoil. He <lb/>
            said it might happen that Antonius should wish to sup <lb/>
            immediately, and if it so happened, he might defer it by <lb/>
            asking for a cup or by falling into some conversation; and <lb/>
            accordingly, he continued, not one supper is prepared, but <lb/>
            many, for the exact time is difficult to conjecture. This <lb/>
            is what Philotas used to tell ; and in the course of time, <lb/>
            as he related, he was among those who attended on the <lb/>
            oldest son of Antonius, whom he had by Fulvia, and he <note type="footnote"> mission ; and he stayed with the Parthians. In the campaign here <lb/>
            alluded to Labienus and the Parthians took Apameia and Antiocheia <lb/>
            in Syria. Labienus, after invading the south-western part of Asia <lb/>
            Minor (B.C. 40), was forced to fly before Ventidius; and he was seized <lb/>
            in Cilicia by a freedman of Julius Cæsar. (Dion Cass. xlviii. 40.) </note><note type="footnote"> * Amphissa was a town of the Locri Ozolæ. </note><note type="footnote"> Philotas studied at Alexandria, which was then a great school of <lb/>
            medicine. We have here an anecdote about Antonius which rests on <lb/>
            more direct testimony than many well-received stories of modern days. </note><note type="footnote"> The bragging physician must have been a stupid fellow to be <lb/>
            silenced by such a syllogism. I have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">πως πυρέττων</foreign>, like <lb/>
            Kaltwnsser, "Wer einigermassen das Fieber hat," &amp;c., which is the <lb/>
            correct translation. </note><note type="footnote"> The text probably means that Philotas was appointed physician to <lb/>

            supped with him with the rest of his companions, as a <lb/>
            general rule, when he did not sup with his father. On <lb/>
            one occasion there was a physician present who was brag­ <lb/>
            ging greatly and much annoying the company at supper, <lb/>
            but Philotas stopped him by a sophism of this kind : “If <lb/>
            a man has fever in some degree, we must give him cold <lb/>
            water ; but every man who has fever has fever in some <lb/>
            degree ; we must therefore give cold water to every man <lb/>
            who has fever." The man was confounded and put to <lb/>
            silence, whereat the youth being pleased, laughed and <lb/>
            said, "All this, Philotas, I give you, pointing to a table <lb/>
            full of many large cups." Philotas acknowledged his in­ <lb/>
            tended kindness, though he was far from thinking that a <lb/>
            boy of his age had authority to make such a present; but <lb/>
            after awhile one of the young slaves took hold of the cups <lb/>
            and bringing them in a vessel bade him put a seal on it. <lb/>
            As Philotas made objections and was afraid to take the <lb/>
            things. " Why, you fool," said the man," do you hesitate ? <lb/>
            Don't you know that the giver is the son of Antonius, and <lb/>
            that he has permission to give so many things of gold ? If <lb/>
            however you tae my advice, you will exchange the whole <lb/>
            with us for a sum of money; for perchance the youth's <lb/>
            father might call for some of the vessels, which are old <lb/>
            and valued for their workmanship.” Such anecdotes as <lb/>
            these my grandfather used to say that Philotas would oc­ <lb/>
            casionally tell.</p>
          <p>XXIX. But Cleopatra, by distributing flattery not, as <lb/>
            Plato* says, in four ways, but in many ways, and by <lb/>
            always adding some new pleasure and charm to whatever <lb/>
            was either serious or mirthful, completely ruled Antonius, <lb/>
            never leaving him by night nor by day. For she played <lb/>
            at dice with him, and drank with him, and hunted with <lb/>
            him, and was a spectator when he was exercising in arms, <lb/>
            and by night when he was standing at the doors and <lb/>
            windows of the common people and jesting with those <lb/>
            within, she accompanied him in his rambles and freaks, <lb/>
            in the dress of a female slave; for Antonius also used to <lb/>
            dress himself in this style. Accordingly he would return <lb/>
            home always well loaded with coarse abuse and sometimes <lb/>
            with blows. With the greater part he was in no good <note type="footnote"> * The passage to which Plutarch alludes is in the Gorgias, p. 464. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            credit; however the Alexandrines took delight in his <lb/>
            extravagances, and joined in his follies without any lack <lb/>
            of cleverness or humour, being pleased therewith and <lb/>
            saying that Antonius put on the tragic mask to the <lb/>
            Romans, but the comic mask to them. Now to relate the <lb/>
            greater part of his follies would be mere trifling. How­ <lb/>
            ever on one occasion when he was fishing and was vexed at <lb/>
            his bad sport, Cleopatra also being present, he ordered the <lb/>
            fisherman to dive under the water and secretly to fasten to <lb/>
            the hook some fishes that had been already caught; and he <lb/>
            pulled up two or three times, but not without being detected <lb/>
            by the Egyptian. Pretending to admire, she spoke to her <lb/>
            Mends and invited them to come as spectators on the <lb/>
            following day. A number of them got into the fishing <lb/>
            boats, and when Antonius had let down his line, she <lb/>
            ordered one of her own men to anticipate him by diving to <lb/>
            the hook and to fasten to it a Pontic salted fish.- Antonius <lb/>
            thinking that he had caught something pulled up, on <lb/>
            which there was, as was natural, great laughter, whereat <lb/>
            Cleopatra said, " Give up the fishing-rud, Imperator, to us <lb/>
            the kings of Pharos and Canopus; your sport is cities and <lb/>
            kings and continents."</p>
          <p>XXX.† While Antonius was spending his time in such <lb/>
            trifles and extravagances, he was surprised by intelligence <lb/>
            from two different quarters; from Rome, that Lucius his <lb/>
            brother and Fulvia his wife, having first been at variance <lb/>
            with one another and then having warred with Cæsar, <lb/>
            were completely defeated and flying from Italy; the other <lb/>
            intelligence was in no wise more favourable, which was <lb/>
            that Labienus at the head of the Parthians had subdued <note type="footnote"> * A great trade was carried on in those times in dried fish from the <lb/>
            Pontic or Black Sea. See Strabo, p. 320, ed. Casaub. </note><note type="footnote"> t It was near the end of B.C. 40 that Antonius was roused from his <lb/>
            “ sleep and drunken debauch." He sailed from Alexandria to Tyriis in <lb/>
            Phoenicia, and thence by way of Cyprus and Rhodes to Athens, where <lb/>
            he saw Fulvia, who had escaped thither from Brundusium. He left <lb/>
            her sick at Sikyon, and crossed from Corcyra (Corfu) to Italy. (Appian, <lb/>
            Civil Wars, v. 52-55.) Brundusium shut her gates against him, on <lb/>
            which he commenced the siege of the city. The war was stopped by <lb/>
            the reconciliation that is mentioned in the text, to which the news of <lb/>
            the death of Fulvia greatly contributed. Antonius had left her at <lb/>

            Asia from the Euphrates and Syria as far as Lydia and <lb/>
            Ionia. With difficulty then, like a man roused from sleep <lb/>
            and a drunken debauch, he set out to oppose the Parthians, <lb/>
            and advanced as far as Phœnice, but as Fulvia sent him <lb/>
            letters full of lamentations be turned towards Italy, with <lb/>
            two hundred ships. On this voyage he took up his friends <lb/>
            who had fled from Italy, and learned from them that <lb/>
            Fulvia had been the cause of the war, for she was naturally <lb/>
            a busy and bold woman; but her hope was to draw away <lb/>
            Antonius from Cleopatra, if their should be any dis­ <lb/>
            turbance in Italy. It happened that Fulvia, who was <lb/>
            Bailing to meet him, died at Sikyon of some disease, which <lb/>
            rendered a reconciliation with Cæsar more easy. For when <lb/>
            Antonius approached Italy, and Caesar was evidently not <lb/>
            intending to make any charge against him, and Antonius <lb/>
            was ready to fix on Fulvia the blame of what he was <lb/>
            charged with, their friends would not let them come to <lb/>
            any explanation of these grounds, but brought them both <lb/>
            to terms and distributed the empire, making the Ionian <lb/>
            gulf the boundary, and giving the eastern parts to <lb/>
            Antonius and the western to Cæsar; Lepidus was allowed <lb/>
            to keep Libya ; and it was settled that the friends of each <lb/>
            in turns should be consuls, when it did not please them­ <lb/>
            selves to be.</p>
          <p>XXXI. This arrangement seemed to be good, but it <lb/>
            required a stronger security, and fortune offered one. <lb/>
            Octavia* was a sister of Caesar, older than Cæsar, but not by <lb/>
            the same mother; for she was the daughter of Ancharia, <lb/>
            but he was born afterwards of Atia. Cæsar was very <lb/>
            greatly attached to his sister, and it is said she was a most <lb/>
            admirable woman. Octavia was now a widow, for her <lb/>
            husband Caius Marcellus had not long been dead. As <lb/>
            Fulvia was dead, Antonius also was considered to be a <lb/>
            widower; he did not deny that he had Cleopatra, but he <lb/>
            did not admit that he had her as a wife, and he was still <lb/>
            struggling in his judgment on this point against his love <lb/>
            for the Egyptian. Everybody was proposing this marriage <lb/>
            in the hope that Octavia, who in addition to great beauty <lb/>
            possessed dignity of character and good sense, if she were <lb/>
            united to Antonius and were beloved by him, as it was <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cicero, c. 44, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            reasonable to suppose that such a woman must be, would <lb/>
            be the conservation and cause of union between them in all <lb/>
            respects. This being arranged between them, they went <lb/>
            up to Rome where the marriage of Octavia was celebrated, <lb/>
            though the law did not allow a woman to marry till ten <lb/>
            months after her husband's decease, but the Senate in this <lb/>
            case remitted the time by a decree.</p>
          <p>XXXII. As Sextus* Pompeius was still in possession of <lb/>
            Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and with his numerous <lb/>
            piratical ships, of which Men as the pirate and Menekrates <lb/>
            were commanders, had rendered the sea unsafe to vessels, <lb/>
            and as he seemed to be in a friendly disposition towards <lb/>
            Antonius, for he had received his mother when she had <lb/>
            fled from Rome with Fulvia, it was resolved to come to <lb/>
            terms with him also. They met at the promontory of <lb/>
            Misenum and the mound, the fleet of Pompeius being <lb/>
            anchored close by them, while the forces of Antonius and <lb/>
            Caesar were arranged by the side of them. Having agreed <lb/>
            that Pompeius should have Sardinia and Sicily on condition <lb/>
            of keeping the sea clear of pirates and sending to Rome a <lb/>
            certain quantity of grain, they invited one another to an <lb/>
            entertainment. They cast lots on the occasion, and it was <lb/>
            the lot of Pompeius to feast them first. Upon Antonius <lb/>
            asking him where they should sup, " There," said he, point­ <lb/>
            ing to the commander's ship of six banks of oars, “ for this <lb/>
            is all the paternal residence that is left for Pompeius." <lb/>
            This he said to reproach Antonius, who had the house that <lb/>
            had belonged to the father of Sextus. Fixing his ship at <lb/>
            anchor and making a kind of bridge from the promontory, <lb/>
            he received them with a hearty welcome. When the <lb/>
            banquet was at its height and jokes against Cleopatra and <lb/>
            Antonius were plentiful, Menas the pirate approaching <lb/>
            Pompeius said to him, so that the rest could not hear, “ Will <note type="footnote"> * The meeting with Sextus Pompeius was in B.C. 39, at Cape <lb/>
            Miseno, which is the northern point of the Gulf of Naples. </note><note type="footnote"> Sextus was the second son of Pompeius Magnus. He was now <lb/>
            master of a large fleet, and having the command of the sea, he cut off <lb/>
            the supplies from Rome. The consequence was a famine and riots in <lb/>
            the city. (Appian. Civil Wars, v. 67, &amp;c.) Antonius slaughtered <lb/>
            many of the rioters, and their bodies were thrown into the Tiber. This <lb/>
            restored order; " but the famine," says Appian, " was at its height, aud <lb/>
            the people groaned and were quiet.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            you let me cut off the anchors of the ship and make you <lb/>
            master not of Sicily and Sardinia, but of the Roman em­ <lb/>
            pire?" Pompeius, on hearing this, considered with himself <lb/>
            for a short time, and said, "You ought to have done <lb/>
            it, Menas, without mentioning it to me: but now let us be <lb/>
            satisfied with things as they are; perjury is not for me." <lb/>
            Pompeius, after being feasted by Cæsar and Antonius in <lb/>
            turn, sailed back to Sicily.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. After the settlement of affairs, Antonius sent <lb/>
            forward Ventidius* into Asia to prevent the Parthians from <lb/>
            advancing further, and, in order to please Cæsar, he was <lb/>
            appointed priest of the former Cæsar; and everything else <lb/>
            that concerned public affairs they transacted in common <lb/>
            and in a friendly way. But their games of amusement <lb/>
            caused annoyance to Antonius, as he always carried off <lb/>
            therein less than Caesar. Now there was with Antonius a <lb/>
            man skilled in divinations, an Egyptian, one of those who <lb/>
            cast nativities, who, whether it was to please Cleopatra, <lb/>
            or whether he said it in good faith, spoke freely to An­ <lb/>
            tonius, saying that his fortune, though most splendid and <lb/>
            great, was obscured by that of Cæsar, and he advised him <lb/>
            to remove as far as possible from the young man: “ For <lb/>
            thy daemon," he said, “ is afraid of the daemon of Cæsar, <lb/>
            and though it is proud and erect when it is by itself, it is <lb/>
            humbled by his dæmon when it is near, and becomes <lb/>
            cowed." And indeed the things which were happening <lb/>
            seemed to confirm the Egyptian; for it is said that when <lb/>
            they were casting lots by way of amusement, in whatever <lb/>
            they might happen to be engaged, and throwing dice, <lb/>
            Antonius came off with disadvantage. They frequently <note type="footnote"> * P. Ventidius Bassus was what the Romans call a “ novus homo,” <lb/>
            the first of his family who distinguished himself at Rome. He had <lb/>
            the courage of a soldier and the talents of a true general. When a <lb/>
            child he was made prisoner with his mother in the Marsian war (Dion <lb/>
            Cass. xliii. 51), and he appeared in the triumphal procession of <lb/>
            Pompeius Strabo (Dion Cass. xlix. 21). The captive lived to figure as <lb/>
            the principal person in his own triumph, B.O. 38. In his youth he sup­ <lb/>
            ported himself by a mean occupation. Hoche, when he was a common <lb/>
            soldier, used to embroider waistcoats. Julius Cæsar discovered the <lb/>
            talents of Bassus, and gave him employment suited to his abilities. <lb/>
            In B.C. 43 he was Prætor and in the same year Consul Suffectu. <lb/>
            (Drumann, Antonii, p. 439; Gell. xv. 4.) </note> <lb/>

            matched cocks,* and fighting quails, and those of Caesar <lb/>
            were always victorious. Whereat Antonius being annoyed, <lb/>
            though he did not show it, and paying more regard to the <lb/>
            Egyptian, departed from Italy, leaving the management <lb/>
            of his affairs to Cæsar; and he took with him Octavia as <lb/>
            far as Greece, there having been a daughter born to them. <lb/>
            While he was spending the winter in Athens, he received <lb/>
            intelligence of the first successes of Ventidius, who had <lb/>
            defeated the Parthians in a battle, in which Labienus lost <lb/>
            his life and Pharnapates, the most skilful of the generals <lb/>
            of King Hyrodes.t On the occasion of this victory Antonius <lb/>
            feasted the Greeks; and he acted as gymnasiarch for the <lb/>
            Athenians, and leaving at home the insignia of his rank, <lb/>
            he went forth with the rods of a gymnasiarch ‡ and the <lb/>
            dress and white shoes; and he took the youths by the neck <lb/>
            when he separated them.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. As he was going to set out for the war, he <lb/>
            took a crown from the sacred olive, and in conformity to <lb/>
            a certain oracle, he filled a vessel with water from the <lb/>
            Clepsydra, and carried it with him. In the mean time <note type="footnote"> * Cockfighting pleased a Roman, as it used to do an Engli hman. <lb/>

            facts with accuracy. Labienus lost his life and the Parthians were <lb/>

            more circumstantially by Dion Cassius (xlviii. 40, 41). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The president of the gymnastic exercises. Dion Cassins (xlviii. <lb/>
            39) tells us something that is characteristic of Antonius. The fulsome <lb/>
            flattery of the Athenians gave him on this occasion the title of the <lb/>
            young Bacchus, and they betrothed the goddess Minerva to him. <lb/>
            Antonius said he was well content with the match ; and to show that <lb/>
            be was in earnest he demanded of them a contribution of one million <lb/>
            drachmæ as a portion with his new wife. He thus fleeced them of <lb/>
            about 2800l. sterling. No doubt Antonius relished the joke as well as <lb/>

            a water-clock. The name Clepsydra is given to a spring in Messenia <lb/>
            by Pausanias (iv. 31). Kaltwasser supposes the name Clepsydra to <lb/>
            have been given because such a spring was intermittent. Such a spring <lb/>
            the younger Pliny describes (Ep. iv. 30). </note> <lb/>

            Pacorus,* the king's son, with a large Parthian army again <lb/>
            advanced against Syria, but Ventidius engaged with him <lb/>
            in Cyrrhestica and put his army to flight with great loss; <lb/>
            Pacorus himself fell among the first. This exploit, which <lb/>
            was one of the most celebrated, gave the Romans full <lb/>
            satisfaction for the defeat of Crassus, and again confined <lb/>
            the Parthians within Media and Mesopotamia, after being <lb/>
            defeated in three successive battles. Ventidius gave up <lb/>
            all intention of pursuing the Parthians further, because he <lb/>
            feared the jealousy of Antonius, but he visited those who <lb/>
            had revolted and brought them into subjection, and be­ <lb/>
            sieged Antiochus of Commagene† in the city Samosata. <lb/>
            The king proposed to pay a thousand talents and to obey <lb/>
            the order of Antonius, but Ventidius told him to send his <lb/>
            proposal to Antonius; for he had now advanced near, and <lb/>
            he would not allow Ventidius to make peace with Antio­ <lb/>
            chus, because hb wished that this single exploit at least <lb/>
            should bear his name, and that everything should not be <lb/>
            accomplished by Ventidius. As, however, the siege was <lb/>
            protracted, and the citizens, after despairing of coming to <lb/>
            terms, betook themselves to a vigorous defence, Antonius, <lb/>
            who was making no progress, but was ashamed and re­ <lb/>
            pented of his conduct, was glad to make peace with An­ <lb/>
            tiochus and to take three hundred talents; and after <lb/>
            settling some trifling matters in Syria, he returned to <lb/>
            Athens, and sent Ventidius to enjoy a triumph after be­ <lb/>
            stowing on him the suitable decorations. Ventidius is <lb/>
            the only Roman to the present time who has had a triumph <lb/>
            over the Parthians; and he was a man of obscure birth, <lb/>
            but the friendship of Antonius gave him the opportunity <lb/>
            of doing great deeds, of which he made the best use, and <lb/>
            so confirmed what was generally said of Antonius and <lb/>
            Cæsar, that they were more successful as generals through <note type="footnote"> * The defeat of Pacorus (B.C. 38) is told by Dion Cassius (xlix. 19). <lb/>

            and the kings of the Iberians and Albanians, and advanced <lb/>

            by certain calumnies, sailed to Italy with three hundred <lb/>
            vessels; but as the people of Brundusium would not re­ <lb/>

            There he sent Octavia, for she accompanied him from <lb/>
            Greece, at her request, to her brother: she was then preg­ <lb/>
            nant, and had already borne him two daughters. She met <lb/>
            Cæsar on the way, and after gaining over his friends <lb/>
            Agrippa and Mæcenas,§ she prayed him with much urgency <lb/>
            and much entreaty not to let her become a most wretched <lb/>
            woman after being most happy. For now, she said, all <lb/>
            men turned their eyes upon her, who was the wife of one <lb/>
            Imperator and the sister of another; “ but if the worse <lb/>
            should prevail," she continued, “ and there should be war, <lb/>
            it is uncertain which of you must be the victor and which <lb/>
            the vanquished; but I shall be unfortunate both ways." <lb/>
            Cæsar, being moved by these words, came in a friendly <lb/>
            manner to Tarentum, and those who were present saw a <lb/>
            most noble spectacle, a large army on land tranquil, and <lb/>
            many ships quietly holding on the shore, and the meeting <lb/>

            passion for Cleopatra, which appeared to be put to rest <lb/>
            and to have been tranquillised by better considerations, <lb/>
            blazed forth again and recovered strength as Antonius <lb/>
            approached Syria. And finally (as Platot says of the stub­ <lb/>
            born and ungovernable beast of the soul), kicking away <lb/>
            everything that was good and wholesome, he sent Fonteius <lb/>
            Capito to bring Cleopatra to Syria. On her arrival he <lb/>
            gave and added to her dominions nothing small or trifling, <lb/>
            but Phoenice, Cœle Syria, Cyprus, a large part of Cilicia, <lb/>
            and further, that part of J udæa which produces the balsam, <lb/>
            and all the part of Arabia Nabathæa which was turned <lb/>
            towards the external sea.§ These donations caused the <lb/>

            scandal of the thing was that which gave more offence <lb/>
            than all the honours conferred on Cleopatra. The evil <lb/>
            report was increased by his acknowledging his twin <lb/>
            children by Cleopatra, one of whom he called Alexander <lb/>
            and the other Cleopatra; and he gave to one the surname <lb/>
            of Sun, and the other of Moon. However, he had some <lb/>
            dexterity in putting a good face on bad things, for he <lb/>
            said that the greatness of the Roman power was shown <lb/>
            not in what they received, but in what they gave; and <lb/>
            that noble families were extended by a succession and <lb/>
            progeny of many kings. Thus, for instance, he said, that <lb/>
            his own ancestor was begotten by Hercules, who did not <lb/>
            deposit his successors in a single womb, nor did he fear <lb/>
            laws like Solon's* and penalties for conception, but gave <lb/>
            nature her course to leave many beginnings and founda­ <lb/>

            illustrious rank and great power, fled to Antonius, who <lb/>
            likening the fortune of Monæses to that of Themistoclest <lb/>
            and comparing his own means and magnanimity to those <lb/>
            of the Persian kings, gave him three cities, Larissa and <lb/>
            Arethusa and Hierapolis, which was before called Bambyce. <lb/>
            Upon the Parthian king sending to Monæses a right hand,§ <lb/>
            Antonius gladly despatched Monæses to him, having re­ <lb/>
            solved to deceive Phraates with a pretence of peace, but <lb/>
            claiming the restoration of the standards taken in the <lb/>
            time of Crassus and such of the prisoners as st ill survived. <lb/>
            Antonius having sent Cleopatra back to Egypt, marched <lb/>

            of the confederate kings; and they were many, but the <lb/>
            greatest of all was Artavasdes,* king of Armenia, who <lb/>
            supplied six thousand horse and seven thousand foot <lb/>
            soldiers. There were of the Romans sixty thousand foot <lb/>
            soldiers, and the cavalry which was classed with the <lb/>
            Romans was ten thousand Iberians† and Celts ; and of the <lb/>
            other nations there were thirty thousand together with <lb/>
            cavalry and light-armed troops. Yet so great a prepara­ <lb/>
            tion and power, which alarmed even the Indians beyond <lb/>
            Bactria and shook all Asia, it is said, was made of no avail <lb/>
            to him by reason of Cleopatra. For through his eagerness <lb/>
            to spend the winter with her, he opened the campaign <lb/>
            before the fit time and conducted everything in a dis­ <lb/>
            orderly way, not having the mastery over his own judg­ <lb/>
            ment, but through the influence of some drugs or magic <lb/>
            always anxiously looking towards her, and thinking more <lb/>
            of his speedy return than of conquering the enemy.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Now, in the first place, though it was his <lb/>
            business to winter there in Armenia and to give his army <lb/>
            rest, which was worn out by a march of eight thousand <lb/>
            stadia, and before the Parthians moved from their winter- <lb/>
            quarters in the commencement of spring, to occupy Media, <lb/>
            he did not wait for the time, but immediately led forward <lb/>
            his army, leaving Armenia on the left and touching on <lb/>
            Atropatene,‡ which he ravaged. In the next place, the <lb/>
            engines which were necessary for sieges were carried along <lb/>
            with the army in three hundred waggons, and among <lb/>
            them was a ram eighty feet long ; and it was not possible <lb/>
            for any one of them, if it was damaged, to be repaired <lb/>
            when it was wanted, because the upper country only <lb/>
            produced wood of insufficient length and hardness: ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly in his hurry he left all the engines behind as <lb/>
            encumbrances to his speed, after appointing a watch and <lb/>

            menced the siege of <unclear>Phraata</unclear>,* a large city, in which were <lb/>
            the children and wives of the king of Media. But the <lb/>
            difficulties soon proved what an error he had committed <lb/>
            in leaving behind the engines; and as he wished to come <lb/>
            to close quarters with the enemy, he commenced erecting <lb/>
            a mound against the city, which rose slowly and with <lb/>
            much labour. In the meantime Phraates came down with <lb/>
            a great force, hearing of the waggons being left behind <lb/>
            that carried the machines, and sent many horsemen <lb/>
            against them, by whom Statianus was hemmed in and <lb/>
            killed and ten thousand men with him. The barbarians <lb/>
            took possession of the engines and destroyed them. They <lb/>
            also took many prisoners, among whom was king Polemon. †</p>
          <p>XXXIX. This misfortune greatly annoyed, as we may <lb/>
            suppose, all the soldiers of Antonius, who at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of the war had received this unexpected blow; <lb/>
            and the Armenian Artavasdes despairing of the success of <lb/>
            the Romans went off with his troops, though he had been <lb/>
            the chief cause of the war. The Parthians now showed <lb/>
            themselves to the besiegers in gallant array and insult- <lb/>
            ingly threatened them, on which Antonius, not wishing <lb/>
            to let despondency and dejection abide in his army by <lb/>
            their being quiet and to increase, took ten legions and <lb/>
            three praetorian cohorts of heavy-armed men and all the <lb/>
            cavalry, and led them out to forage in the hope that the <lb/>
            enemy would thus be drawn on, and that a regular battle <lb/>
            would ensue. After advancing one day's march, he saw <lb/>
            that the Parthians were spreading themselves around him <lb/>
            and seeking to attack him on the march, on which he <lb/>
            hung out in the camp the sign of battle, but at the same <lb/>
            time he ordered the tents to be taken down, as if his in­ <lb/>
            tention were not to fight but to lead off his troops; and <lb/>
            he passed along the line of the barbarians, which was in <lb/>
            the form of a crescent, having given orders, as soon as the <lb/>
            first ranks of the enemy should be within reach of the <note type="footnote"> * Dion Caseins (xlix. 25) names the place Phraaspa or Praaspa, <lb/>

            heavy-armed soldiers, for the cavalry to ride at them. To <lb/>
            the Parthians who stood opposed to the Romans, their <lb/>
            discipline appeared to be something indescribable; and <lb/>
            they observed the Romans as they marched past at equal <lb/>
            intervals without disorder and in silence, brandishing <lb/>
            their spears. But when the standard was raised and the <lb/>
            cavalry facing about rushed upon the enemy, the Par­ <lb/>
            thians received their onset and repelled it, though the <lb/>
            Romans were all at once too close to allow them to use <lb/>
            their arrows; but when the heavy-armed soldiers joined <lb/>
            in the conflict at the same time with shouts and the clatter <lb/>
            of arms, the Parthian horses were frightened and gave <lb/>
            way and the Parthians fled before they came to close <lb/>
            quarters. Antonius pressed on the pursuit, and had great <lb/>
            hopes that he had finished the whole war or the chief part <lb/>
            in that battle. But when the infantry had followed up <lb/>
            the pursuit for fifty stadia and the cavalry for three times <lb/>
            that distance, looking at those of the enemy who had fallen <lb/>
            and were captured, they found only thirty captives and <lb/>
            eighty corpses, which caused dismay and despondency in <lb/>
            all the army, when they reflected that though victorious <lb/>
            they had killed so few, and that when defeated they must <lb/>
            sustain such a loss as they had near the waggons. On <lb/>
            the following day they broke up their encampment and <lb/>
            took the road towards Phraata and the camp. On their <lb/>
            march they fell in at first with a few of the enemy, and <lb/>
            then a greater number, and finally with all, who, as if <lb/>
            they were unvanquished and fresh, challenged them and <lb/>
            fell upon them from all sides, so that with difficulty and <lb/>
            much labour they got safe to their camp. As the Medea <lb/>
            made a sally against the mound and terrified those who <lb/>
            were defending it, Antonius being enraged put in practice <lb/>
            what is called decimation- against the cowards; for he <lb/>
            divided the whole number into tens, and put to death one <lb/>
            out of each ten who was chosen by lot; and to the rest <lb/>
            he ordered barley to be measured out, instead of wheat.</p>
          <p>XL. The war was attended with great hardship to both <lb/>
            sides, and the future was still more alarming, as Antonius <lb/>
            was expecting famine, for it was no longer possible to get <lb/>
            forage without many of the soldiers being wounded and <note type="footnote"> * See Life of Crassus, c 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            killed. Phraates knowing that the Parthians were able <lb/>
            to bear anything rather than to endure hardship in the <lb/>
            winter and to encamp in the open air, was afraid lest, if <lb/>
            the Romans held out and abided there, his troops would <lb/>
            leave him, as the atmosphere was beginning to grow heavy <lb/>
            after the autumnal equinox. Accordingly he planned <lb/>
            such a stratagem as this. The chiefs of the Parthians,* <lb/>
            both in the forages and on other occasions when they met <lb/>
            the Romans, made less vigorous resistance, both allowing <lb/>
            them to take some things and commending their valour in <lb/>
            that they were most courageous men, and were justly <lb/>
            admired by their king. After this, riding up nearer to <lb/>
            them, and quietly placing their horses near the Romans, <lb/>
            they would abuse Antonius, baying that though Phraates <lb/>
            wished to come to terms and to spare so many brave men, <lb/>
            Antonius would not give him the opportunity, but sat <lb/>
            there awaiting those dangerous and powerful enemies, <lb/>
            hunger and winter, from whom it would be difficult for <lb/>
            them to escape, even under convoy of the Parthians. Many <lb/>
            persons reported this to Antonius, and though he was soft­ <lb/>
            ened by hope, still he did not send heralds to the Par­ <lb/>
            thians until he inquired from the barbarians who assumed <lb/>
            this friendly demeanour, whether what they said really <lb/>
            expressed the king's meaning. On their saying that it <lb/>
            was so, and urging him not to fear or distrust, he sent <lb/>
            some of his companions to demand back the standards and <lb/>
            the captives, that it might not be supposed that he was so <lb/>
            eager to make his escape and get away. The Parthian <lb/>
            told him not to trouble himself about that matter, but <lb/>
            promised him peace and security if he would depart forth­ <lb/>
            with ; whereupon in a few days Antonius got his baggage <lb/>
            together and broke up his camp. Though Antonius had <lb/>
            great powers of persuasion before a popular assembly, and <lb/>
            was skilled above every man of the age in leading an army <lb/>
            by his words, he was unable through shame and depression <lb/>
            of spirits to encourage the soldiers, and he bade Domitius <lb/>
            Ænobarbus† do this. Some of the soldiers took this amiss, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ γνωριμώτατοι</foreign>, which Kaltwasser translates "those who were <lb/>
            most acquainted with the Romans;” and his translation may be right. </note><note type="footnote"> t On. Domitius Ahenobarbus, which is the Roman mode of writing <lb/>

            considering it as a token of contempt towards them, <lb/>
            but the majority were affected by it, and perceived <lb/>
            the reason, and they thought that they ought on this <lb/>
            account the more to show their respect and obedience to <lb/>
            the commander.</p>
          <p>XLI. As Antonius was intending to lead the troops <lb/>
            back by the same road, which was through a plain country <lb/>
            without trees, a man, by nation a Mardian,* who was well <lb/>
            acquainted with the Parthian habits, and had already <lb/>
            shown himself faithful to the Romans in the battle at the <lb/>
            waggons, came up to Antonius and advised him in his <lb/>
            flight to keep to the mountains on his right, and not to <lb/>
            expose a force, in heavy armour and encumbered, to so <lb/>
            numerous a cavalry and to the arrows in bare and open <lb/>
            tracts, which was the very thing that <unclear>Phraales</unclear> designed <lb/>
            when he induced him by friendly terms to raide the siege; <lb/>
            and that he would lead them a shorter road, where he <lb/>
            would find a better supply of necessaries. Antonius on <lb/>
            hearing this deliberated; he did not wish to appear to dis­ <lb/>
            trust the Parthians after the truce, yet as he approved of <lb/>
            the shorter road, and the line of march being along in­ <lb/>
            habited villages, he asked the Mardian for a pledge of his <lb/>
            fidelity. The Mardian offered himself to be put in chains <lb/>
            until he should place the army in Armenia; and he was <lb/>
            put in chains, and he conducted them for two days without <lb/>
            their meeting with any opposition. On the third day, <lb/>
            when Antonius had completely ceased to think of the Par­ <lb/>
            thians, and was advancing in a careless way by reason of <lb/>
            his confidence, the Mardian observed that an embankment <lb/>
            against the overflowing of a river had been recently <note type="footnote"> Corfinium (Life of Cæsar, a. 34); and he is the Domitius who deserted <lb/>
            Antonius just before the battle of Actium (c. 63). </note><note type="footnote"> * The Mardi inhabited a tract on the south coast of the Caspian, <lb/>
            where there was a river Mardus or Amardus. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch has derived his narrative of the retreat from some account <lb/>
            by an eye-witness, but though it is striking as a picture, it is quite <lb/>
            useless as a military history. The route is not designated any further <lb/>
            than this, that Antonius had to pass through a plain and desert <lb/>
            country. It is certain that he advanced considerably east of the <lb/>
            Tigris, and he experienced the same difficulties that Crassus did in <lb/>
            the northern part of Mesopotamia. (Strabo, p. 523, ed. Casaub. as to <lb/>
            the narrative of Adelphius, and Casaubon's note.) </note> <lb/>

            broken, and that the stream was flowing in a great cur­ <lb/>
            rent on the road by which they had to pass, and he knew <lb/>
            that the Parthians had done this with the intention of <lb/>
            making the river an obstacle to the Roman march by the <lb/>
            difficulty and delay that it would occasion; and he bade <lb/>
            Antonius look out and be on his guard, as the enemy was <lb/>
            near. Just while he was placing the heavy-armed men <lb/>
            in order, and taking measures for the javelin-men and <lb/>
            slingers to make an attack through their ranks upon the <lb/>
            enemy, the Parthians appeared and rode round them with <lb/>
            the design of encircling the Romans and putting them in <lb/>
            disorder on all sides. The light-armed troops made a sally <lb/>
            against them, and the Parthians, after inflicting some <lb/>
            wounds with their arrows and receiving as many from the <lb/>
            leaden bullets. and javelins of the Romans, retreated. The <lb/>
            Parthians then commenced a second attack, which con­ <lb/>
            tinued until the Celtæ in a mass drove their horses against <lb/>
            them and dispersed them ; and the Parthians showed them­ <lb/>
            selves no more on that day.</p>
          <p>XLII. From this experience Antonius, learning what he <lb/>
            ought to do, covered not only the rear, but also both flanks <lb/>
            with many javelin men and slingers, and led his army in <lb/>
            the form of a quadrangle; and the cavalry received orders <lb/>
            to repel the attack of the enemy, but when they had <lb/>
            repulsed them, not to pursue far, in consequence of which <lb/>
            the Parthians during the four following days sustained as <lb/>
            much damage as they inflicted, and their ardour being <lb/>
            dulled they thought of retiring, as an excuse for which <lb/>
            they alleged the approach of winter. On the fifth day <lb/>
            Flavius Gallus, a man of military talent and great activity, <lb/>
            who held a command, came and asked Antonius for more <lb/>
            light-armed troops for the rear,t and for some of the cavalry <lb/>
            from the van, in the expectation of having great success. <lb/>
            Antonius gave him the troops, and when the enemy made <lb/>
            his attack, he fell upon them, not as on former occasions, <lb/>
            at the same time withdrawing towards the heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldiers and retreating, but resisting them and engaging <lb/>
            with the enemy in a desperate way. The commanders of <note type="footnote"> * These were used by the slingers (funditores) in the Roman army. </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ᾽οὐρὰν</foreign>, Sintenis: but the MS. reading is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐρᾶς</foreign>, “from the <unclear/> <lb/>

            the rear seeing that he was being separated from them, <lb/>
            sent and called him back, but he would not listen to them. <lb/>
            They say that Titius the quæstor, seizing the standards, <lb/>
            turned them round and abused Gallus for throwing away <lb/>
            the lives of many brave men. But as Gallus abused him <lb/>
            in turn, and urged those about him to remain, Titius <lb/>
            retreated. While Gallus was pushing forwards against <lb/>
            the enemy in front, a large body of those in the rear got <lb/>
            round him before he perceived it. Being now attacked on <lb/>
            all sides he sent for aid ; but the commanders of the heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops, among whom was Canidius, a man who had <lb/>
            the greatest influence with Antonius, are considered to <lb/>
            have committed a great mistake. For when they ought <lb/>
            to have moved the whole line against the enemy, they <lb/>
            sent a few at a time to help against them; and again <lb/>
            when these were being worsted, they sent others, and thus <lb/>
            these came near filling the whole army with defeat and <lb/>
            flight before they were aware of it; but Antonius himself <lb/>
            quickly came with the heavy-armed men from the van to <lb/>
            meet the enemy, and the third legion quickly pushing <lb/>
            through the fugitives against the enemy stopped their <lb/>
            further pursuit.</p>
          <p>XLIII. There fell no fewer than three thousand; and <lb/>
            there were carried to the tents five thousand wounded, <lb/>
            and among them Gallus, who was pierced with five arrows <lb/>
            in front. Gallus did not recover from his wounds; but <lb/>
            Antonius, going about, visited the rest of the wounded, and <lb/>
            he encouraged them with tears in his eyes and deep sym­ <lb/>
            pathy. The men, cheerfully grasping his right hand, beg­ <lb/>
            ged him to go and take care of his health and not to trouble <lb/>
            himself about them, calling him Imperator, and saying that <lb/>
            they were all secure if he was only safe. For altogether <lb/>
            it seems that no Imperator of that age got together an army <lb/>
            more distinguished by courage or endurance or strength; <lb/>
            but the respect towards the commander himself, and the <lb/>
            obedience combined with affection, and the circumstance <lb/>
            that all alike, those of good reputation, those of bad, <lb/>
            commanders, private soldiers, preferred honour and favour <lb/>
            from Antonius to their own lives and safety, left nothing <lb/>
            even for the ancient Romans to surpass, And of this there <lb/>
            were several reasons, as we have said before; noble birth. <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            powerful eloquence, simplicity, generosity and munificence, <lb/>
            affability in his pleasures and conversation. On that <lb/>
            occasion, by the pains that he took and his sympathy with <lb/>
            the wounded, and by sharing with them whatever they <lb/>
            wanted, he made the sick and wounded more full of alacrity <lb/>
            than those who were whole.</p>
          <p>XLIV. However the victory so elated the enemy, who <lb/>
            were already worn out and exhausted, and they despised <lb/>
            the Romans so much that they even passed the night. close <lb/>
            to the camp, expecting that they should soon plunder the <lb/>
            deserted tents and the baggage of the Romans skulking <lb/>
            away. At daybreak the enemy crowded upon them in <lb/>
            still greater numbers, and there are said to have been not <lb/>
            fewer than forty thousand horseman, as the king had sent <lb/>
            even those who were always placed around himself, as to <lb/>
            certain and secure success; for the king himself was never <lb/>
            present in any battle. But Antonius, wishing to harangue <lb/>
            the soldiers, asked for a dark garment that he might appear <lb/>
            more piteous. But as his friends opposed him, he came <lb/>
            forward in the purple dress of a general and addressed the <lb/>
            troops, praising those who had been victorious, and up­ <lb/>
            braiding those who had fled. The former exhorted him to <lb/>
            be of good cheer, and the others making their apology <lb/>
            offered themselves to him either to be decimated or to be <lb/>
            punished in any other way ; only they prayed him to cease <lb/>
            being troubled and grieved. Hereupon, raising his hands, <lb/>
            he prayed to the gods, that if any reverse of fortune should <lb/>
            follow on account of his former prosperity, it might come <lb/>
            upon him, but that they would give safety and victory to <lb/>
            the rest of the army.</p>
          <p>XLV. On the following day they advanced under better <lb/>
            protection; and when the Parthians made their attack, the <lb/>
            result was very contrary to their expectations. For they <lb/>
            expected to advance to plunder and booty, and not to battle; <lb/>
            but as they were assailed by many missiles, and saw that <lb/>
            the Romans were encouraged and fresh with alacrity, they <lb/>
            were again completely wearied of the contest. However <lb/>
            the Parthians again fell upon them as they were descending <lb/>
            some steep hills, and galled them with arrows as they were <lb/>
            slowly retreating, whereon the shield-bearerst faced about <note type="footnote"> * Contrary to Parthian practice.

            and placing the light-armed troops within their ranks, <lb/>
            dropped down on one knee and held their shields before <lb/>
            them; those behind held their shields before the front <lb/>
            rank, and those who were behind the second rank did the <lb/>
            same. This form, which very much resembles a roof,. <lb/>
            presents a theatrical appearance, and is the safest of bul­ <lb/>
            warks against the arrows, which thus glance off. But the <lb/>
            Parthians, who thought that the Romans bending on one <lb/>
            knee was a sign of exhaustion and fatigue, laid aside their <lb/>
            bows, and grasping their spears by the middle, came to <lb/>
            close quarters. But the Romans with one shout all at once <lb/>
            sprang up, and pushing with their javelins which they held <lb/>
            in their hands, killed the foremost and put all the rest to <lb/>
            flight. This took place also on the following days, the <lb/>
            Romans making only small way. Famine also attacked <lb/>
            the army, which could get little grain and that with fight­ <lb/>
            ing, and they had few implements for grinding; for the <lb/>
            greater part were left behind, owing to some of the beasts <lb/>
            dying, and others being employed in carrying the sick <lb/>
            and wounded. It is said that an Attic choenixt of wheat <lb/>
            was sold for fifty drachmae; and they sold barley loaves <lb/>
            for their weight in silver. Then they betook themselves <lb/>
            to vegetables and roots; but they found few of the kind <lb/>
            that they were accustomed to, and being compelled to make <lb/>
            trial of what they had never tasted before, they ate of one <lb/>
            herb that caused madness and then death. For he who had <lb/>
            eaten of it recollected nothing, and understood nothing, <lb/>
            and busied himself about nothing except one sole thing, <lb/>
            which was to move and turn every stone, as if he were <lb/>
            doing something of great importance. The plain was full <lb/>
            of men stooping to the ground and digging round stones <note type="footnote"> Life of Crassus, a. 25. See life of Antonius, c. 49, ol <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ δπλῖται ... <lb/>

            many were dying and the Parthians did not desist from <lb/>

            ten thousand! "* whereby he expressed his admiration of <lb/>
            the ten thousand, that though they marched even a greater <lb/>
            distance, from Babylonia, and fought with many more <lb/>
            enemies, yet they made good their retreat.</p>
          <p>XL VI. The Parthians, not being able to break through <lb/>
            the Roman army nor yet to separate their ranks, and being <lb/>
            already often defeated and put to flight, again mingled in a <lb/>
            friendly way with those who went out for grass or corn, <lb/>
            and pointing to the strings of their bows which were <lb/>
            unstrung, said, that they were going back and this was the <lb/>
            end of their attack; but that a few of the Medes would <lb/>
            follow still one or two clays'journey without annoying them <lb/>
            at all, and for the purpose of protecting the more distant <lb/>
            villages. To these words were added embraces and signs <lb/>
            of friendship, so that the Romans were again of good cheer ; <lb/>
            and Antonius hearing this resolved to keep nearer to tho <lb/>
            plains, as the road through the mountains was said to be <lb/>
            waterless. While he was intending to do this, there came <lb/>
            to the camp a man from the enemy, named Mithridates, a <lb/>
            cousin of Monæses, of him who had been with Antonius <lb/>
            and had received the three cities as a present. And he <lb/>
            asked for some one to come near to him who could speak <lb/>
            the Parthian or the Syrian language. Alexander of <lb/>
            Antioch came to him, and he was an intimate friend of <lb/>
            Antonius, whereupon Mithridates, saying who he was, and <lb/>
            intimating that they must thank Monæses for what he was <lb/>
            going to say, asked Alexander, if he saw in the distance a <lb/>
            continuous range of lofty mountains. On Alexander <lb/>
            saying that he saw them, he replied, "Under those <lb/>
            mountains the Parthians with all their forces lie in ambush <lb/>
            for you. For the great plains border on these mountains, <lb/>
            and they expect that you will be deceived by them and <lb/>
            will turn in that direction and leave the road through the <lb/>
            mountains. The way over the mountains is attended with <note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to the retreat of the Greeks in the army of Cyrus <lb/>

             <pb n="310"/>
            thirst and labour to which you are accustomed, but if <lb/>
            Antonius goes by the plain, let him be assured that the fate <lb/>
            of Crassus awaits him "</p>
          <p>XL VII. Having said this, he went away ; and Antonius, <lb/>
            who was troubled at these words, called together his friends <lb/>
            and the Mardian who was their guide, and had exactly the <lb/>
            same opinion. For even if there were no enemy, he knew <lb/>
            that the want of roads in the plains and the mistakes in <lb/>
            the track which they might make there were matters of <lb/>
            hazard and difficulty; but he declared that the road over <lb/>
            the mountains presented no other risk than the want of <lb/>
            water for a single day. Accordingly Antonius turned <lb/>
            aside and led his army by this route by night, having given <lb/>
            orders to the men to take water with them. But the <lb/>
            greater part had no vessels, and accordingly they filled <lb/>
            their helmets with water and carried them, and others took <lb/>
            it in skins. As soon as Antonius began to advance, the <lb/>
            Parthians had intelligence of it, and contrary to their <lb/>
            custom they commenced the pursuit while it was still night. <lb/>
            Just as the sun was rising, they came up with the rear, <lb/>
            which was in weak condition through want of sleep and <lb/>
            fatigue : for they had accomplished two hundred and forty <lb/>
            stadia in the night; and the enemy coming upon them so <lb/>
            suddenly when they did not expect it, dispirited them. <lb/>
            The contest increased their thirst, for they still advanced <lb/>
            while they were defending themselves. Those who were <lb/>
            in the first ranks, as they were marching onwards, came to <lb/>
            a river,* the water of which was cool and pellucid, but salt <lb/>
            and of a medicinal nature; and this water, when drank of <lb/>
            immoderately, caused pains with purging and augmentation <lb/>
            of the thirst: and though the Mardian had warned them <lb/>
            of this, the soldiers nevertheless forced away those who <lb/>
            tried to hinder them and drank of the water. Antonius <lb/>
            went round to the men and prayed them to hold out for a <lb/>
            short time, and he said there was another river not far off, <lb/>
            and besides this, the rest of the route was impracticable for <note type="footnote"> * Salt streams occur on the high lands of Asia. Mannert, quoted by <lb/>
            Kaltwasser, supposes that the stream here spoken of is one that flows <lb/>
            near Tabriz and then joins another river. If this were the only salt <lb/>
            stream that Antonius could meet witi. on his march, the conclusion of <lb/>
            the German geographer might be admitted. </note> <lb/>

            horses and rough, so that the enemy must certainly turn <lb/>
            back. At the same time he summoned those who were <lb/>
            engaged in the fight and gave the signal for pitching the <lb/>
            tents, that the soldiers mignt at least enjoy the shade a little.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. While then the tents were being fixed and the <lb/>
            Parthians as usual were immediately retiring, Mithridates <lb/>
            came again, and upon Alexander going up to him, he ad­ <lb/>
            vised him to put the army in motion after it had rested a <lb/>
            little and to hasten to the river: for he said that the <lb/>
            Parthians would not cross it, but would follow up the <lb/>
            pursuit as far as the river. Alexander reported this to <lb/>
            Antonius, and then brought out from him numerous gold <lb/>
            cups and goblets, of which Mithridates taking as many as <lb/>
            he could hide in his dress, rode off. As it was still day­ <lb/>
            light, they broke up their tents and advanced, without <lb/>
            being annoyed by the enemy; but they made that night <lb/>
            of all others the most painful and frightful to themselves. <lb/>
            For they killed and plundered those who had silver or <lb/>
            gold, and took the things that were carried by the beasts ; <lb/>
            and finally falling upon the baggage of Antonius, they cut <lb/>
            in pieces and divided among them cups and costly tables, <lb/>
            there being great disturbance and confusion through the <lb/>
            whole army; for they thought that the enemy had fallen <lb/>
            upon them and that flight and dispersion had ensued. <lb/>
            Antonius called one of the freedmen, who was on his guard, <lb/>
            named Rhamnus, and bound him by oath when he gave <lb/>
            him the order, to push his sword through him and to cut off <lb/>
            his head, that he might neither be taken alive by the <lb/>
            enemy nor be recognised when dead. His friends broke <lb/>
            out in tears, but the Mardian encouraged Antonius by <lb/>
            telling him that the river was near; for a moist <lb/>
            breeze blowing and a cooler air meeting them made their <lb/>
            respiration more agreeable; and he said that the time they <lb/>
            had been on the march confirmed his estimate of the <lb/>
            distance, for what now remained of the night was not <lb/>
            much. At the same time others reported that the disorder <lb/>
            was owing to their own wrongful deeds and rapacity. <lb/>
            Accordingly Antonius, wishing to bring the army <lb/>
            into order from their state of disorder and confusion, <lb/>
            commanded the signal to be given for pitching the tents.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Day was now dawning, and as the army was <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            beginning to get into certain order and tranquillity, the <lb/>
            arrows of the Parthians fell upon the rear, and the signal <lb/>
            for battle was given to the light-armed troops. The <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops again covering one another in like <lb/>
            manner as before with their shields, stood the assault of <lb/>
            the missiles, the enemy not venturing to come near. The <lb/>
            first ranks advancing slowly in this form, the river was <lb/>
            seen; and Antonius drawing up his cavalry on the banks <lb/>
            in face of the enemy, took across the weak first. Those <lb/>
            who were fighting were now relieved from apprehension, <lb/>
            and had the opportunity of drinking; for when the <lb/>
            Parthians saw the river, they unstrung their bows and <lb/>
            bade the Romans pass over in confidence, with great <lb/>
            encomiums on their valour. Accordingly, they crossed, <lb/>
            and recruited themselves quietly; and then they marched <lb/>
            forwards, but yet not with full confidence in the Parthians. <lb/>
            On the sixth day after the last battle they reached the <lb/>
            river Araxes,* which is the boundary between Media and <lb/>
            Armenia. It appeared dangerous both for its depth and <lb/>
            roughness, and a rumour went through the army that the <lb/>
            enemy was in ambush there, and would fall on them as <lb/>
            they were crossing. When they had safely crossed and <lb/>
            had set foot in Armenia, as if they had just got sight of <lb/>
            that land from the sea, they saluted it and fell to shedding <lb/>
            of tears and embracing of one another for joy. In their <lb/>
            progress through a fertile country, during which they used <lb/>
            everything freely after having suffered great want, they <lb/>
            were subject to dropsical and bowel complaints.</p>
          <p>L. Antonius there made a review of his men, and he <lb/>
            found that twenty thousand infantry and four thousand <lb/>
            cavalry had perished; not all by the enemy, but above <lb/>
            half by disease. They marched from Phraata twenty­ <note type="footnote"> * The modern Aras. The main branch of the river rises in the same <lb/>
            mountain mass in which a branch of the Euphrates rises, about 39° 47' <lb/>
            N. lat., 41° 9' E. long. It joins the Cyrus or Kur, which comes from <lb/>
            the Caucasus, about thirty miles above the entrance of the unite I stream <lb/>
            into the Caspian Sea. Mannert, quo ed by Kaltwasser, conjectures <lb/>
            that Antonius crossed the river at Julfa (38° 54' N. lat.). It is well to <lb/>
            call it a conjecture. Any body may make another, with as much <lb/>
            reason. Twenty-seven days' march <unclear/>(c. 50) brought the Romans from <lb/>
            Phraata to the Araxes, but the point of departure and the point where <lb/>
            the army crossed the Araxes are both unknown. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            seven days, and they defeated the Parthians in eighteen <lb/>
            battles; but these victories brought neither strength nor <lb/>
            security, because their pursuits were short and ineffectual. <lb/>
            And this mainly showed that it was Artavasdes* the <lb/>
            Armenian who had deprived Antonius of the means of <lb/>
            bringing that war to an end. For if the sixteen thousand <lb/>
            horsemen whom he drew out of Media had been present, <lb/>
            who were equipped like the Parthians, and were accustomed <lb/>
            to fight against them, and if, while the Romans put to <lb/>
            flight the fighting enemy, they had overtaken the <lb/>
            fugitives, it would not have been in their power after a <lb/>
            defeat to recover themselves and venture again so often. <lb/>
            All the army accordingly in passion endeavoured to incite <lb/>
            Antonius to punish the Armenian. But Antonius upon <lb/>
            considerations of prudence neither reproached him for his <lb/>
            treachery nor abated of his usual friendly behaviour and <lb/>
            respect towards him, being weak in numbers and in want <lb/>
            of supplies. Afterwards, however, when he again broke <lb/>
            into Armenia, and by many promises and invitations, <lb/>
            persuaded Artavasdes to come into his hands, he seized <lb/>
            him and took him in chains to Alexandria, where he was <lb/>
            led in triumph. And herein chiefly he offended the Romans, <lb/>
            by giving to the Egyptians for the sake of Cleopatra the <lb/>
            honourable and solemn ceremonial of his native country. <lb/>
            This however took place later.</p>
          <p>LI. Antonius now pressed on his march, the winter <lb/>
            having already set in with severity, through incessant <lb/>
            snow-storms, in which he lost eight thousand men on the <lb/>
            route. Going down to the sea-coast with a very small <lb/>
            body of men, he waited for Cleopatrat in a place between <lb/>
            Berytus and Sidon, called “ White village "; and as she was <lb/>
            slow in coming, he became uneasy and restless, soon giving <lb/>
            himself up to drinking and intoxication, but yet being <lb/>
            unable to continue at table; for while his companions were <lb/>
            drinking he would rise and often spring up to look out, <lb/>
            till Cleopatra arrived there by sea bringing a quantify of <note type="footnote"> * The second expedition of Antonius into Armenia was in B.C, 34, <lb/>
            when he advanced to the Araxes. After the triumph, Artavasdes was <lb/>
            kept in captivity, and he was put to death by Cleopatra in Egypt after <lb/>
            the battle of Actium. B.C. 30 (Dion Cassius xlix. 41, &amp;c.). </note><note type="footnote"> t Compare Dion Cassius, xlix. 51. </note> <lb/>

            clothes and supplies for the soldiers. There are some who <lb/>
            say that Antonius received the clothes from he:, but that <lb/>
            the money was his own, though he distributed it as if it <lb/>
            were a present to him from Cleopatra.</p>
          <p>LII. A quarrel arose between the king of the Modes <lb/>
            and Phraortes* the Parthian, which originated, as they say, <lb/>
            about the Roman spoils, but caused the Mede to have sus­ <lb/>
            picions and fear of being deprived of his dominions. For <lb/>
            this reason he sent to invite Antonius, and proffered to <lb/>
            join him in a war with his own forces. Antonius accord­ <lb/>
            ingly being put in great hope-for the only thing as he <lb/>
            thought which had been the cause of his failing to subdue <lb/>
            the Parthians, his having gone against them without many <lb/>
            horsemen and bowmen, he now saw was offered to him in <lb/>
            such way that his part was rather to do a favour by <lb/>
            accepting than to ask for one-was preparing again to <lb/>
            march into the upper country through Armenia, and <lb/>
            after joining the Mede near the Araxes, then to recom­ <lb/>
            mence the war.</p>
          <p>LIII. At Rome Octaviat was desirous of going to An. <lb/>
            tonius, and Cæsar gave her permission; as the greater <lb/>
            part say, not with the design of pleasing her, but in order <lb/>
            that if she were greatly insulted and neglected, he might <lb/>
            have a specious pretext for the war. On reaching Athens <lb/>
            she received letters from Antonius, in which he told her <lb/>
            to stay there, and informed her of his intended expedition. <lb/>
            Though Octavia was annoyed, and saw that this was only <lb/>
            a pretext, she wrote to him to ask to what place he would <lb/>
            have the things sent which she was bringing to him. <lb/>
            And she was taking a great quantity of clothing for the <lb/>
            army, many beasts, and money and presents for his officers <lb/>
            and friends; and besides this, two thousand picked soldiers <lb/>
            equipped as praetorian cohorts, with splendid armour. A <lb/>
            certain Niger, a friend of Antonius, who was sent by <lb/>
            Octavia, reported this to him, and he added commendation <lb/>
            of Octavia such as she merited and was just. But Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra, seeing that Octavia was entering into a contest <lb/>
            with her, and fearing that if to the dignity of her behaviour <lb/>
            and the power of Cæsar she added the pleasure of social <note type="footnote"> * The name is written both Phraates and Phrates in the MSS. <lb/>

             <pb n="315"/>
            intercourse and attention to Antonius, she would be in­ <lb/>
            vincible and get complete mastery over her husband, pre­ <lb/>
            tended to be desperately in love with Antonius, and she <lb/>
            wasted her body by spare diet; and she put on the ex­ <lb/>
            pression of strong passion when he approached her, and of <lb/>
            sorrow and depression when he went away. She also con­ <lb/>
            trived to be often seen in tears, which she would all at <lb/>
            once wipe away and affect to conceal, as if she did not wish <lb/>
            Antonius to observe it. She practised these arts while <lb/>
            Antonius was preparing for his expedition from Syria <lb/>
            against the Mede.* Flatterers, too, who were busy in her <lb/>
            behalf, abused Antonius as a hard and unfeeling man, who <lb/>
            was causing the death of a woman who was devoted to him <lb/>
            alone. As to Octavia, she came to meet Antonius upon <lb/>
            business on her brother's account, and enjoyed the name <lb/>
            of wife of Antonius; but Cleopatra, who was the queen of <lb/>
            so many people, was only called the beloved of Antonius, <lb/>
            and she did not shun nor disdain this name, so long as she <lb/>
            could see Antonius and live with him; but if she were <lb/>
            driven away from him, she would not survive. At last <lb/>
            they so melted and softened the man, that through fear <lb/>
            that Cleopatra might destroy herself, he returned to Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, and put off the Mede to the summer season, though <lb/>
            the affairs of Parthia were said to be in a state of anarchy. <lb/>
            However, he went up into the country, and brought over <lb/>
            the king to friendly terms, and after betrothing to one of <lb/>
            his sons by Cleopatra one of the daughters of the king, <lb/>
            who was still a young child, he returned, being now <lb/>
            engaged in preparing for the civil war.</p>
          <p>LIV. When Octavia returned from Athens, as Cæsar <lb/>
            conceived her to have been insulted, he ordered her to <lb/>
            dwell in her own house. But she refused to leave her <lb/>
            husband's house, and she advised her brother, if he had <lb/>
            not for other reasons determined to go to war with An­ <lb/>
            tonius, to let her affairs alone, for it was not even decent <lb/>
            to be said, that of the greatest Imperators, one through <note type="footnote"> * In B.O. 34, Antonius invaded Armenia and got Artavasdes the <lb/>
            king into his power. The Median king with whom Antonius made <lb/>
            this marriage alliance (B.O. 33) was also named Artavasdes. Alexander, <lb/>
            the son of Antonius by Cleopatra, was married to Jotape, a daughter <lb/>
            of this Median king. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            love for a woman, and the other through jealousy, brought <lb/>
            the Romans to civil war. This she said, and she con­ <lb/>
            firmed what she said by her acts; for she lived in her <lb/>
            husband's house, just as if he were at home, and she took <lb/>
            care of the children, both her own and those of Fulvia, in <lb/>
            an honourable and liberal way; she also received the <lb/>
            friends of Antonius who were sent to Rome to get offices <lb/>
            or on business, and assisted them in obtaining from Cæsar <lb/>
            what they wanted. She thus unintentionally damaged <lb/>
            Antonius, for he was hated for wronging such a woman. <lb/>
            He was also hated for the division which he made among <lb/>
            his children at Alexandria, which appeared to be tragical* <lb/>
            and arrogant, and to show hatred of the Romans. For he <lb/>
            filled the gymnasium with a crowd, and caused to be placed <lb/>
            on a tribunal of silver two thrones of gold, one for himself, <lb/>
            and the other for Cleopatra, and for the children othei <lb/>
            thrones which were lower; and first of all he declared <lb/>
            Cleopatra Queen of Egypt and Cyprus and Libya and <lb/>
            Coele Syria, with Cæsarion as co-regent, who was believed <lb/>
            to be the son of the former Cæsar, who left Cleopatra preg­ <lb/>
            nant ; in the next place he proclaimed his sons and Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra's to be Kings of Kings; and to Alexander he gave <lb/>
            Armenia, and Media, and Parthia, when he should have <lb/>
            subdued it, and to Ptolemæus he gave Phoenice and Syria <lb/>
            and Cilicia. At the same time also he led forth Alexander, <lb/>
            dressed in a Median vest with a tiara and cittaris† upright, <lb/>
            and Ptolemæus in boots, and a chlamys, and a causia with <lb/>
            a diadem attached to it; for this was the dress of the kings <lb/>
            who followed Alexander, and the other was the dress of <lb/>
            the Medes and Armenians. After the children had em­ <lb/>
            braced their parents, a guard of Armenians was placed <lb/>
            around the one, and of Macedonians around the other. <lb/>
            Cleopatra, both on that occasion and on other occasions <lb/>
            when she went out before the people, used to put on a <note type="footnote"> * This is Plutarch's word. Its precise meaning is not clear, but it <lb/>
            may be collected from the context. It was something like a piece of <lb/>
            theatrical pomp. </note><note type="footnote"> t Or Cidaris. (See Life of Pompeius, c. 33.) The Cittaris seems to <lb/>
            be the higher and upright part of the tiara; and sometimes to be <lb/>

            with a broad brim. (See Smith's Diet. of Antiquities.) </note> <lb/>

            dress sacred to Isis, different from her ordinary dress, and <lb/>
            she was called the new Isis.</p>
          <p>LV. By bringing these matters before the Senate, and <lb/>
            often complaining of them before the people, Caesar excited <lb/>
            the multitude against Antonius. Antonius also sent and <lb/>
            made recriminations against Cæsar. The chief charges <lb/>
            which Antonius made against him were, in the first place, <lb/>
            that though he had taken Sicily from Pompeius, he did not <lb/>
            give him a part of the island; second, that Cæsar had bor­ <lb/>
            rowed ships from him for the war and had kept them; <lb/>
            third, that after ejecting his colleague Lepidus from his <lb/>
            authority and degrading him, Cæsar kept the army and <lb/>
            teriitory and revenues that were assigned to Lepidus;* <lb/>
            and, finally, that lie had distributed nearly all Italy in <lb/>
            allotments among his own soldiers, and had left nothing <lb/>
            for the soldiers of Antonius. To these charges Caesar <lb/>
            replied, that he had deprived Lepidus of his authority <lb/>
            because he was abusing it, and as to what he had acquired <lb/>
            in war, he would share it with Antonius, when Antonius <lb/>
            should share Armenia with him. He further said that the <lb/>
            soldiers of Antonius had no claim to any share of Italy, <lb/>
            for that they had Media and Parthia, which they had <lb/>
            added to the Roman possessions by their brave conduct in <lb/>
            war under their Imperator.</p>
          <p>LVI. Antonius heard of this while he was tarrying in <lb/>
            Armenia ; and he immediately gave orders to Canidius to <lb/>
            take sixteen legions and to go down to the sea. Himself <lb/>
            taking Cleopatra with him went to Ephesus. Here the <lb/>
            navy collected from all quarters, eight hundred ships, <lb/>
            including merchant vessels, of which Cleopatra furnished <lb/>
            two hundred, and twenty thousand talents and supplies <lb/>
            for the war for all the army. Antonius, being persuaded <lb/>
            by Domitius and some others, told Cleopatra to sail to <lb/>
            Egypt and there to wait the result of the war. But as <lb/>
            Cleopatra feared that there would again be a reconciliation <lb/>
            through Octavia, she persuaded Canidius by a large bribe <note type="footnote"> * After the defeat of Sextus Pompeius, Lepidus made a claim to <lb/>
            Sicily and attempted a campaign there against Cæsar. B'it this feeble <lb/>
            man was compelled to surrender. He was deprived of all power, and sent <lb/>
            to live in Italy. He still retained his office of Puntifex Maximus <lb/>
            (Appian, Civil Wars, v. 126 ; Diun Cassius, xlix. 11). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            to speak to Antonius about her, and to say, that it was <lb/>
            neither just for a woman to be kept away from the war, <lb/>
            who supplied so many large contributions, nor was it to <lb/>
            the interest of Antonius to dispirit the Egyptians, who <lb/>
            composed a large part of the naval force; and besides this, <lb/>
            he did not see to which of the kings who joined the expe­ <lb/>
            dition Cleopatra was inferior in understanding, she who <lb/>
            for a long time by herself had governed so large a king­ <lb/>
            dom, and had long enjoyed his company, and had learned <lb/>
            to manage great affairs. These arguments prevailed, for <lb/>
            it was fated that all the power should come into Cæsar's <lb/>
            hands; and after the forces had come together, they sailed <lb/>
            to Samos and enjoyed themselves there. For as orders <lb/>
            had been given to kings and rulers and tetrarchs and <lb/>
            nations and all the cities between Syria and the Mæotis <lb/>
            and Armenia and the Illyrians* to send and bring their <lb/>
            supplies for the war, so all the persons who assisted at <lb/>
            theatrical entertainments were required to meet Antonius <lb/>
            at Samos; and while nearly all the world around was <lb/>
            lamenting and groaning, one island for many days re­ <lb/>
            sounded with pipes and stringed instruments, and the <lb/>
            theatres were filled and the chori were vying with one <lb/>
            another. Every city also joined in the celebration by <lb/>
            sending an ox, and kings rivalled one another in giving <lb/>
            entertainments and presents. So that it went abroad and <lb/>
            was said, how will persons behave in the rejoicings after a <lb/>
            victory, who make such costly banquets to celebrate the <lb/>
            preparations for war ?</p>
          <p>LVII. After these amusements were over, Antonius <lb/>
            gave to the theatrical company Priene for their dwelling; <lb/>
            and sailing to Athens he again gave himself up to pleasure <lb/>
            and theatres. Cleopatra, who was jealous of the honours <lb/>
            that had been paid to Octavia in the city, for Octavia was <lb/>
            very much beloved by the Athenians, attempted to gain <lb/>
            the popular favour by many acts of liberality. The <lb/>
            Athenians after voting to her honorable distinctions, sent <lb/>
            a deputation to her residence to carry the record of the <lb/>
            vote, and Antonius was one of them, as being an Athenian <lb/>
            citizen; and coming before her he went through an <note type="footnote"> * This is an emendation of Amiot in place of the corrupt word <lb/>
            Laurians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            harangue on behalf of the city. He sent persons to Rome <lb/>
            to eject Octavia from his house; and it is said that when <lb/>
            she left it, she took all the children of Antonius with her <lb/>
            except the eldest of the children by Fulvia, for he was <lb/>
            with his father, and that she wept and lamented that she <lb/>
            too would be considered one of the causes of the war. And <lb/>
            the Romans pitied not her, but they pitied Antonius, and <lb/>
            those chiefly who had seen Cleopatra, a woman who had <lb/>
            not the advantage over Octavia either in beauty or in <lb/>
            youth.</p>
          <p>LVIII. Cæsar was alarmed when he heard of the <lb/>
            rapidity and the greatness of the preparation- of Antonius, <lb/>
            lest he should be compelled to come to a decisive battle <lb/>
            during that summer. For he was deficient in many <lb/>
            things, and the exaction of taxes vexed people; for the <lb/>
            free men, being compelled to contribute a fourth† of their <lb/>
            income, and the class of freedmen to contribute an eighth <lb/>
            part of their property, cried out against Cæsar, and tumults <lb/>
            arising from these causes prevailed over all Italy. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly the delay in the war is reckoned among the <lb/>
            greatest faults of Antonius; for it gave time to Caesar to <lb/>
            make preparation, and it put an end to the disturbances <lb/>
            among the people; for while the money was being exacted <lb/>
            from them they were irritated, but when it had been <lb/>
            exacted and they had paid it they remained quiet. ‡ Titius <lb/>
            and Plancus, friends of Antonius and men of consular <lb/>
            rank, being insulted by Cleopatra, for they made the most <lb/>
            opposition to her joining the expedition, escaped to Cæsar, <lb/>
            and they gave him information about the will of Antonius, <lb/>
            as they were acquainted with the contents of it. The will <lb/>
            was placed with the Vestal Virgins,§ and when Caesar asked <lb/>
            for it, they would not give it to him, but they told him, if <lb/>
            he wished to have it, to come and take it himself. And <lb/>
            he did go and take it; and first of all he read it over by <note type="footnote"> * The preparation was making in B.o. 32. Antonius spent the <lb/>
            winter of this year at Patræ in Achæa. </note><note type="footnote"> t An account of these exactions is given by Dion Cassius (1. 10). <lb/>

            himself, and marked certain passages which famished <lb/>
            ready matter of accusation; in the next place he assembled <lb/>
            the Senate and read the will, to the dissatisfaction of the <lb/>
            greater part; for they considered it to be altogether <lb/>
            unusual and a hard matter for a man to- be called to <lb/>
            account in his lifetime for what he wished to be done <lb/>
            after his death. Cæsar dwelt most on that part of the will <lb/>
            which related to the interment; for Antonius directed <lb/>
            that his body, even if he should die in Rome, should be <lb/>
            carried in procession through the Forum and sent to <lb/>
            Alexandria to Cleopatra. Calvisius, an intimate friend of <lb/>
            Cæsar, brought forward also these charges against An­ <lb/>
            tonius in reference to Cleopatra: that he had given her <lb/>
            the libraries. from Pergamum, in which there were two <lb/>
            hundred thousand single books; and that at an entertain­ <lb/>
            ment in the presence ot many people he stood up and <lb/>
            rubbed her feett in compliance with a certain arrangement <lb/>
            and agreement; and that he allowed the Ephesians in his <lb/>
            presence to salute Cleopatra as mistress; and that fre­ <lb/>
            quently when he was administering justice to tetrarchs <lb/>
            and kings on his tribunal, he would receive from her love­ <lb/>
            billets written on onyx or crystal and read them. Furnius‡ <lb/>
            also, who was a man of distinction and the most powerful <lb/>
            orator among the Romans, said that Cleopatra was being <lb/>
            carried in a litter through the Forum, and that Antonius <lb/>
            when he saw her, sprung up and left the judgment-seat <lb/>
            and accompanied her hanging on the litter.</p>
          <p>LIX. In most of these matters Calvisius§ was supposed <lb/>
            to be lying. But the friends of Antonius going about in <note type="footnote"> * This great library at Alexandria is said to have been destroyed <lb/>
            during the Alexandrine war. See the Life of Cæsar, c. 49. </note><note type="footnote"> t The translators are much puzzled to explain this. Kaltwasser <lb/>
            conjectures that Antonius in consequence of losing some wager was <lb/>
            required to do this servile act; and accordingly he translates part of <lb/>
            the Greek text “ in consequence of a wager that had been made.” </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The only person of the name who is known as an active partizan <lb/>

            sents him as a partizan of Cæsar. If Plutarch's Furnius was the <lb/>
            tribune, he must have changed sides already. As to his eloquence, <lb/>

            Rome entreated the people for his sake, and they sent <lb/>
            Geminius, one of their body, to entreat Antonius not to be <lb/>
            regardless about being deprived of his authority by a vote <lb/>
            and declared an enemy of the Romans. Geminius having <lb/>
            sailed to Greece became suspected by Cleopatra of acting on <lb/>
            the behalf of Octavia, and, though he was continually ridi­ <lb/>
            culed at supper and insulted by having unsuitable places <lb/>
            at the feast assigned to him, he submitted to this and <lb/>
            waited for an opportunity of an interview ; and when he <lb/>
            was told at supper to say what he had come about, he <lb/>
            replied that all his communication was to be made when <lb/>
            he was sober, except one thing, which he knew whether <lb/>
            he was sober or drunk ; and it was this, that all would be <lb/>
            well if Cleopatra would go off to Egypt. Antonius was <lb/>
            irritated at this, but Cleopatra said, " You have done well, <lb/>
            Geminius, in having confessed the truth without tor­ <lb/>
            tures." After a few days accordingly Geminius made his <lb/>
            escape to Rome. The flatterers of Cleopatra drove away <lb/>
            also many of the other friends of Antonius, who could not <lb/>
            endure their excesses over wine and their coarse beha­ <lb/>
            viour ; and among these were Marcus Silanus and Dellius <lb/>
            the historian. Dellius says that he was also afraid of some <lb/>
            design from Cleopatra, of which he had been informed by <lb/>
            Glaucus the physician. He had offended Cleopatra at <lb/>
            supper by saying that they had to drink vinegar, while <lb/>
            Sarmentus* at Rome was drinking Falernian. Now Sar­ <lb/>
            mentus was a youth, one of Cæsar's favourites, such as the <lb/>
            Romans call Deliciæ.</p>
          <p>LX. When Cæsar had made preparation sufficient, he <lb/>
            got a vote passed for war against Cleopatra t and for de­ <lb/>
            priving Antonius of the authority which he had surren­ <lb/>
            dered to Cleopatra. Cæsar also said that Antonius, owing <lb/>
            to draughts that had been administered to him, was not in <lb/>
            his senses, and those whom the Romans had to fight <lb/>
            against were Mardion the eunuch, and Potheinus, and Iras <note type="footnote"> * The name occurs in Horace, 1 Sat. 5; but the two may be different <lb/>
            persons. As to the Roman Deliciæ see the note of Coraes; and <lb/>
            Suetonius, Augustus, c. 83. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dion Cassius (1. 4) also states that war was declared only against <lb/>
            Cleopatra, but that Antonius was deprived of all the powers that had <lb/>
            been given to him. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            the tire-woman of Cleopatra, and Charmion, by whom all, <lb/>
            the chief matters of administration were directed. These <lb/>
            signs, it is said, happened before the war. Pisaurum,* a <lb/>
            city that had been colonised by Antonius, which was <lb/>
            situated near the Adriatic, was swallowed up by the open­ <lb/>
            ing of chasms in the earth. From one of the stone statues <lb/>
            of Antonius at Alba sweat oozed for many days, and <lb/>
            it did not cease, though there were persons who wiped it <lb/>
            off. While he was staying at Patræ, the Herakleium was <lb/>
            destroyed by lightning; at Athens the Dionysius, one of <lb/>
            the figures in the Battle of the Giants,t was blown down <lb/>
            by the winds and carried into the theatre. Now Antonius <lb/>
            claimed kinship with Hercules by descent and with Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius by imitating his manner of life, as it has been said, <lb/>
            and he was called young Dionysius. The same tempest <lb/>
            also fell on the colossal statues of Eumenes and Attalus, <lb/>
            on which the name of Antonius had been inscribed, and <lb/>
            threw them down alone out of a large number. The <lb/>
            admiral's ship of Cleopatra was called Antonias, and a bad <lb/>
            omen appeared as to it: some swallows had made their <lb/>
            nest under the stern, but other swallows attacked and <lb/>
            drove them out and destroyed the young.</p>
          <p>LXI. They were now coming together for the war; <lb/>
            and the fighting ships of Antonius were not fewer than <lb/>
            five hundred, among which were many vessels of eight <lb/>
            and ten banks of oars fitted out in proud and pompous <lb/>
            style; of the land forces there were one hundred thousand, <lb/>
            and twelve thousand horsemen. There were on his side <lb/>
            of subject kings, Bocchus the king of the Libyans, and <lb/>
            Tarcondemus the king of Upper Cilicia, and Archelaus, <lb/>
            king of Cappadocia, and Philadelphus of Paphlagonia, and <lb/>
            Mithridates of Commagene, and Sadalas of Thrace. These <lb/>
            were with him. From Pontus Polemon sent a force, and <lb/>
            Malchus from Arabia, and Herodes, the Jew; and besides <lb/>
            these, Amyntas, the king of the Lycaonians and Galatians.‡ <lb/>
            There was also help sent from the king of the Medes. <lb/>
            Cæsar had two hundred and fifty ships of war, and eighty <note type="footnote"> * Now Pesaro in Umbria. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Pausanias, i. 25. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The text of Bryan has, " and Deiotarus, king of the Galatians: ” <lb/>

            thousand infantry, and about the same number of horse­ <lb/>
            men as the enemy. The dominion of Antonius extended <lb/>
            over the country from the Euphrates to the Ionian sea <lb/>
            and the Illyrians; and that of Cæsar from the Illyrians <lb/>
            over the country that reached to the Western Ocean, and <lb/>
            over the country from the ocean to the Tuscan and Sicilian <lb/>
            sea. Of Libya Cæsar had the part which extended oppo­ <lb/>
            site to Italy and Gaul and Iberia as far as the pillars of <lb/>
            Hercules; and Antonius had the part from Cyrene to <lb/>
            Ethiopia.</p>
          <p>LXII. Antonius was so mere an appendage to Cleopatra <lb/>
            that though he had a great superiority in land forces, he <lb/>
            wished the decision of the affair to depend on the navy, <lb/>
            to please Cleopatra : and this, though he saw that through <lb/>
            want of a crew, men were being seized by the trierarchs <lb/>
            out of Greece, which had indeed suffered much, travellers, <lb/>
            ass-drivers, reapers, youths, and that even by these means <lb/>
            the ships were not manned, but the greater part were de­ <lb/>
            ficient and were ill manoeuvred. Cæsar's navy consisted <lb/>
            of ships not built to a great height nor yet for the purpose <lb/>
            of making a show, but adapted for easy and quick move­ <lb/>
            ment and well manned; and he kept his fleet together in <lb/>
            Tarentum and Brundusium, and sent to Antonius to ask <lb/>
            him not to waste the time, but to come with his forces, and <lb/>
            that he would provide his armament with naval stations <lb/>
            free from all hindrance, and harbours, and that he would <lb/>
            retreat with his land forces a day's journey for a horseman <lb/>
            from the sea, until Antonius had safely landed and en­ <lb/>
            camped. Antonius replied in like strain to this bragging <lb/>
            language by challenging Cæsar to single combat, though <lb/>
            he was older than Cæsar ; and if Cæsar declined this, he pro. <lb/>
            posed that they should decide the matter with theii <lb/>
            armies at Pharsalus, as Caesar and Pompeius had done <lb/>
            before. While Antonius was taking his station near <lb/>
            Actium,* where Nicopolis is now built, Caesar contrived to <note type="footnote"> * Actium is a promontory on the southern side of the entrance of the <lb/>
            Ambraciot Gulf, now the gulf of Arta. It is probably the point of land <lb/>
            now called La Punta. The width of the entrance of the gulf is about <lb/>
            half a mile. Nicopolis,“ the city of Victory," was built by Cæsar on the <lb/>
            northern side of the gulf, a few miles from the site of Prevesa. The <lb/>
            battle of Actium was fought on the 2nd of September, B.C. 31. It is <lb/>
            more minutely described by Dion Cassius (1. 31, &amp;c.; lie 1). </note> <note type="footnote"> V 2 </note> <lb/>

            cross the Ionian sea and to get possession of a place in <lb/>
            Epirus, called Torune; and as the friends of Antonius <lb/>
            were uneasy, because their land force had not yet come <lb/>
            up, Cleopatra, jesting, said, What is the harm if Caesar is <lb/>
            sitting by a torune ? " *</p>
          <p>LXIII. At daybreak the advance of the enemy's fleet <lb/>
            alarmed Antonius, lest they should seize the ships which <lb/>
            were without crews, and accordingly he armed the rowers <lb/>
            and placed them on the decks to make a show, and raising <lb/>
            the ships' oars and making them ready for plying, he <lb/>
            kept his ships on each side in the channel near Actium, <lb/>
            prow to prow, as if they were fit to be put in motion and <lb/>
            prepared to fight. Cæsar, being frustrated by this man­ <lb/>
            œuvre, retired. Antonius also by some well contrived <lb/>
            works shut in the water and deprived his enemies of it; <lb/>
            and the surrounding spots had only little water, and that <lb/>
            was bad. He behaved with magnanimity to Domitius <lb/>
            also, and contrary to the judgment of Cleopatra. Domitius, <lb/>
            who was already suffering from fever, got into a small <lb/>
            boat and went over to Cæsar, on which Antonius, though <lb/>
            much annoyed, sent him all his baggage together with his <lb/>
            friends and slaves. Domitius indeed, as if he were repent­ <lb/>
            ing after the discovery of his faithlessness and treachery, <lb/>
            died immediately. There were also defections among the <lb/>
            kings, for Amyntas and Deiotarus went over to Cæsar. <lb/>
            Now as the navy was in all things unlucky and always <lb/>
            too late to give any help, Antonius was again compelled <lb/>
            to turn his thoughts to his land forces. Canidius also, <lb/>
            who commanded the land forces, changed his opinion at <lb/>
            the sight of the danger, and he advised Antonius to send <lb/>
            Cleopatra away, and to retreat to Thrace or Macedonia, <lb/>
            and then to decide the matter by a battle. For Dicomes, <lb/>
            the king of the Getæ, promised to help him with a large <lb/>
            force; and Canidius urged that there would be no dis­ <lb/>
            grace, if they should give up the sea to Cæsar, who had <lb/>
            been disciplined in the Sicilian war, but it would be a <lb/>
            strange thing if Antonius, who was excellently versed in <lb/>
            military operations, should not avail himself of his strength <lb/>
            and his resources of so many heavy-armed soldiers, and <note type="footnote"> * This word means something to stir up a pot with, a ladle or some­ <lb/>
            thing of the kind. The joke is as dull as it could be. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            should instead thereof distribute his troops among vessels <lb/>
            and fritter them away. Notwithstanding this the advice <lb/>
            of Cleopatra prevailed that the war should be decided by <lb/>
            a naval battle, though she was already contemplating <lb/>
            flight and making arrangements for her own position, not <lb/>
            with a view to contribute to the victory, but to have the <lb/>
            best place to retreat from if their cause should be ruined. <lb/>
            Now there were long lines which extended from the camp <lb/>
            to the naval station, and Antonius was accustomed to pass <lb/>
            without suspecting any danger; and as a slave of Cæsar <lb/>
            told him that it would be possible to seize Antonius as he <lb/>
            went down through the lines, Cæsar sent men to lie in <lb/>
            ambush for him. They came so near accomplishing their <lb/>
            purpose as this, that by rising up too soon they seized the <lb/>
            man who was advancing in front of Antonius; and <lb/>
            Antonius escaped with difficulty by running.</p>
          <p>LXIV. When it had been resolved to make a sea fight, <lb/>
            Antonius burned all the Egyptian ships except sixty; <lb/>
            but he manned the best and largest, from three to ten <lb/>
            banks of oars, with twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers <lb/>
            and two thousand bowmen. Hereupon it is said that one <lb/>
            of the centurions, who had already fought many battles <lb/>
            for Antonius and was covered with wounds, wept as <lb/>
            Antonius was passing by, and said; "Imperator, why do you <lb/>
            distrust these wounds or this sword and rest your hopes <lb/>
            in miserable logs of wood ? Let Egyptians and Phœnicians <lb/>
            fight on sea, but give us land, on which we are accustomed <lb/>
            to stand and to die or to vanquish our enemies." Without <lb/>
            making any reply, but merely by a motion of his hand <lb/>
            and the expression of his countenance encouraging the <lb/>
            man to be of good cheer, Antonius passed by, without <lb/>
            however having any good hopes himself, inasmuch as <lb/>
            when the masters of the vessels were desirous to leave the <lb/>
            sails behind, he ordered them to be put on board and taken <lb/>
            with them, observing that not a single fugitive of the <lb/>
            enemy should be allowed to escape.</p>
          <p>LXV.* Now on that day and the three following days <note type="footnote"> * Sintenis observes that Plutarch has here omitted to mention the <lb/>

            Sossius commanded the left of the line of Antonius. Insteius is a <lb/>
            Roman name, as appears from inscriptions. Taurus is T. Statilius Taurus. </note> <lb/>

            the sea was agitated by a strong wind which prevented <lb/>
            an engagement, but on the fifth, there being no wind and <lb/>
            the sea being quite calm, they came to an engagement. <lb/>
            Antonius and Publicola commanded the right wing, <lb/>
            and Coelius the left; and in the centre were Marcus <lb/>
            Octavius and Marcus Insteius. Cæsar placed Agrippa on <lb/>
            the left, and reserved the right wing for himself. Canidius <lb/>
            drew up the army of Antonius, and Taurus that of Caesar <lb/>
            on the shore, and remained without moving. As to the two <lb/>
            commanders-in-chief, Antonius visited all his vessels in a <lb/>
            row-boat and exhorted his soldiers to trust to the weight <lb/>
            of their ships and to fight as if they were on land, without <lb/>
            changing their position, and he urged the masters of the <lb/>
            ships to receive the shock of the enemy with their vessels <lb/>
            as if they were quietly at anchor, and to avoid the difficult <lb/>
            spots about the entrance of the bay: and Cæsar, it is said, <lb/>
            while it was still dark, left his tent, and as he was going <lb/>
            round to the ships, he met a man driving an ass, who <lb/>
            being asked his name and knowing Caesar, replied, “ My <lb/>
            name is Goodluck, and my ass's name is Victor." For <lb/>
            this reason when Cæsar afterwards ornamented the place <lb/>
            with the beaks of ships, he set up a bronze figure of an <lb/>
            ass and a man. After observing the arrangement of the <lb/>
            other part of his fleet, he went in a boat to the right wing <lb/>
            and was surprised to see the enemy resting quietly in the <lb/>
            straits; for the vessels had the appearance of being <lb/>
            moored at their anchors; and as he was for a long time <lb/>
            convinced of this, he kept his own ships at the distance of <lb/>
            eight stadia from the enemy. It was now the sixth hour, <lb/>
            and a wind beginning to rise from the sea, the soldiers of <lb/>
            Antonius were impatient at the delay, and, trusting to the <lb/>
            height and magnitude of their ships as making them un­ <lb/>
            assailable, they put the left wing in motion. Cæsar, do­ <lb/>
            lighted to see this, ordered his right wing to row back­ <lb/>
            wards with the design of drawing the enemy still further <lb/>
            out of the gulf and the straits, and by surrounding them <lb/>
            with his own light vessels to come to close quarters with <lb/>
            the enemy's ships, which, owing to their size and the <lb/>
            insufficiency of their crews, were cumbersome and slow.</p>
          <p>LXVI. Though the two fleets were beginning to come <lb/>
            together, they did not drive the ships against, nor strive <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            to crush one another, for the ships of Antonius, owing to <lb/>
            their weight, were unable to move forwards with any <lb/>
            force, which mainly gives effect to the blows of the beaks, <lb/>
            and those of Cæsar not only avoided meeting front to <lb/>
            front the strong and rough brass work of the enemy, but <lb/>
            did not even venture to strike against them on the flank. <lb/>
            For the beaks would easily have been broken off by coming <lb/>
            in contact with the hulls- of the enemy's vessels, which <lb/>
            were protected by large square pieces of timber fastened <lb/>
            to one another with iron. The battle therefore was like <lb/>
            a land fight, or, to speak more exactly, like the assailing of <lb/>
            a fortress; for three and four of Caesar's ships at the same <lb/>
            time were engaged about one of the ships of Antonius, and <lb/>
            the men fought with light shields and spears and poles <lb/>
            and fiery missiles ; the soldiers of Antonius assailed them <lb/>
            also with catapults from wooden towers. While Agrippa <lb/>
            was extending the left wing with a view to surround the <lb/>
            enemy, Publicola, being compelled to advance to meet him, <lb/>
            was separated from the centre, which fell into confusion, <lb/>
            and was also closely engaged with Arruntius. While the <lb/>
            sea fight was still undecided and equally favourable to <lb/>
            both sides, all at once the sixty ships of Cleopatra were <lb/>
            seen raising their sails for the purpose of making off, and <lb/>
            flying through the centre of the combatants; for they <lb/>
            were stationed behind the large vessels and they caused <lb/>
            confusion by making their way through them. The <lb/>
            enemy looked on with wonder, seeing them take advantage <lb/>
            of the wind and shape their course towards the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus. On this occasion Antonius clearly showed that he <lb/>
            was not governed by the considerations that befit either a <lb/>
            commander or a man, or even by his own judgment, but, <lb/>
            as some one observed in jest, that the soul of the lover <lb/>
            lives in another person's body, so was he dragged along <lb/>
            by the woman as if he had grown to her and moved to­ <lb/>
            gether with her. For no sooner did he see her ship sail­ <lb/>
            ing away, than, forgetting everything, and deserting and <lb/>
            skulking away from those who were fighting and dying <lb/>
            in his cause, he got into a five-oared galley with only <lb/>
            Alexas the Syrian and Skellius to attend him, and followed <note type="footnote"> * There is some confusion in the text here, but the general meaning <lb/>
            is probably what I have given. See the note of Sintenis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            after her who had already ruined him and was destined <lb/>
            to complete his ruin.</p>
          <p>LXVII. Cleopatra, having recognised the vessel of <lb/>
            Antonius, raised a signal; and Antonius accordingly, com­ <lb/>
            ing up to her and being taken into her ship, neither saw <lb/>
            Cleopatra nor was seen by her, but advancing close to the <lb/>
            prow he sat down by himself in silence holding his head <lb/>
            with both his hands. In the meantime there were seen <lb/>
            Liburnian ships. from Cæsar's fleet in pursuit; but Antonius, <lb/>
            by ordering his men to turn his vessel's head towards them, <lb/>
            kept them all in check, except the ship of Eurykles, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian, who proudly pressed on, brandishing a spear <lb/>
            on the deck, as if to hurl it at Antonius. Standing on the <lb/>
            prow of his vessel Antonius asked who it was that was <lb/>
            pursuing Antonius ? The reply was, “ I am Eurykles, the <lb/>
            son of Lachares, and by the help of Cæsar's fortune I am <lb/>
            avenging my father's death." Now Lachares had been <lb/>
            beheaded by Antonius in consequence of being involved in <lb/>
            a charge of robbery. However Eurykles did not fall upon <lb/>
            the ship of Antonius, but he dashed against the other of <lb/>
            the admiral-ships (for there were two) with the brazen <lb/>
            beak, and made it spin round, and as the ship fell off from <lb/>
            its course he took it, and also another ship which contained <lb/>
            costly vessels for table use. When this assailant had <lb/>
            retired, Antonius, again settling down in the same posture, <lb/>
            remained without moving, and, after spending three days <lb/>
            at the prow by himself, either because of his passion or that <lb/>
            he was ashamed to see Cleopatra, he put in at Tænarus.† <lb/>
            Here the women who were in attendance on Cleopatra <lb/>
            first of all brought them to speak to one another, and next <lb/>
            they persuaded them to sup and sleep together. And <lb/>
            already not a few of the transport ships and some of their <lb/>
            friends after the defeat began to collect around them; and <lb/>
            they brought intelligence of the destruction of the navy, but <note type="footnote"> * These were light vessels adapted for quick evolutions. Horace, <lb/>
            Epod. i., alludes to them :— <lb/>

            they supposed that the army still kept together. Antonius <lb/>
            sent messengers to Canidius with orders for him to retreat <lb/>
            quickly through Macedonia with his army into Asia; and <lb/>
            as it was his intention to cross over from Tænarus to Libya, <lb/>
            he selected one of the store-ships which conveyed much <lb/>
            money and many royal utensils in silver and in gold of <lb/>
            great value, and gave them to his friends, telling them to <lb/>
            divide the things among them and to look after their safety. <lb/>
            As they refused and wept, he comforted them with much <lb/>
            affection and kindness, and by his entreaties induced them <lb/>
            to depart; and he wrote to Theophilus, his steward in <lb/>
            Corinth, to provide for the safety of the men and to conceal <lb/>
            them until they should be able to make their peace with <lb/>
            Caesar. This Theophilus was the father of Hipparchus, <lb/>
            who had the greatest influence with Antonius, and was <lb/>
            the first of his freedmen who went over to Cæsar, and he <lb/>
            afterwards lived in Corinth.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. Such was the condition of affairs with Anto­ <lb/>
            nius. At Actium the naval force, after resisting Cæsar a <lb/>
            long time and being very greatly damaged by the heavy <lb/>
            sea that set against them ahead, hardly gave up the contest <lb/>
            at the tenth hour. The dead were said not to be more <lb/>
            than five thousand, but there were taken three hundred <lb/>
            ships, as Cæsar has recorded. There were not many who <lb/>
            knew that Antonius had fled, and those who heard of it <lb/>
            could not at first believe that he had gone and left them, <lb/>
            when he had nineteen legions of unvanquished soldiers and <lb/>
            twelve thousand horsemen; as if he had not often expe­ <lb/>
            rienced fortune both ways, and were not exercised in the <lb/>
            reverses of innumerable contests and wars. The soldiers <lb/>
            longed and expected to see him, hoping that he would soon <lb/>
            show himself from some quarter or other; and they dis­ <lb/>
            played so much fidelity and courage that, even when his <lb/>
            flight was well known, they kept together seven days and <lb/>
            paid no regard to Cæsar's messages to them. But at last, <lb/>
            when their general Canidius had stolen away by night and <lb/>
            left the camp, being now deserted of all and betrayed by <lb/>
            their commanders, they went over to the conqueror. Upon <lb/>
            this Caesar* sailed to Athens, and having come to terms with <lb/>
            the Greeks, he distributed the grain that remained over <note type="footnote"> * Dion Cassius (li. 2) gives an account of Cæsar's behaviour after the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            after the war among the cities, which were in a wretched <lb/>
            condition and stripped of money, slaves and beasts of <lb/>
            burden. Now my great-grandfather Nikarchus used to <lb/>
            relate that all the citizens * were compelled to carry down <lb/>
            on their shoulders a certain quantity of wheat to the sea <lb/>
            at Antikyra, and that their speed was quickened by the <lb/>
            whip; they had carried, he said, one supply in this manner, <lb/>
            and had just measured out another and were about to set <lb/>
            out, when news came that Antonius was defeated, and this <lb/>
            saved the city; for the agents and soldiers of Antonius <lb/>
            immediately fled, and they divided the corn among them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>LXIX. When Antonius had reached the coast of Libya, <lb/>
            and had sent Cleopatra forwards to Egypt from Paræto­ <lb/>
            nium,t he had his fill of solitude, wandering and rambling <lb/>
            about with two friends, one a Greek, Aristokrates, a rhetori­ <lb/>
            cian, and the other a Roman, Lucilius,‡ about whom I have <lb/>
            said elsewhere that at Philippi, in order that Brutus might <lb/>
            escape, he had surrendered to the pursuers, pretending that <lb/>
            he was Brutus, and his life being spared by Antonius on <lb/>
            that account, he remained faithful to him and firm to the <lb/>
            last critical times. When the general§ to whom he had <lb/>
            intrusted the troops in Libya had caused their defection, <lb/>
            Antonius made an effort to kill himself, but he was pre­ <lb/>
            vented by his friends and conveyed to Alexandria, where <lb/>
            he found Cleopatra contemplating a hazardous and great <lb/>
            undertaking. The isthmus which separates the Red Sea <note type="footnote"> battle. He exacted money from the cities; but Dion does not mention <lb/>
            any particular cities. </note><note type="footnote"> * By "all the citizens" Plutarch means the citizens of his native <lb/>
            town Chæronea. The people had to carry their burden a considerable <lb/>
            distance, for this Antikyra was on the Corinthian gulf, nearly south of <lb/>
            Delphi. This anecdote, which is supported by undoubted authority, is <lb/>
            a good example of the sufferings of the people during this contest for <lb/>
            power between two men. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was a town on the coast in the country called Marmarica. It <lb/>

            from the sea of Eygpt* and is considered to be the boundary <lb/>
            between Asia and Libya, in the part where it is most <lb/>
            contracted by the sea, and the width is least, is about three <lb/>
            hundred stadia across; and here Cleopatra undertook to raise <lb/>
            her ships out of the water and to drag them across the neck <lb/>
            of land, and so bringing her ships into the Arabian gulf <lb/>
            with much money and a large force, to settle beyond the <lb/>
            limits of Egypt and to escape from slavery and war. But <lb/>
            as the Arabs of Petrat burnt the first ships which were <lb/>
            drawn up, and Antonius thought that the army at Actium <lb/>
            still kept together, Cleopatra desisted from her design <lb/>
            and guarded the approaches to Eygpt. Antonius now <lb/>
            leaving the city and the company of his friends, built for <lb/>
            himself a dwelling in the sea, near the Pharos, ‡ by throwing <lb/>
            forward a mole into the water; and here he lived a fugitive <lb/>
            from men, and he said that he was content with Timon's <lb/>
            life and admired it, considering himself in like plight with <lb/>
            Timon; for he too had been wronged by his friends and <lb/>
            had experienced their ingratitude, and that therefore he <lb/>
            distrusted and disliked all men.</p>
          <p>LXX. Timon§ was an Athenian, who lived about the <lb/>
            time of the Peloponnesian war, as we may conclude from <lb/>
            the plays of Aristophanes and Plato; for he is brought <lb/>
            forward in them as peevish and misanthropical. Though <lb/>
            he avoided and rejected all intercourse with men, yet he <lb/>
            received in a friendly manner Alkibiades, who was a young <note type="footnote"> * Or a Sea that lies off Egypt,” that part of the Mediterranean <lb/>
            which borders on Egypt. The width of the Isthmus is much more <lb/>
            than 300 stadia: it is about seventy-two miles. Herodotus (ii. 158) <lb/>
            states the width more correctly at one thousand stadia. </note><note type="footnote"> In this passage Plutarch calls the Red Sea both the Arabian gulf <lb/>
            and the Erythra (Red), and in this he agrees with Herodotus. 1 he <lb/>

            Erythræan Sea or Indian Ocean. Herodotus (ii. 11) says that there is <lb/>
            a gulf which runs into the land from the Erythræan sea; and this <lb/>
            gulf he calls (ii. 11, 158) the Arabian gulf, which is now the Red Sea. <lb/>

            audacious fellow, and showed him great affection. And <lb/>
            when Apemantus wondered at this and asked the reason, <lb/>
            he said that he liked the young man because he knew that <lb/>
            he would be the cause of much ill to the Athenians. Ape­ <lb/>
            mantus was the only person whom he sometimes allowed <lb/>
            to approach him, because he was like himself and imitated <lb/>
            his mode of life. On one occasion, during the festival <lb/>
            called Choes,* when the two were feasting together, Ape­ <lb/>
            mantus said, “ How delightful the entertainment is, <lb/>
            Timon;” “ Yes, if you were not here," was the reply. It <lb/>
            is said that when the Athenians were in public assembly, <lb/>
            Timon ascended the bema and called for silence, which <lb/>
            raised great expectation on account of the unusual nature <lb/>
            of the circumstance: he then said, “I have a small plot <lb/>
            of building-ground, men of Athens, and there is a fig-tree <lb/>
            growing on it, on which many of the citizens have already <lb/>
            hanged themselves. Now as I intend to build on the <lb/>
            ground, I wished to give public notice that, if any of you <lb/>
            choose, they may hang themselves before the fig-tree is <lb/>
            cut down." After his death he was buried at Halae, near <lb/>
            the sea; but the shore in front of the place slipped down, <lb/>
            and the sea surrounding the tomb made it inaccessible and <lb/>
            unapproachable. The inscription on the tomb was: <lb/>
            Here from the load of life released I lie: <lb/>
            Ask not my name: but take my curse, and die. <lb/>
            And they say that he wrote this inscription during his <lb/>
            lifetime; but that which is commonly circulated as the <lb/>
            inscription is by Callimachus: <lb/>
            Timon misanthropist I am. Away! <lb/>
            Curse, an! thou wiil't, but only do not stay.</p>
          <p>LXXI. These are a few things out of many about Timon. <lb/>
            Canidius himself brought intelligence to Antonius of the <lb/>
            loss of his forces at Actium, and he heard that Herodes,† <note type="footnote"> * This was the second day of the third Dionysiac festival, called the <lb/>
            Anthesteria. The first day was Pithœgia (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πιθοιγία</foreign>) or the tapping of <lb/>
            the jars of wine; and the second day, as the word Choes seems to <lb/>
            import, was the cup day. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was Herodes I., son of Anti pater, sometimes called the <lb/>
            Great. He was not at the battle of Actium, but he sent aid to <lb/>
            Antonius (c. 61). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            the Jew, who had certain legions and cohorts, had gone <lb/>
            over to Cæsar, and that the rest of the princes in like <lb/>
            manner were revolting, and that none of his troops out of <lb/>
            Egypt still kept together. However; none of these things <lb/>
            disturbed him; but, as if he gladly laid aside hope as he <lb/>
            did care, he left that dwelling on the sea, which he called <lb/>
            Timoneium, and being taken by Cleopatra into the palace, <lb/>
            he turned the city to feasting and drinking and distribu­ <lb/>
            tion of money, registering the son of Cleopatra and Cæsar <lb/>
            among the young men, and putting on Antyllus, his son by <lb/>
            Fulvia,* the vest without the purple hem, which marked <lb/>
            the attainment of full age, on which occasion banquets <lb/>
            and revellings and feasts engaged Alexandria for many <lb/>
            days. They themselves put an end to that famed com­ <lb/>
            pany of the Inimitable Livers, and they formed another, not <lb/>
            at all inferior to that in refinement and luxury and expense, <lb/>
            which they called the company of those who would die <lb/>
            together. For the friends of Antonius registered them­ <lb/>
            selves as intending to die together, and they continued <lb/>
            enjoying themselves in a succession of banquets. Cleopatra <lb/>
            got together all kinds of deadly poisons, and she tried the <lb/>
            painless character of each by giving them to those who <lb/>
            were in prison under sentence of death. When she dis­ <lb/>
            covered that the quick poisons brought on a speedy death <lb/>
            with pain, and the less painful were not quick, she made <lb/>
            trial of animals,t which in her presence were set upon one <lb/>
            another. And she did this daily; and among nearly all <lb/>
            she found that the bite of the asp alone brought on without <lb/>
            spasms and groans a sleepy numbness and drowsiness, with <lb/>
            a gentle perspiration on the face, and dulling of the per­ <lb/>
            ceptive faculties, which were softly deprived of their <note type="footnote"> * This was the toga virilis, or dress which denoted that a male was <lb/>

            had a broad purple border, by which the impubes was at once distin­ <lb/>

            arouse them, as is the case with those who are in a deep <lb/>
            sleep.</p>
          <p>LXXII. At the same time they sent also ambassadors <lb/>
            to Caesar into Asia, Cleopatra requesting the dominion of <lb/>
            Egypt for her children, and Antonius asking to be allowed <lb/>
            to live as a private person at Athens, if he could not be <lb/>
            permitted to stay in Egypt. Through the want of friends <lb/>
            and their distrust owing to the desertions, Euphronius, the <lb/>
            instructor of the children, was sent on the embassy. For <lb/>
            Alexas,* of Laodiceia, who at Rome had become known to <lb/>
            Antonius through Timagenes, and possessed most influence <lb/>
            of all the Greeks, who also had been the most active of the <lb/>
            instruments of Cleopatra against Antonius, and had over­ <lb/>
            thrown all the reflections which rose in his mind about <lb/>
            Octavia, had been sent to King Herodes to keep him from <lb/>
            changing; and having stayed there and betrayed Antonius, <lb/>
            be had the impudence to go into the presence of Cæsar, <lb/>
            relying on Herodes. But Herodes helped him not, but <lb/>
            being forthwith confined and carried in chains to his own <lb/>
            country, he was put to death there by order of Cæsar. <lb/>
            Such was the penalty for his infidelity that Alexas paid to <lb/>
            Antonius in his lifetime.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. Caesar would not listen to what was said on <lb/>
            behalf of Antonius; but as to Cleopatra, he replied that <lb/>
            she should not fail to obtain anything that was reasonable <lb/>
            if she would kill Antonius or drive him away. He also <lb/>
            sent with the ambassadors of Antonius and Cleopatra one <lb/>
            Thyrsus,t a freedman of his, a man not devoid of judgment, <lb/>
            nor, as coming from a young general, one who would fail in <lb/>
            persuasive address to a haughty woman who was wonder­ <lb/>
            fully proud of her beauty. This man, having longer inter­ <note type="footnote"> * Conjectured by M. du Soul to be Alexander the Syrian, who has <lb/>
            been mentioned before. </note><note type="footnote"> t He was a native of Alexandria, and had been carried prisoner to <lb/>
            Rome by Gabinius. He obtained his freedom, and acquired celebrity <lb/>
            as a rhetorician and historian. He was a favourite of Asinius Pollio <lb/>
            and of Augustus; but he was too free-spoken for Augustus, who <lb/>
            finally forbade him his house (Horat. 1. Ep. 1, 19; and the note of <lb/>
            Orelli). Life of Pompeius, c. 49. </note><note type="footnote"> Dion Cassius (Ii. 8), who believed every scandalous story, say. <lb/>

            views with Cleopatra than the rest, and being specially <lb/>
            honoured, caused Antonius to have suspicions, and he <lb/>
            seized and whipped him; and he then sent him back to <lb/>
            Cæsar with a letter to the effect that Thyrsus, by giving <lb/>
            himself airs and by his insolent behaviour, had irritated <lb/>
            him, who was easily irritated by reason of his misfortunes. <lb/>
            " But you," he said, " if you do not like the thing, have <lb/>
            my freedman Hipparchus. Hang him up and whip him, <lb/>
            that we may be on equal terms.” Upon this Cleopatra, <lb/>
            with the view of doing away with his cause of complaint <lb/>
            and suspicions, paid more than usual court to Antonius: <lb/>
            she kept her own birthday in a mean manner and a way <lb/>
            suitable to her condition, but she celebrated the birthday <lb/>
            of Antonius with an excess of splendour and cost, so that <lb/>
            many of those who were invited to the feast came poor <lb/>
            and went away rich. Agrippa* in the meantime called <lb/>
            Cæsar back, frequently writing to him from Rome, and <lb/>
            urging that affairs there required his presence.</p>
          <p>LXXIV. Accordingly for the time the war was sus­ <lb/>
            pended ; but when the winter was over, Cæsar advanced <lb/>
            through Syria and his generals through Libya. Pelusium <lb/>
            was taken, and it was said that Seleukus gave it up, not <lb/>
            without the consent of Cleopatra. But Cleopatra sur­ <lb/>
            rendered to Antonius the wife and children of Seleukus to <lb/>
            be put to death; and as she had a tomb and a monument <lb/>
            constructed of unusual beauty and height, which she had <lb/>
            built close to the temple of Isis, she collected there the <lb/>
            most precious of the royal treasures, gold, silver, emeralds, <lb/>
            pearls, ebony, ivory, and cinnamon, and also a great <lb/>
            quantity of fire-wood and tow; so that Cæsar, being afraid <lb/>
            about the money, lest Cleopatra becoming desperate should <lb/>
            destroy and burn the wealth, kept continually forwarding <lb/>
            to her hopes of friendly treatment while he was advancing <lb/>
            with his army against the city. When Cæsar had taken <lb/>
            his position near the hippodrome, Antonius sallied forth <note type="footnote"> * After the battle of Actium, Cæsar crossed over to Samoa, where <lb/>
            he spent the winter. He was recalled by the news of a mutiny among <lb/>
            the soldiers, who had not received their promised reward. He returned <lb/>
            to Brundusium, where he stayed twenty-seven days, and he went no <lb/>
            further, for his appearance in Italy stopped the disturbance. He <lb/>
            returned to Asia and marched through Syria to Egypt (Sueton. Aug. <lb/>
            e. 17; Dion Cassius, li. 4). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            and fought gallantly, and he put Cæsar's cavalry to flight <lb/>
            and pursued them to the camp. Elated with his victory, <lb/>
            he entered the palace and embraced Cleopatra in his <lb/>
            armour, and presented to her one of the soldiers who had <lb/>
            fought most bravely. Cleopatra gave the soldier as a re­ <lb/>
            ward of his courage a golden breastplate and a helmet. <lb/>
            The man took them, and in the night deserted to Caesar.</p>
          <p>LXXV. Again, Antonius sent to Cæsar and challenged <lb/>
            him to single combat. Caesar replied that Antonius had <lb/>
            many ways of dying, on which Antonius, reflecting that <lb/>
            there was no better mode of death for him than in battle, <lb/>
            determined to try a land battle and a naval battle at the <lb/>
            same time. And at supper, it is said, he bade the slaves <lb/>
            to pour out and feast him cheerfully, for it was uncertain <lb/>
            whether they would do that on the morrow or would be <lb/>
            serving other masters, while he should lie a corpse and <lb/>
            should be a nothing. Seeing that his friends shed tears at <lb/>
            his words, he said that he would not lead them out to a <lb/>
            battle from which he would seek for himself a glorious <lb/>
            death rather than safety and victory. During this night, <lb/>
            it is said, about the middle thereof, while the city was <lb/>
            quiet and depressed through fear and expectation of the <lb/>
            future, all at once certain harmonious sounds from all <lb/>
            kinds of instruments were heard, and shouts of a crowd <lb/>
            with Evoes* and satyric leapings, as if some company of <lb/>
            revellers not without noise were going out of the city; <lb/>
            and the course of the procession seemed to be through the <lb/>
            middle of the city to the gate leading outwards in the <lb/>
            direction of the enemy, and at this point the tumult made <lb/>
            its way out, being loudest there. And those who reflected <lb/>
            on the sign were of opinion that the god to whom An­ <lb/>
            tonius all along most likened himself and most claimed <lb/>
            kinship with was deserting him.</p>
          <p>LXXVI.† At daybreak Antonius posted his troops on the <lb/>
            hillu in front of the city, and watched his ships, which were <note type="footnote"> * The shout of Bacchanals at the festivals. See the Ode of Horace <lb/>
            (Corm. ii. 19): <lb/>

            19). The treachery of Cleopatra is not improbable (Dion Cass. li. 10). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            put in motion and advancing against those of the enemy; <lb/>
            and as he expected to see something great done by them, <lb/>
            he remained quiet. But when the men of Antonius came <lb/>
            near, they saluted with their oars Cæsar's men, and as <lb/>
            they returned the salute, the men of Antonius changed <lb/>
            sides, and the fleet becoming one by the junction of all the <lb/>
            ships, sailed with the vessels' heads turned against the city. <lb/>
            As soon as Antonius saw this, he was deserted by the <lb/>
            cavalry, who changed sides, and being defeated with his <lb/>
            infantry he retired into the city, crying out that he was <lb/>
            betrayed by Cleopatra to those with whom he was warring <lb/>
            on her account. Cleopatra, fearing his anger and despair, <lb/>
            fled to the tomb and let down the folding doors which were <lb/>
            strengthened with bars and bolts; and she sent persons to <lb/>
            Antonius to inform him that she was dead. Antonius, <lb/>
            believing the intelligence, said to himself, “ Why dost thou <lb/>
            still delay, Antonius ? fortune has taken away the sole re­ <lb/>
            maining excuse for clinging to life." He then entered his <lb/>
            chamber, and loosing his body armour and taking it in <lb/>
            pieces, he said: " Cleopatra, I am not grieved at being de­ <lb/>
            prived of thee, for I shall soon come to the same place with <lb/>
            thee; but I am grieved that I, such an Imperator, am shown <lb/>
            to be inferior to a woman in courage." Now Antonius had <lb/>
            a faithful slave named Eros, whom he had long before ex­ <lb/>
            horted, if the necessity should arise, to kill him ; and he <lb/>
            now claimed the performance of the promise. Eros drew <lb/>
            his sword and held it out as if he were going to strike his <lb/>
            master, but he turned away his face and killed himself. <lb/>
            As Eros fell at his master's feet Antonius said, " Well done, <lb/>
            Eros, though you are not able to do this for me, you teach <lb/>
            me what I ought to do; " and piercing himself through the <lb/>
            belly he threw himself on the bed. But the wound was <lb/>
            not immediately mortal; and accordingly, as the flow of <lb/>
            blood ceased when he lay down, he came to himself and re­ <lb/>
            quested the bystanders to finish him. But they fled from <lb/>
            the chamber while he was calling out and writhing in <lb/>
            pain, till Diomedes the secretary came from Cleopatra <lb/>
            with orders to convey him to her to the tomb.</p>
          <p>LXXVII.* When he learned that she was alive, he <lb/>
            eagerly commanded his slaves to take him up, and he was <note type="footnote"> * Compare Dion Cassius, lie 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            carried in their arms to the doors of the chamber. Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra did not open the doors, but she appeared at a window, <lb/>
            from which she let down cords and ropes ; and when the <lb/>
            slaves below had fastened Antonius to them, she drew him <lb/>
            up with the aid of the two women whom alone she had <lb/>
            admitted into the tomb with her. Those who were present <lb/>
            say that there never was a more piteous sight; for stained <lb/>
            with blood and struggling with death he was hauled up, <lb/>
            stretching out his hands to her, while he was suspended in <lb/>
            the air. For the labour was not light for women, and <lb/>
            Cleopatra with difficulty, holding with her hands and <lb/>
            straining the muscles of her face, pulled up the rope, while <lb/>
            those who were below encouraged her and shared in her <lb/>
            agony. When she had thus got him in and laid him down, <lb/>
            she rent her garments over him, and beating her breasts <lb/>
            and scratching them with her hands, and wiping the blood <lb/>
            off him with her face, she called him master and husband <lb/>
            and Imperator; and she almost forgot her own misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes through pity for his. Antonius, stopping her <lb/>
            lamentations, asked for wine to drink, whether it was that <lb/>
            he was thirsty or that he expected to be released more <lb/>
            speedily. When he had drunk it, he advised her, if it <lb/>
            could be done with decency, to look after the preservation <lb/>
            of her own interests, and to trust to Procleius* most of the <lb/>
            companions of Cæsar; and not to lament him for his last re­ <lb/>
            verses, but to think him happy for the good things that he <lb/>
            had obtained, having become the most illustrious of men <lb/>
            and had the greatest power, and now not ignobly a Roman <lb/>
            by a Roman vanquished.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. Just as Antonius died, Procleius came from <lb/>
            Caesar ; t for after Antonius had wounded himself and was <lb/>
            carried to Cleopatra, Derketæus, one of his guards, taking <lb/>
            his dagger and concealing it, secretly made his way from <lb/>
            the palace, and running to Cæsar, was the first to report <lb/>
            the death of Antonius, and he showed the blood-stained <lb/>
            dagger. When Cæsar heard the news, he retired within <note type="footnote"> * His name was C. Proculeius. He appears to be the person to <lb/>

            his tent and wept for a man who had been related to him <lb/>
            by marriage, and his colleague in command, and his com­ <lb/>
            panion in many struggles and affairs. He then took the <lb/>
            letters that had passed between him and Antonius, and <lb/>
            calling his friends, read them, in order to show in what a <lb/>
            reasonable and fair tone he had written himself, and how <lb/>
            arrogant and insolent Antonius had always been in his <lb/>
            answers. Upon this he sent Procleius with orders, if pos­ <lb/>
            sible, above all things to secure Cleopatra alive; for he <lb/>
            was afraid about the money, and he thought it a great <lb/>
            thing for the glory of his triumph to lead her in the pro­ <lb/>
            cession. However Cleopatra would not put herself in the <lb/>
            hands of Procleius; but they talked together while he was <lb/>
            standing on the outside close to the building near a door <lb/>
            on a level with the ground, which was firmly secured, but <lb/>
            allowed a passage for the voice. In their conversation <lb/>
            Cleopatra entreated that her children might have the <lb/>
            kingdom, and Procleius bade her be of good cheer and trust <lb/>
            to Cæsar in all things.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. After Procleius had inspected the place and <lb/>
            reported to Cæsar, Gallus* was sent to have another inter­ <lb/>
            view with her; and having come to the door he purposely <lb/>
            prolonged the conversation. In the meantime Procleius <lb/>
            applied a ladder and got through the window by which <lb/>
            the women took in Antonius ; and he immediately went <lb/>
            down with two slaves to the door at which Cleopatra <lb/>
            stood with her attention directed to Gallus. One of the <lb/>
            women who were shut up with Cleopatra called out, <lb/>
            " Wretched Cleopatra, you are taken alive," on which she <lb/>
            turned round, and seeing Procleius, attempted to stab her­ <lb/>
            self, for she happened to have by her side a dagger such <lb/>
            as robbers wear: but Procleius, quickly running up to <lb/>
            her and holding her with both his hands, said, "You <lb/>
            wrong yourself, Cleopatra, and Cæsar too by attempting <lb/>
            to deprive him of the opportunity of a noble display of <lb/>
            magnanimity and to fix on the mildest of commanders the <note type="footnote"> * C. Cornelius Gallus, a Roman Eques, who had advanced from the <lb/>

            but he incurred the displeasure of Augustus, and put an end to life B.O. <lb/>

            stigma of faithlessness and implacability. At the same <lb/>
            time he took away her dagger and shook her dress to see <lb/>
            if she concealed any poison. There was also sent from <lb/>
            Cæsar one of his freedmen, Epaphroditus, whose orders <lb/>
            were to watch over her life with great care, but as to the <lb/>
            rest to give way in all things that would make her most <lb/>
            easy and be most agreeable to her.</p>
          <p>LXXX. Cæsar entered the city talking with Areius the <lb/>
            philosopher, and he had given Areius* his right hand, that <lb/>
            he might forthwith be conspicuous among the citizens and <lb/>
            be admired on account of the special respect that he re­ <lb/>
            ceived from Cæsar. Entering the gymnasium and ascend­ <lb/>
            ing a tribunal that was made for him, the people the while <lb/>
            being terror-struck and falling down before him, he bade <lb/>
            them get up, and he said that he acquitted the people of <lb/>
            all blame, first on account of the founder Alexander, second <lb/>
            because he admired the beauty and magnitude of the city, <lb/>
            and third, to please his friend Areius. Such honour Areius <lb/>
            obtained from Cæsar, and he got the pardon of many others; <lb/>
            and among them was Philostratus,t a man of all sophists <lb/>
            the most competent to speak on the sudden, but one who <lb/>
            claimed to be of the Academy without just grounds. <lb/>
            Wherefore Cæsar, who abominated his habits, would not <lb/>
            listen to his entreaties. But Philostratus, letting his white <lb/>
            beard grow and putting on a dark vest, followed behind <lb/>
            Areius, continually uttering this verse : <lb/>
            Wise save the wise, if wise indeed they be. <lb/>
            Cæsar hearing of this, pardoned Philostratus, wishing <lb/>
            rather to release Areius from odium than Philostratus from <lb/>
            fear.</p>
          <p>LXXXI. Of the children of Antonius, Antyllus,t the son <lb/>
            of Fulvia, was given up by his pædagogus Theodorus and <lb/>
            put to death; and when the soldiers had cut off his head, <note type="footnote"> * Said to have been a Stoic, and much admired by Augustus (Dion <lb/>

            the pædagogus took the most precious stone which he wore <lb/>
            about his neck and sewed it in his belt; and though he <lb/>
            denied the fact, he was convicted of it and crucified. The <lb/>
            children of Cleopatra were guarded together with those <lb/>
            who had charge of them, and they had a liberal treatment; <lb/>
            but as to Cæsarion, who was said to be Cleopatra's son by <lb/>
            Caesar, her mother sent him to India with much treasure <lb/>
            by way of Ethiopia; but another paedagogus like Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus, named Rhodon, persuaded him to return, saying that <lb/>
            Cæsar invited him to take the kingdom. While Cæsar was <lb/>
            deliberating about Cæsarion, it is said that Areius obser­ <lb/>
            ved: “ Tis no good thing, a multitude of Cæsars.”*</p>
          <p>LXXXII. Now Caesar put Cæsarion to death after the <lb/>
            death of Cleopatra. Though many asked for the body of <lb/>
            Antonius to bury it, both kings and commanders, Cæsar <lb/>
            did not take it from Cleopatra, but it was interred by her <lb/>
            own hands sumptuously and royally, and she received for <lb/>
            that purpose all that she wished. In consequence of so <lb/>
            much grief and pain, for her breasts were inflamed by the <lb/>
            blows that she had inflicted and were sore, and a fever <lb/>
            coming on, she gladly availed herself of this pretext for <lb/>
            abstaining from food and with the design of releasing <lb/>
            herself from life without hindrance. There was a physician <lb/>
            with whom she was familiar, Olympus, to whom she told <lb/>
            the truth, and she had him for her adviser and assistant in <lb/>
            accomplishing her death, as Olympus said in a history of <lb/>
            these transactions which he published. Cæsar suspecting <lb/>
            her design, plied her with threats and alarms about her <lb/>
            children, by which Cleopatra was thrown down as by <lb/>
            engines of war, and she gave up her body to be treated and <lb/>
            nourished as it was wished.</p>
          <p>LXXXIII. Cæsar himself came a few days after to see <lb/>
            her and pacify her.t Cleopatra happened to be lying on a <note type="footnote"> * The words are borrowed from Homer (Iliad, ii. 204):— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              mattress meanly dressed, and as he entered she sprang no <lb/>
              in a single vest and fell at his feet. with her head and face in <lb/>
              the greatest disorder, her voice trembling and her eyes <lb/>
              weakened by weeping. There were also visible many <lb/>
              marks of the blows indicted on her breast; and in fine her <lb/>
              body seemed in no respect to be in better plight than ber <lb/>
              mind. Yet that charm and that saucy confidence in her <lb/>
              beauty were not completely extinguished, but, though she <lb/>
              was in such a condition, shone forth from within and <lb/>
              showed themselves in the expression of her countenance. <lb/>
              When Caesar had bid her lie down and had seated himself <lb/>
              near her, she began to touch upon a kind of justification, <lb/>
              and endeavoured to turn all that had happened upon <lb/>
              necessity and fear of Antonius ; but as Cæsar on each <lb/>
              point met her with an answer, being confuted, she all at <lb/>
              once changed her manner to move him by pity and by <lb/>
              prayers, as a person would do who clung most closely to <lb/>
              life. Finally she handed to him a list of all the treasures <lb/>
              that she had; and when Seleukus, one of her stewards, <lb/>
              declared that she was hiding and secreting some things, <lb/>
              she sprang up and laying hold of his hair, belaboured him <lb/>
              with many blows on the face. As Caesar smiled and stopped <lb/>
              her, she said, “ But is it not scandalous, Cæsar, that you <lb/>
              have condescended to come to me and speak to me in my <lb/>
              wretched condition, and my slaves make it a matter of <lb/>
              charge against me if I have reserved some female orna­ <lb/>
              ments, not for myself forsooth, wretch that I am, but that <lb/>
              I may give a few things to Octavia and your wife Livia, <lb/>
              and so through their means make you more favourable to <lb/>
              me and more mild." Cæsar was pleased with these words, <lb/>
              being fully assured that she wished to live. Accordingly, <lb/>
              after saying that he left these matters to her care and <lb/>
              that in everything else he would behave to her better than <lb/>
              she expected, he went away, thinking that he had deceived <lb/>
              her; but he had deceived himself.</p>
          <p>LXXXIV. Now there was Cornelius Dolabella,* a <note type="footnote"> spurious history. The account of Plutarch is much simpler and more <lb/>
            natural than that of Dion Cassius (Ii. 12), which savours of the <lb/>
            rhetorical. </note><note type="footnote"> * He was the son of P. Cornelius Dolabella, once the son-in-law of <lb/>

            youth of rank, and one of the companions of Cæsar. He <lb/>
            was not without a certain liking towards Cleopatra; and <lb/>
            now, in order to gratify her request, he secretly sent and <lb/>
            informed her that Cæsar himself was going to march with <lb/>
            his troops through Syria, and that he had determined to <lb/>
            send off her with her children on the third day. On hear­ <lb/>
            ing this, Cleopatra first entreated Cæsar to permit her to <lb/>
            pour libations on the tomb of Antonius; and when Cæsar <lb/>
            permitted it, she went to the tomb, and embracing the coffin <lb/>
            in company with the women who were usually about her, <lb/>
            said, “ Dear Antonius, I buried thee recently with hands <lb/>
            still free, but now I pour out libations as a captive and so <lb/>
            watched that I cannot either with blows or sorrow dis­ <lb/>
            figure this body of mine now made a slave and preserved <lb/>
            to form a part in the triumph over thee. But expect not <lb/>
            other honours or libatio is, for these are the last which <lb/>
            Cleopatra brings. Living, nothing kept us asunder, but <lb/>
            there is a risk of our changing places in death: thou a <lb/>
            Roman, lying buried here, and I, wretched woman, in Italy, <lb/>
            getting only as much of thy country as will make me a <lb/>
            grave. But if indeed there is any help and power in the <lb/>
            gods there (for the gods of this country have deserted us), <lb/>
            do not deliver thy wife up alive, and let not thyself be <lb/>
            triumphed over in me, but hide me here with thee and bury <lb/>
            thee with me; for though I have ten thousand ills, not one <lb/>
            of them is so great and grievous as this short time which <lb/>
            I have lived apart from thee !"</p>
          <p>LXXXV. After making this lamentation and crowning <lb/>
            and embracing the coffin, she ordered a bath to be pre­ <lb/>
            pared for her. After bathing, she lay down and enjoyed <lb/>
            a splendid banquet. And there came one from the country <lb/>
            bringing a basket; and on the guards asking what he <lb/>
            brought, the man opened it, and taking off the leaves <lb/>
            showed the vessel full of figs. The soldiers admiring <lb/>
            their beauty and size, the man smiled and told them to <lb/>
            take some, whereon, without having any suspicion, they <lb/>
            bade him carry them in. After feasting, Cleopatra took <note type="footnote"> The word “ companions *' represents the Roman " comites," which has <lb/>
            a technical meaning. Young men of rank, who were about the person <lb/>
            of a commander, and formed a kind of staff, were his Comites. See <lb/>

            a tablet, which was already written, and sent it sealed to <lb/>
            Cæsar, and, causing all the rest of her attendants to with­ <lb/>
            draw except those two women, she closed the door. As <lb/>
            soon as Caesar* opened the tablet and found in it the prayers <lb/>
            and lamentations of Cleopatra, who begged him to bury her <lb/>
            with Antonius, he saw what had taken place. At first he <lb/>
            was for setting out himself to give help, but the next thing <lb/>
            that he did was to send persons with all speed to inquire. <lb/>
            But the tragedy had been speedy; for, though they ran <lb/>
            thither and found the guards quite ignorant of everything, <lb/>
            as soon as they opened the door they saw Cleopatra lying <lb/>
            dead on a golden couch in royal attire. Of her two women, <lb/>
            Eiras was dying at her feet, and Charmion, already stagger­ <lb/>
            ing and drooping her head, was arranging the diadem on <lb/>
            the forehead of Cleopatra. One of them saying in passion, <lb/>
            " A good deed this, Charmion ; " " Yes, most goodly," she <lb/>
            replied, " and befitting the descendant of so many kings." <lb/>
            She spake not another word, but fell there by the side of <lb/>
            the couch.</p>
          <p>LXXXVI. Now it is said that the asp was brought with <note type="footnote"> * The story of Dion (Ii. 14) is that Cæsar, after he had seen the body, <lb/>
            sent for the Psylli, serpent charmers, to suck out the poison (compure <lb/>
            Lucan, Pharsal. ix. 925). If a person was not dead, it was supposed <lb/>
            that the Psylli could extract the poison and save the life. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dion Cassius also states that the true cause of Cleopatra's death was <lb/>
            unknown. One account was that she punctured her arm with a hair-pin <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βελόνη</foreign>) which was poisoned. But even as to the punctures on the arm, <lb/>
            Plutarch does not seem to state positively that there were any. The <lb/>
            " hollow comb” is hardly intelligible. Plutarch's word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κνηστις</foreign>, "a <lb/>
            so aping instrument of any kind." One MS. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιστίς</foreign>, " a small <lb/>
            coffer.” Strabo (p. 7U5, ed. Casaub.) doubts whether she perished by <lb/>
            the bite of a serpent or by puncturing herself with a poisoned instru­ <lb/>
            ment. Propertius (iii. 11, 53) alluded to the imuge of Cleopatra, which <lb/>
            was carried in the triumph- <lb/>
            Brachia spectavi sacris admorsa colubris <lb/>
            Et trahere occultum membra soporis iter. <lb/>
            An ancient marble at Rome represents Cleopatra with the asp on her <lb/>
            arm. There was also a story of her applying it to the left breast. </note><note type="footnote"> Cleopatra was born in B.C. 69, and died in the latter part of B.o. 30. <lb/>
            She was seventeen years of age when her father Ptolemæus Auletes <lb/>
            died: and upon his death she governed jointly with her brother <lb/>
            Ptolemæus, whose wife she was to be. Antonius first saw her when he <lb/>
            was in Egypt with Gabinius, and he had not forgotten the impression </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            those figs and leaves, and was covered with them ; for that <lb/>
            Cleopatra had so ordered, that the reptile might fasten on <lb/>
            her body without her being aware of it. But when she <lb/>
            had taken up some of the figs and saw it, she said, “ Here <lb/>
            then it is," and baring her arm, she offered it to the ser­ <lb/>
            pent to bite. Others say that the asp was kept in a water­ <lb/>
            pitcher, and that Cleopatra drew it out with a golden dis­ <lb/>
            taff and irritated it till the reptile sprang upon her arm <lb/>
            and clung to it. But the real truth nobody knows; for it <lb/>
            was also said that she carried poison about her in a hollow <lb/>
            comb, which she concealed in her hair; however, no spots <lb/>
            broke out on her body, nor any other sign of poison. Nor <lb/>
            yet was the reptile seen within the palace; but some said <lb/>
            that they observed certain marks of its trail near the sea, <lb/>
            in that part towards which the chamber looked and the <lb/>
            windows were. Some also say that the arm of Cleopatra <lb/>
            was observed to have two small indistinct punctures; and <lb/>
            it seems that Caesar believed this, for in the triumph a <lb/>
            figure of Cleopatra was carried with the asp clinging to <lb/>
            her. Such is the way in which these events are told. <lb/>
            Though Cæsar was vexed at the death of Cleopatra, he <lb/>
            admired her nobleness of mind, and he ordered the body <lb/>
            to be interred with that of Antonius in splendid and royal <lb/>
            style. The women of Cleopatra also received honourable <lb/>
            interment by his orders. Cleopatra at the time of her <lb/>
            death was forty years of age save one, and she had reigned <lb/>
            as queen two-and-twenty years, and governed together <lb/>
            with Antonius more than fourteen. Antonius, according <lb/>
            to some, was six years, according to others, three years <lb/>
            above fifty. Now the statues of Antonius were thrown <lb/>
            down, but those of Cleopatra remained standing, for <lb/>
            Archibius, one of her friends, gave Caesar two thousand <lb/>
            talents that they might not share the same fate as those <lb/>
            of Antonius.</p>
          <p>LXXXVII. Antonius by his three wives left seven <lb/>
            children, of whom Antyllus, the eldest, was the only one <note type="footnote"> which the young girl then made on him at the time when she visited <lb/>
            him at Tarsus (Appian, Civil Wars, v. 8). Antonius was forty <lb/>
            years old when he saw Cleopatra at Tarsus, B.C. 41, and he woull <lb/>
            therefore be iu his fifty-second year at the time of his death (Clinton, <lb/>
            Fasti). </note> <lb/>

            who was put to death by Cæsar; the rest Octavia* took <lb/>
            and brought them up with her own children. Cleopatra, <lb/>
            the daughter of Cleopatra, she married to Juba, the most <lb/>
            accomplished of kings; and Antonius, the son of Fulvia, <lb/>
            she raised so high that, while Agrippa held the first place <lb/>
            in Cæsar's estimation, and the sons of Livia the second, <lb/>
            Antonius had and was considered to have the third. Oc­ <lb/>
            tavia had by Marcellus two daughters, and one son, <lb/>
            Marcellus, whom Cæsar made both his son and son-in-law, <lb/>
            and he gave one of the daughters to Agrippa. But as <lb/>
            Marcellus died very soon after his marriage, and it was <lb/>
            not easy for Caesar to choose from the rest of his friends a <lb/>
            son-in-law whom he could trust, Octavia proposed to hint <lb/>
            that Agrippa should take Cæsar's daughter and put away <lb/>
            her daughter. Cæsar was first persuaded and then Agrippa. <lb/>
            whereupon Octave took her own daughter back and <lb/>
            married her to Antonius; and Agrippa married Cæsar's <lb/>
            daughter. There were two daughters of Antonius and <lb/>
            Octavia, of whom Domitius Ænobarbus took one to wife; <lb/>
            and the other, who was famed for her virtues and her <lb/>
            beauty, Antonia, was married to Drusus, the son of Livia, <lb/>
            and step-son of Cæsar. From the marriage of Drusus and <lb/>
            Antonia came Germanicus and Claudius, of whom Claudius <lb/>
            afterwards ruled; and of the children of Germanicus, Caius, <lb/>
            who ruled with distinction for no long time, was destroyed <lb/>
            together with his child and wife; and Agrippina, who had <lb/>
            by Ænobarbus a son, Lucius Domitius, married Claudius <lb/>
            Cæsar; and Claudius adopting her son, named him Nero <lb/>
            Germanicus. Nero, who ruled in my time, slew his <lb/>
            mother, and through his violence and madness came very <lb/>
            near subverting the supremacy of Rome, being the fifth <lb/>
            from Antonius in the order of succession. <note type="footnote"> Octavia's care of the children of Antonius is one of the beauti­ <lb/>
            ful traits of her character. She is one of those Roman women whose <lb/>
            virtues command admiration. </note><note type="footnote"> Cleopatra, the daughter of Antonius and twin sister of Alexander, <lb/>
            married Juba IL, king of Numidia, by whom she hud a son Ptolemæus, <lb/>

            Antonius Felix, the governor of Judæa. The two brothers of <lb/>

            Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who married Agrippina, the daughter of <lb/>
            Cæsar Germanicus. Agrippina's son, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was <lb/>
            adopted by the emperor Claudius after his marriage with Agrippina, <lb/>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF DEMETRIUS AND ANTONIUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. Since, then, great changes of fortune took place in each <lb/>
            of their lives, let us first consider their power and renown. <lb/>
            The position of Demetrius was inherited and already made <lb/>
            for him, as Antigonus was the most powerful of the <lb/>
            successors of Alexander, and, before Demetrius came of <lb/>
            age, had overrun and conquered the greater part of Asia: <lb/>
            while Antonius, whose father, though an excellent man, <lb/>
            was no soldier, and left him no renown, yet dared to seize <lb/>
            upon the empire of Caesar, with which he was in no way <lb/>
            connected, and constituted himself the heir of what Cæsar <lb/>
            had won by the sword. Starting as a mere private perso n, <lb/>
            he raised himself to such a height of power as to be able <lb/>
            to divide the world into two, and to select and obtain the <lb/>
            fairer half for his own, while, without his being even <lb/>
            present, his lieutenants and agents inflicted several defeats <lb/>
            upon the Parthians, and conquered all the nations of Asia <lb/>
            as far as the Caspian Sea. Even that for which he is <lb/>
            especially reproached proves the greatness of his power. <lb/>
            Demetrius's father was well pleased at getting Phila, the <lb/>
            daughter of Antipater, as a wife for his son, in spite of the <lb/>
            disparity of their ages, because he regarded her as his <lb/>
            son's superior; while it was thought to be a disgrace for <lb/>
            Antonius to ally himself with Cleopatra, a woman who <lb/>
            excelled in power and renown all the Kings of her age, <lb/>
            except Arsakes himself. Antonius had made himself so <lb/>
            great that men thought him entitled to more even than <lb/>
            he himself desired.</p>
          <p>II. Demetrius, however, cannot be blamed for attempt­ <lb/>
            ing to make himself king over a people accustomed to <lb/>
            servitude, while it appeared harsh and tyrannical for <lb/>
            Antonius to try to enslave the people of Rome just after <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            they had been set free from the rule of Cæsar: and the <lb/>
            greatest of his exploits, the war against Brutus and Cassius, <lb/>
            was waged with the intention of depriving his countrymen <lb/>
            of their liberty. Demetrius, before he became involved in <lb/>
            difficulties, used always to act as a liberator towards Greece, <lb/>
            and to drive out the foreign garrisons from her cities, and <lb/>
            did not act like Antonius, who boasted that he had slain <lb/>
            the would-be liberators of Rome in Macedonia. And <lb/>
            though Antonius is especially commended for his magni­ <lb/>
            ficent generosity, yet Demetrius so far surpassed him as <lb/>
            to bestow more upon his enemies than Antonius would <lb/>
            upon his friends. It is true that Antonius gained great <lb/>
            credit for having caused Brutus to be honourably buried; <lb/>
            but Demetrius buried all his enemy's slain, gave money <lb/>
            and presents to his prisoners, and sent them back to <lb/>
            Ptolemy.</p>
          <p>III. Both were arrogant when in prosperity, and set no <lb/>
            bounds to their luxury and pleasures. Yet it cannot be <lb/>
            said that Demetrius was ever so immersed in enjoyments <lb/>
            as to let slip the time for action, but he only dedicated <lb/>
            the superfluity of his leisure to enjoyment, and used his <lb/>
            Lamia, like the mythical nightmare, only when he was <lb/>
            half asleep or at play. When he was preparing for war, <lb/>
            no ivy wreathed his spear, no perfume scented his helmet, <lb/>
            nor did he go forth from his bed-chamber to battle covered <lb/>
            with finery, but, as Euripides says, he laid the Bacchic <lb/>
            wand aside, and served the unhallowed god of war, and, <lb/>
            indeed, never suffered any reverse through his own care­ <lb/>
            lessness or love of pleasure. But just as in pictures we <lb/>
            often see Omphale stealing the club and stripping off the <lb/>
            lion's skin from Herakles, so Cleopatra frequently would <lb/>
            disarm Antonius and turn his mind to pleasure, persuading <lb/>
            him to give up mighty enterprises and even necessary <lb/>
            campaigns to wander and sport with her on the shores of <lb/>
            Canopus and beside the tomb of Osiris. At last, like Paris, <lb/>
            he fled from battle to nestle on her breast, though Paris <lb/>
            only took refuge in his chamber after he had been de­ <lb/>
            feated in battle, while Antonius, by his pursuit of Cleopatra, <lb/>
            gave up his chance of victory.</p>
          <p>IV. Moreover, in marrying several wives, Demetriua <lb/>
            did not break through any custom, for he only did what <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            had been usual for the kings of Macedonia since the days <lb/>
            of Philip and Alexander, and what was done by <lb/>
            Lysimachus and Ptolemy in his own time ; and he showed <lb/>
            due respect to all his wives; while Antonius, in the first <lb/>
            place, married two wives at the same time, which no <lb/>
            Roman had ever dared to do before, and then drove away <lb/>
            his own countrywoman and his legitimate wife to please <lb/>
            a foreigner, and one to whom he was not legally <lb/>
            married. Yet with all his excesses Antonius was never <lb/>
            led by his vices into such sacrilegious impiety as is re­ <lb/>
            corded of Demetrius. We are told that no dogs are allowed <lb/>
            to enter the Acropolis,* because these animals copulate more <lb/>
            openly than any others; but Demetrius consorted with <lb/>
            harlots in the very temple of the virgin goddess, and <lb/>
            debauched many of the Athenian citizens, while, although <lb/>
            one would have imagined that a man of such a temperament <lb/>
            would be especially averse to cruelty, Demetrius must be <lb/>
            charged with this in allowing, or rather compelling, the <lb/>
            most beautiful and modest of the Athenians to suffer death <lb/>
            in order to avoid outrage. To sum up, the vices of Anto­ <lb/>
            nius were ruinous to himself, while those of Demetrius <lb/>
            were ruinous to others.</p>
          <p>V. Yet Demetrius always behaved well to his parents, <lb/>
            whereas Antonius allowed his mother's brother to perish <lb/>
            in order that he might compass the death of Cicero, which <lb/>
            was of itself so odious a crime that we should scarcely <lb/>
            think Antonius justified if by Cicero's death he had rAved <lb/>
            his uncle's life. With regard to the perjuries and breaking <lb/>
            of their words which they both committed, the one in <lb/>
            seizing Artabazus, and the other in murdering Alexander, <lb/>
            Antonius has a satisfactory defence; for he himself was <lb/>
            first deserted and betrayed by Artabazus in Media: while <lb/>
            many writers say that Demetrius himself invented false <lb/>
            pretexts for his treatment of Alexander, and accused a <lb/>
            man whom he had wronged with a design on his life, <lb/>
            instead of defending himself against one who was already <lb/>
            his enemy. Again, the exploits of Demetrius were all <lb/>
            accomplished by himself in person; while, on the other <lb/>
            hand, Antonius won some of his most important battles by <lb/>
            his lieutenants, without himself being present <note type="footnote"> * Of Athens, </note> <pb n="351"/>
             </p>
          <p>VI. The ruin of both was due to themselves, though in <lb/>
            a different manner, for the Macedonians deserted from <lb/>
            Demetrius, while Antonious deserted his own troops when <lb/>
            they were risking their lives in his defence ; so that we must <lb/>
            blame the former for having rendered his army so hostile <lb/>
            to him, and the latter for betraying so much loyalty and <lb/>
            devotion. In their manner of death neither can be praised, <lb/>
            but that of Demetrius seems the less creditable of the two, <lb/>
            for he endured to be taken prisoner, and when in confine­ <lb/>
            ment willingly spent three years in drinking and gluttony, <lb/>
            like a wild beast that has been tamed; while Antonius, <lb/>
            though he killed himself like a coward, and in a piteous <lb/>
            and dishonourable fashion, nevertheless died before ho fell <lb/>
            into the hands of his enemy.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF DION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. We are told by the poet Simonides, Sossius Senecio, thai <lb/>
            the Trojans bore no malice against the Corinthians for <lb/>
            joining the rest of the Greeks in the siege of Troy, because <lb/>
            Glaukus, who was himself of Corinthian extraction, fought <lb/>
            heartily on their side. In the same manner we may <lb/>
            expect that neither Greeks nor Romans will be able to <lb/>
            blame the doctrines of the academy, as each nation derives <lb/>
            equal credit from their practice in this book of mine, which <lb/>
            contains the lives of Brutus and Dion, of whom the latter <lb/>
            was Plato's intimate friend, while the former was educated <lb/>
            by his writings: so that they were both, as it were, sent <lb/>
            forth from the same school to contend for the greatest prizes. <lb/>
            It is not surprising, therefore, that there should be a great <lb/>
            similarity between their respective achievements, or that <lb/>
            they should have proved the truth of that maxim of their <lb/>
            teacher, that nothing great or noble can be effected in <lb/>
            politics except when a wise and just man is possessed <lb/>
            of absolute power combined with good fortune. Just as <lb/>
            Hippomachus the gymnastic trainer used to declare that <lb/>
            he could always tell by their carriage those who had been <lb/>
            his pupils, even though he only saw them from a distance <lb/>
            when they were carrying meat home for their dinner, so <lb/>
            we may imagine that philosophy accompanies those who <lb/>
            have been brought up in its precepts in every action of <lb/>
            their lives, adding a happy grace and fitness to all that <lb/>
            they do.</p>
          <p>II. Their lives resemble one another even more in their <lb/>
            misfortunes than in the objects at which they aimed. Both <lb/>
            of them perished by an untimely fate, unable, with all <lb/>
            their mighty efforts, to accomplish the object which they <lb/>
            had in view. The most remarkable point of all is that <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            they both received a supernatural warning of their death by <lb/>
            the appearance to them of an evil spirit in a dream. Yet <lb/>
            it is a common argument with those who deny the truth <lb/>
            of such matters that no man of sense ever could see a <lb/>
            ghost or spirit but that it is only children and women <lb/>
            and men who are wandering in their mind through sick­ <lb/>
            ness, who through disorder of the brain or distemperatnre <lb/>
            of the body are subject to these vain and ominous fancies, <lb/>
            which really arise from the evil spirit of superstition <lb/>
            within themselves. If, however, Dion and Brutus, both <lb/>
            of whom were serious and philosophic men, not at all liable <lb/>
            to be mistaken or easy to be deceived about such matters, <lb/>
            did really experience a supernatural visitation so distinctly <lb/>
            that they told other persons about it, I do not know <lb/>
            whether we may not be obliged to adopt that strangest of <lb/>
            all the theories of the ancients that evil and malignant <lb/>
            spirits feel a spite against good men, and try to oppose <lb/>
            their actions, throwing confusion and terror in their way <lb/>
            in order to shake them in their allegiance to virtue; <lb/>
            because they fear lest if they passed their lives entirely <lb/>
            pure and without spot of sin, they might after death <lb/>
            obtain a higher place than themselves. This, however, I <lb/>
            must reserve for discussion in another place; and now, in <lb/>
            this my twelfth book of parallel lives, I will first proceed <lb/>
            to deal with the elder man of the two.</p>
          <p>III. Dionysius the elder, as soon as he had raised <lb/>
            himself to the throne, married the daughter of Hermo­ <lb/>
            krates of Syracuse. However, as his power was not yet <lb/>
            firmly established, the people of Syracuse rose in revolt, <lb/>
            and committed such shocking outrages upon the person of <lb/>
            Dionysius's wife, that she voluntarily put herself to death. <lb/>
            Dionysius, after recovering and confirming his power, now <lb/>
            married two wives at the same time, one of whom was a <lb/>
            Lokrian, named Doris, and the other a native of Syracuse, <lb/>
            named Aristomache, the daughter of Hipparinus, one of <lb/>
            the first men in Syracuse, who had acted as colleague <lb/>
            with Dionysius himself when he was appointed to the <lb/>
            command of the army with unlimited powers. It is said <lb/>
            that he married them both upon the same day, and that <lb/>
            no man knew which he visited first; and of the remainder <lb/>
            of his life he spent an equal share of his time with each. <note type="footnote">VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            as he always supped in company with both of them, and <lb/>
            spent the night with each in turn. The populace of <lb/>
            Syracuse would fain have hoped that their countrywoman <lb/>
            would be preferred to the stranger; but it was the <lb/>
            stranger who first bore a son and heir to Dionysius, to <lb/>
            counterbalance her foreign parentage; while Aristomache <lb/>
            remained childless for a long time, although Dionysius <lb/>
            was anxious to have a family by her, and even put to <lb/>
            death the mother of his Lokrian wife on a charge of <lb/>
            having bewitched her.</p>
          <p>IV. Dion was the brother of Aristomache, and at first <lb/>
            was treated with respect for the sake of his sister, but <lb/>
            afterwards, when he had given proofs of his ability, he <lb/>
            gained the favour of the despot by his own good qualities. <lb/>
            Besides many other privileges, Dionysius ordered his <lb/>
            treasurers to give Dion anything that he might ask for, <lb/>
            letting him know on the same day what they had given <lb/>
            him. He was naturally of a high minded and manly <lb/>
            disposition, and he was greatly encouraged in the path of <lb/>
            virtue by the providential accident of Plato's visit to <lb/>
            Sicily. This never could have been calculated upon <lb/>
            according to human ideas of probability; but it seems as <lb/>
            though some divinity, who had long been meditating how <lb/>
            to put liberty within the reach of the Syracusans and to <lb/>
            free them from despotism, must have brought Plato from <lb/>
            Italy to Syracuse, and caused Dion to become his disciple. <lb/>
            Dion at this time was very young, but was by far the most <lb/>
            apt of Plato's scholars, and the readiest to follow out his <lb/>
            master's instructions in virtue. This we learn from <lb/>
            Plato's own account of him, and from the circumstances <lb/>
            of the case. Brought up as Dion had been in the humble <lb/>
            position of a subject under a despotic ruler, his life had <lb/>
            been full of sudden alarms and violent alternations of <lb/>
            fortune; yet, though he was at this time accustomed to <lb/>
            live in a state of parvenu splendour, and to regard <lb/>
            pleasure and power as the only objects of desire, he, as <lb/>
            soon as he had become acquainted with philosophic reason­ <lb/>
            ing and exhortation to virtue, became passionately inter­ <lb/>
            ested in it. With the guileless innocence of youth he <lb/>
            imagined that the discourses which he had heard would <lb/>
            produce an equally deep impression upon the mind of <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            Dionysius, and took considerable pains to bring Dionysius <lb/>
            to meet Plato and listen to his arguments.</p>
          <p>V. When the meeting took place, Plato chose for his <lb/>
            subject human virtue, and discussed more particularly the <lb/>
            virtue of manly courage, proving that despots are the <lb/>
            most cowardly of men. From this he went on to speak <lb/>
            of justice, and as he pointed out that the life of the just <lb/>
            is happy, and that of the unjust miserable, Dionysius, <lb/>
            who considered the lecture as a reproach to himself, <lb/>
            was much exasperated, especially when he observed <lb/>
            how all the audience admired Plato and were en­ <lb/>
            chanted by his rhetoric. At last in a rage he asked him <lb/>
            why he had come to Sicily: and when Plato answered that <lb/>
            he had come in order to find a good man, Dionysius caught <lb/>
            up his words, and said, “ You seem hitherto not to have <lb/>
            found one."</p>
          <p>Dion and his friends imagined that this outburst marked <lb/>
            the end of Dionysius's indignation; and as Plato was now <lb/>
            anxious to leave Sicily they obtained a passage for him on <lb/>
            board of a trireme which was about to convey home Pollis, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian envoy. Dionysius however secretly <lb/>
            besought Pollis to put Plato to death during the voyage, or <lb/>
            at any rate to sell him for a slave, because, he said, Plato, <lb/>
            according to his own showing, would be none the worse <lb/>
            off for being a slave, but would be just as happy, provided <lb/>
            that he was just. In consequence of this we are told that <lb/>
            Pollis took Plato to Ægina and there sold him, because <lb/>
            the people of Ægina were at that time at war with the <lb/>
            Athenians, and had passed a decree that any Athenian <lb/>
            found in Ægina should be sold for a slave.- Yet Dion <lb/>
            was no less honoured and trusted by Dionysius in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of this, but was entrusted with the management <lb/>
            of the most important negotiations, and was himself sent <lb/>
            as ambassador to Carthage, in which capacity he gained <lb/>
            great credit. Indeed he was almost the only person whom <lb/>
            Dionysius allowed freely to speak his mind, as is proved <lb/>
            by the reproof which he gave Dionysius about Gelon. It <lb/>
            appears that Dionysius was sneering at Gelon and his <lb/>
            kingdom, and saying that he was the laughing-stock of <note type="footnote">* The various stories about Plato's slavery are discussed in Grote's <lb/>
            I History of Greece,' part ii. cl. 53. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            Sicily. All the other courtiers pretended to approve of <lb/>
            this jest, but Dion harshly answered, " Yet you have been <lb/>
            allowed to become our despot because of the good example <lb/>
            set by Gelon; but your example will not encourage any <lb/>
            state to imitate us." In truth Gelon's conduct as an <lb/>
            absolute monarch seems to have been just as admirable as <lb/>
            that of Dionysius was detestable.</p>
          <p>VI. Dionysius had three children by his Lokrian wife, <lb/>
            and four by Aristomache. Of his two daughters, <lb/>
            Sophrosyne married her half-brother, and Arete married <lb/>
            Thearides, the brother of Dionysius, but on the death of <lb/>
            Thearides Dion took Arete, who was his own niece, for his <lb/>
            wife. In Dionysius's last illness, when his life was <lb/>
            despaired of, Dion wished to ask him what was to become <lb/>
            of the children of Aristomache, but the physicians, who <lb/>
            wished to pay their court to the heir to the throne, would <lb/>
            not allow Dion an opportunity of doing so. Timæus even <lb/>
            states that when Dionysius asked for a sleeping draught <lb/>
            they gave him one which rendered him completely in. <lb/>
            sensible, so that he passed from sleep into death. <lb/>
            However, as soon as the young Dionysius assembled his <lb/>
            friends in council, Dion made such an admirable speech <lb/>
            upon the political situation that all the others appeared by <lb/>
            his side to be mere children in intellect, and their words <lb/>
            seemed to be those of slaves and grovelling flatterers of <lb/>
            the despot when compared with his bold and fearless <lb/>
            utterances. He impressed upon their minds the greatness <lb/>
            of the danger by which they were menaced by Carthage, <lb/>
            and promised that if Dionysius wished for peace he <lb/>
            himself would at once set sail for Africa and obtain the <lb/>
            best terms he could; or that, if he preferred to fight, <lb/>
            he would place at his disposal a force of fifty triremes, <lb/>
            which he would maintain at his own expense.</p>
          <p>VII. Dionysius greatly admired his magnanimity and <lb/>
            approved of his zeal; but the others, who thought that <lb/>
            they were eclipsed by Dion, and were jealous of his power, <lb/>
            at once set to work to effect his ruin, and lost no opportunity <lb/>
            of exasperating the young despot against him by pointing <lb/>
            out that he was plotting to obtain the supreme throne by <lb/>
            means of the fleet, and that his object in making the offer <lb/>
            of the ships was to place all real power in the hands of <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            the children of Aristomache. Their hate and jealousy of <lb/>
            Dion was chiefly owing to the proud reserve of his life, so <lb/>
            different to their own: for they at once began to court the <lb/>
            friendship of their young and ill-trained monarch by <lb/>
            offering him all kinds of flatteries and pleasures, endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to amuse his leisure by vagrant amours, drinking <lb/>
            parties, and the like dissolute pastimes, which blunted the <lb/>
            excessive sharpness of his tyranny, and made his subjects <lb/>
            regard it as milder and less ferocious than before, although <lb/>
            the alteration was due only to the laziness and not to the <lb/>
            real goodness of their ruler. By slow degrees the extra­ <lb/>
            vagance and licentious life of the young monarch relaxed <lb/>
            and broke those "chains of adamant" by which the elder <lb/>
            Dionysius boasted that he had secured his power. We are <lb/>
            told that he once continued drinking for ninety days in <lb/>
            succession, and that during the whole of this time his court <lb/>
            was a place which no respectable person could enter, and <lb/>
            where no business could be transacted, as it was a con­ <lb/>
            stant scene of singing, jesting, dancing, drunkenness and <lb/>
            debauchery.</p>
          <p>VIII. As may easily be imagined, Dion soon lost the <lb/>
            favour of the monarch, as he never relaxed the austerity <lb/>
            of his life. For this reason the calumnies of infamous <lb/>
            men were more easily believed by Dionysius, when they <lb/>
            attacked the virtues of Dion, calling his pride arrogance, <lb/>
            and his boldness of speech churlishness. When he gave <lb/>
            good advice he was thought to reproach them, and because <lb/>
            he refused to join in their excesses, he seemed to despise <lb/>
            them. Indeed, his disposition was naturally inclined to <lb/>
            haughtiness, and his manners harsh and forbidding. It <lb/>
            was not only to a young man whose ears were accustomed <lb/>
            to batteries that he appeared so ungracious and harsh- <lb/>
            tempered, but even those who were sincerely attached to <lb/>
            him, and who admired the noble simplicity of his character, <lb/>
            used to blame his discourtesy and rudeness towards those <lb/>
            with whom he was brought in contact upon political busi­ <lb/>
            ness. Indeed, not long after this, Plato, as if prophetically, <lb/>
            wrote to him, warning him against a stubborn and arro­ <lb/>
            gant temper, the consort of a lonely life. Yet, even at <lb/>
            that time, though Dion was regarded as the most able <lb/>
            man in the state, and was thought to be the only person <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            who could save the kingdom from the dangers by which <lb/>
            it was menaced, he knew well that his honourable and <lb/>
            powerful position was not due to any love which the <lb/>
            monarch bore him, but merely to the fact that he could <lb/>
            not do without him.</p>
          <p>IX. As Dion imagined that this must be caused by <lb/>
            Dionysius's want of education, he endeavoured to interest <lb/>
            him in literature, and to form his character by the study <lb/>
            of philosophy and science. Indeed Dionysius was far from <lb/>
            being a stupid ruler, but his father, fearing that if he were <lb/>
            educated, and frequented the society of intellectual men, <lb/>
            he would certainly plot against him and seize his throne, <lb/>
            used to keep him shut up at home, where, through want <lb/>
            of companionship and ignorance, he was forced, we are <lb/>
            told, to amuse himself by making little waggons and <lb/>
            lamps, and wooden chairs and tables; for the elder Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius was so distrustful and suspicious of all men, and <lb/>
            was driven by his fears to take such precautions against <lb/>
            assassination, that he would not even allow his hair to be <lb/>
            cut with a barber's tools, but a workman used to come and <lb/>
            singe his hair with a live coal. Neither his brother nor <lb/>
            his son was allowed to enter his house in their ordinary <lb/>
            dress, but were obliged to take off their clothes and put <lb/>
            on others, so that they might be seen naked by the guard. <lb/>
            Once when his brother Leptines, describing the situation of <lb/>
            some place, took a spear from one of the life-guards and with <lb/>
            it drew a map upon the floor, Dionysius was furiously angry <lb/>
            with him, and put to death the man who gave him the spear. <lb/>
            He used to say that he suspected all his friends, because <lb/>
            he knew that they were sensible men, who would prefer to <lb/>
            be despots themselves rather than live under the rule of a <lb/>
            despot. He put to death one Marsyas, whom he had him­ <lb/>
            self promoted to a responsible post, because he dreamed that <lb/>
            he was killing him; for Dionysius argued that his dream <lb/>
            must have been suggested by some thoughts or talk in his <lb/>
            waking hours. To such a condition of terror and <lb/>
            misery was he reduced by his cowardice, although he was <lb/>
            angry with Plato for not declaring him to be the bravest <lb/>
            of men.</p>
          <p>X. Dion, perceiving, as has been said before, that the <lb/>
            character of the young Dionysius had been ruined by his <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            want of education, begged him to educate himself, to offer <lb/>
            all possible inducements to the first of philosophers to <lb/>
            visit Sicily, and when he came, to place himself in his <lb/>
            hands, in order that his character might be exalted by <lb/>
            the contemplation of virtue, and formed upon the noblest <lb/>
            of models, which alone can produce order out of chaos; <lb/>
            by which means he would not only gain great happiness <lb/>
            for himself, but would bestow great happiness upon the <lb/>
            citizens by his mild and just paternal rule, thus becoming <lb/>
            a true king instead of a despot. He pointed out that the <lb/>
            " adamantine chains ” by which Dionysius's father boasted <lb/>
            that his dominion was secured, were not terror and force, <lb/>
            the numbers of his ships of war, or the thousands of his <lb/>
            barbarian mercenaries, but rather the goodwill, loyalty, <lb/>
            and gratitude engendered by virtue and justice, which, <lb/>
            though softer than those rough defences, would never­ <lb/>
            theless establish his rule far more securely than they. <lb/>
            Besides these considerations he urged that it was a <lb/>
            sorry thing, and showed a want of proper ambition <lb/>
            for a ruler to be splendidly dressed and luxuriously lodged, <lb/>
            but yet to be no more intellectual in his conversa­ <lb/>
            tion and arguments than any ordinary man, and to <lb/>
            neglect to adorn the palace of his soul as became a king.</p>
          <p>XI. As Dion frequently urged these considerations, and <lb/>
            quoted several of Plato's discourses, Dionysius became <lb/>
            passionately desirous of seeing and conversing with <lb/>
            Plato. Many letters were at once sent to Athens by <lb/>
            Dionysius, while Plato also received many injunctions <lb/>
            from Dion and from several of the Pythagorean philoso­ <lb/>
            phers in Italy, bidding him go to Syracuse, undertake <lb/>
            the guidance of the mind of this young and powerful <lb/>
            ruler, and fill it with serious thoughts. Plato obeyed <lb/>
            their invitation, chiefly, he tells us, because he feared to <lb/>
            appear a mere man of words, unwilling to take in hand <lb/>
            any real work, and also because he hoped that if he could <lb/>
            purify the mind of the chief, he might through him <lb/>
            influence for good the whole of the corrupt people of <lb/>
            Sicily. The opponents of Dion, who feared the results <lb/>
            of any change in the character of Dionysius, prevailed <lb/>
            upon him to recall from exile Philistus, a man of intel­ <lb/>
            lectual culture and an experienced courtier, in order to <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            make use of him as a counterpoise to Plato and his <lb/>
            philosophy. Indeed, Philistus had zealously assisted in <lb/>
            the establishment of the despotism, and for a long time <lb/>
            had acted as chief of the garrison of the citadel. There <lb/>
            was also a report that he had been the favoured lover of <lb/>
            the mother of the elder Dionysius, and that, too, not alto­ <lb/>
            gether without the knowledge of the despot; for when <lb/>
            Leptines, without telling Dionysius of it, gave Philistus <lb/>
            for his wife one of the two daughters which had been <lb/>
            born to him by a woman whom he had seduced while she <lb/>
            was married to another man, and who afterwards lived <lb/>
            with him, Dionysius was very angry, caused the wife of <lb/>
            Leptines to be imprisoned in chains, and forced Philistus <lb/>
            to leave Sicily and take refuge with some friends of his <lb/>
            at Adria, where he is thought to have found leisure to <lb/>
            write the greater part of his history; for he never re­ <lb/>
            turned to Syracuse during the life of the elder Dionysius, <lb/>
            but it was after that prince's death, as has been told, that <lb/>
            the opposition to Dion brought him back as being a person <lb/>
            more likely to agree with their views and more likely to <lb/>
            support the monarchy.</p>
          <p>XII. Philistus on his return at once became closely <lb/>
            connected with the monarchy; while Dion was assailed <lb/>
            by misrepresentations and slanders reported by others to <lb/>
            the despot, charging him with having discussed the <lb/>
            extinction of despotism with Theodotes and Herakleides. <lb/>
            Dion appears to have hoped by the influence of Plato to <lb/>
            remove from Dionysius all the arbitrary harshness of a <lb/>
            despot, and to make him into an orderly constitutional <lb/>
            ruler. If he resisted, and refused to be thus softened and <lb/>
            refined, Dion had determined to set him aside, and to <lb/>
            restore to the Syracusans their free constitution; not that <lb/>
            he was an admirer of democracy, but because he thought <lb/>
            that at any rate it was better than a despotism for <lb/>
            states which were not ruled by a wise and stable <lb/>
            oligarchy.</p>
          <p>XIII. While affairs were in this posture, Plato arrived <lb/>
            at Sicily and received a most kindly and magnificent <lb/>
            welcome. One of the royal carriages, splendidly equipped, <lb/>
            stood ready to receive him as he landed, and Dionysius <lb/>
            offered sacrifice. as though some great good fortune had <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            befallen his rule. The sobriety of the royal banquets, the <lb/>
            refined tone of the court and the gentle manners of Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius himself in transacting business, all inspired the <lb/>
            Syracusans with great hope of a change for the better. <lb/>
            It became the fashion to take interest in philosophical <lb/>
            matters, and it is said that so many began to study geo­ <lb/>
            metry that the palace was filled with the dust in which <lb/>
            they drew their figures. In a few days' time a hereditary <lb/>
            sacrifice was celebrated in the palace; and when the <lb/>
            herald, according to custom, prayed that the despotism <lb/>
            might remain unshaken for many years, it is said that <lb/>
            Dionysius, who stood near him, exclaimed: “ Will you not <lb/>
            cease from imprecating curses upon us?" This greatly <lb/>
            grieved the party of Philistus, who feared that Plato's <lb/>
            power over Dionysius would become unassailable, if he <lb/>
            were allowed time to become intimate with him, if after <lb/>
            so short an acquaintance he had already wrought so great <lb/>
            a change in the young man's ideas.</p>
          <p>XIV. They now no longer singly and in secret, but in <lb/>
            a body openly assailed Dion, declaring that they could <lb/>
            easily see through his motives in bewitching Dionysius <lb/>
            with the eloquence of Plato, in order that Dionysius <lb/>
            might be induced to voluntarily abdicate his throne, and <lb/>
            hand it over to the children of Aristomache, whose uncle <lb/>
            Dion was. Some of them even pretended to be angry that, <lb/>
            though in former times a great Athenian naval and <lb/>
            military force sailed thither and perished before it could <lb/>
            effect the conquest of Syracuse, yet now the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians should be able, by means of one single sophist, to <lb/>
            destroy the throne of Dionysius, and persuade him to <lb/>
            desert his ten thousand life-guards, leave his four hundred <lb/>
            ships of war, his ten thousand cavalry and many thou­ <lb/>
            sands more of infantry soldiers, in order to seek in the <lb/>
            Academy for the ineffable good, and find real pleasure in <lb/>
            geometry, leaving the pleasures of power, wealth and <lb/>
            luxury to be enjoyed by Dion and Dion's nephews. This <lb/>
            led at first to Dion's being regarded with suspicion, and <lb/>
            then, when Dionysius began to show his dislike openly, <lb/>
            he received a letter which Dion had secretly despatched <lb/>
            to the Carthaginian commanders, warning them, when <lb/>
            they came to treat for peace with Dionysius, not to con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            duct the interview without his being present, as he would <lb/>
            see that the whole matter was permanently settled. We <lb/>
            are told by Timæus that Dionysius, after reading this <lb/>
            letter to Philistus and having taken counsel with him, <lb/>
            deceived Dion by making false offers of reconciliation <lb/>
            with him. After much friendly talk, he declared that <lb/>
            their differences were at an end, and then, leading him <lb/>
            alone towards the sea-shore under the walls of the citadel, <lb/>
            showed him the letter, and upbraided him with plotting <lb/>
            with the Carthaginians against himself. He would not <lb/>
            listen to Dion when he tried to excuse himself, but at <lb/>
            once placed him on board of a small vessel and ordered the <lb/>
            sailors to land him on the coast of Italy.</p>
          <p>XV. Upon this, as Dionysius appeared to have acted <lb/>
            very harshly, the whole palace was plunged in grief by <lb/>
            the women, while the city of Syracuse became much ex­ <lb/>
            cited, expecting that the exile of Dion and the mistrust <lb/>
            with which others regarded the despot would soon lead to <lb/>
            some revolution. Dionysius, perceiving and fearing this, <lb/>
            encouraged the women and friends of Dion, speaking of <lb/>
            Dion as though he were not banished, but had left the <lb/>
            country of his own free will, for fear that if he remained <lb/>
            at home his quick temper might betray him into some <lb/>
            violent collision with himself. He placed two ships at <lb/>
            the disposal of Dion's relatives, and bade them embark <lb/>
            with as much of his property and servants as they pleased <lb/>
            and go to rejoin him in Peloponnesus. Dion's property was <lb/>
            very extensive, and his whole household was on a mag­ <lb/>
            nificent, almost a royal, scale. Everything was now <lb/>
            carried away by his friends, and much more was sent to <lb/>
            him by his female relatives and his friends, so that his <lb/>
            wealth and magnificence became famous throughout <lb/>
            Greece, and the power of the despot became enhanced by <lb/>
            the sight of the riches of the exile.</p>
          <p>XVI. Dionysius at once removed Plato into the citadel, <lb/>
            where, under pretence of showing him kindly respect, he <lb/>
            was kept in an honourable captivity, in order that he <lb/>
            might not sail away with Dion, a witness of his unjust <lb/>
            treatment. By degrees, like a wild animal who gradually <lb/>
            becomes used to the touch of human beings, so Dionysius <lb/>
            accustomed himself to the society and discourses of Plato, <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            and, after the manner of despots, conceived a violent <lb/>
            passion for him. He was especially anxious that Plato <lb/>
            should return his affection and should approve of his acts, <lb/>
            and was even willing to entrust the government and the <lb/>
            crown itself to him if he would only not prefer Dion's <lb/>
            friendship to his own. This passion of his caused great <lb/>
            annoyance to Plato, for like all true lovers he was furiously <lb/>
            jealous and had frequent quarrels and reconciliations with <lb/>
            him, being very eager to hear his discourses, and engage <lb/>
            in the study of philosophy, and yet being influenced by <lb/>
            those who advised him to keep away from Plato, as he <lb/>
            would be corrupted by his teaching. Meanwhile, as some <lb/>
            war broke out, he sent Plato away, promising that in a <lb/>
            year's time he would recall Dion. This promise he broke <lb/>
            at once, but he remitted to Dion the revenues of his estate, <lb/>
            and besought Plato to pardon his breach of faith about <lb/>
            the time, because of the war; for, as soon as peace should <lb/>
            be made, he promised that he would at once send for Dion. <lb/>
            He also asked Plato to beg Dion to remain quiet, and not to <lb/>
            engage in any revolutionary schemes, and not to traduce <lb/>
            his character to the Greeks.</p>
          <p>XVII. Plato endeavoured to effect this, and turned <lb/>
            Dion's attention to philosophy, and kept him in the <lb/>
            Academy. Dion lived at this time in the city of Athens, <lb/>
            in the house of Kallippus, one of his friends, though he <lb/>
            also. bought an estate in the country for recreation, which, <lb/>
            when he subsequently set sail for Sicily, he presented <lb/>
            to Speusippus, who, of all the Athenians, was his most <lb/>
            intimate friend. This intimacy was brought about by <lb/>
            Plato, who hoped that the harshness of Dion's character <lb/>
            might be somewhat softened by the society of a well- <lb/>
            bred and cheerful man. Such a person as this was Speu­ <lb/>
            sippus, whom we find spoken of in Timon's Silli as being <lb/>
            " good at a jest." When Plato himself exhibited a chorus <lb/>
            of boys, Dion both trained the chorus and defrayed all the <lb/>
            expenses, and Plato permitted him to gain this distinction <lb/>
            although it was likely to obtain popularity for Dion at his <lb/>
            own expense. Dion also visited other cities, where he asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with the best and most statesmanlike of the citizens, <lb/>
            and attended their solemn festivals, without ever betraying <lb/>
            anything repulsive, affected, or imperious in his manner, <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            but acting with manliness and discretion, and discoursing <lb/>
            with elegance on philosophy as well as ordinary topics. <lb/>
            By this conduct he everywhere gained good opinions, and <lb/>
            public honours were decreed to him by various cities, <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians even adopted him as a Spartan, dis­ <lb/>
            regarding the anger of Dionysius, though he at the time <lb/>
            was zealously assisting them in a war against the <lb/>
            Thebans. We are told that once Dion wished to see <lb/>
            Ptoiodorus, of Megara, and went to his house. Ptoiodorus, <lb/>
            it seems, was a rich and powerful man; and when Dion <lb/>
            observed the crowds at his door and the busy throng and <lb/>
            saw how hard it was to gain an audience of him, he <lb/>
            turned to his friends, who were vexed at this, and said: <lb/>
            " Why should we find fault with this man ? for we our­ <lb/>
            selves used to do just the same thing at Syracuse?"</p>
          <p>XVIII. As time went on, Dionysius, feeling jealous of <lb/>
            Dion, and fearing the popularity which he was obtaining <lb/>
            among the Greeks, left off forwarding his revenues to him <lb/>
            and confiscated his property. Being desirous of effacing <lb/>
            the bad impression which he had made upon all philoso­ <lb/>
            phers by his treatment of Plato, he collected round him <lb/>
            many men who had a reputation for learning. As he <lb/>
            wished to surpass them all in argument, he was forced to <lb/>
            make use, often improperly, of what he had very imper­ <lb/>
            fectly learned from Plato. He now again began to wish <lb/>
            for Plato, and blamed himself for not having made use of <lb/>
            him when he was present, and for not having listened to <lb/>
            all his noble language. Frantic in his desires, and im­ <lb/>
            patient to obtain whatever he wished, as despots are, he <lb/>
            at once set his heart upon Plato and tried every means to <lb/>
            attract him. He induced Archytas and the other succes­ <lb/>
            sors of the original Pythagorean philosophers to invite <lb/>
            Plato; for it was by means of Plato that Dionysius had <lb/>
            at first become their friend. They sent Archedemus to <lb/>
            Plato, and Dionysius also despatched a trireme and <lb/>
            several of his friends to entreat Plato to come: while he <lb/>
            himself wrote a letter in which he distinctly stated that <lb/>
            Dion would never get his rights if Plato refused to come <lb/>
            to Sicily, but that if he would, Dion should receive them <lb/>
            all. Many letters also reached Dion from his sister and <lb/>
            his wife, urging him to beg Plato to accede to the request <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            of Dionysius, and not afford him grounds for ill-treating <lb/>
            them. Thus, they say, it was that Plato came to sail a <lb/>
            third time into the straits of Scylla.</p>
          <p>"Again the dread Charybdis to explore.”</p>
          <p>XIX. His arrival afforded un ounded delight to Diony­ <lb/>
            sius, and again filled Sicily with great hopes; for all men <lb/>
            prayed and were eager that Plato and philosophy should <lb/>
            get the better of Philistus and despotism. He was treated <lb/>
            with great respect by the ladies,. and received from <lb/>
            Dionysius a mark of confidence which was accorded to no <lb/>
            one else, in being allowed to come into his presence <lb/>
            without his clothes being searched. As Dionysius fre­ <lb/>
            quently offered valuable presents to Plato, who never <lb/>
            would receive them, Aristippus of Cyrene, who was pre­ <lb/>
            sent, observed that Dionysius exercised a very cheap <lb/>
            generosity; for he gave small presents to himself and <lb/>
            to others who wished for more, and offered great ones to <lb/>
            Plato, who would not accept of any. When, however, <lb/>
            after the first welcome was over, Plato began to speak of <lb/>
            Dion, Dionysius at first put off discussing the subject, and <lb/>
            subsequently reproaches and quarrels took place between <lb/>
            them, of which no one else was aware, since Dionysius <lb/>
            kept them secret, and by showing Plato assiduous atten­ <lb/>
            tions and marks of respect tried to win him over from his <lb/>
            friendship for Dion. Plato, too, at first would not publish <lb/>
            what he knew of the treachery and falsehood of Dionysius, <lb/>
            but affected not to perceive it and endured it in silence. <lb/>
            While they were on these terms, though they believed <lb/>
            that no one knew it, Helikon of Kyzikus, an intimate <lb/>
            friend of Plato, foretold an eclipse of the sun; and as it <lb/>
            happened according to his prediction, the despot was much <lb/>
            impressed, and gave him a talent of silver. Aristippus <lb/>
            now in joke said to the other philosophers that he too had <lb/>
            a remarkable event to predict; and when they begged <lb/>
            him to tell them what it was, he said, “ I predict that <lb/>
            before long Plato and Dionysius will become foes." At <lb/>
            last Dionysius sold Dion's property and kept the money, <lb/>
            and even removed Plato from the lodgings in the gardens <lb/>
            near his own palace, where he had hitherto dwelt, and <note type="footnote"> * Aristomache and Arete. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            quartered him among the mercenary troops, who had long <lb/>
            disliked Plato and wished to make away with him, because <lb/>
            they believed him to be counselling Dionysius to abdicate <lb/>
            and to live without a body-guard.</p>
          <p>XX. Archytas and his friends, when they heard <lb/>
            of the danger to which Plato was exposed, at once sent a <lb/>
            thirty-oared vessel with an embassy to Dionysius, demand­ <lb/>
            ing Plato from him, and alleging that he had originally <lb/>
            come to Syracuse at their request, and that they were re­ <lb/>
            sponsible for his safety. Dionysius concealed his dislike <lb/>
            of Plato by feasting him and treating him kindly on his <lb/>
            departure, but could not help saying to him, "I suppose, <lb/>
            Plato, you will abuse me terribly to your fellow-philoso­ <lb/>
            phers,” or something to that effect. At this Plato smiled, <lb/>
            and replied, " I trust that we shall never be so ill off in <lb/>
            the Academy for subjects to discuss, as for any one to <lb/>
            make mention of you." Such, they say, were the terms <lb/>
            upon which they parted; though this does not entirely <lb/>
            agree with Plato's own account of the matter.</p>
          <p>XXI. Dion was much angered by these proceedings of <lb/>
            Dionysius, and shortly afterwards was converted into an <lb/>
            open enemy on hearing of the treatment of his wife, on <lb/>
            which subject Plato wrote in enigmas to Dionysius. This <lb/>
            happened as follows :-After the expulsion of Dion, Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius, when he sent Plato away, bade him secretly make <lb/>
            inquiries as to whether there was anything to prevent <lb/>
            Dion's wife being bestowed upon another man; for there <lb/>
            was a rumour, which may have been true or merely in­ <lb/>
            vented by Dion's enemies, that the marriage had been <lb/>
            forced upon Dion against his will, and that he and his <lb/>
            wife had not lived happily together. Plato, as soon as lie <lb/>
            arrived at Athens conversed freely with Dion, and then <lb/>
            wrote a letter to the despot, some of which was clearly <lb/>
            expressed, but which in one part intimated to him, in a <lb/>
            manner which he alone could understand, that the writer <lb/>
            had spoken about the matter to Dion, and that he would <lb/>
            certainly be furious if Dionysius attempted anything of <lb/>
            the kind. At that time, as there were still great hopes of <lb/>
            arranging their quarrel, Dionysius did nothing further, <lb/>
            but allowed his sister to remain living with her child by <lb/>
            Dion. When, however, they became irreconcilable enemies <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            and Plato, after his second visit, was sent away bitterly <lb/>
            disliked by Dionysius, he proceeded to give Arete in <lb/>
            marriage, sorely against her will, to one of his friends, <lb/>
            named Timokrates, not imitating in this respect the <lb/>
            gentle conduct of his father; for the elder Dionysius also <lb/>
            had for an enemy Polyxenus the husband of his sister <lb/>
            Theste. Polyxenus, fearing for his life, escaped from <lb/>
            Syracuse and left Sicily. Upon this Dionysius sent for <lb/>
            his sister and blamed her for having known of her hus­ <lb/>
            band's intention to take flight, and not having told him <lb/>
            of it; but she, undismayed, answered him fearlessly, <lb/>
            "Dionysius, do you think me so bad and cowardly a <lb/>
            wife that, if I had known of the intention of my husband <lb/>
            to flee, I should not have accompanied him ? Indeed, I did <lb/>
            not know of it; for it would have been more creditable to <lb/>
            me to have been spoken of as the wife of Polyxenus the <lb/>
            exile than as the sister of Dionysius the despot." It is <lb/>
            said that when Theste used this bold language the despot <lb/>
            regarded her with admiration, and she was also so much <lb/>
            admired by the people of Syracuse for her courage and <lb/>
            goodness that after the fall of the dynasty they still con­ <lb/>
            tinued to treat her with the honours due to royalty, and, <lb/>
            when she died, all the citizens came in procession to her <lb/>
            funeral. These circumstances have required a digression <lb/>
            which is not without value.</p>
          <p>XXII. Dion after this at once prepared for war. Plato <lb/>
            would take no part in his attempts, both out of respect <lb/>
            for Dionysius and because of his own advanced age; but <lb/>
            Speusippus and his other companions joined Dion, and <lb/>
            encouraged him to set free Sicily, which they said was <lb/>
            stretching out its hands to him for help and would eagerly <lb/>
            welcome him. It seems, indeed, that when Plato was at <lb/>
            Syracuse, Speusippus and his friends, who mixed more with <lb/>
            the people, discovered their real feelings. At first they <lb/>
            were afraid to speak plainly, fearing that the despot was ex­ <lb/>
            perimenting upon them, but at length they took courage. <lb/>
            All told the same story, begging and encouraging Dion to <lb/>
            come, not with ships of war and horse and foot soldiers, but <lb/>
            to embark in an open boat, and lend merely his person and <lb/>
            his name to the Sicilians in their struggle against Diony. <lb/>
            sius. Encouraged by these reports, which he received from <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            Speusippus and his friends, Dion secretly levled a force <lb/>
            of mercenaries, but not in his own name, and without <lb/>
            disclosing his intention. Many statesmen and philosophers <lb/>
            assisted him, among the later Eudemus of Cyprus, in <lb/>
            whose honour, after his death, Aristotle composed his <lb/>
            dialogue upon the soul, and Timonides of Leukas. They <lb/>
            brought over to him also Miltas of Thessaly, a soothbayer <lb/>
            and former student of the Academy. Yet, of all those men <lb/>
            who had been banished by the despot, who were not less <lb/>
            than a thousand in number, five-and-twenty alone took <lb/>
            part in the expedition, and all the rest shrank from doing <lb/>
            so. Their starting-point was the island of Zakynthus, <lb/>
            where was assembled a force numbering less than eight <lb/>
            hundred soldiers, all of whom, however, were men of dis­ <lb/>
            tinction who had served in many great campaigns, and <lb/>
            were in admirable bodily condition, and such bold and <lb/>
            skilful warriors as would be able to excite and inspire with <lb/>
            courage the multitude which Dion hoped would rally round <lb/>
            him in Sicily.</p>
          <p>XXIII. These men, when they heard that the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion was directed against Sicily and Dionysius, were at <lb/>
            first scared and refused to go, declaring that only the <lb/>
            frenzy excited by some personal quarrel, or the failure of <lb/>
            all reasonable hopes of success, could have led Dion to <lb/>
            embark upon such a desperate enterprise, and they were <lb/>
            incensed with their own officers and those who had <lb/>
            enlisted them for not having at the outset informed them <lb/>
            of the object of the war. When, however, Dion addressed <lb/>
            them, pointing out the rottenness of the monarchy, and <lb/>
            informing them that he was taking them, not so much <lb/>
            -as soldiers as in order to use them as leaders for the <lb/>
            Syracusans and other peoples of Sicily, who had long been <lb/>
            ripe for revolt, and when, after Dion's speech, Alkimenes, <lb/>
            one of the expedition, who was one of the most celebrated <lb/>
            of the Achaeans both by birth and merit, spoke to the <lb/>
            same effect, they consented to go. The time was mid­ <lb/>
            summer and the Etesian * winds were blowing over the <lb/>
            sea. The moon was at the full. Dion prepared a mag­ <lb/>
            nificent sacrifice to Apollo and marched in solemn proces­ <lb/>
            sion to the temple with his soldiers, all arrayed in <note type="footnote"> * Periodical northerly winds or monsoons. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            complete armour. After the sacrifice he feasted them in <lb/>
            the stadium or race-course of the people of Zakynthus, <lb/>
            where they had an opportunity of admiring the splendour <lb/>
            of his gold and silver plate, and reflected that a man past <lb/>
            middle life, as he was, and possessed of such wealth, <lb/>
            would never attempt an extravagant enterprise without <lb/>
            reasonable expectation of success, or unless his friends <lb/>
            upon the spot had promised to furnish him with abundant <lb/>
            resources.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Just after the libations - and customary <lb/>
            prayers, the moon became eclipsed. Dion and his <lb/>
            friends saw nothing remarkable in this, as they could <lb/>
            calculate the periods of eclipses, and knew how the <lb/>
            shadow was produced upon the moon by the interposition <lb/>
            of the earth between it and the sun. As, however, the <lb/>
            soldiers were alarmed at the portent and required some <lb/>
            encouragement, Miltas the soothsayer came into the <lb/>
            midst of them and addressed them, bidding them be of <lb/>
            good cheer and expect the most complete success; for <lb/>
            the gods, he declared, foretold by this sign that something <lb/>
            brilliant would be extinguished. Now there was nothing <lb/>
            more brilliant than the monarchy of Diunysius, whose <lb/>
            light was fated to be quenched by them as soon as they <lb/>
            arrived at Sicily. This interpretation Miltas told to them <lb/>
            all; but when a swarm of bees was seen to settle on the <lb/>
            sterns of the ships, he privately told Dion and his friends <lb/>
            that he feared lest this might portend that at first they <lb/>
            would be very properous, but that after blooming for a <lb/>
            short time their prosperity would wither away. It is said, <lb/>
            too, that many ominous signs were vouchsafed by Heaven <lb/>
            to Dionysius. An eagle snatched up a spear from one of <lb/>
            the life-guards, soared aloft with it, and let it fall into the <lb/>
            sea; and one day the sea-water which washes the walls <lb/>
            of the citadel became quite sweet and drinkable, so that <lb/>
            all men noticed it. Swine also were born without ears, <lb/>
            though perfect in all other parts. This was interpreted <lb/>
            by the soothsayers to be a sign of insurrection and <lb/>
            disobedience, and to mean that the people would no <lb/>
            longer hearken to the commands of the despot, while the <note type="footnote"> * The ceremony of the libations seems to correspond to our “ grace <lb/>
            after meat." See vol. i. Life of Perikles, ch. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            portent of the sea-water meant that after bitter miserie i <lb/>
            sweet and pleasant times were in store for the people of <lb/>
            Syracuse. The eagle, they said, is the servant of Zeu , <lb/>
            and the spear is the symbol of power and sovereignty ; <lb/>
            wherefore the greatest of the gods must intend to sin t <lb/>
            and destroy the monarchy. These incidents we are tol I <lb/>
            by Theopompus.</p>
          <p>XXV. The soldiers of Dion were contained in tw&gt; <lb/>
            merchant-ships, which were accompanied by another small <lb/>
            vessel and two galleys of thirty oars.. Besides the arms <lb/>
            carried by the soldiers, Dion took with him two thousan 1 <lb/>
            shields, many spears and missiles, and sufficient provision a <lb/>
            to supply them during the whole voyage, which was to <lb/>
            be performed entirely under canvass and over the ope:i <lb/>
            sea, because they feared to approach the land, and had <lb/>
            learned that Philistus was cruising off the Iapygian Cape <lb/>
            with a squadron to intercept them. Sailing with a light <lb/>
            and gentle wind for twelve days, on the thirteenth they <lb/>
            reached Pachynus, the southern extremity of Sicily. Here <lb/>
            Protus their pilot bade them make haste to disembark, <lb/>
            warning them that if they left the land and steered away <lb/>
            from the cape, they would be obliged to spend many days <note type="footnote"> * Grote paraphrases this passage as follows :-" A little squadron <lb/>
            was prepared, of no more than five merchantmen, two of them vessels <lb/>
            of thirty oars, &amp;c.” On consulting Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, s. v. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριακέντορος</foreign>, I find a reference to Thuc. iv. 9; where a Messenian <lb/>
            pirate triaconter is spoken of, and for further information the reader <lb/>
            is referred to the article “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντορος</foreign> (sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυ̑ς</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign>, a ship of burd n <lb/>
            with fifty oars," Find. P. 4. 436, Eur. I. T. 1124, Thuc. i., 14, &amp;c. But <lb/>
            none of these passages bear out the sense of a " vessel of burden." The <lb/>
            passage in Pindar merely states that the snake which Jason slew was <lb/>
            as big or bigger than a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντορος</foreign>. Herod. ii. 163, distinctly <lb/>
            says “ not ships of burden, but penteconters." In Eur. L T. 1124, the <lb/>
            chorus merely remark that Iphigenia will be borne home by a pen­ <lb/>
            teconter, while Thucydides (i. 14) explicitly states that, many genera­ <lb/>
            tions after the Trojan war, the chief navies of Greece consisted of <lb/>
            but few triremes, and chiefly of “ penteconters or of long ships equipped <lb/>
            like them." From these passages I am inclined to think that the true <lb/>
            meaning of the passage is the literal one, that the soldiers were placed <lb/>
            on board of two transports, that the two triaconters, or thirty-oared <lb/>
            galleys, were ships of war and acted as convoy to them, and that the <lb/>
            small vessel was intended for Dion and his friends to escape in if <lb/>
            necessary. In Dem. Zen. a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντορος</foreign> undoubtedly is spoken of <lb/>
            as a merchant vessel; but this does not prove that there were no war <lb/>
            penteconters in Dion's time. </note> <lb/>

            and nights at sea during the summer season, when a <lb/>
            southerly gale might be expected. Dion, however, feared <lb/>
            to disembark so near his foes, and, wishing to land further <lb/>
            away, sailed along the coast past Cape Pachynus. Here­ <lb/>
            upon a violent northerly wind, accompanied by a high sea, <lb/>
            drove the ships away from Sicily, while at the rising of <lb/>
            Arcturus a storm of thunder and lightning burst upon <lb/>
            them with furious rain. At this the sailors became dis­ <lb/>
            mayed, and lost their reckoning, but suddenly found that <lb/>
            the ships were being carried by the waves towards the <lb/>
            rockiest and most precipitous cliffs of the island Kerkina,* <lb/>
            off the coast of Libya. They narrowly escaped being <lb/>
            dashed to pieces upon the rocks, but struggled along, keep­ <lb/>
            ing themselves off the land with punting-poles,† until at <lb/>
            length the storm abated and they learned from a vessel which <lb/>
            they fell in with that they were near what are called the <lb/>
            “ Heads " of the Great Syrtis. It now fell calm and they <lb/>
            became disheartened and quarrelled with one another; but <lb/>
            soon'an off-shore wind sprang up from the south, though <lb/>
            they, not expecting a southerly wind, could scarcely <lb/>
            believe in the change. The wind gradually increased in <lb/>
            force, and they, setting all the sail they were able, and <lb/>
            commending themselves in prayer to the gods, crossed the <lb/>
            open sea from Libya to Sicily before the wind. They <lb/>
            made a quick passage, and on the fifth day came to an <lb/>
            anchor at Minoa, a small city in that part of Sicily which <lb/>
            -belonged to the Carthaginians. The Carthaginian com­ <lb/>
            mander, Synalus, who was a friend of Dion, happened to be <lb/>
            present in the town. Not knowing what the expedition <lb/>
            was, or that Dion, was with it, he attempted to prevent <lb/>
            the soldiers from landing; but they poured out of their <lb/>
            ships fully armed, and though in accordance with Dion's <lb/>
            order they killed no one, because of his friendship with <lb/>
            the Carthaginian leader, yet they routed the Minoans, <lb/>
            entered their city with the fugitives, and captured it. <lb/>

            Dion restored the city to Synalus without doing It any <lb/>
            hurt, while Synalus showed hospitality to the soldiers and <lb/>
            provided Dion with the supplies which he needed.</p>
          <p>XXVI. What specially encouraged them was the absence <lb/>
            of Dionysius from Syracuse, although they had no hand <lb/>
            in bringing it about; for he had just started on a voyage <lb/>
            to the coast of Italy with a fleet of eighty ships. Although <lb/>
            Dion begged his soldiers to wait and recruit their strength <lb/>
            after the hardships of their long sea voyage, they would <lb/>
            not remain there, but in their eagerness to seize this <lb/>
            favourable opportunity bade Dion lead them to Syracuse. <lb/>
            Dion now left behind his surplus arms and baggage at <lb/>
            Minoa, and, begging Synalus to send them on to him when <lb/>
            he should have need of them, set out on his march to <lb/>
            Syracuse. On the road, he was first joined by two hundred <lb/>
            horsemen, citizens of Agrigentum, dwelling near Eknomon. <lb/>
            After these, some of the people of Gela also joined his army.</p>
          <p>The news of Dion's march soon reached Syracuse, and <lb/>
            Timokrates, the husband of Dion's late wife, the sister of <lb/>
            Dionysius, who was left in charge of the garrison, sent a <lb/>
            messenger in great haste to Dionysius with a letter telling <lb/>
            of Dion's arrival. He himself endeavoured to maintain <lb/>
            order and put down all insurrections in the city, for all <lb/>
            the people were excited at the news, but remained quiet <lb/>
            as yet, through fear and doubt. Meantime a strange mis­ <lb/>
            chance betel the bearer of the letter to Dionysius. He <lb/>
            crossed the straits to Italy, passed through the city of <lb/>
            Rhegium, and as he hurried on towards Kaulonia, where <lb/>
            Dionysius was, he fell in with one of his friends, carrying <lb/>
            a newly slaughtered victim. He was given a piece of meat <lb/>
            by the man, and went on in haste. He walked some part <lb/>
            of the night, but being forced by fatigue to take a little <lb/>
            sleep, he lay down, just as he was, in a wood by the road­ <lb/>
            side. While he slept, a wolf, attracted by the smell, <lb/>
            snatched up the meat, which he had tied to his wallet, and <lb/>
            ran off with it, carrying away with it the wallet in which <lb/>
            the man had placed the letter. When the man woke and <lb/>
            discovered his loss, after much vain searching, as he could <lb/>
            not find it, he decided not to go to the despot without the <lb/>
            letter, but to make off and keep out of the way.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In consequence of this Dionysius only heard <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            of the war in Sicily much later and from other persons, <lb/>
            and meanwhile Dion had been joined on his march by the <lb/>
            people of Kamarina, and by a considerable number of <lb/>
            the Syracusans who lived in the country. The Leontines <lb/>
            and Campanians, who formed the garrison of Epipolæ, in <lb/>
            consequence of Dion's sending them a false report that he <lb/>
            intended to attack their city first, left Timokrates, and <lb/>
            went away thither to defend their own property. When <lb/>
            news of this reached Dion, who was encamped near Akræ, <lb/>
            he aroused his soldiers while it was yet night and marched <lb/>
            to the river Anapus, which is ten stadia distant from the <lb/>
            city. There he halted and offered sacrifice beside the <lb/>
            river, praying to the rising sun, and at the same time the <lb/>
            soothsayers declared that the gods would give him the <lb/>
            victory. Observing that Dion wore a garland because he <lb/>
            was sacrificing, all those who were present at the sacrifice <lb/>
            with one impulse crowned themselves with flowers. No <lb/>
            less than five thousand men had joined him on his march. <lb/>
            They were badly armed in a make-shift fashion, but their <lb/>
            zeal supplied the deficiencies of their equipment, and when <lb/>
            Dion led the way they all started at a run, shouting for <lb/>
            joy, and encouraging one another to recover their freedom.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Of the Syracusans within the walls, the chief <lb/>
            men and upper classes in their most splendid raiment met <lb/>
            Dion at the gates, while the populace attacked the friends <lb/>
            of the despot, and seized upon the spies, a wicked and <lb/>
            hateful class of men, who used to live among the people <lb/>
            of the city and report their opinions and conversations to <lb/>
            the despot. These men were the first to suffer for their <lb/>
            crimes, as they were beaten to death by any of the citizens <lb/>
            who fell in with them. Timokrates, unable to reach the <lb/>
            garrison of the citadel, mounted his horse and rode away <lb/>
            from the city, spreading alarm and confusion everywhere <lb/>
            as he fled by exaggerating the numbers of Dion's army, <lb/>
            that he might not be thought to have surrendered the city <lb/>
            through fear to a small force.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Dion could already be seen plainly, as he <lb/>
            marched first of all his men, clad in splendid armour. On <lb/>
            one side of him was his brother Megakles, and on the <lb/>
            other the Athenian Kallippus, both crowned with garlands. <lb/>
            Next marched a hundred of the mercenary soldiers, as a <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            body-guard for Dion, while the rest of the men were led <lb/>
            on by their officers in battle array. The entire procession <lb/>
            was looked upon and welcomed as though it were sacred <lb/>
            by the citizens of Syracuse, who, after forty-two years of <lb/>
            tyranny, saw liberty and a popular constitution restored <lb/>
            to their city.</p>
          <p>XXIX. When Dion had entered by the Temenitid* <lb/>
            gate, he caused his trumpet to sound to obtain silence; <lb/>
            and then a herald made proclamation that Dion and Me­ <lb/>
            gakles were come to put down the monarchy, and that <lb/>
            they set free from the despot both the Syracusans and the <lb/>
            other Sicilian Greeks.</p>
          <p>As Dion wished to address the people in person, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded through Achradina, while the Syracusans placed <lb/>
            animals for sacrifice, tables and bowls of wine on each <lb/>
            side of the street,† and each, as Dion passed them, strewed <lb/>
            flowers in his path and addressed prayers to him as if to <lb/>
            a god. In front of the citadel, with its Pentapyla, or <lb/>
            Five Gates, stood a sundial, a conspicuous and lofty work, <lb/>
            erected by Dionysius. Dion mounted upon this, and <lb/>
            addressed the citizens, encouraging them to hold fast the <lb/>
            freedom which they had obtained. The people, in joy and. <lb/>
            gratitude to them, elected them both generals, with un­ <lb/>
            limited powers, and at their earnest request chose twenty <lb/>
            more as their colleagues, half of whom were taken from <lb/>
            the exiles who had returned with Dion. The prophets <lb/>
            considered it to be an excellent omen that Dion, while <lb/>
            addressing the people, should have trodden under his feet <lb/>
            the building which the despot had reared in his pride; <lb/>
            but they augured ill from his having been chosen general <lb/>
            while standing upon a sundial, lest his fortunes should <lb/>
            soon experience some revolution. After this he captured <lb/>
            Epipolæ, released the citizens who were imprisoned there <lb/>
            and cut off the citadel by a palisade. ‡ On the seventh <note type="footnote">* This seems to be the universally accepted emendation of the <lb/>
            unmeaning words in the original text. Grote remarks "The statue <lb/>
            and sacred ground of Apollo Temenites was the most remarkable feature <lb/>
            in this portion of Syracuse, and would naturally be selected to furnish <lb/>
            a name for the gate." ' Hist. of Greece,' part ii. ch. lxxxiv. note. </note><note type="footnote"> t The main street of Achradina is spoken of by Cicero as broad, <lb/>

             <pb n="375"/>
            day after this, Dionysius returned to the citadel by sea, <lb/>
            and waggons arrived bringing to Dion the arms and armour <lb/>
            which he had left with Synalus. These he distributed <lb/>
            among the citizens, and of the others, each man equipped <lb/>
            himself as well as he was able, and eagerly offered his <lb/>
            services as a soldier.</p>
          <p>XXX. Dionysius at first sent ambassadors privately to <lb/>
            Dion to endeavour to corrupt him. Afterwards, as Dion <lb/>
            bade him speak openly to the people of Syracuse, who were <lb/>
            now free, Dionysins through his ambassadors made them <lb/>
            attractive offers of moderate taxation and moderate mili­ <lb/>
            tary service, subject to their own vote of consent.- Thase <lb/>
            proposals were scornfully rejected by the Syracusans. <lb/>
            Dion told the ambassadors that he and his party could <lb/>
            have no dealings with Dionysius unless he abdicated; but <lb/>
            that if he did so, he himself, remembering their relation­ <lb/>
            ship, would answer for his personal safety, and obtain as <lb/>
            good terms for him as could be reasonably expected. <lb/>
            These conditions were approved by Dionysius, who again <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to demand that some of the Syracusans <lb/>
            should come to the citadel and arrange the terms of the <lb/>
            surrender upon a basis of mutual concessions. Com­ <lb/>
            missioners, chosen by Dion, were at once sent to him, and <lb/>
            a report spread from the citadel that Dionysius intended <lb/>
            to abdicate and to make himself more popular even than <lb/>
            Dion. However, the negotiations were all a trick of the <lb/>
            despot to take the Syracusans at a disadvantage. He <lb/>
            imprisoned the commissioners, and at daybreak, having <lb/>
            excited his mercenary troops with wine, sent them at a run <lb/>
            to attack the Syracusan wall across the isthmus. This <lb/>
            attack was unexpected, and the foreign troops boldly and <lb/>
            with loud shouts began to destroy the works and to attack <lb/>
            the Syracusans. No one could withstand their onset except <lb/>
            the mercenaries of Dion, who were the first to hear the <lb/>
            noise of the conflict and to rush to the spot. But not <lb/>
            even these men could perceive what was to be done or <lb/>
            obey their orders, mixed up as they were with noisy crowds <note type="footnote"> was therefore easily cut off by a ditch and palisade across the narrow <lb/>
            isthmus by which it was connected with the mainland. </note><note type="footnote"> * “ He offered them what in modern times would be called a con­ <lb/>

             <pb n="376"/>
            of panic-stricken Syracusan fugitives, before Dion, findii g <lb/>
            that no one heeded his words, and wishing to show by <lb/>
            his actions what ought to be done, was the first man to <lb/>
            attack the foreigners. Round him a fierce and terrible <lb/>
            battle took place, as he was recognised as well by the <lb/>
            enemy as by his friends, and all ran towards him with <lb/>
            shouts. He was, indeed, somewhat advanced in years to <lb/>
            engage in such a furious combat, but yet stoutly and <lb/>
            bravely withstood and repulsed all who attacked him. He <lb/>
            received a wound in the hand from a spear, and had to <lb/>
            rely upon his breastplate for protection against showers <lb/>
            of darts and blows in close combat, for his shield was <lb/>
            pierced through by many spears and lances. When these <lb/>
            were broken he fell to the ground, but was snatched away <lb/>
            by his soldiers. He appointed Timonides to take his place, <lb/>
            and himself rode through the city on horseback, rallied the <lb/>
            Syracusan fugitives, brought out the garrison of mercen­ <lb/>
            aries from Achradina, and led these fresh and confident <lb/>
            troops against the wearied foreigners, who had already <lb/>
            begun to despair of victory. They had imagined that by <lb/>
            their first attack they would be able to overrun the whole <lb/>
            city, but having unexpectedly fallen in with men who <lb/>
            could deal hard blows they began to retire towards the <lb/>
            citadel. As they gave way the Greeks pressed upon them <lb/>
            still more, until at length they were driven in confusion <lb/>
            into the citadel, after killing seventy-four of Dion's party, <lb/>
            and losing many of their own men.</p>
          <p>XXXI. After this glorious victory the Syracusans pre­ <lb/>
            sented the mercenaries with a hundred minæ, and the <lb/>
            mercenaries presented Dion with a golden crown. <lb/>
            Heralds from Dionysius now came from the citadel bring­ <lb/>
            ing letters to Dion from his female relatives. One of these <lb/>
            bore the superscription “ From Hipparinus to his father <lb/>
            for this was the name of Dion's son, although Timæus <lb/>
            says that he was named Aretæus after his mother Arete. <lb/>
            But I imagine we ought rather to believe Timonides in <lb/>
            such matters as these, since he was a friend and comrade of <lb/>
            Dion. The other letters, those from the women, which <lb/>
            were full of piteous supplications, were read aloud to the <lb/>
            Syracusans, but they were unwilling that the letter from <lb/>
            the child should be opened before them. In spite of their <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            opposition, Dion opened it and read it aloud. It was from <lb/>
            Dionysius himself, addressed nominally to Dion, but really <lb/>
            to the people of Syracuse, and though in it Dionysius <lb/>
            seemed to appeal to Dion and to plead his own cause with <lb/>
            him, yet in truth it was concocted with a view to render­ <lb/>
            ing him suspected by the people ; for it contained allusions <lb/>
            to his former zeal on behalf of the monarchy, and also <lb/>
            threatened him through the persons of those dearest to <lb/>
            him, his sister, his child and his wife. There were in <lb/>
            the letter also pitiful entreaties, and what especially <lb/>
            moved him to anger, supplications to him not to destroy <lb/>
            the monarchy and set free a people which hated him and <lb/>
            would turn and rend him, but to become despot himself, <lb/>
            and thus to save his relatives and friends.</p>
          <p>XXXII. When these letters were read to them, the <lb/>
            Syracusans, instead of admiring Dion for his magnani­ <lb/>
            mity in adhering to the cause of honour and right, in <lb/>
            spite of such touching appeals as these, they rather <lb/>
            began to suspect him and to fear him, because he had <lb/>
            such powerful reasons for sparing the despot, and they <lb/>
            began to look around them for some other leader. They <lb/>
            became particularly excited on hearing that Herakleides <lb/>
            sailed into the harbour. This Herakleides was a Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan exile, a military man who had gained a great repu­ <lb/>
            tation by. the commands which he had held in the service <lb/>
            of Dionysius and his father, but of an unsettled disposition, <lb/>
            fickle and least of all to be relied upon when associated <lb/>
            with a colleague in any command of dignity and honour. <lb/>
            This man had quarrelled with Dion in Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            and determined to make an expedition of his own to attack <lb/>
            Dionysius. He now arrived at Syracuse with seven triremes <lb/>
            and three other vessels,. and found Dionysius blockaded in <lb/>
            his citadel and the people of Syracuse in an excited con­ <lb/>
            dition. He at once received the popular favour, being <note type="footnote">* On this passage Grote has the following note:—“ Plutarch states <lb/>
            that Herakleides brought only seven triremes. But the force stated <lb/>
            by Diodorus (twenty triremes, three transports and 1500 soldiers) <lb/>
            appears more probable. It is difficult otherwise to explain the number <lb/>
            of ships which the Syracusans presently appear as possessing. More­ <lb/>
            over, the great importance which Herakleides steps into, as opposed <lb/>
            to Dion, is more easily accounted for." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            naturally plausible and well able to impose upon a people <lb/>
            who were fond of flattery. He was the more easily ena­ <lb/>
            bled to do this, as the Syracusans were already disgusted <lb/>
            with the haughty demeanour of Dion, which they consi­ <lb/>
            dered to be offensive and unfit for a statesman, being <lb/>
            themselves grown insubordinate and insolent after their <lb/>
            victory and requiring a demagogue even before they had <lb/>
            become a democracy.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Their first act was to assemble of their own <lb/>
            accord and elect Herakleides as admiral. When, however, <lb/>
            Dion came forward and complained that the appointment <lb/>
            of Herakleides was a revocation of the powers granted to <lb/>
            himself, since he would no longer be general with un­ <lb/>
            limited powers, if another commanded by sea, the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, much against their will, annulled the election. <lb/>
            After this Dion sent for Herakleides privately and, after <lb/>
            bitterly reproaching him with his want of honour and <lb/>
            right feeling in raising disputes about precedence during <lb/>
            so momentous and dangerous a crisis, again assembled <lb/>
            the people, appointed Herakleides admiral and prevailed <lb/>
            upon the citizens to grant him a body-guard such as that <lb/>
            by which he himself was attended. Herakleides now <lb/>
            in words and in manner acknowledged Dion as his supe­ <lb/>
            rior, obeyed his orders with humility, and owned that he <lb/>
            owed him a debt of gratitude; but in secret he encou­ <lb/>
            raged the people to revolt against him, stirred up tumults <lb/>
            and brought Dion into a most difficult position; for if he <lb/>
            were to permit Dionysius to retire from the citadel under <lb/>
            a flag of truce, he feared that he should be reproached <lb/>
            with sparing the despot and saving him from the fate <lb/>
            he deserved, while, if he did not push the siege through a <lb/>
            wish not to drive him to extremities, he would appear to <lb/>
            be purposely protracting the war in order that he might <lb/>
            the longer remain in power and have the people under <lb/>
            his orders.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. There was one Sosis, a man who by villainy <lb/>
            and audacity had gained a certain reputation at Syracuse, <lb/>
            where the citizens thought that his licence in speech must <lb/>
            be prompted by an excessive love of freedom. This man <lb/>
            began to intrigue against Dion, and first of all rose in the <lb/>
            assembly and violently abused the Syracusana for not <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            perceiving that they had got a sober and vigilant despot <lb/>
            instead of a drunken and imbecile one. After this, having <lb/>
            avowed himself Dion's open enemy, he withdrew from <lb/>
            the market-place and next day was seen running naked <lb/>
            through the city with his face and head covered with <lb/>
            blood, as though he were fleeing from some pursuers. <lb/>
            Rushing into the market-place in this condition, he said <lb/>
            that his life had been at tempted by Dion's mercenaries, <lb/>
            and showed his wounded head to the people. He at once <lb/>
            gained an audience of sympathisers, who became furious <lb/>
            with Dion, and declared that he was acting shamefully <lb/>
            and despotically in restraining the freedom of speech of <lb/>
            the citizens by threats and murders. However, though a <lb/>
            disorderly assembly took place, Dion was able to speak in <lb/>
            his own defence, pointing out that a brother of Sosis was <lb/>
            one of the guards of Dionysius, and that this man must <lb/>
            have persuaded him to rebel and throw the city into <lb/>
            confusion, since Dionysius could have no hope of safety <lb/>
            except in the dissensions of the besiegers. At the same <lb/>
            time the physicians examined the wound of Sosis, and <lb/>
            found that it was the result of a superficial scratch rather <lb/>
            than of a downward cut; for wounds by swordstrokes are <lb/>
            deepest in the middle, because of the weight of the blow, <lb/>
            while this wound of Sosis was shallow throughout all its <lb/>
            length and had several beginnings, as probably he had been <lb/>
            forced by the pain to leave off cutting his head and then <lb/>
            had begun again. Some of the more respectable citizens <lb/>
            also came to the assembly with a razor, and said that <lb/>
            while they were walking they met Sosis covered with <lb/>
            blood, saying that he was fleeing from Dion's mercenaries <lb/>
            and had just been wounded by them. They at once pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to look for them, and found no man, but saw the <lb/>
            razor hidden under a hollow stone at the place from <lb/>
            which Sosis had been seen coming out.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Matters now began to look ill for Sosis; and <lb/>
            when his slaves, after torture, declared that he left the <lb/>
            house while it was yet night carrying a razor, Dion's <lb/>
            accusers withdrew their charges against him, and the <lb/>
            people became reconciled with Dion and condemned Sosis <lb/>
            to death. Nevertheless, they viewed the mercenaries with <lb/>
            suspicion, especially after the great battles which took <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            place at sea, when Philistus came from Iapygla with <lb/>
            many triremes to rescue Dionysius, upon which they <lb/>
            imagined that the mercenaries, being heavy-infantry <lb/>
            soldiers, would be of no further use in the war, and would <lb/>
            soon become their enemies, as they were all seafaring <lb/>
            people, whose strength lay in their ships. They were <lb/>
            further excited by their success in a sea-fight, in which <lb/>
            they defeated Philistus, and treated him with the utmost <lb/>
            barbarity. Ephorus states that Philistus killed himself as <lb/>
            soon as his ship was captured, but Timonides, who was <lb/>
            present with Dion throughout the whole of these events, <lb/>
            in a letter which he wrote to the philospher, Speusippus, <lb/>
            informs him that Philistus was taken alive from his ship <lb/>
            which ran ashore; and that the Syracusans first stripped <lb/>
            him of his corslet and displayed him naked, jeering at <lb/>
            him, he being then an old man; and that after this they <lb/>
            cut off his head and gave up the body to the boys of the <lb/>
            town, bidding them drag it through Achradina, and cast <lb/>
            it into the stone quarries. Timæus declares that Philistus <lb/>
            was treated with even greater indignity, his dead body <lb/>
            being dragged by the boys through the city by the lame <lb/>
            leg amidst the insults of all the people of Syracuse, who <lb/>
            were pleased to see this treatment inflicted on the man <lb/>
            who had told Dionysius that far from requiring a swift <lb/>
            horse to escape from his throne, he ought to remain until <lb/>
            he was dragged from it by the leg. Philistus, however, <lb/>
            gave this advice to Dionysius, not as having been said by <lb/>
            himself, but by some one else.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Philistus doubtless laid himself open to blame <lb/>
            by his zealous adherence to the cause of the monarchy, <lb/>
            but Timæus takes advantage of this to satisfy his own <lb/>
            spite by abusing him. It might, perhaps, be pardoned if <lb/>
            those who had been wronged by him were so transported <lb/>
            by rage as even to insult his senseless corpse; but a <lb/>
            historian, writing an account of his actions in a later age, <lb/>
            without having been in any way personally injured by <lb/>
            him, ought to be restrained by feelings of honour and <lb/>
            decency from taunting him with his misfortunes, which, <lb/>
            indeed, might equally have befallen the best of men <lb/>
            Neither does Ephorus show a sound judgment in praising <lb/>
            Philistus, for, in spite of his skill in inventing good <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            motives for evil conduct and actions, and the care with <lb/>
            which his words are chosen, he cannot, with all his art, <lb/>
            gloss over the fact that Philistus was devotedly attached <lb/>
            to the cause of despotism, and that he, more than any one <lb/>
            else, was dazzled and attracted by wealth, power, luxury <lb/>
            and marriages with the daughters of absolute princes. A <lb/>
            historian would show better taste than either of these by <lb/>
            neither praising Philistus for his conduct nor reproaching <lb/>
            him with his misfortunes.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. After the death of Philistus, Dionysius sent <lb/>
            to Dion offering to deliver up to him the citadel, the arms <lb/>
            which it contained, the mercenary troops and five months <lb/>
            pay for them, and demanding to be allowed to retire un­ <lb/>
            molested to Italy and live there, and also to receive the <lb/>
            revenues of a large and fertile tract belonging to Syracuse <lb/>
            called Gyarta, which extended from the sea-side to the <lb/>
            interior of the island. Dion would not receive the <lb/>
            embassy, but bade Dionysius address himself to the people <lb/>
            of Syracuse; and they, hoping to take Dionysius alive, <lb/>
            drove away his ambassadors. Dionysius now handed over <lb/>
            the citadel to Apollokrates, his eldest son, and himself <lb/>
            placed what persons and property he chiefly valued on <lb/>
            board ship, waited for a fair wind, and then sailed away, <lb/>
            eluding the vigilance of the admiral Herakleides. <lb/>
            Herakleides was fiercely reproached by the citizens for <lb/>
            his neglect, but suborned one of the popular speakers to <lb/>
            make proposals to the people for a division of lands, point­ <lb/>
            ing out that equality is the source of freedom, and that <lb/>
            poverty reduces men to slavery. Herakleides spoke on <lb/>
            the same side, openly opposed Dion, who led the opposite <lb/>
            faction, and prevailed upon the Syracusans to agree to this <lb/>
            proposal, and further to refuse to pay the mercenary <lb/>
            troops and to rid themselves of the haughty arrogance of <lb/>
            Dion by electing new generals. Thus, like a man who <lb/>
            attempts to rise and walk when weakened by a long ill­ <lb/>
            ness, the Syracusans, after ridding themselves of their des­ <lb/>
            potism, at once tried to adopt the institutions of free <lb/>
            peoples, and both failed in their undertakings and dis­ <lb/>
            liked Dion, because he, like a careful physician, wished <lb/>
            to impose a strict and temperate regimen upon them.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. When they assembled to choose their new <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            commanders the time was about midsummer, and ominous <lb/>
            thunderstorms and portents took place for fifteen days in <lb/>
            succession, dispersing the people and preventing their <lb/>
            election of any other generals. When the popular leaders, <lb/>
            by waiting and watching, had obtained a fair still day for <lb/>
            the election of chief magistrates, a draught ox, who was <lb/>
            quite tame and accustomed to crowds, but who was en­ <lb/>
            raged with his driver, broke from his yoke and ran towards <lb/>
            the theatre. He scattered the people in the greatest con­ <lb/>
            fusion and panic, and ran on prancing and causing dis­ <lb/>
            order through all that part of the city which afterwards <lb/>
            fell into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, the Syra- <lb/>
            CUBans disregarded this omen, and elected five-and-twenty <lb/>
            generals, one of whom was Herakleides. They also made <lb/>
            secret overtures to Dion's mercenaries, inviting them to <lb/>
            desert, and offering them equal rights with the other <lb/>
            citizens. They, however, would not listen to these pro­ <lb/>
            posals, but faithfully and promptly got under arms, formed <lb/>
            column with Dion in their midst, and began to march out <lb/>
            of the city, without harming any one, but bitterly re­ <lb/>
            proaching all whom they met with their ingratitude and <lb/>
            wickedness. But the Syracusans, who despised them for <lb/>
            their small numbers and for not having been the first to <lb/>
            attack, had now collected in crowds, far outnumbering the <lb/>
            mercenaries, and set upon them, expecting that in a street- <lb/>
            fight they would easily be able to overpower them and to <lb/>
            kill them all.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. In this terrible dilemma, as he was forced <lb/>
            either to fight against his fellow-countrymen or to perish <lb/>
            with his mercenaries, Dion stretched out his hands towards <lb/>
            the Syracusans and implored them to desist, and pointed <lb/>
            to the citadel, full of armed enemies, who were watching <lb/>
            them from the battlements. As, however, the excited <lb/>
            mob could not be turned from its purpose, for the speeches <lb/>
            of the demagogues stirred up the people as the wind stirs <lb/>
            up the waves of the sea, Dion ordered his troops not to <lb/>
            charge them, but to march forward with a shout and <lb/>
            martial clash of arms. At this none of the Syracusans <lb/>
            stood their ground, but ran away along the streets un­ <lb/>
            pursued; for Dion at once wheeled round his troops and <lb/>
            marched away to Leontini. The new chiefs of the Syra­ <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            cusans, ridiculed by the women, and wishing to wipe out <lb/>
            their disgrace, now again got the citizens under arms and <lb/>
            pursued Dion. They came up with him as he was crossing <lb/>
            a stream, and rode up to his troops in skirmishing order. <lb/>
            When, however, they perceived that Dion was no longer <lb/>
            willing to deal gently and paternally with their follies, <lb/>
            but that he angrily formed his troops in line and <lb/>
            ordered them to attack, they fled more disgracefully <lb/>
            than before back to their city, without losing many of <lb/>
            their number.</p>
          <p>XL. The people of Leontini received Dion with especial <lb/>
            honours, provided his troops with pay, and made them <lb/>
            free of the city. They also sent ambassadors to the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, calling upon them to do the soldiers justice; to <lb/>
            which they replied by sending ambassadors to prefer <lb/>
            charges against Dion. When, however, all the allies <lb/>
            held a meeting at Leontini and discussed the matter, the <lb/>
            Syracusans were held to be in fault. But the Syracusans <lb/>
            refused to accept this decision, as they were now full of <lb/>
            insolent importance, having no one to rule them, but <lb/>
            being led by generals who were the merest slaves of the <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>XLI. After this a fleet of triremes sent by Dionysius <lb/>
            arrived at the city, under the command of Nypsius, a <lb/>
            Neapolitan, with supplies of corn and money for the be­ <lb/>
            sieged. In a sea-fight which took place the Syracusans <lb/>
            were victorious, and took four of the ships, but were so <lb/>
            elated by their victory, and, having none to rule them, <lb/>
            celebrated their success with such reckless excesses of <lb/>
            drinking and feasting, that while they imagined they had <lb/>
            taken the citadel they really lost the city as well; for <lb/>
            Nypsius, observing that discipline was everywhere at an <lb/>
            end, as the populace were engaged in drinking to the <lb/>
            sound of music from daylight until late at night, and that <lb/>
            the generals were delighted at the festivity and were ---in­ <lb/>
            willing to summon the drunken men to their duty, seized <lb/>
            his opportunity and attacked the Syracusan wall of in­ <lb/>
            vestment. His attack succeeded; he broke through the <lb/>
            works, and at once let loose his foreign mercenaries, <lb/>
            bidding them deal as they pleased with all whom they met. <lb/>
            The Syracusans, though they soon learned their misfor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            tune, yet were slow to assemble, being taken by surprise; ( <lb/>
            for the city was being sacked, the men slaughtered, the <lb/>
            walls thrown down and the women and children being <lb/>
            forced weeping into the citadel, while the generals gave <lb/>
            up all for lost, and could make no use of the citizens, <lb/>
            who were everywhere confusedly mixed up with the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>XLII. While the city was in this condition, and the <lb/>
            danger began to menace Achradina also, all men thought <lb/>
            of him who was their last and only hope, but no one spoke <lb/>
            of Dion, as they were all ashamed of the folly and in­ <lb/>
            gratitude with which they had treated him. Sheer neces­ <lb/>
            sity, however, forced some of the auxiliary troops and the <lb/>
            knights* to cry out that they must send for Dion and his <lb/>
            Peloponnesians from Leontini. As soon as any were found <lb/>
            bold enough to raise this cry, the Syracusans shouted <lb/>
            aloud, and rejoiced with tears, for they prayed that Dion <lb/>
            would come, they longed to see him, and they remembered <lb/>
            his courage and strength in time of danger, in which he <lb/>
            not only remained calm and unmoved, but gave them <lb/>
            confidence by his demeanour and caused them fearlessly <lb/>
            and bravely to attack their enemies. They therefore at <lb/>
            once sent off to him Archonides and Telesides, as repre­ <lb/>
            sentatives of the allies, and Hellanikus, with four others, of <lb/>
            the knights. These men rode at full gallop to Leontini, <lb/>
            arriving there late in the afternoon. When they dis­ <lb/>
            mounted, the first person they met was Dion, and with <lb/>
            tears in their eyes they told him of the misfortunes <lb/>
            which had befallen the Syracusans. Soon some of the <lb/>
            citizens of Leontini fell in with them, and many of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians gathered round Dion, suspecting from the <lb/>
            earnest and supplicatory tones and gestures of the <lb/>
            ambassadors that something important had happened. <lb/>
            Dion at once led the way to the public assembly, where all <lb/>
            the people soon met together. Archonides and Hellanikus <lb/>
            in a few words informed them of the great misfortune <lb/>
            which had befallen the Syracusans, and besought the <note type="footnote"> * The Syracusan cavalry was celebrated, and “the knights " here <lb/>
            and elsewhere no doubt means Syracusan citizens, though at first this <lb/>
            passage looks as if strangers were meant. See oh. 4-1, where the <lb/>
            knights and leading citizens are mentioned together. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            stranger mercenaries to help them and Lot to bear malice <lb/>
            for the treatment which they had received, since the <lb/>
            Syracusans had been more terribly punished for their <lb/>
            misconduct than even the soldiers could have wished them <lb/>
            to be.</p>
          <p>XLIII. After they had ceased speaking, there was a <lb/>
            great silence; and when Dion rose and began to speak, <lb/>
            tears choked his utterance. The Peloponnesians en­ <lb/>
            couraged him, and showed sympathy with him, and at <lb/>
            length he mastered his emotion and said : “Men of Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus and Allies, I have assembled you here to de­ <lb/>
            liberate about your own affairs. As for myself, I cannot <lb/>
            with honour deliberate while Syracuse is being destroyed, <lb/>
            but if I cannot save my country, I will share her ruin and <lb/>
            make her flames my own funeral pyre. As for you, if <lb/>
            you can bring yourselves even now, after all that has passed, <lb/>
            to help us, the most ill-advised and the most ill-fated of <lb/>
            men, restore again by your own means alone the city of <lb/>
            Syracuse. But if you hate the Syracusans and reject their <lb/>
            appeal, then may you be rewarded by heaven for your <lb/>
            former brave conduct and loyalty to me, and may you <lb/>
            remember Dion, who would not desert you when you were <lb/>
            wronged, and would not afterwards desert his fellow- <lb/>
            countrymen when they were in trouble." While Dion <lb/>
            was still speaking, the Peloponnesians leaped up with a <lb/>
            shout, bidding him lead them as quickly as possible to <lb/>
            the rescue, and the ambassadors from Syracuse embraced <lb/>
            him, calling upon heavan to bless both him and the <lb/>
            troops. When order was restored, Dion immediately began <lb/>
            to prepare for the march, and ordered his men to go and <lb/>
            eat their dinners at once, and then to assemble under arms <lb/>
            in that very place; for he intended to march to Syracuse <lb/>
            by night.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Meanwhile at Syracuse the generals of Dionysius <lb/>
            worked great ruin in the city while it was day, but when <lb/>
            darkness came on retired into the citadel, having lost but <lb/>
            few men. The popular leaders now took courage, and, <lb/>
            expecting that the enemy would attempt nothing further, <lb/>
            again called upon the people to have nothing to do with <lb/>
            Dion, and, if he came with his foreign troops, not to admit <lb/>
            him into the city and own themselves inferior to his men <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            in courage, but to reconquer their city and their liberty <lb/>
            by their own exertions. More embassies were now sent <lb/>
            to Dion, from the generals dissuading him from coming, <lb/>
            and from the knights and leading citizens entreating him <lb/>
            to come quickly. This caused him to march more slowly, <lb/>
            yet with greater determination. When day broke, the <lb/>
            party opposed to Dion occupied the gates, in order to shut <lb/>
            him out of the city, while Nypsius a second time led out <lb/>
            the mercenaries from the citadel, in greater numbers and <lb/>
            far more confident than before. He at once levelled to the <lb/>
            ground the whole of the works by which the citadel was <lb/>
            cut off from the main land, and overran and pillaged the <lb/>
            city. No longer men alone, but even women and children <lb/>
            were slaughtered, and property of every kind mercilessly <lb/>
            destroyed; for Dionysius, who now despaired of ultimate <lb/>
            success, and bitterly hated the Syracusans, wished only, as <lb/>
            it were, to bury the monarchy in the ruins of the city. <lb/>
            In order to effect their purpose before Dion could come tc <lb/>
            the rescue, the soldiers destroyed the houses in the quickest <lb/>
            way by setting them on fire, using torches for those near <lb/>
            at hand, and shooting fiery arrows to those at a distance. <lb/>
            As the Syracusans fled from their burning dwellings, some <lb/>
            were caught and butchered in the streets, while others <lb/>
            who took refuge in the houses perished in the flames, as <lb/>
            now a large number of houses were burning, and kept <lb/>
            falling upon the passers by.</p>
          <p>XLV. This misfortune more than anything else caused <lb/>
            all to be unanimous in opening the gates to Dion. He had <lb/>
            been marching slowly, as he heard that the enemy were <lb/>
            shut up in the citadel; but as the day went on, at first <lb/>
            some of the knights rode up to him and told him of the <lb/>
            second occupation of the city; and afterwards some even <lb/>
            of the opposite faction arrived and begged him to hasten <lb/>
            his march. As the danger became more pressing, Hera­ <lb/>
            kleides sent first his brother, and afterwards his uncle <lb/>
            Theodotus, to beseech Dion to assist them, and to tell him <lb/>
            that no one any longer could offer any resistance, that <lb/>
            Herakleides himself was wounded, and that the whole city <lb/>
            was within a little of being totally ruined and burned. <lb/>
            When these messages reached Dion he was still sixty <lb/>
            stadia distant from the gates of Syracuse. He explained <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            to his troops the danger the city was in, spoke some words <lb/>
            of encouragement to them, and then led them on, no longer <lb/>
            at a walk, but at a run, while messenger after messenger <lb/>
            continued to meet them and urge them to haste. At the <lb/>
            head of his mercenaries, who displayed extraordinary <lb/>
            speed and spirit, Dion made his way through the gates <lb/>
            of Syracuse to the place called Hekatompedon. He at <lb/>
            once sent his light-armed troops to attack the enemy, and <lb/>
            to encourage the Syracusans by their presence, while he <lb/>
            himself formed his own heavy infantry, and those of the <lb/>
            citizens who rallied round him in separate columns under <lb/>
            several commanders, in order to create greater terror by <lb/>
            attacking the enemy at many points at once.</p>
          <p>XLVI. When, after making these preparations, and <lb/>
            offering prayer to the gods, he was beheld leading his <lb/>
            troops through the city to attack the enemy, the Syracusans <lb/>
            raised a shout of joy, with a confused murmur of prayers, <lb/>
            entreaties and congratulations, addressing Dion as their <lb/>
            saviour and their tutelary god, and calling the foreign <lb/>
            soldiers their brethren and fellow-citizens. All of them, <lb/>
            even the most selfish and cowardly, now appeared to hold <lb/>
            Dion's life dearer than his own or that of his fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            as they saw him lead the way to danger through blood and <lb/>
            fire, and over the corpses which lay in heaps in the streets. <lb/>
            The enemy, too, presented a formidable appearance, for they <lb/>
            were exasperated to fury, and had established themselves <lb/>
            in a strong position, hard even to approach, amidst the <lb/>
            ruins of the rampart by which the citadel had been cut off <lb/>
            from the town ; while the progress of the mercenary troops <lb/>
            was rendered difficult and dangerous by the flames of the <lb/>
            burning houses by which they were surrounded. They <lb/>
            were forced to leap over heaps of blazing beams, and to <lb/>
            run from under great masses of falling ruins, struggling <lb/>
            forwards through thick smoke and choking dust, and yet <lb/>
            striving to keep their ranks unbroken. When at length <lb/>
            they reached the enemy, only a few could fight on either <lb/>
            side, because of the narrowness of the path, but the <lb/>
            Syracusans, pushing confidently forward with loud shouts, <lb/>
            forced the troops of Nypsius to give way. Most of them <lb/>
            escaped into the citadel, which was close at hand : but all <lb/>
            the stragglers who were left outside, were pursued and <lb/>
            put to death by the Peloponnesians. The Syracusans <note type="footnote">2 C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            could not spare any time to enjoy their victory and to <lb/>
            congratulate one another after such great successes, but <lb/>
            betook themselves at once to extinguishing their burning <lb/>
            houses, and with great exertions put out the fire during <lb/>
            the night.</p>
          <p>XLVII. As soon as day broke, all the popular leaders, <lb/>
            conscious of their guilt, left the city, with the exception <lb/>
            of Herakleides and Theodotus, who went of their own <lb/>
            accord and delivered themselves up to Dion, admitting <lb/>
            that they had done wrong, and begging that he would <lb/>
            treat them better than they had treated him. They pointed <lb/>
            out, also, how much he would enhance the lustre of his <lb/>
            other incomparable virtues by showing himself superior <lb/>
            even in the matter of temper to those by whom he had <lb/>
            been wronged, who now came before him admitting that <lb/>
            in their rivalry with him they had been overcome by his <lb/>
            virtue. When Herakleides and his companion thus threw <lb/>
            themselves upon the mercy of Dion, his friends advised <lb/>
            him not to spare such envious and malignant wretches, <lb/>
            but to deliver up Herakleides to his soldiers, and thus to <lb/>
            put an end to mob rule, an evil quite as pestilent as <lb/>
            despotism itself. Dion, however, calmed their anger, <lb/>
            observing that other generals spent most of their time in <lb/>
            practising war and the use of arms; but that he, during <lb/>
            his long sojourn in the Academy, had learned to subdue <lb/>
            his passions, and to show himself superior to jealousy of <lb/>
            his rivals. True greatness of mind, he said, could be <lb/>
            better shown by forgiving those by whom one has been <lb/>
            wronged, than by doing good to one's friends and bene­ <lb/>
            factors ; and he desired not so much to excel Herakleides <lb/>
            in power and generalship, as in clemency and justice, the <lb/>
            only qualities which are truly good: for our successes in <lb/>
            War, even if won by ourselves alone, yet can only be won <lb/>
            by the aid of Fortune. “If," he continued, " Herakleides <lb/>
            be jealous, treacherous and base, that is no reason for Dion <lb/>
            to stain his glory by yielding to his anger; for though to <lb/>
            revenge a wrong is held to be less culpable than to <lb/>
            commit one, yet both alike spring from the weakness of <lb/>
            human nature: while even though a man be wicked, yet <lb/>
            he is seldom so hopelessly depraved as not to be touched <lb/>
            by one who repeatedly returns good for evil."</p>
          <p>XLVIIL After expressing himself thus, Dion released <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            Herakleides. He next turned his attention to the fortifi­ <lb/>
            cation by which the citadel was cut off, and ordered each <lb/>
            Syracusan to cut a stake and bring it to the spot. He <lb/>
            allowed the citizens to rest during the night, but kept his <lb/>
            mercenary soldiers at work, and by the next morning had <lb/>
            completed the palisade, so that both the enemy and his own <lb/>
            countrymen were astonished at the speed with which he <lb/>
            had accomplished so great a work. He now buried the <lb/>
            corpses of those citizens who had fallen in the battle, <lb/>
            ransomed the prisoners, who amounted to no less <lb/>
            than two thousand, and summoned an assembly, in which <lb/>
            Herakleides proposed that Dion should be appointed <lb/>
            absolute commander by land and by sea. All the better <lb/>
            citizens approved of this, and wished it to be put to the <lb/>
            vote, but it was thrown out by the interference of the mob <lb/>
            of sailors and people of the lower classes, who were sorry <lb/>
            that Herakleides had lost his post as admiral, and who <lb/>
            thought that, although he might be worthless in all other <lb/>
            respects, he was at any rate more of a friend to the people <lb/>
            than Dion, and more easily managed by them. Dion con­ <lb/>
            ceded so much to them as to give Herakleides command of <lb/>
            the fleet, but vexed them much by opposing their plans <lb/>
            for a redistribution of land and houses, and by declaring <lb/>
            void all that they had decided upon this subject. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence of this Herakleides, who at once entered upon his <lb/>
            office of admiral, sailed to Messenia, and there by his <lb/>
            harangues excited the sailors and soldiers under his <lb/>
            command to mutiny against Dion, who, he declared, <lb/>
            intended to make himself despot of Syracuse; while he, in <lb/>
            the meanwhile, entered upon negotiations with Dionysius <lb/>
            by means of the Spartan Pharax. When this was dis­ <lb/>
            covered by the Syracusan nobility, a violent quarrel arose <lb/>
            in his camp, which led to the people of Syracuse being <lb/>
            reduced to great want and scarcity, so that Dion was at <lb/>
            his wit's end, and was bitterly reproached by his friends <lb/>
            for having placed such an unmanageable and villainous <lb/>
            rival as Herakleides in possession of power which he used <lb/>
            against his benefactor.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Pharax was now encamped at Neapolis, in the <lb/>
            territory of Agrigentum, and Dion, who led out the <lb/>
            Syracusans to oppose him, wished to defer an engagement; <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            but Herakleides and the sailors overwhelmed him with <lb/>
            their clamour, saying that he did not wish to bring the <lb/>
            war to an end by a battle, but to keep it constantly going <lb/>
            on in order that he might remain the longer in command. <lb/>
            He therefore fought and was beaten. The defeat was not <lb/>
            a disastrous one, but was due more to the confusion pro­ <lb/>
            duced by the quarrels of his own men than to the enemy. <lb/>
            Dion therefore prepared to renew the engagement, drew <lb/>
            out his men in battle array, and addressed them in en­ <lb/>
            couraging terms. Towards evening, however, he heard <lb/>
            that Herakleides had weighed anchor and sailed away to <lb/>
            Syracuse with the fleet, with the intention of seizing the <lb/>
            city and shutting its gates against Dion and the army. <lb/>
            Dion at once took the strongest and bravest men with him, <lb/>
            and rode all night, reaching the gates of Syracuse about <lb/>
            the third hour of the next day, after a journey of seven <lb/>
            hundred stadia. Herakleides, who in spite of the exer­ <lb/>
            tions of his fleet was beaten in the race, was at a loss what <lb/>
            to do, and sailed away aimlessly. He chanced to fall in <lb/>
            with the Spartan Gæsylus, who informed him that he was <lb/>
            coming from Lacedæmon to take command of the Sicilian <lb/>
            Greeks, as Gylippus had done in former times. Hera­ <lb/>
            kleides was delighted at having met this man, and <lb/>
            displayed him to his troops, boasting that he had found a <lb/>
            counterpoise to the power of Dion. He at once sent a <lb/>
            herald to Syracuse, and ordered the citizens to receive the <lb/>
            Spartan as their ruler. When Dion answered that the <lb/>
            Syracusans had rulers enough, and that in case they should <lb/>
            require a Spartan to command them, he himself was a <lb/>
            Spartan by adoption, Gæsylus gave up all claims to com­ <lb/>
            mand, but went to Dion and reconciled Herakleides to him, <lb/>
            making Herakleides swear the greatest oaths and give the <lb/>
            strongest pledges for his future good behaviour, while <lb/>
            Gæsylus himself swore that he would avenge Dion and <lb/>
            punish Herakleides in case the latter should misconduct <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>L. After this the Syracusans disbanded their navy, <lb/>
            which was quite useless; besides being very expensive to <lb/>
            the crews, and giving opportunities for the formation of <lb/>
            plots against the government; but they continued the <lb/>
            siege of the citadel, and thoroughly completed the wall <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            across the isthmus. As no assistance arrived for the <lb/>
            besieged, while their provisions began to fail, and their <lb/>
            troops became inclined to mutiny, the son of Dionysius <lb/>
            despaired of success, arranged terms of capitulation with <lb/>
            Dion, handed over the citadel to him together with all the <lb/>
            arms and other war material which it contained, and <lb/>
            himself, taking his mother and sisters and their property <lb/>
            on board of five triremes, sailed away to his father. Dion <lb/>
            permitted him to leave in safety, and his departure was <lb/>
            witnessed by every one of the Syracusans, who even called <lb/>
            upon the names of those who were absent, and were <lb/>
            unable to see this day when the sun rose upon a free <lb/>
            Syracuse. Indeed the downfall of Dionysius is one of the <lb/>
            most remarkable instances of the vicissitudes of fortune <lb/>
            known in history; and what then must we suppose was the <lb/>
            joy and pride of the Syracusans, when they reflected that <lb/>
            with such slender means they had overthrown the most <lb/>
            powerful dynasty at that time existing in the world ?</p>
          <p>LI. After Apollokrates had sailed away and Dion had <lb/>
            entered the citadel, the women could endure no longer to <lb/>
            wait indoors till he came to them, but ran to the gates, <lb/>
            Aristomache leading Dion's son, and Arete following <lb/>
            behind her in tears, and at a loss to know how she should <lb/>
            greet her husband after she had been married to an­ <lb/>
            other. After Dion had embraced his sister and his child, <lb/>
            Aristomache led Arete forward, and said, “Dion, we were <lb/>
            unhappy while you were an exile; but now that you have <lb/>
            returned and conquered you have taken away our reproach <lb/>
            from all but Arete here, whom I have had the misery to <lb/>
            see forced to accept another husband while you were <lb/>
            yet alive. Now, therefore, since fortune has placed us in <lb/>
            your power, how do you propose to settle this difficulty ? <lb/>
            Is she to embrace you as her uncle or as her husband <lb/>
            also ? " Dion shed tears at these words of Aristomache, <lb/>
            and affectionately embraced his wife. He placed his son <lb/>
            in her hands, and bade her go to his own house, where he <lb/>
            himself also continued to live; for he delivered up the <lb/>
            citadel to the people of Syracuse.</p>
          <p>LII. After he had thus accomplished his enterprise, he <lb/>
            reaped no advantage from his success, except that he con­ <lb/>
            ferred favours on his friends and rewarded his allies; <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            while he bestowed upon his own companions, both Syra. <lb/>
            cusan and Peloponnesian, such signal marks of his grati­ <lb/>
            tude that his generosity even outran his means. He <lb/>
            himself continued to live simply and frugally, while not <lb/>
            only Sicily and Carthage, but all Greece viewed with <lb/>
            admiration the manner in which he bore his prosperity, <lb/>
            considering his achievements to be the greatest, and <lb/>
            himself to be the most splendid instance of successful <lb/>
            daring known to that age. He remained as modest in his <lb/>
            dress, his household, and his table, as though he were <lb/>
            still the guest of Plato in the Academy, and not living <lb/>
            among mercenary soldiers, who recompense themselves for <lb/>
            the hardships and dangers of their lives by daily indul­ <lb/>
            gence in sensual pleasures. Plato wrote a letter to him, in <lb/>
            which he informed him that the eyes of all the world were <lb/>
            fixed upon him; but Plato probably only alluded to one <lb/>
            place in one city, namely the Academy, and meant that the <lb/>
            critics and judges of Dion therein assembled did not admire <lb/>
            his exertions or his victory, but only considered whether <lb/>
            he bore himself discreetly and modestly in his success, <lb/>
            and showed moderation now that he was all-powerful, <lb/>
            Dion made a point of maintaining the same haughty de­ <lb/>
            meanour in society, and of treating the people with the <lb/>
            same severity as before, although the times demanded <lb/>
            that he should unbend, and though Plato, as we have <lb/>
            said before, wrote to him bidding him remember that an <lb/>
            arrogant temper is the consort of a lonely life. However, <lb/>
            Dion appears to have been naturally inclined to harshness, <lb/>
            and besides was desirous of reforming the manners of the <lb/>
            Syracusans, who were excessively licentious and corrupt.</p>
          <p>LIII. Now Herakleides again opposed him. When <lb/>
            Dion sent for him to attend at the council, he refused to <lb/>
            come, declaring that he was a mere private man, and <lb/>
            would go only to the public assembly with the other <lb/>
            citizens. Next he reproached Dion for not having de­ <lb/>
            molished the citadel, for having restrained the people when <lb/>
            they wished to break open the tomb of Dionysius (the <lb/>
            elder) and cast out his body, and for having insulted his <lb/>
            own fellow-countrymen by sending to Corinth for coun­ <lb/>
            sellors and colleagues. Indeed, Dion had sent to Corinth <lb/>
            for some commissioners from that city, hoping that their <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            presence would assist him in effecting the reforms which <lb/>
            he meditated. Like Plato, he regarded a pure democracy <lb/>
            as not being a government at all, but rather a warehouse <lb/>
            of all forms of government: and his intention was to <lb/>
            establish a constitution, somewhat on the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            or Cretan model, by a judicious combination of monarchy <lb/>
            and oligarchy: and he saw that the government of Corinth <lb/>
            was more of an oligarchy than a democracy, and that few <lb/>
            important measures were submitted to the people. As <lb/>
            Dion expected that Herakleides would most vehemently <lb/>
            oppose these projects, and was moreover a turbulent, fickle, <lb/>
            and facetious personage, he gave him up to those who had <lb/>
            long before desired to kill him, but whom he had formerly <lb/>
            restrained from doing so. These men broke into the house <lb/>
            of Herakleides and killed him. The Syracusans were <lb/>
            deeply grieved at his death; yet, as Dion gave him a <lb/>
            splendid funeral, followed the corpse at the head of his <lb/>
            army, and afterwards made a speech to the people, they <lb/>
            forgave him, reflecting that their city could never have <lb/>
            obtained rest while Dion and Herakleides were both <lb/>
            engaged in political life.</p>
          <p>LIV. One of Dion's companions was an Athenian named <lb/>
            Kallippus, who, we are told by Plato, became intimate with <lb/>
            him, not because of his learning, but because he happened <lb/>
            to have initiated Dion into some religious mysteries. <lb/>
            This man took part in Dion's expedition, and received <lb/>
            especial honours, being the first of all Dion's comrades <lb/>
            who marched into Syracuse with him, wearing a garland <lb/>
            on his head, and he had always distinguished himself in <lb/>
            the combats which took place since that time. Now, <lb/>
            seeing that the noblest and best of Dion's friends had <lb/>
            fallen in the war, and that by the death of Herakleides the <lb/>
            Syracusan people were deprived of their leader, while he <lb/>
            had greater influence than any one else with Dion's <lb/>
            mercenary soldiers, Kallippus conceived a scheme of detest­ <lb/>
            able villainy. No doubt he hoped to obtain the whole of <lb/>
            Sicily as his reward for murdering Dion, though some <lb/>
            writers state that he received a bribe of twenty talents <lb/>
            from Dion's personal enemies. He now drew several of <lb/>
            the mercenary soldiers into a conspiracy against Dion, <lb/>
            conducting his plot in a most ingenious and treacherous <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            manner. He was in the habit of informing Dion of any <lb/>
            treasonable speeches, whether true or invented by himself, <lb/>
            which he said that he had heard from the mercenary troops, <lb/>
            and by this means gained such entire confidence with him, <lb/>
            that he was able to hold secret meetings and plot against <lb/>
            Dion with whichever of the soldiers he pleased, having <lb/>
            Dion's express command to do so, in order that none of the <lb/>
            disaffected party might escape his notice. By this means <lb/>
            Kallippus was easily enabled to find out all the worst and <lb/>
            most discontented of the mercenaries, and to organise a <lb/>
            conspiracy amongst them; while, if any man refused to <lb/>
            listen to his proposals and denounced him to Dion, he took <lb/>
            no heed of it and showed no anger, believing that Kallippus <lb/>
            was merely carrying out his own instructions.</p>
          <p>LV. When the plot was formed, Dion beheld a great <lb/>
            and portentous vision. Late in the evening he was sitting <lb/>
            alone in the hall * of his house, plunged in thought. Sud­ <lb/>
            denly he heard a noise on the other side of the court, and, <lb/>
            looking up, as it was not quite dark, saw a tall woman, <lb/>
            with the face and dress of a Fury as represented upon the <lb/>
            stage, sweeping the house with a kind of broom. He was <lb/>
            terribly startled, and became so much alarmed that he <lb/>
            sent for his friends, described the vision to them, and be­ <lb/>
            sought them to remain with him during the night, as he <lb/>
            was beside himself with fright, and dreaded lest if he <lb/>
            were alone the apparition might return. This, however, <lb/>
            did not take place. A few days after this his son, now <lb/>
            almost grown up, took offence at some trifling affront, and <lb/>
            destroyed himself by throwing himself headlong from the <lb/>
            roof of the house.</p>
          <p>LVI. While Dion was thus alarmed and distressed, Kal­ <lb/>
            lippus all the more eagerly carried out his plot. He spread <lb/>
            a rumour among the Syracusans that Dion, being childless, <lb/>
            had determined to recall Apollokrates, the son of Diony­ <note type="footnote"> * I conceive that the " atrium " or " cavædium It of the house, that <lb/>
            is, the interior peristyle or court surrounded with columns, is meant, <lb/>
            and that Dion, sitting on one side of this room, saw the apparition <lb/>
            behind the columns on the other. An outside portico was a very <lb/>
            unusual appendage to a Greek house, and Dion's house is said to have <lb/>
            been especially simple and unpretending, whereas nearly all houses <lb/>
            were built with an inner court or " patio," with its roof supported by <lb/>
            columns, and into which the other rooms of the house opened. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            sins, and to make him his heir, since he was his wife'is <lb/>
            nephew, and his sister's grandson. By this time Dion <lb/>
            and the women of his household began to entertain some <lb/>
            suspicion of the plot, and information of it reached them <lb/>
            from all quarters. Dion, however, grieved at the murder <lb/>
            of Herakleides, as though that crime had stained his glory, <lb/>
            had become low-spirited and miserable, and frequently <lb/>
            said that he was willing to die, and would let any man <lb/>
            cut his throat, if he were obliged to live amidst constant <lb/>
            precautions against his friends as well as his enemies. <lb/>
            Kallippus, who perceived that the women had discovered <lb/>
            the whole plot, came to them in great alarm, denying that <lb/>
            he bad any share in it, shedding tears, and offering to give <lb/>
            any pledge of his loyalty which they chose to ask for. <lb/>
            They demanded that he should swear the great oath, <lb/>
            which is as follows :-The person who is about to swear <lb/>
            enters the precinct of the temple of Demeter and Perse­ <lb/>
            phone, and after certain religious ceremonies puts on the <lb/>
            purple robe of the goddess Persephone, and swears, hold­ <lb/>
            ing a lighted torch in his hand. All this was done by <lb/>
            Kallippus, and after swearing the oath he was impious <lb/>
            enough to wait for the festival of the goddess whose name <lb/>
            he had taken in vain, and to commit the murder on the <lb/>
            day which was specially dedicated to her, although, perhaps, <lb/>
            he thought nothing about the profanation of that particu­ <lb/>
            lar day, but considered that it would be wickedness enough <lb/>
            to murder the man whom he had himself initiated into <lb/>
            the mysteries, on whatever day he might do it.</p>
          <p>LVII. Many were now in the plot; and when Dion was <lb/>
            sitting with his friends in a room furnished with several <lb/>
            couches, some of the conspirators surrounded the house, <lb/>
            while others stood at the doors and windows. Those who <lb/>
            intended to do the deed were Zakynthians, and entered <lb/>
            the house in their tunics, without swords. Those who <lb/>
            remained outside made fast the doors, while those within <lb/>
            rushed upon Dion, and endeavoured to strangle him. As, <lb/>
            however, they could not accomplish this, they asked for a <lb/>
            sword; but no one ventured to open the doors, because <lb/>
            within the house were many of Dion's friends, but as <lb/>
            each of these imagined that, if he gave up Dion, he <lb/>
            himself might get away safe, no one would help him. <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            After some delay, a Syracusan, named Lykon, handed <lb/>
            a dagger through a window to the Zakynthians, with <lb/>
            which, as if sacrificing a victim, they cut the throat of <lb/>
            Dion, who bad long before been overpowered and had <lb/>
            given himself up for lost. His sister and his wife, who <lb/>
            was pregnant, were at once cast into prison, where the <lb/>
            unhappy woman was delivered of a male child. The <lb/>
            women prevailed upon the keepers of the prison to spare <lb/>
            the child's life, and obtained their request the more readily <lb/>
            because Kallippus was already in difficulties.</p>
          <p>LVIII. After Kallippus had murdered Dion, he at once <lb/>
            became a person of importance, and had the entire govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Syracuse in his hands. He even sent despatches <lb/>
            to Athens, a city which, next to the gods, he ought espe­ <lb/>
            cially to have dreaded, after having brought such pollu­ <lb/>
            tion and sacrilege upon himself. However, the saying <lb/>
            appears to be true, that that city produces both the best <lb/>
            of good and the worst of wicked men, just as the territory <lb/>
            of Athens produces both the sweetest honey and the most <lb/>
            poisonous hemlock. Kallippus did not long survive to <lb/>
            mock the justice of heaven, lest the gods might have been <lb/>
            thought to disregard a man who, by such a crime, had <lb/>
            obtained so great wealth and power; but he soon paid the <lb/>
            penalty of his wickedness. He set out to capture Katana, <lb/>
            and in doing so lost Syracuse; upon which he is said to <lb/>
            have remarked, that he had lost a city and gained a <lb/>
            cheese-scraper. In an attack upon Messenia he lost most <lb/>
            of his soldiers, among whom were the murderers of Dion. <lb/>
            As no city in Sicily would receive him, but all hated him <lb/>
            and attacked him, he proceeded to Rhegium, where, as <lb/>
            ho was quite ruined and could no longer maintain his <lb/>
            mercenary soldiers, he was murdered by Leptines and <lb/>
            Polyperchon, who chanced to use the self-same dagger <lb/>
            with which Dion is said to have been slain. It was recog­ <lb/>
            nised by being very short, after the Laconian fashion, and <lb/>
            by its workmanship, for it was admirably carved with <lb/>
            figures in high relief. Such was the retribution which <lb/>
            betel Kallippus; while Aristomache and Arete, when they <lb/>
            were released from prison, fell into the power of Hiketes, <lb/>
            a Syracusan, who had been one of Dion's friends, and who <lb/>
            treated them at first loyally and honourably, but after­ <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            wards, at the instigation of some of the enemies of Dion, <lb/>
            sent them on board of a ship, on the pretext of sending <lb/>
            them to Peloponnesus, and gave orders to the people of <lb/>
            the ship to put them to death and throw their bodies into <lb/>
            the sea. They, however, are said to have thrown them <lb/>
            alive into the sea, and the child with them. This man <lb/>
            also paid a fitting penalty for his crimes, for he was taken <lb/>
            and put to death by Timoleon, and the Syracusans put to <lb/>
            death his two daughters to avenge the murder of Dion. <lb/>
            All of this I have already described at length in the Life <lb/>
            of Timoleon.</p><pb n="398"/>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF BRUTUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. The ancestor of Marcus Brutus was Junius Brutus,* <lb/>
            whose statue of bronze the Romans of old set up in the <lb/>
            Capitol, in the midst of the kings, with a drawn sword in <lb/>
            his hand, thereby signifying that it was he who completely <lb/>
            accomplished the putting down of the Tarquinii. Now <lb/>
            that Brutus, like swords forged of cold iron, having a <lb/>
            temper naturally hard and not softened by education, was <lb/>
            carried on even to slaying of his sons through his passion <lb/>
            against the tyrants: but this Brutus, about whom I am <lb/>
            now writing, having tempered his natural disposition with <lb/>
            discipline and philosophical training and roused his earnest <lb/>
            and mild character by impulse to action, is considered to <lb/>
            have been most aptly fashioned to virtue, so that even <lb/>
            those who were his enemies on account of the conspiracy <lb/>
            against Cæsar, attributed to Brutus whatever of good the <lb/>
            act brought with it, and the worst of what happened they <lb/>
            imputed to Cassius, who was a kinsman and friend of <lb/>
            Brutus, but in his disposition not so simple and pure. <lb/>
            His mother Servilia t traced her descent from Ala <note type="footnote"> * L. Junius Brutus, consul B.C. 509, was a Patrician, and his race <lb/>
            was extinct in his two sons (Liv. ii. 1-4; Drumann, Junii, p. 1; Dion <lb/>
            Cassius, xliv. 12 ; Dionys. Hal. Antiq. Rom. v. 18). </note><note type="footnote"> t Servilia, the wife of M. Junius Brutus, the futher of this Brutus, <lb/>
            was the daughter of Livia, who was the sister of M. Livius Drusus, <lb/>
            tribunus plebis B.C. 91. Livia married for her first husband M. Cato, <lb/>
            by whom alie had M. Cato Uticensis; for her second husband she had <lb/>
            Q. Servilius Cæpio, by whom she became the mother of Servilia. <lb/>
            M. Junius Brutus, the father of this Brutus, was the first husband of <lb/>
            Servilia, who had by her second husband, D. Junius Silanus, two <lb/>
            daughters. Her son Brutus was born in the autumn of B.C. 85. He <lb/>
            was adopted by his uncle Q. Servilius Cæpio, wl.ence he is sometimes <lb/>
            called Cæpio, and Q. Cæpio Brutus on coins, public monuments, and <lb/>
            in decrees (Drumann. Junii). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            Servilius,* who when Mallius Spurius was contriving to <lb/>
            establish a tyranny and was stirring up the people, put a <lb/>
            dagger under his arm, and going into the Forum and taking <lb/>
            his stand close to the man, as if he were going to have <lb/>
            something to do with him and to address him, struck him <lb/>
            as he bent forwards and killed him. Now this is agreed <lb/>
            on; but those who showed hatred and enmity towards <lb/>
            Brutus on account of Caesar's death, say that on the father's <lb/>
            side he was not descended from the expeller of the <lb/>
            Tarquinii, for that Brutus after putting his sons to death <lb/>
            left no descendants, but this Brutus was a plebeian, the son <lb/>
            of one Brutus who was a bailiff, † and had only recently <lb/>
            attained to a magistracy. Poseidonius the philosopher says <lb/>
            that the sons of Brutus, who had arrived at man's estate, <lb/>
            were put to death as the story is told, but there was left a <lb/>
            third, an infant, from whom the race of Brutus descended; <lb/>
            and that some of the illustrious men of his time who be­ <lb/>
            longed to the family showed a personal resemblance to the <lb/>
            statue of Brutus. So much about this.</p>
          <p>II. Servilia the mother of Brutus was a sister of Cato <lb/>
            the philosopher, whom most of all the Romans this Brutus <lb/>
            took for his model, Cato being his uncle and afterwards <lb/>
            his father-in-law. As to the Greek philosophers, there <lb/>
            was not one, so to say, whom he did not hear or to whom <lb/>
            he was averse, but he devoted himself especially to those <lb/>
            of Plato's school The Academy ‡ called the Now and the <lb/>
            Middle he was not much disposed to, and he attached <lb/>
            himself to the Old, and continued to be an admirer of <lb/>
            Antiochus § of Ascalon; but for his friend and companion he <lb/>
            chose Antiochus's brother Aristus, a man who in his manner <lb/>
            of discourse was inferior to many philosophers, but in well­ <lb/>
            regulated habits and mildness a rival to the first. <lb/>
            Empylus,∥ whom both Brutus in his letters and his friends <note type="footnote"> * Ahala was Magister Equitum to L. Quinctius Cincinnatus. The <lb/>
            story belongs to B.O. 439; and it is told by Livius, iv. IS, 14. The <lb/>
            true name of Mallius Spurius is Spurius Mælius. </note><note type="footnote"> t This passage is obscure in the original. The parentage of M. <lb/>

            often mentioned as being in intimacy with him, was a <lb/>
            rhetorician and left a small work, though not a mean one, <lb/>
            on the assassination of Cæsar, which is inscribed Brutus. <lb/>
            In the Latin language Brutus was sufficiently trained for <lb/>
            oratory * and the contests of the forum; but in the Greek, <lb/>
            he practised the apophthegmatic and Laconic brevity <lb/>
            which is sometimes conspicuous in his letters. For <lb/>
            instance when he was now engaged in the war, he wrote <lb/>
            to the people of Pergamum : " I hear that you have given <lb/>
            money to Dolabella; if you gave it willingly, you admit <lb/>
            your wrong; if you gave it unwillingly, make proof of <lb/>
            this by giving to me willingly !" On another occasion, to <lb/>
            the Samians: " Your counsels are trifling; your help is <lb/>
            slow. What end do you expect of this ?" And another <lb/>
            about the people of Patara : " The Xanthians by reject­ <lb/>
            ing my favours have made their country the tomb of their <lb/>
            desperation. The people of Patara by trusting to me want <lb/>
            nothing of liberty in the management of their affairs. It <lb/>
            is therefore in your power also to choose the decision of the <lb/>
            people of Patara or the fortune of the Xanthians." Such <lb/>
            is the character of the most remarkable of his letters.</p>
          <p>III. While he was still a youth he went abroad with <lb/>
            his uncle Cato, who was sent to Cyprus t to Ptolemæus. <lb/>
            After Ptolemæus had put an end to himself, Cato, being <lb/>
            detained of necessity in Rhodes, happened to have sent <lb/>
            Canidius, one of his friends, to look after the money, but as <lb/>
            he feared that Canidius would not keep his hands from <lb/>
            filching, he wrote to Brutus to sail as quick as he could to <lb/>
            Cyprus from Pamphylia; for Brutus was staying there to <lb/>
            recover from an illness. Brutus sailed very much against <lb/>
            his will, both out of respect for Canidius, as being un­ <lb/>
            deservedly deprived of his functions by Cato, and inas­ <lb/>
            much as he was a young man and a student,t considering <lb/>
            such a piece of business and administration not at all <lb/>
            fit for a free man or for himself. However, he exerted <note type="footnote"> * The original is obscure. See Sintenis, note; and Schæfer, note- <lb/>

            himself about these matters and was commended by Cato; <lb/>
            and when the king's substance was converted into money, <lb/>
            he took the greatest part and sailed to Rome.</p>
          <p>IV. But when matters came to a division, Pompeius and <lb/>
            Cæsar having taken up arms, and the government being <lb/>
            in confusion, it was expected that he would choose Coesar's <lb/>
            side, for his father * was put to death by Pompeius some <lb/>
            time before; but as he thought it right to prefer the <lb/>
            public interests to his own, and as he considered the ground <lb/>
            of Pompeius for the war to be better than Cæsar's, he <lb/>
            joined Pompeius. And yet, hitherto, when he met <lb/>
            Pompeius, he would not even speak to him, thinking it a <lb/>
            great crime to talk with his father's murderer; but now, <lb/>
            placing himself under Pompeius as leader of his country, <lb/>
            he sailed to Sicily as legatus with Sestius,t who had got it <lb/>
            for his province. But as there was nothing of importance <lb/>
            to do there, and Pompeius and Cæsar had already met <lb/>
            together to contend for the supremacy, he went to <lb/>
            Macedonia as a volunteer to share the danger ; on which <lb/>
            occasion they say that Pompeius, being delighted and <lb/>
            surprised at his coming, rose from his seat and embraced <lb/>
            him as a superior man in the presence of all. During the <lb/>
            campaign all the daytime when he was not with Pompeius <lb/>
            he was employed about study and books; and not only at <lb/>
            other times, but also before the great battle. It was the <lb/>
            height of summer, and the heat was excessive, as they were <lb/>
            encamped close to marshy ground; and those who carried <lb/>
            the tent of Brutus did not come quickly. After being <lb/>
            much harassed about these matters, and having scarcely by <lb/>
            mid-day anointed himself and taken a little to eat, while <note type="footnote">* The father of this Brutus was of the faction of Marius, and <lb/>
            tribunus plebis B.C. 83. After Sulla's return he lost all power, and <lb/>
            after Sulla's death Pompeius (B.C. 77) marched against Brutus, who <lb/>
            shut himself up in Mutina (Modena). A mutiny among his troops <lb/>
            compelled him to open the gates, and Pompeius ordered him to be put <lb/>
            to death, contrary to the promise which he had given (Life of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, c. 16). </note><note type="footnote"> The allusion at the beginning of this chapter is to the outbreak <lb/>

            the rest were either sleeping or engaged in thought and <lb/>
            care about the future, he kept on writing till evening-time, <lb/>
            making an epitome of Polybius.*</p>
          <p>V. It is said that Cæsar, too, was not indifferent about <lb/>
            the man, but gave orders to those who commanded under <lb/>
            him not to kill Brutus in the battle, but to spare him; <lb/>
            and if he yielded to bring him, and if he resisted being <lb/>
            taken, to let him alone and not force him ; and this, it is <lb/>
            said, he did to please Servilia,t the mother of Brutus. <lb/>
            For when he was still a youth, he had, it seems, known <lb/>
            Servilia, who was passionately in love with him, and as <lb/>
            Brutus was born about the time when her love was most <lb/>
            ardent, he had in some degree a persuasion that Brutus <lb/>
            was his son. It is recorded that when the great affair of <lb/>
            Catilina had engaged the Senate, which affair came very <lb/>
            near overturning the State, Cato and Cæsar were standing <lb/>
            up at the same time and disputing. While this was going <lb/>
            on a small letter was brought in and given to Caesar, <lb/>
            which he read silently, whereon Cato called out that <lb/>
            Cæsar was doing a shameful thing in receiving communi­ <lb/>
            cations and letters from their enemies. Many of the <lb/>
            Senators hereon made a tumult, and Caesar gave the letter <lb/>
            just as it was to Cato, and it was a passionate letter from <lb/>
            his sister Servilia, which he read and throwing it to Cæsar <lb/>
            said, " Take it, drunkard;" and he again turned afresh to <lb/>
            his argument and his speech. So notorious was the love <lb/>
            of Servilia for Cæsar. <note type="footnote"> * Brutus was a great reader and a busy writer. Drumann (Junii, <lb/>
            p. 37) gives a sketch of his literary activity. Such a trifle as an <lb/>
            epitome of Polybius was probably only intended as a mere occupation <lb/>
            to pass the time. The loss of it is not a matter of regret, any further <lb/>
            than so far as it might have supplied some deficiencies in the present <lb/>
            text of Polybius. Bacon (Advancement of Learning) describes epi­ <lb/>
            tomes thus : " As for the corruptions and moths of history, which are <lb/>
            epitomes, the use of them deserveth to be banished, as all men of sound <lb/>
            judgment have confessed; as those that have fretted and corroded the <lb/>
            sound bodies of many excellent histories, and wrought them into base <lb/>
            and unprofitable dregs." </note><note type="footnote"> t The story of Cæsar receiving this note is told in the Life of Cato, <lb/>
            c. 24. Cæsar was born on the 12th July, B.O. 100, which is a sufficient <lb/>
            answer to the scandalous tale of his being the father of Brutus. That <lb/>
            he may have had an adulterous commerce with Servilia in and before <lb/>
            D.C. 63, the year of Catiline's conspiracy, is probable enough. </note> <pb n="403"/>
             </p>
          <p>VI. After the defeat at Pharsalus and the escape of <lb/>
            Pompeius to the sea, while the ramparts were blockaded, <lb/>
            Brutus secretly got out of the gates which led to a marshy <lb/>
            spot, full of water and reeds, and made his way by night <lb/>
            to Larissa. From thence he wrote to Cæsar, who was <lb/>
            pleased that he was alive and told him to come to him; <lb/>
            and he not only pardoned Brutus, but had him about him <lb/>
            and treated him with as much respect as any one else. <lb/>
            No one could say where Pompeius had fled to, and there <lb/>
            was much doubt about it; but Caesar walking a short <lb/>
            way alone with Brutus tried to find out his opinion on <lb/>
            the matter; and as Brutus appeared, from certain con­ <lb/>
            siderations, to have come to the best conjecture about the <lb/>
            flight of Pompeius, Cæsar leaving everything else hurried <lb/>
            to Egypt. But Pompeius, who, as Brutus conjectured, had <lb/>
            landed in Egypt, met his fate there; and Brutus mollified <lb/>
            Cæsar even towards Cassius.* When Brutus was speaking <lb/>
            in defence of the King of the Libyans,† he felt himself <lb/>
            overpowered by the magnitude of the charges against him, <lb/>
            but yet by his prayers and urgent entreaties he preserved <lb/>
            for him a large part of his dominions. Cæsar is said, <lb/>
            when he first heard Brutus speaking, to have remarked to <lb/>
            his friends : " This youth, I know not what he wills, but <lb/>
            what he does will, he wills with energy." For the earnest <lb/>
            character of Brutus, and his disposition not to listen un­ <lb/>
            advisedly nor to every one who asked a favour, but to act <lb/>
            upon reflection and principle, made his efforts strong and <lb/>
            effective towards accomplishing whatever he turned to. <lb/>
            But towards unreasonable prayers he was immovable by <lb/>
            flattery, and to be overcome by those who impudently <lb/>
            urged their suit, which some call to be shamed out of a <lb/>
            thing, he considered to be most disgraceful to a great man, <lb/>
            and he was wont to say that those who can refuse nothing, <note type="footnote"> * This was C. Cassius Longinus, who accompanied Crassus in his <lb/>

            were in his opinion persons who had not well husbanded <lb/>
            their youthful bloom. When Cæsar was going to cross <lb/>
            over to Libya against Cato and Scipio, he intrusted Brutus <lb/>
            with Gallia 0 on this side of the Alps, to the great good <lb/>
            fortune of the province; for while the other provinces, <lb/>
            through the violence and rapacity of those who were <lb/>
            intrusted with them, were harassed like conquered coun­ <lb/>
            tries, Brutus was to the Gauls a relief and consolation for <lb/>
            their former misfortunes; and he put all to Caesar's credit. <lb/>
            so that when after his return Cæsar was going about Italy, <lb/>
            the cities that had been under Brutus were a most pleasing <lb/>
            sight, as well as Brutus himself, who was increasing his <lb/>
            honour and associating with him as a friend.</p>
          <p>VII. Now there were several prætorships, but that <lb/>
            which conferred the chief dignity, and is called the Urban <lb/>
            prætorship,† it was expected that either Brutus or Cassius <lb/>
            would have; and some say that Brutus and Cassius, who <lb/>
            had before some slight causes of dispute, were still more <lb/>
            at variance about this office, though they were kinsmen, <lb/>
            for Cassius was the husband of Junta, the sister of Brutus. <lb/>
            Others say that this rivalry was the work of Cæsar, who <lb/>
            continued secretly to give both of them hopes, until, being <lb/>
            thus urged on and irritated, they were brought into <lb/>
            collision. Brutus relied on his good fame and virtues <lb/>
            against the many splendid exploits of Cassius in his <lb/>
            Parthian campaigns. Cæsar hearing this and consulting <lb/>
            with his friends said: " What Cassius says has more <lb/>
            justice, but Brutus must have the first office." Cassius <lb/>
            was appointed to another prætorship, but he had not so <lb/>
            much gratitude for what he got, as anger for what he <lb/>
            failed in getting. Brutus also shared Cæsar's power in <note type="footnote"> * This was the north part of Italy. Cæsar set out for his African <lb/>
            campaign in B.C. 47. Brutus held Gallic in the year B.C. 46. See <lb/>
            Drumann, Junii, p. 26, note 91, on the administration of Gallia by <lb/>
            Brutus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plutarch here alludes to the office of Prætor Urbanus, who, <lb/>
            duriug the year of his office, was the chief person for the administration <lb/>
            of justice. The number of prætors at this time was ten (Dion Cas­ <lb/>
            sius, xlii. 51), to which number they were increased from eight by <lb/>
            Cæsar in B.C. 47. The Prætor Urbanus still held the first rank. <lb/>
            The motive of Cæsar may have been, as Dion Cassius says, to oblige <lb/>
            his dependents by giving them office and rank. Brutus was Prætor <lb/>
            Urbanus in B.C. 44, the year of Cæsar's assassination. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            other respects as much as he chose. For if he had chosen, <lb/>
            he might have been the first of his friends and had most <lb/>
            power; but his intimacy with Cassius drew him that way <lb/>
            and turned him from Cæsar, though he had not yet been <lb/>
            reconciled to Cassius after their former rivalry; but he <lb/>
            listened to his friends who urged him not to let himself <lb/>
            be softened and soothed by Cæsar, and to fly from the <lb/>
            friendly advances and the favours which a tyrant showed <lb/>
            him, not because he respected the virtues of Brutus, but <lb/>
            because he wished to curtail his vigour and to undermine <lb/>
            his spirit.</p>
          <p>VIII. Nor yet was Cæsar altogether without suspicions <lb/>
            of Brutus, and matter of complaint against him ; he feared <lb/>
            the proud temper and the credit and friends of the man, <lb/>
            but he trusted in his moral character. In the first place, <lb/>
            when Antonius and Dolabella * were said to be aiming at <lb/>
            change, he said, it was not sleek and long-haired men who <lb/>
            gave him trouble, but those pale and lean fellows, mean­ <lb/>
            ing Brutus and Cassius. Next, when some persons were <lb/>
            making insinuations against the fidelity of Brutus and <lb/>
            urging Cæsar to be on his guard, he touched his body with <lb/>
            his hand and said, " What, think you that Brutus would <lb/>
            not wait for this poor body?" thereby intimating that <lb/>
            no person but Brutus had any pretensions to so much <lb/>
            power after himself. And indeed it seems that Brutus <lb/>
            might certainly have been the first man in the State, if he <lb/>
            could have endured for a short time to be second to Caesar, <lb/>
            and if he had let Cæsar's power pass its acme, and the <lb/>
            fame got by his great exploits waste away. But Cassius, <lb/>
            who was a violent-tempered man and rather on his indi­ <lb/>
            vidual account a hater of Cæsar than on the public account <lb/>
            a hater of the tyrant, inflamed Brutus and urged him on. <lb/>
            Brutus indeed is said to have been discontented with the <lb/>
            dominion, but Cassius to have hated the dominator; and <lb/>
            Cassius had various grievances against Cæsar and among <lb/>
            others, the seizing of the lions, which Cassius had procured <lb/>
            when he was going to be ædile, but Cæsar kept them after <lb/>
            they had been found in Megara at the time when the city <lb/>
            was taken by Calenus.t It is said that these beasts were <note type="footnote"> * This anecdote is told in Cæsar's Life, c. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> t Q. Fufius Calenus was sent by Cæsar before the battle of <lb/>
            Pharsalus to Greece (Life of Cæsar, c. 43). Megara made strong </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            the cause of great calamity to the people of Megara: for <lb/>
            when the enemy were getting possession of the city, the <lb/>
            citizens forced open their dens and loosed their chains, <lb/>
            that the beasts might oppose the enemy who were entering <lb/>
            the city, but they rushed against the citizens themselves, <lb/>
            and running among them rent those who were unarmed, <lb/>
            so that the sight moved even the enemy to pity.</p>
          <p>IX. Now they say that this was with Cassius the main <lb/>
            cause of his conspiring; but they say so untruly. For <lb/>
            there was from the beginning in the nature of Cassius a <lb/>
            certain hostility and dislike to all the race of tyrants, as <lb/>
            he showed when he was still a boy and went to the same <lb/>
            school with Faustus,* the son of Sulla. Faustus was one <lb/>
            day bragging among the boys and exalting the monarchy <lb/>
            of his father, on which Cassius got up and thumped him. <lb/>
            The guardians of Faustus and his kinsmen were desirous <lb/>
            to prosecute the matter and seek legal satisfaction; but <lb/>
            Pompeius prevented this, and bringing both the boys <lb/>
            together questioned them about the affair. Thereon it is <lb/>
            reported that Cassius said, "Come, now, Faustus, say if <lb/>
            you dare before Pompeius the words at which I was enraged, <lb/>
            that I may break your mouth again." Such was the <lb/>
            character of Cassius. But many words from his friends <lb/>
            and many oral and written expressions from the citizens <lb/>
            called and urged Brutus to the deed. For they wrote on <lb/>
            the statue of his ancestor Brutus, who had put down the <lb/>
            dominion of the kings: " Would you were here, Brutus !" <lb/>
            and "Would Brutus were now living !" And the tribunal <lb/>
            of Brutus, who was prætor, was found every morning full <lb/>
            of such writings as these: " Brutus, are you asleep ? " and <lb/>
            " You are not really Brutus !" But they who were the <lb/>
            real cause of this were the flatterers of Cæsar, who devised <lb/>
            various unpopular distinctions for him and placed diadems <lb/>
            on his statues by night, as if their design was to lead on <lb/>
            the many to salute him as king instead of dictator. But <lb/>
            the contrary was the result, as it has been circumstantially <lb/>
            told in the Life of Cæsar.† <note type="footnote"> resistance to Calenus, and was treated with severity. Dion Cassius <lb/>

          <p>X. When Caseins was trying to move his friends <lb/>
            against Cæsar, they all assented, provided Brutus would <lb/>
            take the lead; for they said that the undertaking required <lb/>
            not hands nor yet daring, but the character of a man such <lb/>
            as Brutus was, who should as it were begin the holy rite <lb/>
            and confirm it by his presence: if this could not be, the <lb/>
            conspirators would be more dispirited in the doing of the <lb/>
            deed and more timid when they had done it, for it would <lb/>
            be said that Brutus would not have rejected all share in <lb/>
            the thing, if it had a good cause. Cassius, who saw the <lb/>
            truth of this, now made the first advances to Brutus since <lb/>
            their difference. Andafter their reconciliation and friendly <lb/>
            greeting Cassius asked, if he intended to be present in the <lb/>
            Senate on the new-moon of March, for he heard that Caesar's <lb/>
            friends would then make a proposal about the kingly power. <lb/>
            Brutus replied that he would not be present. " W hat then," <lb/>
            said Cassius, " if they summon us ? " " It would be my <lb/>
            business then," said Brutus, " not to be silent, but to fight <lb/>
            and die in defence of liberty." Cassius being now en­ <lb/>
            couraged said, "What Roman will endure that you die <lb/>
            first ? Brutus, do you not know yourself? Do you think it is <lb/>
            the weavers and tavern-keepers who have written on your <lb/>
            tribunal, and not the first and best who have done this, <lb/>
            and who demand from the other prætors donations and <lb/>
            shows and gladiators, but from you, as a debt that you owe <lb/>
            your country, the destruction of the tyranny, and who are <lb/>
            ready to suffer everything for you, if you show yourself to <lb/>
            be such a man as they think you ought to be and they expect <lb/>
            you to be." Upon this he threw his arms around Brutus <lb/>
            and embraced him, and thus separating each went to his <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>XI. There was one Caius Ligarius,* a friend of Pom­ <lb/>
            peius, who had been accused on this ground aDd acquitted <lb/>
            by Caesar. This man, who had not gratitude for his <lb/>
            acquittal of the charge, but was hostile to the power by <note type="footnote">* His name was Quintus. Ligarius fought against Cæsar at the <lb/>
            battle of Thapsus B c. 46. He was taken prisoner and banished. He <lb/>
            was prosecuted by Q. Delius Tubero for his conduct in Africa, and de­ <lb/>
            fended by Cicero in an extant speech. ligarius obtained a pardon <lb/>
            from Cæsar, and he repaid the dictator, like many others, by aiding <lb/>
            in his murder. It seems pretty certain that he lost his life in the <lb/>
            proscriptions of the Triumviri (Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 22, 23). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            reason of which he had been in danger, was an enemy of <lb/>
            Cæsar, and one of the most intimate friends of Brutus. <lb/>
            Brutus, who came to see him when he was sick, said, <lb/>
            " Ligarius, at what a time you are sick! " Immediately <lb/>
            supporting himself on his elbow, and laying hold of the <lb/>
            hand of Brutus, Ligarius said, " But if you, Brutus, design <lb/>
            anything worthy of yourself, I am well."</p>
          <p>XII. After this they secretly sounded their acquaint­ <lb/>
            ance whom they trusted, and communicated the design to <lb/>
            them, and added them to their number; making choice <lb/>
            not only among their intimates, but those whom they <lb/>
            knew to be good darers and to despise death. It was for <lb/>
            this reason that they concealed their design from Cicero, <lb/>
            though both as to trustworthiness and good-will he was <lb/>
            esteemed by them among the first, lest to his natural <lb/>
            defect of courage he should join by reason of his years <lb/>
            senile caution, and so attempting by deliberation to bring <lb/>
            everything singly to perfect security, should blunt their <lb/>
            edge, which required the speed of ready action. Among <lb/>
            his other companions Brutus omitted also Statilius * the <lb/>
            Epicurean, and Favonius, an admirer of Cato, because <lb/>
            when Brutus, in conversation and philosophical disquisi­ <lb/>
            tion, had remotely and in a circuitous way sounded them <lb/>
            about such an attempt, Favonius answered that a civil war <lb/>
            was worse than an illegal monarchy; and Statilius said <lb/>
            that it was not befitting a wise man, and one who had <lb/>
            understanding, to expose himself to danger and to trouble <lb/>
            on account of the vile and foolish. Labeo,t who was pre­ <lb/>
            sent, opposed both of them. Brutus, indeed, at the time <lb/>
            kept silent, as if he considered that the matter was some­ <lb/>
            thing hard and difficult to determine; but afterwards he <lb/>
            communicated his design to Labeo. When Labeo had <lb/>
            readily accepted the proposal, it was resolved to gain over <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of the Younger Cato, c. 65, 73; and as to <lb/>
            Favonius, the same life. </note><note type="footnote"> t Q. Antistius Labeo was one of the hearers of Servius Sulpicius <lb/>
            (Dig. i. tit. 2, s. 2, § 44), and himself a jurist, and the father of a more <lb/>
            distinguished jurist, Antistius Labeo, who lived under Augustus. He <lb/>
            was at the battle of Philippi, and after the defeat he killed himself, <lb/>
            and was buried in a grave in his tent, which he had dug for the <lb/>
            purpose (Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 135). </note> <lb/>

            the othei Brutus, surnamed Albinus,* who was not a man <lb/>
            of action nor courageous, but he was strengthened by a <lb/>
            number of gladiators, whom he was keeping for a spectacle <lb/>
            for the Romans, and he was also in the confidence of Cæsar. <lb/>
            When Cassius and Labeo spoke to him he made no answer, <lb/>
            but meeting privately with Brutus, and learning that he <lb/>
            was the leader in the act, he agreed to co-operate zealously. <lb/>
            The greater part, and the men of chief note among the <lb/>
            rest of the conspirators, were also brought over by the <lb/>
            reputation of Brutus. And without swearing any mutual <lb/>
            oath, or taking or giving mutual pledges by sacrifice of <lb/>
            victims, they all so kept the secret in themselves and were <lb/>
            silent and carried it with them, that the act, though prog­ <lb/>
            nosticated by the gods through oracular answers and sights <lb/>
            and victims, was considered past belief.</p>
          <p>XIII. Brutus having now the first men in Rome, both <lb/>
            for spirit and family and virtues, dependent upon himself, <lb/>
            and having a view of the whole danger, in his public <lb/>
            demeanour endeavoured to restrain within himself and to <lb/>
            keep his designs under strict control; but at home and by <lb/>
            night he was no longer the same man, for sometimes care <lb/>
            roused him involuntarily from his sleep, and at other times <lb/>
            he was sunk in thought and brooding over the difficulties; <lb/>
            and it did not escape his wife, who was resting with him, <lb/>
            that he was full of unusual trouble, and was revolving in <lb/>
            himself some design hard to carry and difficult to unravel. <lb/>
            Now Porcia,† as it has been said, was the daughter of <lb/>
            Cato, and Brutus, who was her cousin, had married her, <lb/>
            not in her virgin state, but he took her after the death of <lb/>
            her husband, while she was still a young woman, and had <lb/>
            one little child by her husband, and the child's name was <lb/>
            Bibulus; and there is extant a small book of memoirs of <lb/>
            Brutus, written by Bibulus. Porcia, who was a philoso­ <note type="footnote">* See the Life of Cæsar, c. 64, and the note. <lb/>

            and shivering fever came upon her in consequence of the <lb/>
            wound. Brutus being agonised and full of trouble, Porcia <lb/>
            spoke to him thus in the acme of her pain: " I, Brutus, <lb/>
            Cato's daughter, was given unto thy house, not like women <lb/>
            who serve as concubines, to share thy bed and board only, <lb/>
            but to be a partner in thy happiness, and a partner in thy <lb/>
            sorrows. Now, with respect to thy marriage, everything <lb/>
            is blameless on thy part; but as to me, what evidence is <lb/>
            there, or what affection, if I must neither share with thee <lb/>
            a secret sorrow nor a care which demands confidence ? I <lb/>
            know that a woman's nature is considered too weak to <lb/>
            carry a secret, but, Brutus, there is a certain power to­ <lb/>
            wards making moral character in a good nurture and <lb/>
            honest conversation; and I am Cato's daughter and also <lb/>
            Brutus' wife, whereon hitherto I had less relied, but now <lb/>
            I know that I am also invincible to pain." Thus saying, <lb/>
            she showed him the wound, and told him of the trial she <lb/>
            had made of herself. Struck with astonishment and stretch­ <lb/>
            ing forth his hands, Brutus prayed that the gods would <lb/>
            permit him to succeed in the enterprise and to show himself <lb/>
            a husband worthy of Porcia. He then consoled his wife.</p>
          <p>XIV. When notice had been given of a meeting of the <lb/>
            Senate, at which Cæsar was expected to be present, they <lb/>
            resolved to make the attempt, for they would be then <lb/>
            collected without raising any suspicion, and they would <lb/>
            have together all the men of highest character and rank, <lb/>
            who would be ready as soon as a great act was accom­ <lb/>
            plished, forthwith to seize their freedom. The circum­ <lb/>
            stance of the place, too, was considered to be a token from <lb/>
            heaven and in their favour. For it was a portico, one <lb/>
            belonging to the theatre,. with an exhedra, in which <lb/>
            there was a statue of Pompeius, which the city erected at <note type="footnote"> * This was the great architectural work of Pompeius (Life of <lb/>
            Pompeius, c. 40, uote). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            the time when Pompeius adorned that sito with porticoes <lb/>
            and the theatre. Hither then the Senate was summoned <lb/>
            about the middle of the month of March; the Romans call <lb/>
            the day the Ides; so that some dæmon seemed to be <lb/>
            bringing the man to the vengeance of Pompeius. When <lb/>
            the day came, Brutus put a dagger under his vest, without <lb/>
            any one being privy to it except his wife, and went forth; <lb/>
            the rest assembled at the house of Cassius, to conduct <lb/>
            down to the Forum Cassius' son, who was going to assume <lb/>
            the toga called virilis. From thence they all hurried to <lb/>
            the portico of Pompeius, where they waited in expectation <lb/>
            of Caesaris coming immediately to the Senate. Herein <lb/>
            most of all would one have admired the impassiveness of <lb/>
            the men and their presence of mind before the danger, if <lb/>
            he had known what was going to take place — in that, being <lb/>
            compelled by their duties of prætor to attend to the con­ <lb/>
            cerns of many persons, they not only listened patiently to <lb/>
            those who came before them and had matter in dispute, <lb/>
            like men who have plenty of leisure, but they also gave <lb/>
            to each their decision in exact form and with judgment, <lb/>
            carefully attending to the business. And when one person, <lb/>
            who was unwilling to submit to the decision, was appeal­ <lb/>
            ing to Caesar, and calling out loud and protesting, Brutus, <lb/>
            looking on the bystanders, said: " Caesar does not hinder <lb/>
            me from acting according to the laws, and he will not <lb/>
            hinder me."</p>
          <p>XV. And yet many things chanced to fall out to cause <lb/>
            them perplexity; first and chief, that Cæsar tarried while <lb/>
            the day was getting on, and as the victims were not <lb/>
            propitious, was kept at home by his wife, and was hindered <lb/>
            by the priests from going abroad. In the next place, a <lb/>
            person came up to Casca, who was one of the conspirators, <lb/>
            and taking his hand said, " Casca, you have concealed the <lb/>
            secret from us, but Brutus has disclosed all to me." Casca <lb/>
            was startled at this, whereon the other smiled and said, <lb/>
            " How have you grown so rich all at once as to become a <lb/>
            candidate for the ædileship ? " So near did Casca come to <lb/>
            betraying the secret, being deceived by the ambiguity of <lb/>
            the man's words. A senator also, Popilius Lænas,* saluted <lb/>
            Brutus and Cassius in a more lively way than usual, and <note type="footnote">* The same btory is told by Appian (Civil Wars, ii. 115). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            whispering in a low tone, " You have my wishes, " he said, <lb/>
            " for success in what you design, and I urge you not to tarry, <lb/>
            for the matter is no secret." Saying this he withdrew, <lb/>
            putting them in great suspicion of the intended deed being <lb/>
            known. In the meantime one came running from the <lb/>
            house of Brutus and told him that his wife was dying. <lb/>
            For Porcia, who was beside herself through thinking of <lb/>
            what was going to be done, and unable to bear the weight <lb/>
            of her anxiety, could scarce keep herself within doors, and <lb/>
            at every noise and shout, like those possessed with bacchio <lb/>
            frenzy, she would spring forth and question every one <lb/>
            who came in from the Forum, what Brutus was doing, <lb/>
            and was continually sending others out. At length, as <lb/>
            the time began to be protracted, her bodily strength no <lb/>
            longer held out, but she fainted and swooned away, her <lb/>
            mind wandering by reason of her perplexity; and she <lb/>
            could not reach her apartment before faintness and in­ <lb/>
            describable alarm seized her, where she was sitting in the <lb/>
            midst of her attendants, and her colour changed and her <lb/>
            voice was completely choked. Her maids at this sight <lb/>
            shrieked aloud, and as the neighbours quickly ran to the <lb/>
            door, a report went forth and was given out abroad, that <lb/>
            she was dead. However she quickly recovered and was <lb/>
            herself again, and her women took care of her. Brutus <lb/>
            was troubled, as was natural, by this report coming upon <lb/>
            him; yet he did not desert the public interest, nor allow <lb/>
            himself to be carried away by his feelings to his own <lb/>
            domestic affairs.</p>
          <p>XVI. And now it was told that Cæsar was approaching, <lb/>
            borne in a litter. For he had determined, in consequence <lb/>
            of being dispirited by the sacrifices, to ratify nothing of <lb/>
            importance at that time, but to put things off on the <lb/>
            pretext of illness. When he had stepped out of the litter, <lb/>
            Popilius Lænas hurried up to him, he who had a little <lb/>
            before wished Brutus good luck and success, and he talked <lb/>
            some time with Cæsar who was standing there and listen­ <lb/>
            ing. The conspirators (for so we may call them) not hearing <lb/>
            what he said, but conjecturing from their own suspicions <lb/>
            that the conversation was a discovery of the plot, sunk in <lb/>
            their spirits and looked at one another, by their countenances <lb/>
            declaring to one another that they ought not to wait to be <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            scized, but forthwith to die by their own hands. Cassius <lb/>
            and some others had already laid their hands on the hilts <lb/>
            of their daggers under their garments and were drawing <lb/>
            them out, when Brutus observing in the attitude of Lænas <lb/>
            the earnestness of a man who was asking a favour and <lb/>
            not preferring an accusation, said nothing, because somany <lb/>
            persons not of their party were mingled with them, but <lb/>
            he encouraged Cassius by the cheering expression of <lb/>
            his countenance. And soon after Lænas kissed Cæsar's <lb/>
            right hand and withdrew, by which it was plain that he <lb/>
            had : spoken with Cæsar about himself and some of his own <lb/>
            concerns.</p>
          <p>XVII.* The Senate having advanced to the exhedra, the <lb/>
            conspirators surrounded Cæsar's chair, as if they designed <lb/>
            to have a conference with him. And it is said that Cassius, <lb/>
            turning his face to the statue of Pompeius, invoked him as <lb/>
            if he could hear; and Trebonius having engaged Antonius <lb/>
            in conversation at the door kept him out. As Cæsar <lb/>
            entered, the Senate stood up, and as soon as he sat down, <lb/>
            the conspirators in a body surrounded him, putting forward <lb/>
            Tillius Cimber, one of their number, to supplicate for his <lb/>
            brother who was an exile; and they all joined in the sup­ <lb/>
            plication, laying hold of Cæsar's hands, and they kissed <lb/>
            his breast and head. Caesar at first repulsed their in treaties, <lb/>
            and then, as they did not intermit, he made a sudden <lb/>
            attempt to rise up, on which Tillius, with both his hands, <lb/>
            pulled Cæsar's garment down from the shoulders, and <lb/>
            Casca first of all (for he stood behind him) drew his sword <lb/>
            and drove it into Cæsar's body near the shoulders, but to <lb/>
            no great depth. Caesar, laying hold of the handle, cried <lb/>
            out aloud in the Roman language, " Villain Casca, what <lb/>
            are you doing !" and Casca, addressing his brother in Greek, <lb/>
            urged him to come to his aid. Cæsar being now assaulted <lb/>
            by many, looked around with the intention of forcing his <lb/>
            way through them, but when ho saw Brutus drawing his <lb/>
            sword against him, he let loose his hold of Casca's hand, <lb/>
            and wrapping his head in his garment he offered his body <note type="footnote"> * The circumstances of Cæsar's death are told in his Life, c. 66; <lb/>
            where it is incorrectly said that Brutus Albinus engaged Antonius in <lb/>
            conversation. To the authorities referred to in the note to c. 66 of the <lb/>
            Life of Cæsar, add Cicero, Philipp. it 14, which is referred to by <lb/>

            to the blows. The conspirators, who were all mingled in <lb/>
            confusion, and using their numerous swords against Cæsar, <lb/>
            wounded one another, so that even Brutus received a blow <lb/>
            on the hand while he was taking part in the slaughter; <lb/>
            and they were all drenched with blood.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Cæsar having been thus killed, Brutus advanced <lb/>
            into the midst wishing to speak, and he attempted to <lb/>
            detain the Senate by encouraging them ; but the senators, <lb/>
            through fear, fled in disorder, and there was shoving and <lb/>
            confusion about the door, though no one pursued or pressed <lb/>
            upon them. For it had been firmly resolved to kill no <lb/>
            other than Cæsar, but to invite all to freedom. Now the <lb/>
            rest, when they were deliberating about the deed, were of <lb/>
            opinion that they should kill Antonius at the same time <lb/>
            with Cæsar, as he was a man who aspired to monarchical <lb/>
            power and was a violent man, and had got strength by his <lb/>
            intercourse and familiarity with the army; and chiefly <lb/>
            that to his natural haughtiness and daring temper he had <lb/>
            added the dignity of the consulship, being then Cæsar's <lb/>
            colleague. But Brutus opposed the design, first relying <lb/>
            on grounds of justice, and next suggesting hopes of a <lb/>
            change. For he did not despair that Antonius, a man of <lb/>
            generous nature, a lover of honourable distinctions and <lb/>
            fond of fame, when Cæsar was put out of the way, would <lb/>
            join his country in seizing hold of freedom, and be led on <lb/>
            by them through emulation to what was good. In this <lb/>
            way Brutus saved Antonius; but in the then alarm <lb/>
            Antonius changed his dress for plebeian attire and fled. <lb/>
            Brutus and his partisans went to the Capitol, their hands <lb/>
            stained with blood, and displaying their bare swords called <lb/>
            the citizens to liberty. Now, at first, there were shouts, and <lb/>
            the people running this way and that, as chance would <lb/>
            have it, after the murder, increased the confusion; but as <lb/>
            there was no more slaughter and no plundering of the <lb/>
            things exposed for sale, both the senators and many of the <lb/>
            plebeians took heart and went up to the conspirators <lb/>
            to the Capitol. The multitude being assembled, Brutus <lb/>
            spoke in a way to please the people and suitable to the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances ; and as the people commended him and called <lb/>
            out for them to come down, the conspirators confidently <lb/>
            descended to the Forum, the rest following with one an. <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            other; but many of the persons of distinction putting Bru­ <lb/>
            tus in the midst, of them, conducted him with great show <lb/>
            from the Capitol, and placed him on the Rostra. At the <lb/>
            eight of this the many, though a mingled body and pre­ <lb/>
            pared to raise a tumult, were afraid, and they awaited the <lb/>
            result in order and silence. When Brutus came forward <lb/>
            they all listened to what he said ; but that the deed was <lb/>
            not agreeable to all, they made evident when Cinna began <lb/>
            to speak and to bring charges against Cæsar, by breaking <lb/>
            out in passion and abusing Cinna, so that the conspirators <lb/>
            returned to the Capitol. Brutus, fearing to be blockaded, <lb/>
            then sent away the chief persons of those who had gone <lb/>
            up with him, not thinking it right that, as they had no <lb/>
            share in the blame, they should sustain a share in the <lb/>
            danger.</p>
          <p>XIX. However, on the following day when the Senate <lb/>
            met in the temple of Earth, and Antonius and Plancus * and <lb/>
            Cicero had spoken about an amnesty and concord, it was <lb/>
            resolved that the conspirators should not only have impu­ <lb/>
            nity, but that the consuls should also propose a measure <lb/>
            for conferring honours on them. They voted these things, <lb/>
            and then separated. After Antonius had sent his son to <lb/>
            the Capitol as a hostage, Brutus and the conspirators came <lb/>
            down, and there were salutations and pressing of hands <lb/>
            among all of them together. Antonius received Cassius <lb/>
            and feasted him, and Lepidus entertained Brutus ; and the <lb/>
            rest were entertained by others according to the intimacy <lb/>
            or friendship that existed between them. At daybreak <lb/>
            the senators met again, and in the first place they conferred <lb/>
            honours on Antonius for having stopped the beginning <lb/>
            of civil wars; in the second place, thanks were given to <lb/>
            Brutus and his friends who were present, and finally distri­ <lb/>
            butions of provinces. For to Brutus they decreed Crete, <lb/>
            and to Cassius Libya, and to Trebonius Asia, and to Cimber <lb/>
            Bithynia, and to the other Brutus Gallia on the Eridanus.</p>
          <p>XX. After this a discussion arising about the will of <note type="footnote"> * L. Munatius Plancus, who had received favours from Cæsar, and <lb/>
            the province of Transalpine Gaul, with the exception of Narbonensis <lb/>
            and Belgica B.C. 44. <lb/>

            Cæsar and his interment, and Antonius demanding that <lb/>
            the will should be read, and that the body should be carried <lb/>
            forth not secretly nor without due honours, so that this, <lb/>
            too, might not irritate the people, Cassius violently opposed <lb/>
            it, but Brutus gave way, wherein he was considered to <lb/>
            have made a second mistake. For in sparing Antonius <lb/>
            he incurred the imputation of strengthening against the <lb/>
            conspirators a dangerous and irresistible enemy ; and as to <lb/>
            the matter of the interment, in allowing it to take place in <lb/>
            the way in which Antonius demanded, he was considered <lb/>
            to have altogether made a mistake. For in the first place <lb/>
            there being given by the will to every Roman seventy-five <lb/>
            drachmæ,* and to the people there being left the gardens <lb/>
            beyond the river, where the temple of Fortuna now is, a <lb/>
            wonderful degree of affection and regret for Cæsar seized <lb/>
            the citizens: in the second place, when the body had been <lb/>
            carried into the Forum, and Antonius according to custom <lb/>
            had pronounced a funeral oration in honour of Cæsar, see­ <lb/>
            ing that the masses were stirred by his speech, he changed <lb/>
            their feeling into compassion, and taking the blood- <lb/>
            stained vest of Cæsar he unfolded it and showed the rents <lb/>
            and the number of the wounds. Upon this there was no <lb/>
            longer any order kept; but some called out to kill the <lb/>
            murderers, and others, as before in the case of Clodius t <lb/>
            the demagogue, tearing up the benches and tables from the <lb/>
            workshops and bringing them together made a very large <lb/>
            pile; and placing the corpse upon it in the midst of many <lb/>
            temples and asyla and holy places burnt it. When the fire <lb/>
            blazed forth, men from various quarters, approaching and <lb/>
            plucking out half-burnt pieces of wood, ran about to the <lb/>
            houses of Cæsar's assassins, intending to fire them. But <lb/>
            they were already well prepared and repelled the danger. <lb/>
            Now there was one Cinna,t a man given to poetry, who <lb/>
            was under no imputation in the matter, and had even been <lb/>
            a friend of Cæsar. He dreamed in a dream that he was <lb/>
            invited by Cæsar to supper and he refused; but Caesar <lb/>
            urged and forced him, and at last, laying hold of his hand, <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Cesar, c. 68, and the note. </note><note type="footnote"> t The allusion is to P. Clodius, who fell in a brawl with T. Annius <lb/>

            led him to a vast and gloomy place, he following the while <lb/>
            unwilling and alarmed. After having this vision, it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that he had a fever in the night. Nevertheless, in <lb/>
            the morning, when Cæsar's body was being carried forth <lb/>
            he felt ashamed not to be present, and went out to the <unclear/> <lb/>
            abble, who were now in a ferocious mood. Being seen and <lb/>
            supposed to be not the Cinna that he was, but the Cinna <lb/>
            who had lately reviled Cæsar before the assembly, he was <lb/>
            torn in pieces.</p>
          <p>XXI. It was mainly through fear on account of this <lb/>
            unlucky affair, next after the change in Antonius, that <lb/>
            Brutus and his partisans left the city. They stayed in <lb/>
            Antium * at first, with the design of returning to Rome <lb/>
            when the popular fury should have passed its height and <lb/>
            worn itself out. And this they expected to take place as <lb/>
            a matter of course among numbers which were subject to <lb/>
            unsteady and rapid movements, and because they had the <lb/>
            Senate in their favour, who without taking any notice of <lb/>
            those that had torn Cinna to pieces, sought out and seized <lb/>
            those who had attacked the houses of the conspirators. <lb/>
            The people, too, already annoyed at Antonius being nearly <lb/>
            established in monarchical power, longed for Brutus, and <lb/>
            it was expected that he would, in person, superintend the <lb/>
            spectacles t which as prefer it was his duty to exhibit. <lb/>
            But when Brutus heard that many of those who had <lb/>
            served under Cæsar and received lands and cities from him, <lb/>
            were forming designs against him, and were dropping into <lb/>
            the city a few at a time, he did not venture to go, and the <lb/>
            people saw the spectacles, which, though Brutus was absent, <lb/>
            were furnished without any thrift and in a profuse style. <lb/>
            For he had purchased a great number of wild beasts, and he <lb/>
            gave orders that none should be sold or left, but that all <lb/>
            should be killed; and he himself went down to Neapolis <lb/>
            and engaged most of the actors. With respect to a certain <lb/>
            Canutius who was much in favour on the theatre, he wrote <note type="footnote"> * Now Porto d'Anzo, on the coast of Latium, thirty miles from Rome. <lb/>
            It is now a poor place, with numerous remains of former buildings <lb/>
            (Westphal, Die Römische Kampagne, and his two maps). </note><note type="footnote"> t These were the Ludi Apollinares (Dion, xlvii 20), which Brutus <lb/>
            had to superintend as Prætor Urbanus. The day of celebration was the <lb/>
            fourth of Quintilis or Julius. The games were superintended by L. <lb/>
            Antonius, the brother of Marcus, and the colleague of Brutus. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            to his friends that they should get him on the stage by <lb/>
            persuasion, for it was not fit that any Greek should be <lb/>
            forced. He also wrote to Cicero and urged him by all <lb/>
            means to be present at the spectacles.</p>
          <p>XXII. While affairs were in this state, another change <lb/>
            was brought about by the arrival of the young Cæsar.* He <lb/>
            was the son of Cæsar's niece, but by Cæsar's testament he <lb/>
            was left his son and heir: and he was staying at Apollonia <lb/>
            when Cæsar was killed, being engaged with philosophical <lb/>
            studies and waiting for Cæsar, who had resolved to march <lb/>
            forthwith against the Parthians. As soon as he heard of <lb/>
            Cæsar's death he came to Rome, and by assuming Cæsar's <lb/>
            name as a mode of beginning to get the popular favour, and <lb/>
            by paying among the citizens the money that was left them, <lb/>
            he made a strong party against Antonius, and by distribu­ <lb/>
            ting money he got together and assembled many of those <lb/>
            who had served under Cæsar. Now when Cicero took the <lb/>
            side of Cæsar through hatred of Antonius, Brutus t rebuked <lb/>
            him strongly in his letters, saying that Cicero did not dis­ <lb/>
            like a master, but feared a master who hated him, and that <lb/>
            his policy was to choose a mild servitude, as he showed by <lb/>
            writing and saying, “How good Caesar is !" But our fathers, <lb/>
            he said, did not endure even mild masters. He said that <lb/>
            for his part at this crisis he had neither quite resolved to <lb/>
            fight nor to remain quiet, but he was resolved on one thing <lb/>
            only, not to be a slave; but he wondered at Cicero, that <lb/>
            he was afraid of a civil war and one attended with danger, <lb/>
            and was not afraid of a base and inglorious peace, and <lb/>
            that he asked as a reward for ejecting Antonius from the <lb/>
            tyranny, to be allowed to make Caesar a tyrant.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now in his first letters Brutus thus expressed <lb/>
            himself; but when people were separating themselves, <lb/>
            some on the side of Cæsar and some on the side of <lb/>
            Antonius, and the armies being venal were selling them­ <lb/>
            selves as it were by auction to the highest bidder, Brutus, <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Cicero, c. 43, and notes; and the Life of <lb/>
            Antonius, c. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> t Complaints like these, of the conduct of Cicero, appear in the six­ <lb/>
            teenth and seventeenth letters of the book which is entitled ‘M. Tullii <lb/>
            Epistolarum ad Brutum Liber Singularis;’ but the genuinen<unclear>ss</unclear> of these <lb/>
            letters is very doubtful. Plutarch himself (Brutus, 53) did not fully <lb/>
            believe in the genuineness of all the letters attributed to Brutus. </note> <lb/>

            altogether despairing of affairs, resolved to leave Italy, and <lb/>
            he went by land through Lucania to Velia * to the sea. <lb/>
            From this place Porcia, intending to turn back to Rome, <lb/>
            endeavoured to conceal her excessive emotion, but a paint­ <lb/>
            ing made her betray herself though she was a noble- <lb/>
            spirited woman. It was a subject from Grecian story, <lb/>
            Hector accompanied by Andromache,t who was receiving <lb/>
            her infant son from Hector and looking upon him. The <lb/>
            sight of the picture, in which her own feelings were <lb/>
            portrayed, melted Porcia to tears, and she went to it many <lb/>
            times in the day and wept. Acilius, one of the friends of <lb/>
            Brutus, having pronounced the words of Andromache to <lb/>
            Hector :- <lb/>
            Hector, thou art to me father and mother dear, <lb/>
            And brother too, and husband in thy bloom:" <lb/>
            Brutus, smiling, said, “But it is not for me to say to <lb/>
            Porcia as Hector said : <lb/>
            “‘The loom and distaff, and command the maids;' <lb/>
            for owing to the natural weakness of her body she is <lb/>
            unable to perform noble deeds equally with us, but in her <lb/>
            mind she nobly dares as we do in defence of our country." <lb/>
            This is recorded by Bibulus, the son of Porcia.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Having set out thence Brutus sailed towards <lb/>
            Athens.‡ The people received him gladly with expres­ <lb/>
            sions of good wishes and public honours, and he lodged <note type="footnote"> * Elea, the Romans called this place Velia. It was on the coast of Luca­ <lb/>
            nia, in the modern province of Basilicata in the kingdom of Naples; <lb/>
            and the remains are near Castella a mare della Brucca. Velia is often <lb/>
            mentioned by Cicero, who set sail from thence when he intended to go <lb/>
            to Greece (Life of Cicero, c. 43). </note><note type="footnote"> t The passages in Homer are, Iliad, vi. 429 and 491, the parting of <lb/>
            Hector and Andromache. The old stories of Greece furnished the <lb/>
            painter with excellent subjects, and the simplicity with which they <lb/>
            treated them may be inferred from Plutarch's description. The poet <lb/>
            was here the real painter. The artist merely gave a sensuous form to <lb/>
            the poet's conception. The parting of Hector and Andromache is the <lb/>
            subject of one of Schiller's early poems. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Dion Cassius (xlvii. 20) describes the reception of Brutus at <lb/>

            who had liberated Athens from the tyranny of the Peisistratidæ. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 E 2 </note> <lb/>

            with a friend. As he attended the discourses of <lb/>
            Theomnestus the Academic, and Cratippus * the Peri­ <lb/>
            patetic, and associated with those philosophers, it Was <lb/>
            supposed that he was altogether inactive and was un­ <lb/>
            bending himself. But he was busied about preparations <lb/>
            for war, when no one suspected it; for he sent Herostratus <lb/>
            into Macedonia with the view of gaining over those who <lb/>
            were with the armies there, and he attached to himself <lb/>
            and kept with him the young men from Rome who were <lb/>
            residing at Athens for the sake of their studies. Among <lb/>
            them was also a son of Cicero whom Brutus particularly <lb/>
            commends, and says, that whether he is waking or sleep­ <lb/>
            ing, he admires him for his noble disposition and hatred of <lb/>
            tyrants. Having now begun openly to attend to affairs, <lb/>
            and hearing that Roman vessels full of money were sailing <lb/>
            over from Asia, with a commander on board who was an <lb/>
            honest man and an acquaintance of his, he met him near <lb/>
            Carystus and having fallen in with him and persuaded <lb/>
            him and obtained a surrender of the vessels, he prepared <lb/>
            for a magnificent entertainment, for it was the birth-day <lb/>
            of Brutus. When they had come to drinking and were <lb/>
            pouring out wine with wishes for the success of Brutus <lb/>
            and the liberty of the Romans, Brutus, wishing to encourage <lb/>
            them still more, asked for a larger cup, and taking it up, <lb/>
            without anything moving thereto, he uttered the following <lb/>
            verse: <lb/>
            “Me evil fate and Leto's son t have slain." <lb/>
            In addition to this they report that when he went out to <lb/>
            fight the last battle at Philippi, Apollo was the word that <lb/>
            he gave to his soldiers. Accordingly they consider that <lb/>
            the utterance of that verse was a sign of what was to <lb/>
            befall him. <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, c. 75. Cicero's son Marcus was attend­ <lb/>
            ing the lectures of Cratippus B.O. 44, and also, as it appears, up to the <lb/>
            time when Brutus came to Athens. Horace, who was now at Athens, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XXV. After this Antistius gave Brutus fifty ten <lb/>
            thousands out of the money which he was taking to Italy ; <lb/>
            and all the soldiers of Pompeius who were still rambling <lb/>
            about Thessaly gladly flocked to Brutus; and he took five <lb/>
            hundred horsemen from Cinna who was conducting them <lb/>
            into Asia to Dolabella.* He then sailed against Demetrias t <lb/>
            and got possession of a large quantity of arms, which were <lb/>
            going to be carried away to Antonius, and had been made <lb/>
            at the command of the elder Cæsar for the Parthian war. <lb/>
            Hortensius,t the governor, also surrendered Macedonia to <lb/>
            him, and the kings and rulers all around began to side <lb/>
            with him and to come over; but in the meantime news <lb/>
            arrived that Caius, the brother of Antonius, had crossed <lb/>
            over from Italy and was marching straight against the <lb/>
            troops which Gabinius § had under him in Epidamnus and <lb/>
            Apollonia. Brutus, intending to anticipate and prevent <lb/>
            him, immediately put in motion those who were with him, <lb/>
            and marched through a difficult country in the midst of a <lb/>
            snow-storm ; and he was far in advance of those who con­ <lb/>
            veyed the provisions. As he came near Epidamnus, he <lb/>
            began to suffer from bulimy || through exhaustion and cold. <lb/>
            This malady chiefly attacks both beasts and men when <lb/>
            they are worn out and in the midst of the snow, whether <lb/>
            it is that the heat owing to the refrigeration and condens­ <lb/>
            ation, when everything is internally compressed, consumes <lb/>
            the nourishment all at once, or that a sharp and subtle <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cicero, c. 43, note; and Dion Cassius (xlvii. <lb/>

            the province of Macedonia (B.C. 44), in which Brutus was to succeed <lb/>

            (c. 28). </note><note type="footnote"> § This may be an error of Plutarch's copyists. His name was P. <lb/>

            Babylonia over the table-land of Armenia (Xenophon, Anabasis, iv. 5, <lb/>

            call by that name, and which they describe as a “canine appetite, in­ <lb/>
            satiable desire for food." The nature of the appetite is exemplified by <lb/>
            the instance of a man eating in one day four pounds of raw cow'a <lb/>
            udder, ten pounds of raw beef, two pounds of candles, and drinking <lb/>
            five bottles of porter (Penny Cyclopædia, art. Bulimia). The subject <lb/>
            of Bulimia is discussed by Plutarch (Symposiaca, b. vi. Qu. 8). </note> <lb/>

            the body and destroys the warmth which is dispersed out­ <lb/>

            the surface; whereof there has been further discussion in <lb/>
            another place.</p>
          <p>XXVI. As Brutus was fainting, and no one in the <lb/>
            army had anything to eat, his attendants were compelled <lb/>
            to fly for refuge to their enemies, and approaching the <lb/>
            gates they asked bread of the watch, who hearing of the <lb/>
            mishap of Brutus came and brought to eat and to drink. <lb/>
            In return for which, when Brutus got possession of the <lb/>
            city, he not only treated them kindly, but also all the <lb/>
            rest for their sake. Caius Antonius now came up to <lb/>
            Apollonia and summoned the soldiers who were there; but <lb/>
            when they went over to Brutus, and he perceived that the <lb/>
            people of Apollonia were in favour of Brutus, he left the <lb/>
            city and marched to Buthrotum.* And in the first place <lb/>
            he lost three cohorts, which were cut to pieces by Brutus <lb/>
            on the march; and in the next place, attempting to force <lb/>
            the posts about By bits, which were already occupied, he <lb/>
            came to a battle with Cicero and was defeated; fur <lb/>
            Brutus employed Cicero in command and gained many <lb/>
            successes through him. Brutus himself came upon Caius, <lb/>
            who was in marshy ground and far separated from the <lb/>
            rest of his troops, but he would not let his lien make an <lb/>
            attack, and he threw his cavalry around him with orders <lb/>
            to spare the men, saying that in a short time they would <lb/>
            be theirs; which in fact happened, for they surrendered <lb/>
            themselves and their general, so that there was now a <lb/>
            large force with Brutus. Now Brutus treated Caius <lb/>
            respectfully for some time and did not deprive him of the <lb/>
            insignia of his office, though, as they say, many persons, <lb/>
            and Cicero among the rest, wrote to him from Rome and <lb/>
            urged him to do it. But as Caius began to have secret <note type="footnote"> * Now Butrinto, was on the main land in the north part of the <lb/>
            channel which divides Corcyra (Corfu) from the continent. It was <lb/>
            made a Colonia by the Romans after their occupation of Epirus. <lb/>
            Atticus, the friend of Cicero, had land in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Buthrotum. </note><note type="footnote"> As to the events mentioned at the end of this chapter, compare Diou <lb/>

            conferences with the officers and attempted to excite a <lb/>
            mutiny, he had him put in a ship and guarded. The <lb/>
            soldiers who had been corrupted fled to Apollonia and <lb/>
            invited Brutus there, but Brutus said that this was not <lb/>
            the custom among the Romans, and that they must come <lb/>
            to their general, and ask pardon for their offence. They <lb/>
            came, and Brutus pardoned them at their prayer.</p>
          <p>XXVII. As Brutus was going to set out for Asia, news <lb/>
            arrived of the changes at Rome. The young Caesar had <lb/>
            been strengthened by the Senate against Antonius, whom <lb/>
            he had driven out of Italy, and he was now formidable, <lb/>
            and was seeking for the consulship contrary to law, and <lb/>
            maintaining large armies of which the State had no need. <lb/>
            But when Cæsar saw that the Senate was displeased at <lb/>
            this, and was looking abroad towards Brutus and decreeing <lb/>
            provinces * for him and confirming them, he became alarmed. <lb/>
            And he sent to Antonius and invited him to friendship, <lb/>
            and placing his troops around the city he got the consul­ <lb/>
            ship, being yet hardly a young man, but in his twentieth <lb/>
            year, as he said in his Memoirs. He immediately instituted <lb/>
            a pr&lt; secution on a charge of murder against Brutus and <lb/>
            his partisans, for having put to death without trial the <lb/>
            first man in the state who was filling the highest offices ; <lb/>
            and he named as the accuser of Brutus, Lucius Cornificius, <lb/>
            and Marcus Agrippa as the accuser of Cassius. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly they were condemned for default of appearance, the <lb/>
            judices being compelled to go to the vote. It is said that <lb/>
            when the crier, according to custom, from the tribunal <lb/>
            summoned Brutus into court, the mass gave a loud groan, <lb/>
            and the nobles bent their heads to the ground and kept <lb/>
            silence; but that Publius Silicius was seen to shed tears, <lb/>
            and for this reason was shortly after one of those who <lb/>
            were proscribed. After this, the three, Cæsar, Antonius <lb/>
            and Lepidus, distributed the provinces among them, and <lb/>
            caused the slaughter and proscription of two hundred men, <lb/>
            among whom Cicero perished.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. When the news of these events reached <lb/>
            Macedonia, Brutus,† compelled by circumstances, wrote <note type="footnote"> * Compare Dion Cassius, xlvii. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was Decimus Brutus Albums, who fell into the hands of the <lb/>
            soldiers of M. Antonius in North Italy, and was put to death by order</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            to Hortensius to put Caiu8 Antonius to death, on the <lb/>
            ground of avenging Brutus and Cicero, the one being his <lb/>
            friend, and the other both a friend and kinsman. This <lb/>
            was the reason why Antonius, when he afterwards took <lb/>
            Hortensius at Philippi, put him to death on the tomb of <lb/>
            his brother. Brutus says that he felt more shame at the <lb/>
            cause of Cicero'is death than sympathy at his misfortune, <lb/>
            and that he blamed his friends in Rome, for they were <lb/>
            slain more through their own fault than that of the <lb/>
            tyrants, and that they submitted to see and to witness <lb/>
            what it should have been intolerable for them even to <lb/>
            hear. Brutus having taken his army over to Asia, which <lb/>
            was now a considerable force, set about fitting out a naval <lb/>
            force in Bithynia* and in the neighbourhood of Cyzicus; <lb/>
            and himself moving about with his troops settled the <lb/>
            cities and had interviews with the rulers; and he sent to <lb/>
            Cassius t into Syria to recall him from Egypt; for he said <lb/>
            that it was not to get dominion, but to deliver their <lb/>
            country that they were rambling about and collecting a force <lb/>
            with which they would put down the tyrants; that they <lb/>
            ought therefore, remembering and keeping in mind this <lb/>
            purpose, not to hold themselves far from Italy, but to <lb/>
            hasten thither and to aid the citizens. Cassius obeyed, and <lb/>
            Brutus met him on his return; and they fell in with one <lb/>
            another near Smyrna, for the first time since they had <lb/>
            separated in Peiraeus and set out, the one for Syria, the <lb/>
            other for Macedonia. They had accordingly great pleasure <lb/>
            and confidence owing to the force which each had. For <lb/>
            they had hurried from Italy like the most despicable <lb/>
            fugitives, without money and without arms, without a <lb/>
            single ship, a single soldier, or a city, and yet after no <lb/>
            very long interval they had come together with ships and <lb/>
            troops and horses and money, able to struggle for the <lb/>
            supremacy of the Romans. <note type="footnote">of Antonius B.C. 43. Compare Dion Cassius (xlvi. 53), and the note of <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XXIX. Now Cassius was desirous to have and to allow <lb/>
            an equal share of honour, but Brutus herein anticipated <lb/>
            him by generally going to Cassius who, in age, was his <lb/>
            superior, and in body was not able to sustain equal toil. <lb/>
            The opinion was that Cassius was skilled in military <lb/>
            matters, but was violent in passion and governed mainly <lb/>
            by fear, while towards his intimates he was too much <lb/>
            inclined to use ridicule and was too fond of jesting. As <lb/>
            to Brutus, they say that he was esteemed by the many for <lb/>
            his virtues, but loved by his friends, admired by the <lb/>
            nobles, and not hated even by his enemies, because the <lb/>
            man was extraordinarily mild and high-minded and un­ <lb/>
            moved by anger, pleasure or love of aggrandisement, and <lb/>
            kept his judgment upright and unbending in tt e main­ <lb/>
            tenance of honour and justice. That which got him most <lb/>
            good-will and reputation was the faith which men had in <lb/>
            his motives. For neither that great Pompeius, if he had <lb/>
            put down Cæsar, was confidently expected to give up his <lb/>
            power to the laws, but to retain affairs in his hands, <lb/>
            pacifying the people with the name of consulship and <lb/>
            dictatorship or some other title with more pleasing name; <lb/>
            and this Cassius, who was a violent and passionate man <lb/>
            and was often carried away from justice in quest of gain, <lb/>
            more than any one else they thought would carry on war, <lb/>
            and ramble about and expose himself to danger for the <lb/>
            purpose of getting power for himself, not liberty for the <lb/>
            citizens. For as to the men of still earlier times, the Cinnas <lb/>
            and Marii and Carbos, they viewed their country as a <lb/>
            prize and booty for competition, and all but in express <lb/>
            words fought to get a tyranny. But as to Brutus, they <lb/>
            say that not even his enemies imputed to him such a <lb/>
            change in his purpose, but that many persons had heard <lb/>
            Antonius say, he thought Brutus was the only person who <lb/>
            conspired against Cæsar because of being moved by the <lb/>
            splendour and apparent noble nature of the deed, and that <lb/>
            the rest combined against the man because they hated and <lb/>
            envied him. Accordingly it appears from what Brutus <lb/>
            says that he trusted not so much in his power as in his <lb/>
            virtues. He wrote to Atticus when he was just approach­ <lb/>
            ing the danger, that his affairs were in the best plight as <lb/>
            to fortune, for that he should either get the victory and <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            tree the Roman people, or should die and be released from <lb/>
            slavery; and though everything else was safe and secure <lb/>
            for them, one thing was uncertain, whether they should <lb/>
            live and be free or die. He says that Marcus Antonius <lb/>
            was paying a just penalty for his folly, for while he <lb/>
            might have been numbered with the Bruti and Cassii and <lb/>
            Catos, he made himself an appendage to Octavius, and if <lb/>
            he should not be defeated with him, he would shortly <lb/>
            after have to fight against him. Now he seems, in say­ <lb/>
            ing this, to have well divined what was to happen.</p>
          <p>XXX. While they were then in Smyrna, Brutus claimed <lb/>
            a share of the money which Cassius had collected to a great <lb/>
            amount, for Brutus alleged that he had expended all his <lb/>
            own resources in building so great a fleet with which they <lb/>
            would command all the internal sea.* But the friends of <lb/>
            Cassius were not for lettinghim give up the money, saying, <lb/>
            “What you save by economy and get with odium, it in <lb/>
            not fair that he should take and apply to gaining popular­ <lb/>
            ity and gratifying the soldiers." However, Cassius gave <lb/>
            him a third part of all. Separating again to their several <lb/>
            undertakings, Cassius, after taking Rhodes, did not conduct <lb/>
            himself with moderation, but made this answer at his en­ <lb/>
            trance to those who addressed him as king and lord : “I am <lb/>
            neither king nor lord, but the executioner and punisher of <lb/>
            lord and king." Brutus demanded of the Lycians money <lb/>
            and men. When Naucrates the demagogue persuaded the <lb/>
            cities to revolt, and the people occupied certain heights to <lb/>
            prevent Brutus from passing, in the first place he sent <lb/>
            cavalry against them when they were eating, who killed <lb/>
            six hundred of them; and in the next place taking posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the posts and forts, he released all the people with­ <lb/>
            out ransom with the view of gaining over the nation by <lb/>
            kindness. But the people were obstinate, being enraged <lb/>
            at what they had suffered, and despising his moderation <lb/>
            and humanity, till at last Brutus drove into Xanthus t the <note type="footnote"> * The Mediterranean, for which the Romans had no name. </note><note type="footnote"> t Xanthus stood on a river of the same name, about ten miles from <lb/>
            the mouth. The river is now called Etchen-Chai. Xanthus is first <lb/>
            mentioned by Herodotus (i. 176), who describes its destruction by the <lb/>
            Persian general Harpagus, to which Plutarch afterwards (c. 31) <lb/>
            alludes. Numerous remains have been recently discovered there by</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            most warlike of the Lycians, and blockaded them there. <lb/>
            Some of them attempted to escape by swimming under the <lb/>
            river which flowed by the city: but they were caught by <lb/>
            nets which were sunk in the channel to the bottom, and <lb/>
            the tops of the nets had bells attached to them which gave <lb/>
            a signal as soon as any one was caught. The Xanthians, <lb/>
            making a sally by night, threw fire on certain engines; <lb/>
            and when they were driven back into the town by the <lb/>
            Romans who perceived them, and a strong wind began to <lb/>
            blow against the battlements the flame which was laying <lb/>
            hold of the adjoining houses, Brutus, who feared for the <lb/>
            city, ordered his soldiers to help to extinguish the fire.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But the Lycians were all at once seized with a <lb/>
            horrible impulse to despair surpassing all description, <lb/>
            which might be best likened to a passion for death; for <lb/>
            with their wives and children, both freemen and slaves, and <lb/>
            people of every age, they threw missiles from the walls upon <lb/>
            the enemy who were assisting to quench the flames, and <lb/>
            carrying reeds and wood and everything combustible, they <lb/>
            drew the fire to the city, offering to it all kinds of mate­ <lb/>
            rial and in every way exciting and feeding it. As the <lb/>
            flames rushed onwards and engirdling the city blazed forth <lb/>
            with violence, Brutus, in great affliction at what was going <lb/>
            on, rode round the walls, being eager to save the people, <lb/>
            and stretching out his hands to the Xanthians he prayed <lb/>
            them to spare themselves and save the city; and yet no <lb/>
            one regarded him, but in every way they sought to destroy <lb/>
            themselves; and not only men and women, but even the <lb/>
            little children; with cries and shouts, some leaped into the <lb/>
            fire and others broke their necks from the walls, and others <lb/>
            presented their throats to their fathers' knives, baring them <lb/>
            and bidding them strike. After the city was destroyed, <lb/>
            there was found a woman suspended by a rope, with a dead <lb/>
            child hung to her neck, and firing the house with a lighted <lb/>
            torch. This tragical sight Brutus could not endure to see, <lb/>
            and he wept at hearing of it; and he proclaimed that a <lb/>
            reward should be given to every soldier who could save a <lb/>
            Lycian. They say that there were only one hundred and <note type="footnote">Fellowes, and some of them are now in the British Museum (Penay <lb/>
            Cyclop, art. Xanthian Marbles, and the references in that article). <lb/>
            The last sentence of this chapter is very confused in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            fifty who did not escape being saved. Now the Xanthians <lb/>
            after a long interval, as if they were reproducing a fated <lb/>
            period of destruction, renewed the fortune of their an­ <lb/>
            cestors in their desperation; for their ancestors in like <lb/>
            manner in the time of the Persians burnt their city and <lb/>
            destroyed themselves.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Brutus seeing that the city of Patara was pre­ <lb/>
            paring to resist him was unwilling to attack it, and was <lb/>
            perplexed because he feared the same desperation; and <lb/>
            as he had their women captive, he let them go without <lb/>
            ransom. These women, who were the wives and daughters <lb/>
            of distinguished men, reported of Brutus that he was a <lb/>
            most moderate and just man, and they persuaded the <lb/>
            citizens to yield and to surrender the city. Upon this all <lb/>
            the rest of the Lycians surrendered and gave themselves <lb/>
            up to him, and they found him to be honourable and <lb/>
            merciful beyond their expectation; for while Cassius <lb/>
            about the same time compelled all the Rhodians to bring <lb/>
            in the gold and silver which was their private property, <lb/>
            and a sum of eight thousand talents was thus collected, <lb/>
            and mulcted the commonwealth of the city in five hundred <lb/>
            talents besides, Brutus only demanded of the Lycians a <lb/>
            hundred and fifty talents, and without doing them any <lb/>
            other wrong set out for Ionia.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Now Brutus did many deeds worthy of remem­ <lb/>
            brance both in rewarding and punishing according to <lb/>
            desert; but that with which he himself was most pleased <lb/>
            and the best of the Romans, I will relate. When Pompeius <lb/>
            Magnus landed in Egypt at Pelusium, what time he fled <lb/>
            after being completely defeated by Cæsar, the guardians <lb/>
            of the king, who was still a youth, being in counsel with <lb/>
            their friends, were not inclined the same way in their <lb/>
            opinions. Some were for receiving and others for driving <lb/>
            the man from Egypt. But one Theodotus * of Chios, who <lb/>
            was hired to teach the king rhetoric, and was then thought <lb/>
            worthy of a place in the council for want of better men, <lb/>
            attempted to show that both were in error, those who <lb/>
            advised to receive and those who advised to send away <lb/>
            Pompeius, for there was one thing in the present circum <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Pompeius, c. 77, 80. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            stances that was useful, and that was to receive him and <lb/>
            put him to death. And he added, at the end of his speech, <lb/>
            that a corpse does not bite. The council assented to his <lb/>
            opinion, and Pompeius Magnus fell, an instance of things <lb/>
            passing belief and expectation, and the result of the <lb/>
            rhetorical skill and eloquence of Theodotus, as the sophist <lb/>
            himself used to say boastingly. When Cæsar arrived <lb/>
            shortly after, some of them paid the penalty of their guilt <lb/>
            and perished miserably ; and Theodotus, who borrowed <lb/>
            from fortune a short period for an inglorious and poor and <lb/>
            rambling life, did not escape Brutus when he came into <lb/>
            Asia, but he was carried before him and punished, and <lb/>
            thus he gained a greater name by his death than by his <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Brutus invited Cassius to Sardis* and met <lb/>
            him with his friends on his approach ; and the whole force <lb/>
            under arms saluted both of them as Imperatores. Now <lb/>
            as it is wont to happen in the midst of great affairs, and <lb/>
            among many friends and commanders, causes of difference <lb/>
            had arisen between Brutus and Cassius, and suspicions; <lb/>
            and before they did anything else, immediately on their <lb/>
            arrival at Sardis they entered into a room by themselves <lb/>
            and closed the door, and no one being present they began <lb/>
            with blaming one another, and then fell to proofs and <lb/>
            charges. From this they came to tears and passionate <lb/>
            expressions without restraint, so that their friends, wonder­ <lb/>
            ing at the roughness and violence of their anger, feared <lb/>
            lest something should happen; but it was forbidden to <lb/>
            approach them. But Marcus Favonius, who had been a <lb/>
            lover of Cato, and was a philosopher not so much from <lb/>
            reason as a certain impulse and mad passion, went in to <lb/>
            them though the slaves attempted to hinder him. But it <lb/>
            was a hard thing to check Favonius when he had put <lb/>
            himself in motion towards any object, for he was im <lb/>
            petuous in all things and impatient. He made no account <lb/>
            of being a Roman senator, but by his cynical freedom of <lb/>
            speech he often took away the harshness and unseasonable­ <lb/>
            ness of his behaviour, the hearers receiving all as jest. On <lb/>
            this occasion forcing his way against those who tried to <note type="footnote"> * Brutus and Cassius met at Sardis in the early part of B.C. 42. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            stop him, he entered, and with mock solemnity uttered <lb/>
            the words which Homer * has made Nestor use : <lb/>
            " Obey: ye both are younger far than I," <lb/>
            and what follows. At which Cassius laughed, but Brutus <lb/>
            turned him out, calling him true dog and false cynic. How­ <lb/>
            ever, they forthwith became reconciled, and this was the end <lb/>
            of their difference for the time. Cassius gave an entertain­ <lb/>
            ment to which Brutus invited his friends.! As they were <lb/>
            just reclining, Favonius came from the bath; and, on <lb/>
            Brutus declaring that he came without invitation and <lb/>
            bidding him withdraw to the highest couch,‡ he forced his <lb/>
            way to the central couch and reclined there; and they <lb/>
            made merry over the banquet, and the mirth was not <lb/>
            without its zest nor unseasoned with philosophy.</p>
          <p>XXXV. On the following day Lucius Pella, § a Roman <lb/>
            who had been prætor and trusted by Brutus, was charged <lb/>
            by the people of Sardis with taking money unlawfully, <lb/>
            and he was publicly condemned and declared infamous by <lb/>
            Brutus. This affai r gave Cassius no small pain. For a few <lb/>
            days before, two of his friends who were convicted of the <lb/>
            same offence, he privately admonished and publicly ac­ <lb/>
            quitted, and he still continued to employ them. Accordingly <lb/>
            he blamed Brutus as being too strict an observer of law and <lb/>
            justice at a time which required politic conduct and con­ <note type="footnote">* The passage to which Plutarch refers is Iliad, i. 259. The charac­ <lb/>

            dilatory measutcs. But Brutus told him to remember the <lb/>
            Ides of March on which they killed Caesar, who was not <lb/>
            himself oppressing and plundering everybody, but sup­ <lb/>
            ported others who did it, so that if there was any specious <lb/>
            pretext for overlooking justice, it would have been better to <lb/>
            bear with Cæsar's friends than to allow their own friends <lb/>
            to do wrong. For they, he said,. have the imputation of <lb/>
            cowardice, but we of injustice, and that too joined to danger <lb/>
            and toil. Such were the principles of Brutus.</p>
          <p>XXXVI.† When they were going to cross over from <lb/>
            Asia, it is said that Brutus had a great sign. The man <lb/>
            was naturally wakeful, and by discipline and temperance <lb/>
            he contracted his sleep into a small space of time, never <lb/>
            reposing in the daytime, and by night only so long as he <lb/>
            was unable to do anything or to speak to any one because <lb/>
            people were resting. But at that time when the war was <lb/>
            on foot, having on his hands the general management of <lb/>
            everything, and his thoughts being on the stretch with <lb/>
            regard to the future, when he had taken a short repose <lb/>
            after eating, he employed the rest of the night on affairs <lb/>
            of urgency. And when he had finished and arranged <lb/>
            everything that was necessary about such matters, he <lb/>
            would read a book till the third watch, at which time the <lb/>
            centurions and tribunes were used to come to him. Being <lb/>
            then about to convey his army over from Asia, it happened <lb/>
            to be dead of night and the lamp in his tent was not very <lb/>
            bright; and the whole camp was in deep silence. As <lb/>
            Brutus was considering and reflecting with himself, he <lb/>
            thought that he heard some one come in, and looking <lb/>
            towards the entrance he saw a terrible and strange vision <lb/>
            of a huge and frightful figure standing by him in silence. <lb/>
            He had the courage to ask, " What man or god art thou, or <lb/>
            with what purpose dost thou come to us ? " The phantom <lb/>
            replied to him, " I am thy evil daemon, Brutus, and thou <lb/>
            shalt see me at Philippic And Brutus without being dis­ <lb/>
            turbed, said, " I shall see."</p>
          <p>XXXVII.‡ When the phantom disappeared, Brutus <note type="footnote">* The reading here is probably corrupt.

            called the slaves, and as they said that they had neither <lb/>
            heard any voice nor seen anything, Brutus still kept awake; <lb/>
            and at daybreak he betook himself to Cassius and told him <lb/>
            his vision. Cassius, who followed the doctrines of Epicurus, <note type="footnote">letter to Cassius (Ad Diversos, xv. 16) rallies him about his opinions; <lb/>
            and Cassius (xv. 19) in reply defends them. Cicero says to Cassius, <lb/>

            Britannia, the image (spectum) of Britannia will fly to his mind. <lb/>
            Lucretius expounded the Epicurean doctrines in his poem De Rerum <lb/>
            Natura. In his fourth book he treats of images (simulacra): <lb/>
            “Quaeritur in primis quare quod quoique libido <lb/>
            Venerit, extemplo mens cogitet ejus id ipsum. <lb/>
            Anne voluntatem nostram simulacra tuentur, <lb/>

            nature than the things which affect the sight, for they penetrate <lb/>
            through the pores of bodies, and inwardly move the subtile nature of <lb/>
            the mind. He then adds: <lb/>

            world. It is one of the main purposes of the poem to free men from <lb/>

            and was accustomed to dispute about them with Brutus, <lb/>
            said, “Our opinion, Brutus, is this, that we do not in <lb/>
            fact feel all things nor see them, but perception is a certain <lb/>
            flexible and deceitful thing, and the intellect is still quicker <lb/>
            to move and change it, without there being any real thing, <lb/>
            into all forms. For the fashioning of the form is like unto <lb/>
            wax, and as the soul of man possesses both the thing to be <lb/>
            fashioned and that which fashions, being the same, it has <lb/>
            of itself the power of most easily varying itself and assum­ <lb/>
            ing different forms. And this is shown by the changes <lb/>
            of our dreams in sleep, which changes the phantastic power <lb/>
            undergoes, from slight causes assuming every kind of effect <lb/>
            and image. It is the nature of the phantastic power to be <lb/>
            always in motion, and motion is to it a certain phantasy or <lb/>
            perception. In you the body being troubled naturally <lb/>
            excites and perverts the mind. But it is neither probable <lb/>
            that there are daemons, nor that, if there are, they have <lb/>
            the form of men or the voice, or that their power reaches <lb/>
            to us; and indeed I wish it were so, that we might not <lb/>
            put trust only in arms and horses and so many ships, but <lb/>
            also in the help of the gods being the leaders in most upright <lb/>
            and noble undertakings." By such arguments as these <lb/>
            Cassius attempted to calm Brutus. When the soldiers <lb/>
            were embarking, two eagles descended on the first standards <lb/>
            and were carried along with them, and accompanied the <lb/>
            soldiers, who fed them, as far as Philippi. And there, one <lb/>
            day before the battle, they flew away.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Now Brutus had subjected to him most of <lb/>
            the nations that lay in his way: and if any city or ruler <lb/>
            had been passed by, they then brought over all in their <lb/>
            progress as far as the sea opposite to Thasos. In those <lb/>
            parts Norbanus * and his troops happened to be encamped <note type="footnote"> * C. Norbanus Flaccus and L. Decidius Saxa, two legates of Auto­ <lb/>
            nius, who had been sent forward with eight legions, and had occupied <lb/>
            Philippi. The town of Philippi lay near the mountain-range of <lb/>
            Pangæus and Symbolum, which was the name of a place at which <lb/>
            Pangæus joins another mountain, that stretches up into the interior. <lb/>
            Symbolum was between Neapolis (new city) and Philippi. Neapolis <lb/>
            was on the coast opposite to Thasus: Philippi was in the mountain <lb/>
            region, and was built on a hill; west of it was a plain which extended <lb/>
            to the Strymon (Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 1205: Dion Cassius. xlvii. 35). <lb/>
            Philippi was originally called Krenides, or the Springs, then Datus, </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            in the Straits and about Symbolum; but Brutus and <lb/>
            Cassius getting round them compelled them to withdraw <lb/>
            and desert the posts. They also came very near taking <lb/>
            his force, Cæsar staying behind on account of illness; <lb/>
            and they would have done it, if Antonius had not come to <lb/>
            their aid with such wonderful expedition that Brutus could <lb/>
            scarce believe it. Cæsar arrived ten days later, and pitched <lb/>
            his camp opposite to Brutus: Antonius took his station <lb/>
            opposite to Cassius. The plain which lay between the <lb/>
            armies, the Romans called the Campi Philippi ; and it was <lb/>
            on this occasion that the largest Roman armies were <lb/>
            matched against one another. Now in numbers they were <lb/>
            not a little inferior to those of Caesar, but in show and <lb/>
            splendour of arms the forces of Brutus outshone the <lb/>
            enemy. For most of their armour was of gold, and silver <lb/>
            had been unsparingly supplied, though in other respects <lb/>
            Brutus accustomed his officers to a simple and severe <lb/>
            habit. But he thought that the wealth which they had in <lb/>
            their hands and about their bodies, would give courage to <lb/>
            the more ambitious of honour and would make those who <lb/>
            were fond of gain still more courageous, as if the weapons <lb/>
            which they held were their property.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Now Cæsar made a lustration * within his <lb/>
            lines, and distributed among the soldiers a small allowance <lb/>
            of grain and five drachmae apiece for the sacrifice; but <lb/>
            Brutus, who considered this either as proof of Cæsar's <lb/>
            poverty or his meanness, first of all performed a lustration <lb/>
            for the army under the open sky, according to the custom, <lb/>
            and then distributed a number of victims for every cohort, <lb/>
            and fifty drachmae to each man, by which he had the <lb/>
            advantage over the enemy in the good-will and zeal of his <lb/>
            troops. Notwithstanding this a bad omen, as Cassius <lb/>
            considered it, happened during the lustration; for the <lb/>
            lictor brought him his crown reversed. It is said that on <lb/>
            a former occasion, also during a certain spectacle and <note type="footnote"> and lastly Philippi by King Philippus, of Macedonia, who fortified it. <lb/>
            Appian's description of the position of Philippi is very clear. </note><note type="footnote"> * A lustration was a solemn ceremony of purification, which was per­ <lb/>
            formed on various occasions, and before a battle: see Livy, xxix. 47. <lb/>

            procession, a golden Victory belonging to Cassius, which <lb/>
            was being carried, fell down owing to the bearer slipping. <lb/>
            Besides this many birds of prey daily appeared in the <lb/>
            camp and swarms of bees were seen collecting about a <lb/>
            certain spot within the lines, which the diviners enclosed <lb/>
            in order to get rid of the superstitious fear which was <lb/>
            gradually withdrawing even Cassius himself from the <lb/>
            principles of Epicurus, and had completely cowed the <lb/>
            soldiers. Owing to this, Cassius was not eager that the <lb/>
            matter should be decided at present by a battle, and he <lb/>
            was of opinion that they should protract the war, being <lb/>
            strong in resources, but in amount of arms and men <lb/>
            inferior to the enemy. But Brutus even before this was <lb/>
            eager to settle the matter by the speediest hazard, and <lb/>
            thus either to recover freedom for his country, or to relieve <lb/>
            from their sufferings all the people who were oppressed <lb/>
            by cost and military service and requisitions. And now <lb/>
            seeing that his cavalry was successful and victorious in the <lb/>
            skirmishes and encounters of posts, his spirit was raised: <lb/>
            and some desertions to the enemy which took place and <lb/>
            imputations and suspicions against others caused many of <lb/>
            the friends of Cassius in the council to go over to the <lb/>
            opinion of Brutus. One of the friends of Brutus, Atillius, <lb/>
            opposed the opinion of Brutus and advised that they should <lb/>
            wait for the winter. On Brutus asking, Wherein he <lb/>
            thought that he would be better after a year, he replied, If <lb/>
            in nothing else, I shall live longer. Cassius was vexed at <lb/>
            this, and Atillius gave no small offence to the rest. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly it was resolved to fight on the next day.</p>
          <p>XL. Brutus went to rest after having been in high <lb/>
            spirits and engaged in philosophical discourse at supper. <lb/>
            As to Cassius, Messala * says that he supped by himself <lb/>
            with a few of his intimates, and appeared thoughtful and <lb/>
            silent, though he was not naturally so; and that after <lb/>
            supper he pressed the hand of Messala strongly and said, <note type="footnote"> * M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, of a distinguished Roman family, <lb/>
            was a son of Messala who was consul B.O. 53. After the battle of <lb/>
            Philippi he attached himself to M. Antonius, whom he deserted to <lb/>
            join Octavianus Cæsar. He fought on Cæsar's side at the battle of <lb/>
            Actium (c. 53). He died somewhere between B.C. 3 and A.D. 3. <lb/>
            Messala was a poet and an historian. His history of the Civil Wars, <lb/>
            after the death of the Dictator Caesar, was used by Plutarch. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            as he was wont when he was in friendly mood, in the <lb/>
            Greek language, " I call you to witness, Messala, that I <lb/>
            am in the same situation as Pompeius Magnus, being com­ <lb/>
            pelled to cast the die for my country's safety in a single <lb/>
            battle. However, let us have a good heart, looking to <lb/>
            fortune, which it is not right to distrust, though we may <lb/>
            have resolved badly." Messala says that these were the <lb/>
            last words that Cassius spoke to him and thereon <lb/>
            embraced him, and that he was invited * by him to supper <lb/>
            for the following day, which was his birthday. At day­ <lb/>
            break there was hung out in the lines of Brutus and of <lb/>
            Cassius the signal for the contest, a purple vest, and they <lb/>
            met between the two camps, and Cassius said: " Brutus, I <lb/>
            hope we may be victorious and live together happily all <lb/>
            the rest of our lives; but as the chief of human events <lb/>
            are the most uncertain, and if the battle results contrary <lb/>
            to our expectation, it will not be easy for us to see one <lb/>
            another, what do you intend with respect to flight or <lb/>
            death ?" Brutus replied, " When I was a young man, <lb/>
            Cassius, and inexperienced in affairs, I know not how it <lb/>
            happened that I neglected a weighty matter in philosophy. <lb/>
            I blamed Cato for killing himself, considering that it was <lb/>
            not right nor befitting a man to withdraw himself from <lb/>
            his daemon, and not to await what happens without fear, <lb/>
            but to skulk away. But now I am of a different mind in <lb/>
            the circumstances, and if the deity shall not determine in <lb/>
            our favour, I do not want to try other hopes and means, but <lb/>
            I will withdraw content with fortune, that on the Ides of <lb/>
            March I gave to my country my life and have lived another <lb/>
            life for her sake free and glorious." Whereat Cassius <lb/>
            smiled and, embracing Brutus, said, " With such thoughts <lb/>
            let us go against the enemy; for we shall either conquer <lb/>
            or we shall not fear the conquerors." After this they <lb/>
            discussed the order of battle in the presence of their <lb/>
            friends. Brutus asked Cassius to allow him to command <lb/>
            the right wing, which was supposed to be more appro­ <lb/>
            priate for Cassius on account of his experience and his age. <note type="footnote"> * See the note of Sintenis, who proposes to read <unclear>εκημένος</unclear> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκλημένον</foreign>, to prevent any ambiguity, such as Kaltwasser discovered <lb/>
            hi the passage. It was the birthday of Cassius (Appian, Civil Wars. <lb/>
            if, 113). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            But Cassius granted even this, and he commanded <lb/>
            Messala with the bravest of the legions to be posted on <lb/>
            the right. Brutus immediately led forth the cavalry <lb/>
            equipped in splendid style, and he brought up the infantry <lb/>
            with equal expedition.</p>
          <p>XLI. The soldiers of Antonius happened to be driving <lb/>
            trenches from the marshes, around which they were en­ <lb/>
            camped, into the plain and cutting off the approaches of <lb/>
            Cassius to the sea. Caesar was on the watch, not being <lb/>
            present himself by reason of sickness, but his troops were <lb/>
            there, which, however, did not expect that the enemy would <lb/>
            fight, but would merely make sallies against the works <lb/>
            and disturb the diggers with light missiles and shouts; <lb/>
            and as they were paying no attention to those who were <lb/>
            opposed to them, they were surprised at the shouts about <lb/>
            the trenches, which were indistinct and loud. In the <lb/>
            meantime billets came from Brutus to the officers in <lb/>
            which the word was written, and as he was advancing on <lb/>
            horseback before the legions and encouraging them, a <lb/>
            few had time to hear the word as it was passed along, <lb/>
            but the greater part without waiting, with one impulse <lb/>
            and shout rushed against the enemy. Some irregularity <lb/>
            arose in the lines and some separation of them through <lb/>
            this disorder, and the legion of Messala first and those <lb/>
            which were close upon it outflanked Cæsar's left; and <lb/>
            having slightly touched the soldiers on the extreme left <lb/>
            and killed no great number, but completely outflanking <lb/>
            them, fell on the camp. Caesar, as he says in his Memoirs, <lb/>
            inasmuch as one of his friends, Artorius Marcus,* had seen <lb/>
            a vision in his sleep which bade Cæsar get out of the way <lb/>
            and leave the camp, bad just before been conveyed out of it, <lb/>
            and he was supposed to have lost his life ; for the enemy <lb/>
            pierced his empty litter with javelins and spears. And <lb/>
            there was a slaughter in the camp of those who were <lb/>
            captured, and two thousand Lacedæmonians, who had <lb/>
            lately come as allies, were cut to pieces with them. <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch here quotes the Memoirs of Cæsar. It is of no great <lb/>
            importance who saw the dream, and perhaps there was no dream at <lb/>
            all. Cæsar wished to have an excuse for being out of the way of <lb/>
            danger. Dion Cassius (xlvii. 41) says that it was Cæsar's physician <lb/>
            who had the dream, but he docs not mention his name. See the <lb/>
            notes of Reimarus. </note> <pb n="438"/>
            </p>
          <p>XLII. They who had not surrounded the soldiers of <lb/>
            Caesar, but had engaged with those in front, easily put to <lb/>
            flight the enemy who were in confusion, and destroyed at <lb/>
            close quarters three legions, and they rushed into the <lb/>
            camp with the fugitives, carried along by the impetuosity <lb/>
            of success and having Brutus with them; but what the <lb/>
            victors did not see, that the critical time showed to the <lb/>
            vanquished. For pushing forward to the parts of the <lb/>
            opposite line which were exposed and broken where the <lb/>
            right wing was drawn off in the pursuit, they did not force <lb/>
            the centre but were engaged in a violent struggle; but they <lb/>
            put to flight the left, which was in disorder and ignorant <lb/>
            of what had happened, and pursuing it to the camp they <lb/>
            plundered it, neither of the Imperatores being with them. <lb/>
            For Antonius, as they say, having at the beginning avoided <lb/>
            the attack, retreated to the marsh, and Cæsar could no­ <lb/>
            where be seen, as he had fled from the camp; but some <lb/>
            showed their bloody swords to Brutus supposing they had <lb/>
            killed him, and describing his appearance and age. And <lb/>
            now the centre had repelled their opponents with great <lb/>
            slaughter; and Brutus thought that he was completely <lb/>
            victorious as Cassius thought that he was defeated. And <lb/>
            this was the only thing which ruined their cause, that <lb/>
            Brutus did not aid Cassius because he thought that he was <lb/>
            victorious, and that Cassius did not wait for Brutus be­ <lb/>
            cause he thought that he had perished; for Messala con­ <lb/>
            siders it a proof of victory that Brutus had taken three <lb/>
            eagles and many standards from the enemy, and the enemy <lb/>
            had taken nothing. Brutus now retreating after he had <lb/>
            destroyed Cæsar's camp, was surprised not to see the tent <lb/>
            of Cassius standing out conspicuous, as usual, nor the rest <lb/>
            in their place, for most of the tents had immediately been <lb/>
            thrown down and torn in pieces by the enemy when they <lb/>
            broke in. But those who thought they could see better <lb/>
            than their comrades said to Brutus that they saw many <lb/>
            helmets glittering and many silver shields moving about <lb/>
            in the camp of Cassius, and they said it did not appear to <lb/>
            them that it was either the number or the armour of those <lb/>
            were left to guard the camp, but yet there did not appear to <lb/>
            be in that direction a number of corpses such as might be <lb/>
            expected if so many legions had been defeated. This was <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            the first thing that gave Brutus an idea of the misfortune ; <lb/>
            and leaving a guard in the camp of the enemy he recalled <lb/>
            the pursuers and got them together to aid Cassius.</p>
          <p>XLIII. And it had fared thus with him. He was <lb/>
            neither pleased at seeing the first onset of the soldiers of <lb/>
            Brutus without signal and order, nor was he pleased that <lb/>
            when they were victorious they rushed straight to plunder <lb/>
            and profit, taking no pains to get round and encircle the <lb/>
            enemy. Cassius, conducting his operations rather with <lb/>
            delay and waste of time than with vigour and judgment, <lb/>
            was surrounded by the right wing of the enemy; and <lb/>
            when he saw that, as soon as the cavalry broke away in <lb/>
            flight to the sea, the infantry also were giving way, lie <lb/>
            endeavoured to stop and recall them. He also seized the <lb/>
            standard from one of the standard-bearers who was flying, <lb/>
            and fixed it in the ground before his feet, though even <lb/>
            those who were placed about his person no longer remained <lb/>
            with any spirit. In these circumstances, being pressed, ho <lb/>
            retreated with a few men to a hill which had a view to­ <lb/>
            wards the plain. He saw nothing in the plain, or with <lb/>
            difficulty the plunder of the camp, for he was weak of <lb/>
            vision; but the horsemen around him saw many approach­ <lb/>
            ing whom Brutus sent. Cassius conjectured that they <lb/>
            were enemies and were in pursuit of him; yet he sent <lb/>
            Titinius, one of those who were with him, to see. The <lb/>
            horsemen did not fail to observe him approaching, and <lb/>
            when they saw a man who was a friend, and faithful to <lb/>
            Cassius, they shouted for joy, and some of his friends leap­ <lb/>
            ing down from their horses embraced him and took his <lb/>
            hand, and the rest riding round him with joyful shouts <lb/>
            and clatter by their unmeasured rejoicing produced the <lb/>
            greatest misfortune. For Cassius was quite sure that <lb/>
            Titinius was caught by the enemy. With these words, <lb/>
            “Through love of life have I waited to see a friend seized <lb/>
            by the enemy," he retired into an empty tent dragging <lb/>
            after him one of his freed men, Pindarus, whom, in the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate affair of Crassus, he had prepared for this ex­ <lb/>
            tremity. Cassius escaped the Parthians, but now drawing <lb/>
            his cloak over his head and baring his neck he presented <lb/>
            it to be cut asunder; for the head was found separated <lb/>
            from the body. But no man saw Pindarus after the death <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            of Cassius, which made some persons think that he had <lb/>
            killed Cassius without his order. Shortly after the horse­ <lb/>
            men appeared, and Titinius crowned by them went up to <lb/>
            Cassius. But when, by the weeping and cries of his friends <lb/>
            who were lamenting and bewailing, he knew of the fate of <lb/>
            the general and of his error, he drew his sword and with <lb/>
            much upbraiding of himself for his tardiness killed him­ <lb/>
            self.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Brutus, who was acquainted with the defeat of <lb/>
            Cassius, was now approaching, and he heard of his death <lb/>
            when he was near the camp. After lamenting over the <lb/>
            body and calling Cassius the last of the Romans, as if he <lb/>
            considered that such a spirit could never again be produced <lb/>
            in Rome, he wrapped up the corpse and sent it to Thasos, <lb/>
            that no disorder might be produced by its being interred <lb/>
            there. He summoned the soldiers together and consoled <lb/>
            them ; and seeing that they were deprived of all necessaries <lb/>
            he promised them two thousand drachmae apiece in place of <lb/>
            what they had lost. The soldiers were encouraged by his <lb/>
            words and admired the magnitude of his present; and <lb/>
            they accompanied him with shouts as he went away, mag­ <lb/>
            nifying him as the only one of the four Imperatores who <lb/>
            was un vanquished in battle. And the result proved that <lb/>
            he had good reason for trusting to success in the battle; <lb/>
            for with a few legions he put to flight all those who <lb/>
            opposed him. But if he had employed all his forces in <lb/>
            the battle, and the greater part had not passed by the <lb/>
            enemy and fallen on the enemy's baggage, it is probable <lb/>
            that he would have left no part of the enemy's force un­ <lb/>
            vanquished.</p>
          <p>XLV. There fell on the side of Brutus eight thousand, <lb/>
            with the slaves who were with them in the army, whom <lb/>
            Brutus called Briges; * and of the enemy Messala says <lb/>
            that he thinks more than twice the number fell. For this <lb/>
            reason the enemy was the more dispirited, till a slave of <note type="footnote"> * The true name may be Briges. The Briges were a Thracian tribe <lb/>
            (Stephan. Byzant., <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βρίγες</foreign>), who are mentioned by Herodotus (vii. 73). <lb/>
            The Macedonian tradition was that they were the same as the <lb/>
            Phrygians ; that so long as they lived in Europe with the Macedonians <lb/>
            they kept the name of Briges, and that when they passed over into <lb/>
            Asia they were called Phryges. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            Cassius, named Demetrius, came to Antonius as soon as it <lb/>
            was evening, having taken the cloaks from the corpse, and <lb/>
            the sword; and when these were brought, they were so <lb/>
            much encouraged that at daybreak they led forth their <lb/>
            force prepared for battle. But as both his armies were in <lb/>
            an unsettled and dangerous state (for his own army being <lb/>
            full of captives required careful watching, and the army <lb/>
            of Cassius was troubled at the loss of their general, and <lb/>
            they felt somewhat of envy and dislike in consequence of <lb/>
            their defeat towards the army that had been victorious), <lb/>
            Brutus resolved to put his troops under arms, but he would <lb/>
            not fight. Of the captives, he ordered the slaves to be <lb/>
            killed, as they were moving about among the soldiers in a <lb/>
            suspicious way; but of the freemen he released some, <lb/>
            saying that they had rather been made captives by the <lb/>
            enemy, and were captives and slaves there, but with him <lb/>
            were free men and citizens; and when he saw that his <lb/>
            friends and the officers were ill-disposed towards them, he <lb/>
            saved them by concealing them and sending them away. <lb/>
            There were a certain Volumnius,* a mime, and Saculio, a <lb/>
            jester, among the prisoners, whom Brutus cared not for, <lb/>
            and his friends bringing these to him accused them of not <lb/>
            abstaining even now from speaking and jeering to insult <lb/>
            them. Brutus was silent, being occupied with other <lb/>
            thoughts, but Messala Corvinus was of opinion that they <lb/>
            should be flogged in a tent, and given up naked to the <lb/>
            generals of the enemy, that they might know what kind <lb/>
            of drinking companions and intimates they wanted in <lb/>
            their campaigns. Some of those who were present laughed; <lb/>
            but Publius Casca, who had struck Cæsar first, said, " We <lb/>
            offer no fit sacrifice to Cassius who is dead, by making <lb/>
            merry and jesting; but you, Brutus,” he said, " will show <lb/>
            what remembrance you have of the general either by <lb/>
            punishing or protecting those who will mock and revile <lb/>
            him." Upon this Brutus, greatly angered, said, " Why <lb/>
            then do you ask me, Casca, and why don't you do what <lb/>
            you like ? " This answer of Brutus they considered as an <note type="footnote">* Drumann (Geschichte Roms, i. 516, n. 84) assumes that it is P. <lb/>
            Volumnius Eutrapelus, a boon companion of Antonius. Several of <lb/>
            Cicero's letters to him are extant (Ad Div. vii. 32, 33). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            assent to the punishment of the unhappy men, whom they <lb/>
            led away and put to death.</p>
          <p>XL VI. After this Brutus gave the soldiers their present, <lb/>
            and blaming them mildly for not having waited for the <lb/>
            word, and having fallen on the enemy somewhat disorderly <lb/>
            without waiting for the order, he promised them if they <lb/>
            were victorious to give up to them for plunder and profit <lb/>
            two cities, Thessalonica * and Lacedaemon. This is the <lb/>
            only thing in the life of Brutus which he is charged with <lb/>
            that admits of no defence, though Antonius and Caesar paid <lb/>
            to their soldiers a much more terrible price as the reward <lb/>
            of their victories, for they drove the old settlers out of <lb/>
            nearly the whole of Italy, that their soldiers might have <lb/>
            land and cities to which they had no claim. But with <lb/>
            Antonius and Cæsar dominion and power was the end <lb/>
            which they proposed to themselves in the war, while <lb/>
            Brutus, owing to his reputation for virtue, was not allowed <lb/>
            by the many either to conquer or to save his life otherwise <lb/>
            than by honourable and just means; and especially now <lb/>
            that Cassius was dead, who had the imputation of urging <lb/>
            Brutus on to some of his more violent acts. But as at sea <lb/>
            when the helm is broken, they attempt to nail on other <note type="footnote">* Plutarch has handled the character of Brutus with partiality. <lb/>
            He could not be ignorant of his love of money and of the oppressive <lb/>
            manner in which lie treated his unlucky creditors. Drumann (Junii, <lb/>
            p. 20, &amp;c.) has collected the evidence on this point. Though Brutus <lb/>
            was an austere man and affected philosophy, his character is not free <lb/>
            from the imputation of ingratitude to Caesar, love of power, and avarice. <lb/>
            He seems to have been one of those who deceive themselves into a <lb/>
            belief of their own virtues, because they are free from other people's <lb/>
            vices. The promise of plunder to his soldiers is not excusable <lb/>
            because Antonius and Cæsar did worse than he intended to do. <lb/>
            Plutarch here alludes to many of the Italians being driven out of <lb/>
            their lands, which were given to the soldiers who had fought on the <lb/>
            side of Cæsar and Antonius at Philippi. The misery that was <lb/>
            occasioned by this measure was one of the chief evils of the Civil <lb/>
            Wars. The slaughter in war chiefly affected the soldiers themselves, <lb/>
            and if both armies had been destroyed, the people would only have <lb/>
            been the better for it. The misery that arose from the ejection of the <lb/>
            hard-working husbandmen reached to their wives and children. But <lb/>
            a country which had a large army on foot which is no longer wanted, <lb/>
            must either pay them out of taxes and plunder, or have a revolution. <lb/>
            Necessity was the excuse for Cæsar and Antonius, and the same <lb/>
            necessity would have been the excuse of Brutus, if he had been <lb/>
            victorious. Defeat saved him from this necessity. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            pieces of wood, and to fit them, not skilfully indeed, but <lb/>
            as well as they can under circumstances, fighting against the <lb/>
            necessity, so Brutus with so great a force around him, and <lb/>
            in so hazardous a state of affairs, having no commander of <lb/>
            equal weight with himself, was compelled to employ those <lb/>
            who were with him, and to do and say many things accord <lb/>
            ing to their pleasure. And he judged it fit to do whatever <lb/>
            he thought would improve the disposition of the soldiers <lb/>
            of Cassius, for they were difficult to manage : in the camp <lb/>
            being unruly for want of discipline, and towards the enemy <lb/>
            having a feeling of cowardice by reason of their defeat.</p>
          <p>XLVII. Affairs were no better with Caesar and <lb/>
            Antonius, for they were scantily supplied with provisions, <lb/>
            and owing to the camp being pitched in a hollow, they <lb/>
            expected a bad winter. For being among marshes and <lb/>
            the autumnal rains coming on after the battle, they had <lb/>
            their tents filled with mud and with water which froze <lb/>
            immediately through the cold. While they were in this <lb/>
            condition, news arrived of the misfortune that had befallen <lb/>
            their forces at sea. For the ships of Brutus * fell upon them, <lb/>
            and destroyed a large force that was coming to Cæsar <lb/>
            from Italy, and only a very few of the men escaped, <lb/>
            who were compelled by famine to eat the sails and ropes. <lb/>
            On hearing this news they were eager to settle the matter <lb/>
            by a battle before Brutus was aware of the great good <lb/>
            fortune that had come to him; for it happened that in the <lb/>
            same day the battle by land and the battle by sea were <lb/>
            determined. But by some chance rather than through <lb/>
            the fault of the commanders of the fleet, Brutus was <lb/>
            ignorant of the success, though twenty days had elapsed. <lb/>
            For otherwise he would not have gone out to a second battle <lb/>
            when he was provided with all necessaries for his army for <lb/>
            a long time and was posted in a good position, wherein he <lb/>
            could have maintained his army in the winter free from all <lb/>
            suffering and safe against the attacks of the enemy, and <lb/>
            by being master of the sea, and having defeated by land <lb/>
            the troops opposed to him, was in high hopes and spirits. <lb/>
            But affairs, as it appears, being no longer governable by a <note type="footnote"> * The ships which were bringing aid to Cæsar from Brundusium <lb/>
            under the command of Domitius Calvinus. They were met and <lb/>
            defeated by L. Statius Murcus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            number, and requiring a monarchy, the deity wishing to <lb/>
            lead away and to remove the only person who stood in the <lb/>
            way of him who was able to govern, cut off the news of <lb/>
            that good fortune, though it came exceeding near to being <lb/>
            communicated to Brutus. For the day before that on <lb/>
            which he was going to fight, and late in the day, there <lb/>
            came one Clodius, a deserter from the enemy, who <lb/>
            reported, that Cæsar was eager to come to a decisive <lb/>
            contest because he had heard of the destruction of his <lb/>
            armament. The man got no credit for his report nor did <lb/>
            he come into the presence of Brutus, being altogether <lb/>
            despised as one who had heard no well-founded news, or <lb/>
            reported falsehood to get favour.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. In that night it is said that the phantom <lb/>
            again appeared to Brutus, and displaying the same appear­ <lb/>
            ance said nothing and went away. But Publius Volum­ <lb/>
            nius,* a philosopher and one who accompanied Brutus in <lb/>
            his campaign from the first, says that this was not the <lb/>
            sign; but he says that the first eagle was covered with bees, <lb/>
            and from the arm of one of the centurions an oil of roses <lb/>
            spontaneously burst out, and though they often rubbed it <lb/>
            off and wiped it away, it was all to no use. Further, <lb/>
            before the battle, two eagles met and fought in the space <lb/>
            between the armies, and a silence past belief filled the <lb/>
            plain while all were looking on, but at last the eagle which <lb/>
            was on the side of Brutus gave way and fled. The <lb/>
            Ethiopian became notorious, he who met the eagle-bearer <lb/>
            as soon as the gate was opened, and was cut down with <lb/>
            their swords by the soldiers, who considered it a bad omen.</p>
          <p>XLIX. After Brutus had made the line advance, and <lb/>
            had placed it in front of the enemy, he paused some time, <lb/>
            for suspicions reached him and information against certain <lb/>
            persons while he was inspecting the army; and he observed <lb/>
            that the cavalry were not very eager to begin the battle, <lb/>
            but were still waiting for the infantry to commence the <lb/>
            attack. All of a sudden, a man of military skill, who had <lb/>
            been particularly distinguished for his courage, rode past <lb/>
            Brutus himself and passed over to the enemy : his name <lb/>
            was Camulatus. Brutus was greatly pained at seeing this, <note type="footnote"> * Nothing seems to be known about him. Of course he is not the <lb/>
            Volumnius meutioned in o. 45. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            and partly through passion, partly through fear of greater <lb/>
            change and treachery, he forthwith led his men against <lb/>
            the enemy, the sun now going down to the ninth hour. <lb/>
            Brutus had the advantage with his own troops, and he <lb/>
            pushed on, pressing upon the left wing of the enemy which <lb/>
            gave way, and the cavalry supported him by charging <lb/>
            together with the infantry the disordered ranks; but the <lb/>
            other wing, which the commanders extended for fear of <lb/>
            being surrounded, was inferior in numbers, and was drawn <lb/>
            out in the centre, and thus becoming weak, did not resist <lb/>
            the enemy, but fled first. The enemy, having broken this <lb/>
            wing, immediately surrounded Brutus, who displayed all <lb/>
            the virtues of a general and a soldier, both in his personal <lb/>
            exertions, and his prudent measures in the midst of danger <lb/>
            to secure victory; but he was damaged by that circumstance <lb/>
            whereby he gained advantage in the former battle. For <lb/>
            in that battle the part of the enemy which was defeated <lb/>
            had perished; but few perished of the troops of Cassius, <lb/>
            though they were put to flight, and those who escaped <lb/>
            being very timid through their former defeat, filled the chief <lb/>
            part of the army with despondency and confusion. On this <lb/>
            occasion also, Marcus the son of Cato,* fighting among the <lb/>
            noblest and bravest of the youth, though hard pressed, did <lb/>
            not yield nor flee, but laying about him and calling out <lb/>
            who he was, and his father's name, he fell on a heap of <lb/>
            the enemy's slain. There fell, too, the bravest of the men, <lb/>
            exposing themselves in defence of Brutus.</p>
          <p>L. Among the intimates of Brutus was one Lucilius,t <lb/>
            a good man. Observing that some barbarian horsemen <lb/>
            in their pursuit paid no regal d to the rest, but rode at full <lb/>
            speed after Brutus, he resolved at his own risk to stop <lb/>
            them. And being a little in the rear he said that he was <lb/>
            Brutus, and he gained belief by praying them to take him <lb/>
            to Antonius, because he feared Cæsar, but trusted in <lb/>
            Antonius. The barbarians delighted at their success, and <lb/>
            considering that they had surprising good luck, conducted <lb/>
            the man, and as it was now growing dark, sent forward <lb/>
            some of their number as messengers to Antonius. Antonius, <lb/>
            much pleased, went to meet those who were conducting <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Cato the Younger, a. 78. </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Antonius, c. 70. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            Lucilius; and those who heard that Brutus was being <lb/>
            brought alive flocked together, some pitying him for his <lb/>
            ill fortune, and others thinking it unworthy of his fame to <lb/>
            let himself be taken by barbarians through love of life. <lb/>
            When they were near, Antonius stopped, being doubtful <lb/>
            how he should receive Brutus, but Lucilius, approaching <lb/>
            with a cheerful countenance, said, " Antonius, no enemy <lb/>
            has taken Marcus Brutus, nor will: may fortune never <lb/>
            have such a victory over virtue. But he will be found, <lb/>
            whether alive or dead, in a condition worthy of himself. <lb/>
            But I who have deceived your soldiers am come to suffer, <lb/>
            and I deprecate no punishment, however severe, for what I <lb/>
            have done." When Lucilius had said this, and all were in <lb/>
            amaze, Antonius, looking on those who conducted Lucilius, <lb/>
            said, “ I suppose, fellow soldiers, you are vexed at your <lb/>
            mistake, and think that you have been grossly tricked. <lb/>
            But be assured that you have taken a better prey than <lb/>
            that which you were in search of. For while you were <lb/>
            seeking for an enemy, you have brought us a friend ; for <lb/>
            as to Brutus, I know not by the gods, what I should have <lb/>
            done with him if he were alive, but such men as this, I <lb/>
            pray that I may have as friends rather than as enemies." <lb/>
            Saying this he embraced Lucilius and for the time placed <lb/>
            him with one of his friends, but he afterwards employed <lb/>
            him, and found him in everything faithful and true.</p>
          <p>LI. Brutus, having crossed a certain stream, the banks <lb/>
            of which were lined with wood and steep, just when it <lb/>
            began to be dark, did not advance far, but seating <lb/>
            himself in a hollow spot where there was a large rock <lb/>
            spread out, with a few of his officers and friends about <lb/>
            him, first looked up to the heavens which were full of <lb/>
            stars, and uttered two verses, one of which Volumnius has <lb/>
            recorded: <lb/>
            “ Forget not,* Jove, the author of these ills;” <note type="footnote"> * The verse is from the Medea of Euripides (v. 332), in which Medea <lb/>
            Is cursing her faithless husband Jason. The educated Romans were <lb/>
            familiar with the Greek dramatists, whom they often quoted. (Com­ <lb/>
            pare the Life of Pompeius, c. 78.) Appian says that Brutus intended <lb/>
            to apply this line to Antonius (Civil Wars, iv. 130). <lb/>
            The other verse, which Volumnius forgot, was remembered by some­ <lb/>
            body else, if it be the verse of which Floras (iv. 7) has recorded the</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            but the other he says that he forgot. After a while <lb/>
            naming each of his companions who had fallen -in battle <lb/>
            before his eyes, he grieved most over the memory of <lb/>
            Flavius and Labeo. Labeo was his lieutenant, and <lb/>
            Flavius the chief of the engineers. In the meantime one <lb/>
            who was thirsty himself and saw that Brutus was in the <lb/>
            same plight, took a helmet and ran down to the river. <lb/>
            As a noise from the opposite side reached their ears, <lb/>
            Volumnius went forward to see, and Dardanus the shield- <lb/>
            bearer with him. Returning after a while they asked about <lb/>
            the water; and Brutus, smiling with a very friendly ex­ <lb/>
            pression on Volumnius, said, “ It is drunk up, but some <lb/>
            more shall be brought for you." The same person was <lb/>
            sent, but he was in danger of being taken by the enemy <lb/>
            and escaped with difficulty after being wounded. As <lb/>
            Brutus conjectured that no great number of his men had <lb/>
            fallen, Statyllius* undertook to make his way secretly <lb/>
            through the enemy, for it was not possible in any other <lb/>
            way, and to inspect the camp, and after raising a fire- <lb/>
            signal, if he should find all safe there, to come back to <lb/>
            him. The fire-signal was raised, for Statyllius got to the <lb/>
            camp, but as a long time elapsed and he did not return, <lb/>
            Brutus said, “ If Statyllius is alive he will come." But it <lb/>
            happened that, as he was returning, he fell among the <lb/>
            enemy and was killed.</p>
          <p>LII.† In the course of the night, Brutus, as he sat on <note type="footnote">substance, “ that virtue is not a reality, but a name." Dion Cassius <lb/>
            (xlvii. 49. and the note of Reimarus) also has recorded two Greek <lb/>
            verses which Brutus is said to have uttered; but he does not mention <lb/>
            the verse which Plutarch cites. The substance of the two verses <lb/>
            cited by Dion is this: <lb/>
            “ Poor virtue, empty name, whom I have serv'd <lb/>
            As a true mistress; thou art fortune's slave." <lb/>
            Volumnius might not choose to remember these verses, as Drumann <lb/>
            suggests, in order to save the credit of his friend. </note><note type="footnote"> * See c. 11, and the Life of the younger Cato, c. 65, 73. </note><note type="footnote"> t Brutus was forty-three years of age when he died. Velleius <lb/>
            (ii. 72) says that he was in his thirty-seventh year, which is a mistake. </note><note type="footnote"> The character of Brutus requires a special notice. It is easy <lb/>
            enough to write a character of a man, but not easy to write a true one. <lb/>
            Michelet (Histoire de la Revolution Française, ii. 545), speaking of the <lb/>
            chief actors of the Revolution in 1789. '90, '91, says: “We have rarely </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            the ground, turned to his slave Kleitus and spoke to him <lb/>
            But as Kleitus kept silence and shed tears, Brutus drew <note type="footnote"> given a judgment entire, indistinct, no portrait properly speaking; all, <lb/>
            almost all, are unjust; resulting from a mean which is taken between <lb/>
            this and that moment in a person's life, between the good and the bad, <lb/>
            neutralising the one by the other, and making both false. We have <lb/>
            judged the acts, as they present themselves, day by day, hour by hour. <lb/>
            We have given a date to our judgments; and this has allowed us often <lb/>
            to praise men, whom at a later time we shall have to blame. Criticism, <lb/>
            forgetful and harsh, too often condemns beginnings which are laudable, <lb/>
            having in view the end which it knows, of which it has a view beforehand. <lb/>
            But we do not choose to know this end; whatever this man may do to­ <lb/>
            morrow, we note for his advantage the good which he does to-day: the <lb/>
            end will come soon enough." This is the true method of writing <lb/>
            history; this is the true method of judging men. Unfortunately we <lb/>
            cannot trace the career of many individuals with that particularity of <lb/>
            date and circumstance which would enable us to do justice. Plutarch <lb/>
            does not draw characters in the mass in the modern way: he gives us <lb/>
            both the good and the bad, in detail: but with little regard sometimes <lb/>
            to time and circumstance. He has treated Brutus with partiality: he <lb/>
            finds only one act in his life to condemn (chap. 46). The great condem­ <lb/>
            nation of Brutus is, that acting in the name of virtue, he did not know <lb/>
            what it was; that fighting for his country, he was fighting for a party ; <lb/>
            his Roman republic was a republic of aristocrats; his people was a <lb/>
            fraction of the Roman citizens; he conceived no scheme for regenerating <lb/>
            a whole nation: he engaged in a death struggle in which we can <lb/>
            feel no sympathy. His name is an idle abused theme for rhetoric; and <lb/>
            his portrait must be drawn, ill or well, that the world may be dis­ <lb/>
            abused. </note><note type="footnote"> Drumann (Geschichte Roms, Junii, p. 34) has carefully collected the <lb/>
            acts of Brutus; and he has judged him severely, and, I think, truly. </note><note type="footnote"> Brutus had moderate abilities, with great industry and much learn­ <lb/>
            ing : he had no merit as a general, but he had the courage of a soldier, <lb/>
            he had the reputation of virtue, and he was free from many of the <lb/>
            vices of his contemporaries; he was sober and temperate. Of enlarged <lb/>
            political views he had none ; there is not a sign of his being superior <lb/>
            in this respect to the mass of his contemporaries. When the Civil <lb/>
            War broke out, he joined Pompeius, though Pompeius had murdered <lb/>
            his father. If he gave up his private enmity, as Plutarch says, for <lb/>
            what he believed to be the better cause, the sacrifice was honourable : <lb/>
            if there were other motives, and I believe there were, his choice of his <lb/>
            party does him no credit. His conspiracy against Cæsar can only be <lb/>
            justified by those, if there are such, who think that a usurper ought to <lb/>
            be got rid of in any way. But if a man is to be murdered, one does <lb/>
            not expect those to take a part in the act who, after being enemies <lb/>
            have received favours from him, and professed to be friends. The <lb/>
            murderers should at least be a man's declared enemies who have just <lb/>
            wrongs to avenge. Though Brutus was dissatisfied with things <lb/>
            under Cæsar, he was not the first mover in the conspiracy. He was</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            to him his shield-bearer Dardanus, and privately said some­ <lb/>
            thing to him. At last employing the Greek language he <note type="footnote"> worked upon by others, who knew that his character and personal <lb/>
            relation to Cæsar would in a measure sanctify the deed; and by their <lb/>
            persuasion, not his own resolve, he became an assassin in the name of <lb/>
            freedom, which meant the triumph of his party, and in the name of <lb/>
            virtue, which meant nothing. </note><note type="footnote"> The act was bad in Brutus as an act of treachery; and it was bad <lb/>
            as an act of policy. It failed in its object-the success of a party, <lb/>
            because the death of Cæsar was not enough; other victims were <lb/>
            necessary, and Brutus would not have them. He put himself at the <lb/>
            head of a plot, in which there was no plan: he dreamed of success and <lb/>
            forgot the means. He mistook the circumstances of the times and the <lb/>
            character of the men. His conduct after the murder was feeble and <lb/>
            uncertain; and it was also as illegal as the usurpation of Cæsar. <lb/>
            " He left Rome as praetor without the permission of the Senate; he <lb/>
            took possession of a province which, even according to Cicero's <lb/>
            testimony, had been assigned to another; he arbitrarily passed <lb/>
            beyond the boundaries of his province, and set his effigy on the coins." <lb/>
            (Drumann.) He attacked the Bessi in order to give his soldiers <lb/>
            booty, and he plundered Asia to get money for the conflict against <lb/>
            Cæsar and Antonius, for the mastery of Rome and Italy. The means <lb/>
            that he had at his disposal show that he robbed without measure and <lb/>
            without mercy; and never was greater tyranny exercised over helpless <lb/>
            people in the name of liberty than the wretched inhabitants of Asia <lb/>
            experienced from Brutus the “ Liberator " and Cassius “ the last of the <lb/>
            Romans." But all these great resources were thrown away in an ill­ <lb/>
            conceived and worse executed campaign. </note><note type="footnote"> Temperance, industry, and unwillingness to shed blood are noble <lb/>
            qualities in a citizen and a soldier ; and Brutus possessed them. But <lb/>
            great wealth gotten by ill means is an eternal reproach ; and the <lb/>
            trade of money-lending, carried on in the names of others, with unre­ <lb/>
            lenting greediness, is both avarice and hypocrisy. Cicero, the friend <lb/>
            of Brutus, is the witness for his wealth, and for his unworthy means to <lb/>
            increase it. </note><note type="footnote"> Reflecting men in all ages have a philosophy. With the educated <lb/>
            Greeks and Romans, philosophy was religion. The vulgar belief, <lb/>
            under whatever name it may be, is never the belief of those who have <lb/>
            leisure for reflection. The vulgar rich and vulgar poor are immersed in <lb/>
            sense: the man of reflection strives to emerge from it. To him the <lb/>
            things which are seen are only the shadows of the unseen; forms with­ <lb/>
            out substance, but the evidence of the substantial: “ for the invisible <lb/>
            things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being <lb/>
            understood by the things that are made" (Epistle to the Romans, i. <lb/>
            20). Brutus was from his youth up a student of philosophy and well <lb/>
            versed in the systems of the Greeks. Untiring industry and a strong <lb/>
            memory had stored his mind with the thoughts of others, but he had <lb/>
            not capacity enough to draw profit from his intellectual as he did from <lb/>
            his golden treasures. His mind was a barren field on which no culture </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            addressed Volumnius and reminded them of their philo­ <lb/>
            sophical studies and discipline, and he urged him to put <note type="footnote"> could raise an abundant crop. His wisdom was the thoughts of others, <lb/>
            and he had ever ready in his mouth something that others had said. But <lb/>
            to utter other men’s wisdom is not enough: a man must make it his own <lb/>
            by the labour of independent thought. Philosophy and superstition <lb/>
            were blended in his mind, and they formed a chaos in his bewildered <lb/>
            brain, as they always will do; and the product is Gorgons and Hydras <lb/>
            and Chimeras dire. In the still of night phantoms floated before his <lb/>
            wasted strength and wakeful eyes; perhaps the vision of him, the <lb/>
            generous and the brave, who had saved the life of an enemy in battle, <lb/>
            and fell by his hand in the midst of peace. Conscience was his tor. <lb/>
            mentor, for truth was stronger than the illusions of self-imputed virtue. <lb/>
            Though Brutus had condemned Cato's death, he died by his own hand, <lb/>
            not with the stubborn resolve of Cato, who would not yield to a usur­ <lb/>
            per, but merely to escape from his enemies. A Roman might be par­ <lb/>
            doned for not choosing to become the prisoner of a Roman, but his <lb/>
            grave should have been the battle-field, and the instrument should <lb/>
            have been the hands of those who were fighting against the cause which <lb/>
            he proclaimed to be righteous aud just. Cato's son bettered his father's <lb/>
            example: he died on the plain of Philippi by the sword of the enemy. <lb/>
            Brutus died without belief in the existence of that virtue which he <lb/>
            had affected to follow: the triumph of a wrongful cause, as he con­ <lb/>
            ceived it, was a proof that virtue was an empty name. He forgot the <lb/>
            transitory nature of all individual existences, and thought that justice <lb/>
            perished with him. But a true philosopher does not make himself a <lb/>
            central point, nor his own misfortunes a final catastrophe. He looks both <lb/>
            backwards and forwards, to the past and the future, and views himself <lb/>
            as a small link in the great chain of events which holds all things <lb/>
            together. Brutus died in despair, with the courage, but not with the <lb/>
            faith, of a martyr. </note><note type="footnote"> When men talk of tyranny and rise against it, the name of Brutus <lb/>
            is invoked; a mere name and nothing else. What single act is there <lb/>
            in the man's life which promised the regeneration of his country and <lb/>
            the freedom of mankind? Like other Romans, he only thought of <lb/>
            maintaining the supremacy of Rome; his ideas were no larger than <lb/>
            theirs; he had no sympathy for those whom Rome governed and op­ <lb/>
            pressed. For his country, he had nothing to propose; its worn-out <lb/>
            political constitution he would maintain, not amend; indeed, amend­ <lb/>
            ment was impossible. Probably he dreaded anarchy and the dissolu­ <lb/>
            tion of social order, for that would have released his creditors and <lb/>
            confiscated his valuable estates. But Cæsar’s usurpation was not an <lb/>
            anarchy: it was a monarchy, a sole rule; and Brutus, who was am­ <lb/>
            bitious, could not endure that. It may be said that if the political <lb/>
            views of Brutus were narrow, he was only like most of his countrymen. <lb/>
            But why then is he exalted, and why is his name invoked ? What <lb/>
            single title had he to distinction except what Cæsar gave him ? A roan <lb/>
            of unknown family, the son of a woman whom Cæsar had debauched, <lb/>
            pardoned after fighting against his mother’s lover, raised by him to the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            his hand to his sword and to aid him in the thrust. <lb/>
            Volumnius refusing, and the rest being in the same dispose <note type="footnote"> prætorship, and honoured with Cæsar’s friendship—he has owed his dis­ <lb/>
            tinction to nothing else than murdering the man whose genius he could <lb/>
            not appreciate, but whose favours he had enjoyed. </note><note type="footnote"> His spurious philosophy has helped to save him from the detestation <lb/>
            which is his due; but the false garb should be stripped off. A stoic, <lb/>
            an ascetic, and nothing more, is a mere negation. The active virtues <lb/>
            of Brutus are not recorded. If he sometimes did an act of public <lb/>
            justice (c. 35), it was not more than many other Romans have done. To <lb/>
            reduce this philosopher to his true level, we ask, what did lie say or do <lb/>
            that showed a sympathy with all mankind ? Where is the evidence <lb/>
            that he had the feeling of justice which alone can regenerate a nation ? <lb/>
            But it may be said, why seek in a Roman of his age what we cannot <lb/>
            expect to find ? Why then elevate him above the rest of his age and <lb/>
            consecrate his name? Why make a hero of him who murdered his <lb/>
            benefactor, and then ran away from the city which he was to save­ <lb/>
            from we know not what ? And why make a virtuous man of him who <lb/>
            was only austere, and who did not believe in the virtues that he pro­ <lb/>
            fessed ? As to statesmanship, nobody has claimed that for him yet. </note><note type="footnote"> “ The deputy of Arras, poor, and despised even by his own party, won <lb/>
            the confidence of the people by their belief in his probity: and he de­ <lb/>
            served it. Fanatical and narrow-minded, he was still a man of princi­ <lb/>
            ples. Untiring industry, unshaken faith, and poverty, the guarantee <lb/>
            of his probity, raised him slowly to distinction, and enabled him to <lb/>
            destroy all who stood between him and the realisation of an unbending <lb/>
            theory. Though he had sacrificed the lives of others, he scorned to <lb/>
            save his own by doing what would have contradicted his principles: he <lb/>
            respected the form of legality, when its substance no longer existed, <lb/>
            and refused to sanction force when it would have been used for his <lb/>
            own protection " (Lamartine, Hi8toire des Girondins, live 61, ix.). A <lb/>
            great and memorable example of crime, of fanaticism, and of virtue; <lb/>
            of a career commenced in the cause of justice, in truth, faith and sin­ <lb/>
            cerity ; of a man who did believe in virtue, and yet spoiled the cause <lb/>
            in which he embarked, and left behind him a name for universal <lb/>
            execration. </note><note type="footnote"> Treachery at home, enmity abroad, and misconduct in its own <lb/>
            leaders, made the French Revolution result in anarchy, and then in a <lb/>
            tyranny. The Civil Wars of Rome resulted in a monarchy, and there <lb/>
            was nothing else in which they could end. The Roman monarchy on <lb/>
            the Empire was a natural birth. The French Empire was an abortion. <lb/>
            The Roman Empire was the proper growth of the ages that had pre­ <lb/>

            The genius of Augustus, often ill appreciated, is demonstrated by the <lb/>
            results of his policy. He restored order to a distracted state and <lb/>

            tion, and some one saying that they must not stay there, out <lb/>
            fly, Brutus sprang up and said, " Certainly we must fly, <lb/>
            yet not with the feet, but with the hands." Offering his <lb/>
            right hand to each with a cheerful countenance, he said <lb/>
            that he felt great pleasure, that no one of his friends <lb/>
            had deceived him, but he blamed fortune with respect to <lb/>
            his country; as for himself, he considered that he was <lb/>
            happier than the conquerors, in that not yesterday nor <lb/>
            yet recently, but even now he left behind him a reputa­ <lb/>
            tion for virtue, which those would not leave behind who <lb/>
            gained the victory by arms or by money, nor would they <lb/>
            make people think that unjust and vile men who had de­ <lb/>
            stroyed just and upright men did not rule unmeritedly. <lb/>
            After entreating and urging them to save themselves, he <lb/>
            retired a little farther with two or three, among whom was <lb/>
            Strato who had become intimate with him from being his <lb/>
            instructor in rhetoric. Putting Stiato close to him, and <lb/>
            pressing the bare sword with both hands on the handle, <lb/>
            he fell upon it and died. Others say that it was not <lb/>
            Brutus himself, but Strato who, at the earnest request of <lb/>
            Brutus, held the sword under him, averting his eyes, and <lb/>
            that Brutus throwing his breast upon it with violence, and <lb/>
            piercing it through, quickly died.</p>
          <p>LIII. Messala* who was a friend of Brutus and became <lb/>
            reconciled to Cæsar, once on a time when Cæsar was at <lb/>
            leisure, brought this Strato to him, and with tears in his <lb/>
            eyes said, “ This, Cæsar, is the man who did the last <lb/>
            service to my Brutus." Caesar received Strato and kept <lb/>
            him about him, and Strato was one of the Greeks who <lb/>
            showed themselves brave men in difficulties, and in the <lb/>
            battle at Actium. They say that Messala himself being <lb/>
            afterwards commended by Cæsar because, though he had <lb/>
            been one of their greatest enemies at Philippi for the sake <lb/>
            of Brutus, he had shown himself most zealous at Actium, <lb/>
            replied, " Yes, Caesar, I have always been on the better and <note type="footnote"> greatness resting on its ancient foundations, only crumbled beneath <lb/>
            the assaults that time and new circumstances make against all political <lb/>
            institutions. </note><note type="footnote"> * Velleius (ii. 71, quoted by Kaltwasser) states that some of the par­ <lb/>
            tisans of Brutus and Cassius wished Messala to put himself at the head <lb/>
            of their party, but he declined to try the fortune of another contest. </note> <lb/>

            juster side." When Antonius found the body of Brutus,* he <lb/>
            ordered it to be wrapped in the most costly of his purple <lb/>
            vests; and when he afterwards discovered that the purple <lb/>
            vest was stolen, he put the thief to death. The ashes he <lb/>
            sent to Servilia, the mother of Brutus. Nikolaus t the <lb/>
            philosopher and Valerius Maximus ‡ relate that Porcia the <lb/>
            wife of Brutus being desirous to die, which none of her <lb/>
            friends would allow, but kept close and watched her, <lb/>
            snatched burning embers from the fire, and closing her <lb/>
            mouth, so died. Yet there is extant a letter of Brutus § to his <lb/>
            friends in which he upbraids them and laments about <lb/>
            Porcia, that she was neglected by them and had deter­ <lb/>
            mined to die because of her sufferings from disease. <lb/>
            Nikolaus therefore appears not to have known the time, <lb/>
            since the letter, if it is genuine, informs us of the malady, <lb/>
            and the love of the woman and the manner of her death. <note type="footnote"> * Compare the Life of Antonius, c. 22. Appian (Civil Wars, iv. <lb/>
            135) makes the same statement as Plutarch about the body of Brutus. <lb/>
            It is not inconsistent with this that his head was cut off in order to be <lb/>
            sent to Rome and thrown at the feet of Cæsar's statue, as Suetonius <lb/>
            says (Sueton. August. 13). Dion Cassius adds (xlvii. 49) that in the <lb/>
            passage from Dyrrachium a storm came on and the head was thrown <lb/>
            into the sea. </note><note type="footnote"> t Nikolaus of Damascus, a Peripatetic philosopher, and a friend of <lb/>

            fragment of his Life of Augustus. The best edition is that of J. C. <lb/>

            There are a few letters in the collection of Cicero which are genuine, <lb/>
            but the single book of letters to Brutus (M. Tullii Ciceronis Episto­ <lb/>
            lorum ad Brutum Liber Singularis) is condemned as a forgery by the <lb/>
            best critics. It contains letters of Cicero to Brutus, and of Brutus to <lb/>
            Cicero ; and a letter of Brutus to Attious. Genuine letters of Brutua, <lb/>
            written day by day, like those of Cicero, would have formed the best <lb/>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF DION AND BRUTUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. Among the glories of these two men's lives, it is <lb/>
            especially to be noticed, that each of them started from <lb/>
            small beginnings, and yet raised himself to the highest <lb/>
            position in the state; and this fact is peculiarly honourable <lb/>
            to Dion. Brutus owed much of his success to the help of <lb/>
            Caseins, who, though less trustworthy than Brutus in <lb/>
            matters of virtue and honour, gave equal proofs of courage, <lb/>
            skill, and energy in war, while some writers go so far as <lb/>
            to give him the entire credit of the plot against Cæsar, <lb/>
            and say that Brutus had no share in it. Dion on the <lb/>
            other hand was obliged to provide himself with friends <lb/>
            and fellow conspirators, no less than with arms, ships, and <lb/>
            soldiers. Furthermore, Dion did not, like Brutus, gain <lb/>
            wealth and power by the revolution and war which he <lb/>
            began, but even gave his own money to support the war, <lb/>
            and spent the property on which he might have lived <lb/>
            comfortably in exile in order to make his countrymen free. <lb/>
            We must remember, also, that Brutus and Cassius could <lb/>
            not have remained quiet after they left Rome, for they <lb/>
            had been condemned to death, and were being pursued, so <lb/>
            that they were forced to fight in their own defence. <lb/>
            When they risked their lives in battle it was for themselves <lb/>
            that they did so more than for their countrymen, whereas <lb/>
            Dion lived in exile more happily than the despot who <lb/>
            banished him, and nevertheless exposed himself to so <lb/>
            terrible a hazard in order to set Sicily free.</p>
          <p>II. Yet it was not the same thing to free the Syracusana <lb/>
            from Dionysius and to rid the Romans of Cæsar. Dionysius <lb/>
            never denied that he was a despot, and had inflicted <lb/>
            countless miseries upon Sicily: while the government of <lb/>
            Cæsar, though its creation gave great offence, yet when it <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            had been accepted and had overcome all opposition seemed <lb/>
            to be a despotism merely in name, for Cæsar did nothing <lb/>
            cruel or arbitrary, and rather appeared to have been sent <lb/>
            by heaven like a physician, to establish an absolute mon­ <lb/>
            archy in as mild a form as possible, at a time when that <lb/>
            remedy was necessary for Rome. In consequence of this <lb/>
            the people of Rome were grieved at the death of Cæsar, <lb/>
            and showed themselves harsh and inexorable to his mur­ <lb/>
            derers; while the severest charges which were brought <lb/>
            against Dion by his countrymen were that he had allowed <lb/>
            Dionysius to escape from Syracuse, and that he had not <lb/>
            destroyed the tomb of the former despot.</p>
          <p>III. In actual warfare Dion proved himself a faultless <lb/>
            general, as he succeeded brilliantly in every enterprise <lb/>
            planned by himself, and was able to remedy the failures <lb/>
            caused by the misconduct of others ; while Brutus seems <lb/>
            not to have been wise in engaging in the last decisive <lb/>
            battle, and when it was lost did not attempt to retrieve his <lb/>
            fortunes, but gave himself up to despair, showing even less <lb/>
            confidence than Pompeius. Yet, his position was far from <lb/>
            hopeless, for he still retained a large part of his army, and <lb/>
            a fleet which gave him entire command of the sea. Again, <lb/>
            Dion cannot be accused of any crime like that which is the <lb/>
            greatest blot upon the character of Brutus, who after his <lb/>
            life had been saved by Cæsar's goodness, and he had been <lb/>
            allowed to save as many as he pleased of his fellow captives, <lb/>
            after also he had been regarded by Cæsar as his friend, and <lb/>
            had been promoted by Cæsar above many others, murdered <lb/>
            his benefactor. On the contrary, Dion was the relative <lb/>
            and friend of Dionysius, and assisted him in maintaining <lb/>
            his government, and it was not until he was expelled from <lb/>
            his country, his wife wronged, and his property confiscated, <lb/>
            that he openly began a most just and lawful war against <lb/>
            the despot. Is there not, however, another view of this <lb/>
            question? That hatred of despotism and wrong which <lb/>
            is so highly honoured, was possessed by Brutus pure <lb/>
            and unalloyed by personal motives, for he had no private <lb/>
            grudge against Cæsar, and yet risked his life on behalf of <lb/>
            the liberty of the people : while Dion would never have <lb/>
            made war against Dionysius, if he had not been wronged <lb/>
            by him. This we learn distinctly from PJato's letters, <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            which prove that Dion did not begin his revolt until he <lb/>
            was banished by Dionysius, after which he deposed the <lb/>
            tyrant. A common object made Brutus become the friend <lb/>
            of Pompeius, who was Cæsar's enemy both personally and <lb/>
            politically, for Brutus made men his friends or his enemies <lb/>
            solely according to what he thought right: while Dion <lb/>
            assisted Dionysius much while he was on friendly terms <lb/>
            with him, and only made war against him out of anger at <lb/>
            his loyalty being suspected. For this reason many even <lb/>
            of his own friends believed that after removing Dionysius <lb/>
            from the throne he intended to succeed him, and to reign <lb/>
            though under some title more plausible than that of despot; <lb/>
            while even the enemies of Brutus admitted that he alone <lb/>
            of all the conspirators against Cæsar kept one object con­ <lb/>
            sistently in view, which was to restore to the Romans <lb/>
            their ancient constitution.</p>
          <p>IV. Apart from these considerations the struggle against <lb/>
            Dionysius was different from that against Cæsar. Diony­ <lb/>
            sius was despised even by his own associates for wasting <lb/>
            all his time with drink, dice, and women ; whereas it shows <lb/>
            a certain magnanimity, and a spirit undismayed by any <lb/>
            danger, to have conceived the idea of dethroning Caesar, <lb/>
            and not to have been overawed by the wisdom, power, and <lb/>
            good fortune of a man whose very name made the kings of <lb/>
            Parthia and India uneasy in their sleep. As soon as Dion <lb/>
            appeared in bicily, thousands joined him to attack Diony­ <lb/>
            sins, while the power of Cæsar's name even after his death <lb/>
            rallied his friends, and enabled a helpless child to become <lb/>
            at once the first of the Romans by assuming it, as though it <lb/>
            were a talisman to protect him against the might and hatred <lb/>
            of Antonius. If it be said that Dion only drove out Diony­ <lb/>
            sius after many fierce battles, whereas Brutus stabbed <lb/>
            Cæsar when he was naked and unguarded, yet it was in <lb/>
            itself a brilliant piece of generalship to have attacked so <lb/>
            powerful a man when he was naked and unguarded: for <lb/>
            he did not attack him on a sudden impulse, or alone, or <lb/>
            even with a few associates; but the plot had been laid <lb/>
            long before, and many were concerned in it, yet none be­ <lb/>
            trayed him. Either lie chose only the bravest men, or else <lb/>
            the mere fact of their having been chosen and trusted by <lb/>
            Brutus made them brave. Dion on the other hand trusted <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            worthless men; and this is discreditable to his judgment, <lb/>
            for they must either have been villains when he chose them <lb/>
            for his followers, or else they must have been originally <lb/>
            good, and have become worse during their connection with <lb/>
            him. Plato indeed blames him for choosing such men for <lb/>
            his friends, and at last he was murdered by them.</p>
          <p>V. No one avenged the murder of Dion; but Antonius, <lb/>
            though Brutus's enemy, nevertheless buried him with <lb/>
            honour, and Caesar (Augustus) allowed the honours which <lb/>
            were paid to his memory to remain untouched. A brazen <lb/>
            statue of Brutus stands in the city of Milan, in Gaul, on this <lb/>
            side of the Alps. When Augustus saw this, which was a <lb/>
            good likeness and a capital piece of workmanship, he passed <lb/>
            by it, but stopped shortly afterwards, and before a large <lb/>
            audience called for the magistrates of the city, and told <lb/>
            them that he had caught them in the act of breaking the <lb/>
            peace by harbouring his enemy within their walls. They <lb/>
            at first, as may be imagined, denied the charge, and looked <lb/>
            at one another, not knowing to whom he alluded. Augustus <lb/>
            now turned round towards the statue, and, knitting his <lb/>
            brows, asked, " Is not this my enemy who stands here ? " <lb/>
            At this the magistrates were even more abashed, and re­ <lb/>
            mained silent. Augustus, however, smilingly commen­ <lb/>
            ded the Gauls for remaining true to their friends in mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, and ordered the statue to be left where it blood.</p><pb n="458"/>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF ARTAXERXES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. The first Artaxerxes, who surpassed all the kings of <lb/>
            Persia in mildness and magnanimity of character, was <lb/>
            surnamed Longhand, because his right hand was larger <lb/>
            than his left. He was the son of Xerxes; and Artaxerxes <lb/>
            the Second, the subject of this memoir, who was surnamed <lb/>
            Mnemon, was the son of the former's daughter : for Darius <lb/>
            and Parysatis had four children, of whom the eldest was <lb/>
            named Artaxerxes, the next Cyrus, and the two younger <lb/>
            ones Ostanes and Oxathres.</p>
          <p>Cyrus was named after the ancient king of that name, <lb/>
            who is said to have been taken from the sun ; for the <lb/>
            Persians are said to call the sun Cyrus. Artaxerxes was <lb/>
            originally named Arsikas, although the historian Deinon <lb/>
            states that he was named Oarses. Still Ktesias, although <lb/>
            his writings are full of all kinds of absurd and incredible <lb/>
            tales, must be supposed to know the name of the king at <lb/>
            whose court he lived, acting as physician to him, his <lb/>
            mother and his wife.</p>
          <p>II. Cyrus from his earliest youth displayed a determined <lb/>
            and vehement disposition, while his brother was gentler <lb/>
            in all respects and less passionate in his desires. He <lb/>
            married a fair and virtuous wife at his parents' command, <lb/>
            and kept her against their will, for the king killed her <lb/>
            brother, and wished to put her also to death, but Arsikas, <lb/>
            by tears and entreaties, prevailed upon his mother to <lb/>
            spare her life, and not to separate her from him. His <lb/>
            mother, however, always loved Cyrus more than <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, and wished him to become king instead of his <lb/>
            brother. For this reason, when Cyrus was sent for from the <lb/>
            coast during his father's last illness, he went to court <pb n="459"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            th great expectations, imagining that she had managed <lb/>
            to have him declared heir to the throne. Indeed, Parysatis <lb/>
            had a good argument for doing so, which had formerly, at <lb/>
            the suggestion of Demarat as, been acted upon by the old <lb/>
            king Xerxes; namely, that when Arsikas was born, <lb/>
            Darius was merely a private man, but that when Cyrus <lb/>
            was born he was a king. However, Parysatis did not <lb/>
            succeed in inducing the king to declare Cyrus his heir, <lb/>
            but the eldest son was proclaimed king and his name <lb/>
            changed to Artaxerxes, while Cyrus was appointed satrap <lb/>
            of Lydia and ruler of the provinces on the sea coast.</p>
          <p>III. Shortly before the death of Darius, the king <lb/>
            Artaxerxes travelled to Pasargadæ, in order that he might <lb/>
            be initiated into the royal mystic rites by the priests there. <lb/>
            The temple is dedicated to a warlike goddess whom one <lb/>
            might liken to Athena. The person to be initiated enters <lb/>
            this temple, removes his own clothes, and puts on those <lb/>
            which the ancient Cyrus wore before he became king. <lb/>
            He then eats some of a cake made of preserved figs, tastes <lb/>
            the fruit of the terebinth tree, and drinks a cup of sour <lb/>
            milk. Whether besides this he does anything else is known <lb/>
            only to the initiated. When Artaxerxes was about to do <lb/>
            this Tissaphernes met him, bringing with him one of the <lb/>
            priests, who, when both the princes were boys, had been <lb/>
            Cyrus's teacher in the usual course of study, had taught <lb/>
            him to use incantations like a Magian, and had been especi­ <lb/>
            ally grieved at Cyrus not being proclaimed king. For this <lb/>
            reason he more easily obtained credit when he accused <lb/>
            Cyrus; and the accusation he brought against him was <lb/>
            that Cyrus intended to conceal himself in the temple, and <lb/>
            when the king took off his clothes, to attack him and <lb/>
            murder him. Some writers say that this was how Cyrus <lb/>
            came to be apprehended, while others state that he actually <lb/>
            got into the temple, and was there betrayed by the priest. <lb/>
            When he was about to be put to death, his mother threw <lb/>
            her arms round him, flung her hair over him, pressed his <lb/>
            neck against her own, and by her tears and entreaties <lb/>
            obtained his pardon, and got him sent back again to <lb/>
            his government on the sea coast. He was not satisfied <lb/>
            with this position nor was he grateful for his pardon, but <lb/>
            remembered only how he had been taken into custody, and <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            through anger at this became all the more eager to gain <lb/>
            the throne for himself.</p>
          <p>IV. Some writers say that he revolted because his reve­ <lb/>
            nues did not suffice for his daily expenses; but this is absurd, <lb/>
            since, if he could have obtained it from no other source, his <lb/>
            mother was always ready to supply him, and used to give <lb/>
            as much as he wanted from her own income. His wealth <lb/>
            also is proved by the large mercenary force which, we <lb/>
            learn from Xenophon, was enlisted by his friends and <lb/>
            guests in many different places: for he never collected it <lb/>
            together, as he wished to conceal his preparations, but he <lb/>
            kept many persons in different places who recruited <lb/>
            soldiers for him on various pretexts. His mother, who <lb/>
            was present at court, lulled the king's suspicions, and <lb/>
            Cyrus himself constantly wrote to him in dutiful terms, <lb/>
            asking him to grant certain matters, and bringing accu­ <lb/>
            sations against Tissaphernes, as though it was Tissaphernes <lb/>
            of whom he were jealous and with whom he had a quarrel. <lb/>
            There was also a certain slowness in the disposition of the <lb/>
            king, which was mistaken by the people for good nature. <lb/>
            At the beginning of his reign, he seemed inclined to rival <lb/>
            the gentleness of his namesake, as he made himself <lb/>
            pleasant to all whom he met, distributed honours and <lb/>
            favours even beyond men's deserts, took no delight in in­ <lb/>
            sulting and torturing evil-doers, and showed himself as <lb/>
            affable and courteous to those from whom he received favours <lb/>
            as he was to those upon whom he bestowed them. No <lb/>
            present was so trifling that he did not receive it gladly, <lb/>
            but even when a man named Onisus brought him a pome­ <lb/>
            granate of unusual size, he said, " By Mithras, if this man <lb/>
            were given the charge of a small city he would soon make <lb/>
            it great!"</p>
          <p>V. When during one of his journeys all men were <lb/>
            bringing him presents, a labouring man, not finding any­ <lb/>
            thing else to give, ran to the river, took up some of the <lb/>
            water in his two hands and offered it to him. Artaxerxes <lb/>
            was pleased with the man, and sent him a gold drinking­ <lb/>
            cup and a thousand darics. When Eukleidas the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian had spoken his mind very freely to him, he bade <lb/>
            his general say to him, “ You may say what you please, <lb/>
            but I may both say and do what I please." Once when <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            they were hunting, Teribazus pointed out to him that his <lb/>
            coat was torn. Artaxerxes asked what was to be done, to <lb/>
            which Teribazus answered, “ Put on another coat, and <lb/>
            give this one to me." He replied, "I will give it to you, <lb/>
            Teribazus, but I forbid you to wear it." Teribazus, <lb/>
            however, who was a loyal subject, but careless and flighty, <lb/>
            immediately put on the coat, and ornamented himself with <lb/>
            women's nooklaces belonging to the king, so that all men <lb/>
            were disgusted with him, for it was not lawful to do so. <lb/>
            The king, however, laughed, and said, " I allow you to <lb/>
            wear the jewelry as a woman, and the coat as a fool." <lb/>
            Though no one eats at the same table with the king of <lb/>
            Persia except his mother, who sits above him, or his <lb/>
            wedded wife, who sits below him, Artaxerxes invited his <lb/>
            younger brothers also, Ostanes and Oxathres, to sit at the <lb/>
            same table. One of the sights which especially delighted <lb/>
            the Persians was the carriage in which Statira, the wife of <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, drove, with the curtains drawn back, for the <lb/>
            queen allowed the people to greet her and approach her, <lb/>
            and was much beloved by them in consequence.</p>
          <p>VI. However, all turbulent and unsettled spirits thought <lb/>
            that the empire required Cyrus at its head, since he was <lb/>
            a brilliant and warlike prince, a staunch friend to his <lb/>
            comrades, and a man of intellect and ambition, capable of <lb/>
            wielding the enormous power of Persia. Cyrus, when he <lb/>
            began the war, relied upon the attachment of the people of <lb/>
            the interior of Asia as much as he did upon that of his own <lb/>
            followers; and he wrote to the Lacedæmonians, begging <lb/>
            them to help him and to send soldiers to him, declaring <lb/>
            that if the soldiers came to him on foot, he would give <lb/>
            them horses, and if they came on horseback, he would <lb/>
            give them carriages and pairs, that if they possessed fields, <lb/>
            he would give them villages, and if they possessed villages <lb/>
            he would give them cities; and that his soldiers' pay <lb/>
            should be given them by measure, instead of being counted <lb/>
            out to them. At the same time he boasted loudly about <lb/>
            himself, averring that he had'a greater heart than his <lb/>
            brother, was a better philosopher, and was a more learned <lb/>
            Magian, and also that he could drink and carry more wine <lb/>
            than his brother, who, he declared, was so lazy and <lb/>
            cowardly that he would not even mount a horse when <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            hunting, or a throne in time of peril. The Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            now sent a skytale* to Klearchus, bidding him obey the <lb/>
            bidding of Cyrus in all things. Cyrus marched against <lb/>
            the King of Persia with a large force and nearly thirteen <lb/>
            thousand Greek mercenary troops, whom he had engaged <lb/>
            upon various pretences. His treason was not long un­ <lb/>
            discovered, for Tissaphernes went in person to tell the <lb/>
            king of it, upon which there was a terrible scene of dis­ <lb/>
            order in the palace, since Parysatis was blamed as being <lb/>
            the chief instigator of the war, and her friends were all <lb/>
            v lowed with suspicion as traitors. Parysatis was especially <lb/>
            enraged by the reproaches of Statira, who asked her loudly, <lb/>
            "Where now are the pledges you gave us? What has <lb/>
            come of the entreaties by which you begged off Cyrus <lb/>
            when he plotted against his brother's life, now that you <lb/>
            have plunged us into war and misery ? " In consequence <lb/>
            of these reproaches Parysatis conceived a vehement hatred <lb/>
            for Statira, and being of a fierce passionate unforgiving <lb/>
            temper, she plotted her destruction. Deinon states that <lb/>
            she effected her purpose during the war, but Ktesias says <lb/>
            that she did the deed afterwards, and I shall adopt his <lb/>
            account of the matter, for it is not probable that he, who <lb/>
            was an eye-witness of these events, did not know the order <lb/>
            in which they took place, or that in his history he should <lb/>
            have had any reason for misrepresenting them, although <lb/>
            he often departs from the exact truth with a view to <lb/>
            dramatic effect.</p>
          <p>VII. As Cyrus marched onwards, many rumours and <lb/>
            ] eports were brought to him, that the king had determined <lb/>
            not to fight at once, and was not anxious to meet him in <lb/>
            battle, but that he intended to remain in Persia until his <lb/>
            forces had assembled there from all parts of the empire. <lb/>
            Indeed, although he had dug a trench across the plain ten <lb/>
            fathoms wide, as many deep, and four hundred stadia <lb/>
            long, yet he remained quiet and permitted Cyrus to cross <lb/>
            it, and to march close to Babylon itself. Teribazus, we <lb/>
            are told, was the first who ventured to tell the king that he <lb/>
            ought not to avoid a battle, and retreat from Media and <lb/>
            from Babylon, and even from Susa itself into Persia, when <note type="footnote">* A despatch rolled in a peculiar manner. See voL ii. Life of <lb/>
            Lysander, ch. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            he possessed an army many times as great as that of the <lb/>
            enemy, and numberless satraps and generals who were <lb/>
            better generals and better soldiers than Cyrus. Upon <lb/>
            hearing this advice, the king determined to fight as soon <lb/>
            as possible. At first his sudden appearance with a <lb/>
            splendidly equipped force of nine hundred thousand men <lb/>
            caused great surprise and confusion among the rebels, who <lb/>
            had gained such confidence that they were marching <lb/>
            without their arms ; and it was not without much shouting <lb/>
            and disorder that Cyrus was able to rally them and place <lb/>
            them in array. The king moved forward slowly and in <lb/>
            silence, so that the Greeks were filled with admiration at <lb/>
            the discipline of his army, for they had expected that in <lb/>
            such a host there would be disorderly shouts and <lb/>
            irregularity and intervals in the line- The strongest of <lb/>
            the scythed chariots were judiciously posted by Artaxerxes <lb/>
            in front of his line, in order that before the two armies <lb/>
            engaged hand to hand they might break the enemy's ranks <lb/>
            by the force of their charge.</p>
          <p>VIII. The battle- has been described by many writers, <lb/>
            and as Xenophon's narrative is so clear that the reader <lb/>
            seems almost to be present, and to see the different events <lb/>
            in the act of taking place, it would be folly for me to do <lb/>
            more than to mention some important particulars which he <lb/>
            has omitted. The place where the two armies met is called <lb/>
            Kunaxa, and is five hundred stadia distant from Babylon. <lb/>
            Before the battle Klearchus is said to have advised Cyrus <lb/>
            to post himself behind the ranks of the soldiers, and not to <lb/>
            risk his life ; to which Cyrus replied “ What say you, <lb/>
            Klearchus? Just when I am striving to win a kingdom, <lb/>
            do you bid me prove myself unworthy of one ?" In the <lb/>
            action itself, though Cyrus made a great mistake in plung­ <lb/>
            ing so rashly into the midst of the enemy without re­ <lb/>
            garding the risk that he ran, yet Klearchus was quite as <lb/>
            much, if not more to blame for not arraying his Greeks <lb/>
            opposite to the Persian king, and for resting his right wing <lb/>
            upon the river for fear he should be surrounded. If he <lb/>
            valued safety more than anything else, and cared only to <lb/>
            avoid the slightest risk of loss, he had better have stayed <note type="footnote"> * The battle of Kunaxa was fought on the 7th of September <lb/>
            401 B.C. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="464"/>
            at home; but after he had marched ten thousand stadia <lb/>
            from the sea, under no compulsion, but solely in order to <lb/>
            place Cyrus upon the throne of Persia, then to be solicitous, <lb/>
            not for a post where he might win the victory for his chief <lb/>
            and paymaster, but merely for one where he might fight <lb/>
            without exposing himself, was to act like a man who, on <lb/>
            the first appearance of danger, abandons the whole enter­ <lb/>
            prise and gives up the object for which the expedition was <lb/>
            made. It is abundantly clear from what took place, that <lb/>
            if the Greeks had charged the troops who defended the <lb/>
            king'is person, they would have met with no resistance, <lb/>
            and if these men had been routed, and the king slain or <lb/>
            forced to take flight, Cyrus's victory would at once have <lb/>
            placed him on the throne. It was, therefore, the over­ <lb/>
            caution of Klearchus more than the rashness of Cyrus <lb/>
            which really caused the death of the latter and the ruin of <lb/>
            his cause; for the Persian King himself could not, if he <lb/>
            had wished, have placed the Greeks in a position where <lb/>
            they could do him less harm, for they were so far away <lb/>
            from him and his main body that he did not even perceive <lb/>
            that they had routed their antagonists, and Cyrus was <lb/>
            slain before Klearchus could reap any advantage from his <lb/>
            victory. Yet Cyrus knew what was best, for he ordered <lb/>
            Klearchus to post his men in the centre; but Klearchus, <lb/>
            saying that he would manage as well as he could, ruined <lb/>
            everything.</p>
          <p>IX. The Greeks put the Persians to flight with the <lb/>
            greatest ease, and pursued them for a long distance. <lb/>
            Cyrus, as he rode forward, mounted upon a spirited, but <lb/>
            hard-mouthed and unmanageable horse, which, we learn <lb/>
            from Ktesias was named Pasakas, was met by Artagerses, <lb/>
            the leader of the Kadousians, who shouted loudly, saying, <lb/>
            “ Most wicked and foolish of men, who hast disgraced the <lb/>
            name of Cyrus, erst the noblest in Persia, and bringest thy <lb/>
            base Greeks on a base errand, to plunder the good things <lb/>
            of the Persians, and to slay thy brother and thy lord, who <lb/>
            hath ten thousand times ten thousand slaves, each one <lb/>
            better than thou art. Soon shalt thou find out the truth <lb/>
            of this; for before thou seest the king's face thou shalt <lb/>
            lose thine own head." Saying thus, he hurled his javelin <lb/>
            against Cyrua, but his breastplate resisted the blow, and <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            Cyrus was not wounded, although he reeled in his saddle <lb/>
            from the violence of the stroke. As Artagerses wheeled <lb/>
            round his horse, Cyrus struck him with a javelin, driving <lb/>
            the point through his throat, beside the collar-bone. That <lb/>
            Artagerses was slain by Cyrus nearly all historians agree, <lb/>
            but as to the death of Cyrus himself, since Xenophon has <lb/>
            described it very shortly, as he was not an eye-witness of <lb/>
            it, we may as well give the accounts of it which Deinon <lb/>
            and which Ktesias have written.</p>
          <p>X. Deinon says that when Artagerses fell, Cyrus <lb/>
            charged violently among the troops round the king, and <lb/>
            wounded the king's horse. Artaxerxes was thrown from <lb/>
            his horse, but Teribazus quickly mounted him upon <lb/>
            another horse, saying, " My king, remember this day, for <lb/>
            you ought not to forget it." Artaxerxes, he states, was <lb/>
            again thrown from his horse by the vehement onset of <lb/>
            Cyrus, and again mounted. At the third charge the king <lb/>
            who was violently enraged, and cried out to those around <lb/>
            him that it was better to die than be treated thus, rode <lb/>
            straight against Cyrus, who rashly and heedlessly exposed <lb/>
            himself to the missiles of his enemies, The king hurled <lb/>
            a dart at Cyrus, and so did all his followers. Cyrus fell, <lb/>
            struck, some say by the king himself, but according to <lb/>
            others he was slain by a Carian soldier, on whom the king <lb/>
            afterwards, as a reward for this feat of arms, bestowed the <lb/>
            honour of marching at the head of the army, carrying a <lb/>
            golden cock upon a spear. Indeed the Persians call the <lb/>
            Carinis themselves cocks, because of the plumes with <lb/>
            which they ornament their helmets.</p>
          <p>XI. The story of Ktesias, reduced to a succinct form, is <lb/>
            as follows:—Cyrus, after slaying Artagerses, rode towards <lb/>
            the king himself, and the king rode towards him, both of <lb/>
            them in silence. Ariæus, the friend of Cyrus, struck the <lb/>
            king first but did not wound him. The king hurled his <lb/>
            spear and missed Cyrus, but struck Satiphernes, a man of <lb/>
            noble birth and a trusted friend of Cyrus, and slew him. <lb/>
            Cyrus hurled his javelin at the king, drove it through his <lb/>
            breastplate, making a wound in his breast two fingers’ <lb/>
            breadths deep, and cast him from his horse. Upon this <lb/>
            there was much disorder, and many took to flight. The <lb/>
            king rose, and with a few followers, among whom was <note type="footnote"> VOL. IT. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            Ktesias, took refuge on a hill hard by. Meanwhile Cyrus <lb/>
            was carried by his horse a long distance forward into the <lb/>
            midst of his enemies, and, as it was now growing dark, he <lb/>
            was not recognised by his foes, and was being sought for <lb/>
            in vain by his friends. Excited by his victory, and full <lb/>
            of spirit and pride, he rode about through the ranks, crying, <lb/>
            " Out of my way, wretches." As Cyrus shouted these words <lb/>
            in Persian, some made way for him, but the tiara fell from <lb/>
            his head, and a young man named Mithridates, not know­ <lb/>
            ing who he was, hurled a javelin and struck him on the <lb/>
            temple near the eye. The wound bled profusely, and <lb/>
            Cyrus became dizzy and faint, so that he fell from his <lb/>
            horse. The horse rushed away from him and was lost, <lb/>
            but the servant of the man who struck Cyrus took up his <lb/>
            saddle-cloth, which fell from his horse, and which was <lb/>
            drenched with blood.</p>
          <p>When Cyrus began to recover from the effects of this <lb/>
            blow, some few of his eunuchs tried to mount him upon <lb/>
            another horse and get him safe away from the field. <lb/>
            As, however, he could not mount, he proposed to walk, and <lb/>
            the eunuchs supported him as he went, faint and weak in <lb/>
            his body, but still imagining himself to be the victor as <lb/>
            he heard the fugitives calling Cyrus their king and <lb/>
            begging him for mercy. At this time certain men of <lb/>
            Kaunus, of mean and low condition, who followed the <lb/>
            king's army to perform menial services, happened to join <lb/>
            the party with Cyrus, supposing them to be friends. <lb/>
            When, however, they managed to distinguish that the <lb/>
            surcoats which they wore over their armour were purple, <lb/>
            while all the king's soldiers wore white ones, they per­ <lb/>
            ceived that they were enemies. One of them ventured to <lb/>
            strike Cyrus from behind with a spear, not knowing who <lb/>
            he was. The javelin struck Cyrus behind the knee, cutting <lb/>
            the vein there, and in his fall he also struck his wounded <lb/>
            temple against a stone, and so died. This is the story of <lb/>
            Ktesias, in which he seems, as it were, to hack poor Cyrus <lb/>
            to death with a blunt sword.</p>
          <p>XII. When Cyrus was dead it happened that Artasyras, <lb/>
            who was called the king's eye,* rode past. Recognising the <lb/>
            eunuchs who were mourning over the body, he asked the <lb/>
            most trusted of them, " Pariskas, who is this beside whom <note type="footnote">* The title of a great Persian officer of State. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            you sit weeping ? " He answered, " Artasyras, do you not <lb/>
            see that it is Cyrus, who is dead ? " Artasyras was aston­ <lb/>
            ished at this news, bade the eunuch be of good courage and <lb/>
            guard the body, and himself rode in haste to Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            who had given up all hope of success, and was in great <lb/>
            bodily suffering from his wound and from thirst. Artasyras, <lb/>
            with great delight, told him that he had seen Cyrus lying <lb/>
            dead. On hearing this Artaxerxes at first wished to go to <lb/>
            see it himself, and bade Artasyras lead him to the spot; <lb/>
            but as there was much talk and fear of the Greeks, who <lb/>
            were said to be advancing and carrying all before them; <lb/>
            he decided to send a party to view the body; and thirty <lb/>
            men went carrying torches. Meanwhile, as the king him­ <lb/>
            self was almost dying of thirst the eunuch Satibarzanes <lb/>
            went in search of drink for him ; for there was no water in <lb/>
            the place where he was, nor indeed anywhere near the <lb/>
            army. After much trouble the eunuch at length fell in <lb/>
            with one of the low Kaunian camp followers, who had <lb/>
            about four pints of putrid water in a skin, which he took <lb/>
            from the man and carried it to the king. When the king <lb/>
            had drunk it all, he asked him if he was not disgusted <lb/>
            with the water; and the king swore by the gods that he <lb/>
            never had drank either wine or the purest of water with <lb/>
            such pleasure. " So," added he, " if I be not able to find <lb/>
            the man who gave you this water and reward him for it, I <lb/>
            pray that the gods may make him rich and happy. "</p>
          <p>XIII. While they were talking thus, the thirty men <lb/>
            rode up in high spirits, announcing to him his unlooked­ <lb/>
            for good fortune. Artaxerxes now began to recover his <lb/>
            courage from the number of men who began to assemble <lb/>
            round him, and descended from the hill amidst the glare <lb/>
            of many torches. When he reached the body, the head <lb/>
            and right hand were cut off, in accordance with some <lb/>
            Persian custom. He ordered the head to be brought to <lb/>
            him, took hold of it by the long thick hair, and showed it <lb/>
            to those who were still wavering or fleeing. They all <lb/>
            were filled with amazement, and did homage to him, so <lb/>
            that he soon collected a force of seventy thousand men, <lb/>
            accompanied by whom he re-entered his camp. He had <lb/>
            left it in the morning, according to Ktesias, with an army <lb/>
            of four hundred thousand men; though Deinon and Xeno­ <note type="footnote"> 2 H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            phon both estimate the forces actually engaged at a higher <lb/>
            figure. Etesias states that the number of the dead was <lb/>
            returned to Artaxerxes as nine thousand, but that he <lb/>
            himself thought that the corpses which he saw lying on <lb/>
            the field must amount to more than twenty thousand. <lb/>
            This point admits of discussion; but Ktesias tells an <lb/>
            obvious untruth when he says that he was sent on an <lb/>
            embassy to the Greeks, together with Phalinus of Zakyn­ <lb/>
            thus, and some other persons. Xenophon knew that <lb/>
            Ktesias was at the king's court, for he makes mention of <lb/>
            him, and has evidently read his history; so that he never <lb/>
            would have passed him over, and only mentioned Phalinus <lb/>
            of Zakynthus, if Ktesias had really come as interpreter on <lb/>
            a mission of such importance. But Ktesias, being a won­ <lb/>
            derfully vain man, and especially attached to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and to Klearchus, constantly in his history <lb/>
            introduces himself, while he sings the praises of Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon and of Klearchus.</p>
          <p>XIV. After the battle, Artaxerxes sent most splendid <lb/>
            and valuable presents to Artagerses, the son of the man <lb/>
            who had been slain by Cyrus, and handsomely rewarded <lb/>
            Ktesias and the rest of his companions. He sought out <lb/>
            the Kaunian from whom he had received the water-skin, <lb/>
            who was a poor and humble man, and made him rich <lb/>
            and honoured. He also took pains to appoint suitable <lb/>
            punishments to those who had misconducted themselves. <lb/>
            One Arbakes, a Mede, deserted to Cyrus during the battle, <lb/>
            and when Cyrus fell again returned to his allegiance. <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, perceiving that he had done so not from <lb/>
            treachery but from sheer cowardice, ordered him to carry <lb/>
            a naked courtesan about the market-place upon his <lb/>
            shoulders for the whole of one day. Another deserter, <lb/>
            who besides changing sides falsely boasted that he had <lb/>
            slain two of the enemy, was condemned by the king to <lb/>
            have his tongue pierced with three needles. As Artaxerxes <lb/>
            believed, and wished all men to think that he had himself <lb/>
            slain Cyrus, he sent presents to Mithridates, who was the <lb/>
            first man that wounded Cyrus, and bade those who carried <lb/>
            the presents say, "The king honours you with these <lb/>
            presents, because you found Cyrus's saddle-cloth and <lb/>
            brought it to him." And when the Carian, who had <lb/>
             <pb n="469"/>
            struck Cyrus under the knee, demanded a present, he <lb/>
            bade those who carried the presents say, “ The king gives <lb/>
            you these for having been second to bring him the good <lb/>
            news; for Artasyras first, and you next, brought him the <lb/>
            news of the death of Cyrus." Mithridates retired in silence, <lb/>
            much vexed at this; but the unhappy Carian, as often <lb/>
            happens, was ruined by his own folly. Excited by his <lb/>
            good fortune into trying to obtain more than became him, <lb/>
            be refused to take what was offered him for having brought <lb/>
            good news, but remonstrated loudly, declaring that he, <lb/>
            and no one else, slew Cyrus, and that he was most unjustly <lb/>
            being deprived of the credit of the action. The king, <lb/>
            when he heard this, was greatly angered, and ordered the <lb/>
            man's head to be struck off. His mother, Parysatis, who <lb/>
            was present, said, " My king, do not thus rid yourself of <lb/>
            this pestilent Carian. He shall receive from me a fitting <lb/>
            punishment for what he has dared to say." The king <lb/>
            handed him over to her, and Parysatis ordered the execu­ <lb/>
            tioners to torture him for ten days, and then to tear out <lb/>
            his eyes and pour molten copper into his ears until he died.</p>
          <p>XV. Mithridates also came to an evil end after a few <lb/>
            days by his folly. He came dressed in the robe, and <lb/>
            adorned with the ornaments which he had received from <lb/>
            the king, to a banquet at which the eunuchs of the king <lb/>
            and of the king's mother were present. When they began <lb/>
            to drink the most influential of the eunuchs of Parysa'is <lb/>
            said to him: “ What a fine dress, Mithridates, and what <lb/>
            fine necklaces and bracelet the king has given you I How <lb/>
            valuable is your scimitar? Indeed, he has made you <lb/>
            fortunate and envied by all men." Mithridates, who was <lb/>
            already in liquor, answered: " What are these things, <lb/>
            Sparamixes? I proved myself on that day worth more <lb/>
            than these to the king." Sparamixes smiled and said, <lb/>
            "I do not grudge you them, Mithridates, but come—as <lb/>
            the Greeks say that there is truth in wine-toll us how <lb/>
            it can be so great or brilliant an achievement to find a <lb/>
            saddle-cloth that has fallen off a horse, and to bring it to <lb/>
            the king." This the eunuch said, not because he did not <lb/>
            know the truth, but because he wished to lead Mithridates, <lb/>
            whose tongue was loosened by wine, to expose his folly <lb/>
            before the company. Mithridates could not restrain <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            himself, and said: " You may say what you please about <lb/>
            saddle-cloths and such nonsense; I tell you plainly, that it <lb/>
            was by my hand that Cyrus fell. I did not hurl my <lb/>
            javelin in vain, like Artagerses, but I just missed his eye, <lb/>
            struck him through the temple, and felled him to the <lb/>
            ground ; and with that blow he died." All the rest of <lb/>
            the guests, foreseeing the miserable end to which <lb/>
            Mithridates would certainly come, cast their eyes upon <lb/>
            the ground; but the host said : " My good Mithridates, let <lb/>
            us now eat and drink, adoring the fortune of the king, but <lb/>
            let us not talk about subjects which are too high for us."</p>
          <p>XVI. After this, the eunuch told Parysatis what <lb/>
            Mithridates had said, and she told the king, who was <lb/>
            much enraged, because he was proved not to have spoken <lb/>
            the truth, and had been deprived of the sweetest part of <lb/>
            his victory; for he wished to persuade all men, Asiatics <lb/>
            and Greeks alike, that in the skirmish when he and his <lb/>
            brother met he himself had been wounded by Cyrus, but <lb/>
            had struck him dead. He therefore condemned Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates to the punishment of the boat. This is as follows :— <lb/>
            Two wooden boats are made, which fit together. The <lb/>
            criminal is placed on his back in one of them, and then <lb/>
            the other is placed over him, and the two are fastened so <lb/>
            as to leave his head, feet, and hands outside, but covering <lb/>
            all the rest of his body. They give him food, and if he <lb/>
            refuses it, they force him to eat it by pricking his eyes. <lb/>
            When he has eaten they pour a mixture of milk and <lb/>
            honey into his mouth and over his face. They then keep <lb/>
            turning his eyes towards the sun, his whole face becomes <lb/>
            completely covered with flies. As all his evacuations are <lb/>
            necessarily contained within the boat, worms and maggots <lb/>
            are generated from the corruption, which eat into his body; <lb/>
            for when the man is certainly dead, they take off the <lb/>
            upper boat and find all his flesh eaten away, and swarms <lb/>
            of these animals clinging to his bowels and devouring <lb/>
            them. In this way Mithridates died, after enduring his <lb/>
            misery for seventeen days.</p>
          <p>XVII. The only remaining object of the vengeance of <lb/>
            Parysatis was Masabates, the king's eunuch who cut off <lb/>
            the head and hand of Cyrus. As he gave no handle against <lb/>
            himself, Parysatis devised the following plot against him. <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            She was naturally a clever woman, and was fond of playing <lb/>
            with the dice. Before the war, she had often played with <lb/>
            dice with the king; and after the war when she became <lb/>
            reconciled to him she took part in his amusements, played <lb/>
            at games with him, encouraged his amours, and altogether <lb/>
            permitted Statira to have but very little of his society ; for <lb/>
            Parysatis hated Statira more than any one else, and wished <lb/>
            to have most influence with Artaxerxes herself. Finding <lb/>
            Artaxerxes one day eager for amusement, as he had nothing <lb/>
            to do, she challenged him to play for a thousand darics. <lb/>
            She purposely allowed her son to win, and paid him the <lb/>
            money : and then pretending to be vexed at her loss, called <lb/>
            on him to cast the dice afresh for a eunuch. Artaxerxes <lb/>
            agreed, and they agreed to play upon the condition that <lb/>
            each of them should set apart five of their most trusty <lb/>
            eunuchs, and that the winner was to have his choice of <lb/>
            the rest. On these terms they played; and Parysatis, <lb/>
            who gave the closest attention to her game, and was also <lb/>
            favoured by fortune, won, and chose Masabates, who was <lb/>
            not one of the excepted ones. Before the king suspected <lb/>
            her purpose she had Masabates arrested, and delivered him <lb/>
            to the executioners with orders to flay him alive, impale <lb/>
            his body sideways upon three stakes, and hang up his skin <lb/>
            separately. This was done; and as the king was greatly <lb/>
            grieved at it and was angry with her, she smiled and said <lb/>
            ironically: " How pleasant and well-mannered you are, to <lb/>
            be angry about a miserable old eunuch, whereas I have <lb/>
            lost a thousand darics at dice and say nothing about it." <lb/>
            The king, though he was sorry to have been so cheated, <lb/>
            yet remained quiet; but Statira, who indeed often on <lb/>
            other occasions openly braved Parysatis, was very indig­ <lb/>
            nant with her for so cruelly and unjustly putting the <lb/>
            king's faithful eunuch to death for Cyrus's sake.</p>
          <p>XVIII. When Tissaphernes betrayed Klearchus and <lb/>
            the other generals, broke his plighted word, seized them <lb/>
            and sent them away in chains, Ktesias tells us that Klear­ <lb/>
            chus asked him to provide him with a comb. When <lb/>
            Klearchus received it and combed his hair with it, he was <lb/>
            so much pleased that he gave Ktesias his ring, to be a <lb/>
            token to all Klearchus's friends and relatives in Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon of his friendship for Ktesias. The device engraved <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            upon the ring was a dance of Karyatides. At first the <lb/>
            soldiers who were imprisoned with Klearchus took away <lb/>
            the provisions which were sent to him and ate them them­ <lb/>
            selves, giving him but a small part of them. Ktesias says <lb/>
            that he remedied this also, by arranging that a larger <lb/>
            portion should be sent to Klearchus, and that a separate <lb/>
            allowance should be given to the soldiers. All these ser­ <lb/>
            vices Ktesias states that he rendered in consequence of the <lb/>
            favour of Parysatis for the captives, and at her instiga­ <lb/>
            tion. He says, also, that as he sent Klearchus a joint of <lb/>
            meat daily in addition to his other provisions, Klearchus <lb/>
            begged him and assured him that it was his duty to hide a <lb/>
            small dagger in the meat, and send it to him, and not to <lb/>
            allow him to be cruelly put to death by the king; but he <lb/>
            was afraid, and did not dare to do it. Ktesias says that the <lb/>
            king's mother pleaded with him for the life of Klearchus, <lb/>
            and that he agreed to spare him, and even swore to do so, <lb/>
            but that he was again overruled by Statira, and put them <lb/>
            all to death except Menon. It was in consequence of this, <lb/>
            according to Ktesias, that Parysatis began to plot against <lb/>
            Statira,and devised the plan for poisoning her, though it <lb/>
            seems very unlikely that it was only for the sake of Klear­ <lb/>
            chus that she dared to do such wickedness as to murder the <lb/>
            lawful wife of her king, who was the mother of the heirs <lb/>
            to the throne. But clearly all this was written merely for <lb/>
            dramatic effect, to do honour to the memory of Klearchus. <lb/>
            Ktesias writes, too, that when the generals were put to <lb/>
            death the remains of the others were thrown away to be <lb/>
            devoured by the dogs and fowls of the air; but that a violent <lb/>
            storm of wind heaped much earth over the body of Klear­ <lb/>
            chus, and that from some dates which were scattered <lb/>
            around there soon sprung up a fair and shady grove above <lb/>
            the place where he lay, so that the king sorely repented <lb/>
            of what he had done, thinking that in Klearchus he had <lb/>
            slain one who was a favourite of the gods.</p>
          <p>XIX. Parysatis, who had long been jealous of Statira <lb/>
            and hated her, and who saw that her own power depended <lb/>
            merely on the respect with which she was regarded by the <lb/>
            king, who loved and trusted Statira, now determined to <lb/>
            destroy her, though at the most terrible risk to herself. <lb/>
            She had a faithful maid-servant, named Gigis, who was <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            high in her favour, whom Demon accuses of having <lb/>
            assisted to administer the poison, though Ktesias says that <lb/>
            she was only privy to the plot, and that against her will. <lb/>
            Ktesias says that the man who procured the poison was <lb/>
            named Belitaris, but Demon calls him Melantas. Now the <lb/>
            two queens, leaving off their former hatred and suspicion, <lb/>
            began again to visit one another and to dine together, but <lb/>
            yet mistrusted each other so much that they only ate the <lb/>
            same food from the same dishes. There is in Persia a <lb/>
            small bird, which has no excrements, but all its entrails <lb/>
            are filled with solid fat; it is supposed that it feeds upon <lb/>
            air and dew; the name of it is rhyntakes. Ktesias states <lb/>
            that Parysatis cut this bird in two with a small knife, one <lb/>
            side of which was smeared over with the poison. As she <lb/>
            cut it, she wiped the poison off the blade on to one piece <lb/>
            of the bird, which she gave to Statira, while she ate the <lb/>
            untouched portion herself. Deinon, however, says that it <lb/>
            was not Parysatis, but Melantas, who cut off the poisoned <lb/>
            part of the meat and gave it to Statira. As Statira <lb/>
            perished in dreadful agonies and convulsions, she herself <lb/>
            perceived that she had been poisoned, and directed the <lb/>
            suspicions of the king against his mother, knowing, as ho <lb/>
            did, her fierce and rancorous disposition. He at once <lb/>
            began to search for the author of the crime, seized all his <lb/>
            mother's servants and the attendants at her table, and put <lb/>
            them to the torture, except Gigis, whom Parysatis kept <lb/>
            for a long time at home with herself, and refused to deliver <lb/>
            up, though afterwards, when Gigis begged to be sent tc <lb/>
            her own home, the king heard of it, laid an ambuscade, <lb/>
            caught her, and condemned her to death. Poisoners are <lb/>
            put to death in Persia in the following manner: their <lb/>
            heads are placed upon a flat stone, and are then beaten <lb/>
            with another stone until the face and skull is crushed. <lb/>
            Gigis perished in this manner; but Artaxerxes said and <lb/>
            did nothing to Parysatis, except that he sent her to Babylon, <lb/>
            at her own request, saying that he himself should not see <lb/>
            Babylon as long as she lived. Such were the domestic <lb/>
            troubles of Artaxerxes.</p>
          <p>XX. Though the king was as anxious to get the Greek <lb/>
            troops, who accompanied Cyrus, into his power as he had <lb/>
            been to conquer Cyrus himself and to save his throne, yet <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            he could not do so : for though they had lost their leader, <lb/>
            Cyrus, and all their generals, yet they got away safe after <lb/>
            having penetrated almost as far as the king's palace itself, <lb/>
            proving clearly to the world that the Persian empire, in <lb/>
            spite of all its gold and luxury and beautiful women, was <lb/>
            mere empty bombast without any real strength. Upon <lb/>
            this all Greece took courage and despised the Asiatics, while <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians felt that it would be a disgrace to <lb/>
            them not to set free the enslaved Greeks of Asia Minor, <lb/>
            and put a stop to the insolence of the Persians. Their <lb/>
            army was at first commanded by Thimbron, and afterwards <lb/>
            by Derkyllidas, but as neither of these effected anything <lb/>
            of importance, they entrusted the conduct of the war to <lb/>
            their king Agesilaus. He crossed over to Asia with the <lb/>
            fleet, and at once began to act with vigour. He gained <lb/>
            much glory, defeated Tissaphernes, and set free the Greek <lb/>
            cities from the Persians. Artaxerxes, upon this, having <lb/>
            carefully considered how it would be best for him to <lb/>
            contend with the Greeks, sent Timokrates of Rhodes into <lb/>
            Greece with a large sum of money, and ordered him to <lb/>
            corrupt the most important persons in each city by offering <lb/>
            bribes to them, and to stir up the Greeks to make war <lb/>
            against Lacedæmon. Timokrates did so, and as the <lb/>
            greatest states formed a league, and Peloponnesus was in <lb/>
            great confusion, the goverment ordered Agesilaus to return <lb/>
            from Asia. On his departure on this occasion he is said <lb/>
            to have remarked to his friends that he was being-driven <lb/>
            out of Asia by the King of Persia with thirty thousand <lb/>
            archers; for the Persian coins bear the device of an archer.</p>
          <p>XXI. Artaxerxes also chased the Lacedæmonians from <lb/>
            the sea, making use for this purpose of Konon, the <lb/>
            Athenian, as his admiral in conjunction with Pharnaba­ <lb/>
            zus. Konon, after the battle of Ægospotami, had retired <lb/>
            to Cyprus, where he remained, not so much in order to <lb/>
            ensure his own safety as to watch for a favourable oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, as one waits for the turn of the tide. Observing <lb/>
            that while he possessed skill without power, the King of <lb/>
            Persia possessed power without an able man to direct it, <lb/>
            he wrote a letter to the king expressing these ideas. Ho <lb/>
            ordered the man who carried the letter to make it reach <lb/>
            the king, if possible, by the hands of Zeno the Cretan, 01 <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            of Polykritus of Mende. Of these men, Zeno was a dancer, <lb/>
            and Polykritus a physician. If these men should be <lb/>
            absent he ordered the man to give the letter to Ktesias the <lb/>
            physician. It is said that Ktesias received the letter <lb/>
            and that he added to what Konon had writen a paragraph <lb/>
            bidding the king send Ktesias to him, as he would be a <lb/>
            useful person to superintend naval operations. Ktesias, <lb/>
            however, says that the king of his own accord appointed <lb/>
            him to this service. Artaxerxes, now, by means of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus and Konon, gained the sea-fight of Knidos, <lb/>
            deprived the Lacedæmonians of the empire of the sea, and <lb/>
            established so great an ascendancy over the Greeks that <lb/>
            he was able to conclude with them the celebrated peace <lb/>
            which was known as the peace of Antalkidas. This <lb/>
            Antalkidas was a Spartan, the son of Leon ; and he being <lb/>
            entirely in the interests of the King of Persia, prevailed <lb/>
            upon the Lacedæmonians to allow him to possess all the <lb/>
            Greek cities in Asia, and all the islands off the coast, as <lb/>
            his subjects and tributaries, as the result of the peace, if <lb/>
            that can be called a peace, which was really an insult and <lb/>
            betrayal of Greece to the enemy; for no war could have <lb/>
            ended more disgracefully for the vanquished.</p>
          <p>XXII. It follows from this that Artaxerxes, who, we <lb/>
            learn from Deinon, always disliked all other Spartans, <lb/>
            and thought them the most insolent of mankind, when <lb/>
            he visited Persia, showed especial favour to Antalkidas. <lb/>
            Once, after dinner, he took a garland of flowers, dipped it <lb/>
            in the most valuable perfume, and sent it to Antalkidas. <lb/>
            All men wondered at this mark of favour; but, it appears, <lb/>
            Antalkidas was just the man to receive such presents, and <lb/>
            to be corrupted by the luxury of the Persians, as he did <lb/>
            not scruple to disgrace the memory of Leonidas and Kali­ <lb/>
            kratidas by his conduct among them. When some one <lb/>
            said to Agesilaus, “ Alas for Hellas, when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians are Medising." Agesilans answered " Is it not <lb/>
            rather the Medes that are Laconising.” Yet the clever­ <lb/>
            ness of this retort did not take away the disgrace of the <lb/>
            transaction, for, though the Lacedæmonians lost their <lb/>
            empire at the battle of Leuktra by their bad generalship, <lb/>
            yet the glory of Sparta was lost before, by that shameful <lb/>
            treaty. While Sparta was the leading state in Greece, <lb/>
             <pb n="476"/>
            Artaxerxes made Antalkidas his guest, and spoke of him <lb/>
            as his friend; but when after the defeat at Leuktra the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were humbled to the dust, and were in <lb/>
            such distress for money that they sent Agesilaus to Egypt <lb/>
            to serve for hire, Antalkidas again came to the court of <lb/>
            Artaxerxes to beg him to help the Lacedæmonians. But <lb/>
            Artaxerxes treated him with such neglect, and so con­ <lb/>
            temptuously refused his request, that Antalkidas, on his <lb/>
            return, jeered at by his enemies, and afraid moreover of <lb/>
            the anger of the Ephors, starved himself to death. There <lb/>
            went also to the King of Persia Ismenias of Thebes, and <lb/>
            Pelopidas who had just won the battle of Leuktra. Pelop­ <lb/>
            idas would not disgrace himself by any show of servility; <lb/>
            but Ismenias, when ordered to do reverence to the king, <lb/>
            dropped his ring, and then stooped to pick it up, so that <lb/>
            he appeared to bow to the earth before him. Artaxerxes <lb/>
            was so much pleased with Timagoras of Athens, who gave <lb/>
            some secret intelligence in a letter which he sent by a <lb/>
            secretary named Beluris, that he gave him a thousand <lb/>
            darics, and, as he was in weak health and required milk <lb/>
            sent eighty milch cows to accompany him. He also sent <lb/>
            him a bed with bed-clothes and attendants to make it, as <lb/>
            though Greeks did not know how, and bearers to carry <lb/>
            him in a litter down to the sea-coast, on account of his <lb/>
            indisposition. When he was at court, also, the king sent <lb/>
            him a magnificent banquet, so that the king's brother, <lb/>
            Ostanes, said to him, " Timagoras, remember this table; <lb/>
            for it is not for slight services that it is so splendidly set <lb/>
            out." This he said rather to reproach him for his treachery <lb/>
            than to remind him to be grateful. However, the <lb/>
            Athenians put Timagoras to death for taking bribes from <lb/>
            the king.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Although many of the acts of Artaxerxes <lb/>
            grieved the Greeks, yet they were delighted with one of <lb/>
            them, for he put to death Tissaphernes, their bitterest enemy. <lb/>
            This he did in consequence of an intrigue of Parysatis; <lb/>
            for Artaxerxes did not long continue angry with his <lb/>
            mother, but became reconciled with her, and sent for her <lb/>
            to his court, as he felt that her understanding and spirit <lb/>
            would help him to govern, while there remained no further <lb/>
            causes of variance between them. Henceforth she en­ <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            deavoured in everything to please the king, and gained <lb/>
            great influence with him by never opposing any of his <lb/>
            wishes. She now perceived that he was violently <lb/>
            enamoured of one of his own daughters, named Atossa, <lb/>
            but that, chiefly on his mother's account, he concealed his <lb/>
            love and restrained himself, though some historians state <lb/>
            that he had already had some secret commerce with the <lb/>
            girl. When Parysatis suspected this, she caressed the girl <lb/>
            more than ever, and was continually praising her beauty <lb/>
            and good qualities to the king, saying that she was a <lb/>
            noble lady and fit to be a queen. At last she persuaded <lb/>
            him into marrying the girl and proclaiming her as his <lb/>
            lawful wife, disregarding the opinions and customs of the <lb/>
            Greeks, and declaring that he himself was a law to the <lb/>
            Persians and able to decide for himself what was right <lb/>
            and wrong. Some writers, however, amongst whom is <lb/>
            Herakleides of Kyme, state that Artaxerxes, besides <lb/>
            Atossa, married another of his daughters, named Amestris, <lb/>
            of whom I shall shortly afterwards make mention. Atossa <lb/>
            lived with her father as his wife, and was so much beloved <lb/>
            by him, that when leprosy broke out over her body he was <lb/>
            not at all disgusted with her, but prayed for her to Hera <lb/>
            alone of all the goddesses, prostrating himself in her <lb/>
            temple and grasping the earth with his hands, while he <lb/>
            ordered his satraps and friends to send so many presents to <lb/>
            the goddess, that all the space between the palace and the <lb/>
            temple, a distance of sixteen stadia (two English miles <lb/>
            was filled with gold and silver, and horses, and purple <lb/>
            dyed stuffs.</p>
          <p>XXIV. He appointed Pharnabazus and Iphikrates to <lb/>
            conduct a war against Egypt,. which failed through the <lb/>
            dissensions of the generals; and he himself led an army of <lb/>
            three hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse <lb/>
            against the Kadousians.t On this occasion he insensibly <lb/>
            placed himself in a position of great peril as he entered a <lb/>
            difficult and foggy country, which produces no crops that <lb/>
            grow from seed, but is inhabited by a fierce and warlike <lb/>
            race of men who feed upon apples, pears, and other fruits <note type="footnote"> * Egypt revolted from Persia B.C. 358. See vol. iii. Life of Agesilaus, <lb/>

            which are found upon trees. No provisions could be <lb/>
            found in this country, nor yet be brought into it from <lb/>
            without, and the army was reduced to slaughtering the <lb/>
            beasts of burden, so that an ass's head sold for more than <lb/>
            sixty drachmas. The king's own table was scantily <lb/>
            furnished ; and but few of the horses remained alive, all <lb/>
            the rest having been eaten. At this crisis Teribazus, <lb/>
            a man who had often made himself the first man in the <lb/>
            state by his bravery, and as often fallen into disrepute by <lb/>
            folly, and who was then in a very humble and despicable <lb/>
            position, saved both the king and his army. The <lb/>
            Kadousians had two kings, each of whom occupied a <lb/>
            separate camp. Teribazus, after having explained to <lb/>
            Artaxerxes what he was about to do, himself went to one <lb/>
            of these camps, and sent his son to the other. Each of <lb/>
            them deceived the king to whom he went, by saying that <lb/>
            the other king was about to send an embassy to Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            offering to make peace and contract an alliance with him <lb/>
            for himself alone. " If, then, you are wise," said they, <lb/>
            "you will be beforehand with your rival, and I will <lb/>
            manage the whole affair for you." Both of the kings <lb/>
            were imposed upon in this manner, and, in their eagerness <lb/>
            to steal a march upon one another, one of them sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to the Persians with Teribazus, and the other <lb/>
            with his son. As Teribazus was a long while absent, <lb/>
            Artaxerxes began to suspect his fidelity, and he fell into <lb/>
            a very desponding condition, regretting that he had trusted <lb/>
            Teribazus, and listening to his detractors. When, however, <lb/>
            Teribazus arrived, and his son arrived also, each bringing <lb/>
            ambassadors from the Kadousians, and a treaty of peace was <lb/>
            concluded, Teribazus became again a great and important <lb/>
            personage. In this campaign Artaxerxes proved that <lb/>
            cowardice and effeminacy arise only from a depraved <lb/>
            disposition and natural meanness of spirit, not, as the <lb/>
            vulgar imagine, from wealth and luxury; for in spite of the <lb/>
            splendid dress and ornaments, valued at twelve thousand <lb/>
            talents, which he always wore, the king laboured as hard, <lb/>
            and suffered as great privations, as any common soldier, <lb/>
            never mounting his horse, but always leading the way on <lb/>
            foot up steep and rugged mountain paths, with his quiver <lb/>
            on his shoulder, and his shield on his left arm, so that all <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            the rest were inspirited and encouraged by seeing his <lb/>
            eagerness and vigour; for he accomplished every day a <lb/>
            march of upwards of two hundred stadia.</p>
          <p>XXV. When during cold weather the army, encamped <lb/>
            in a royal domain, which was full of parks and fine trees, <lb/>
            while all the rest of the country was bare and desert, he <lb/>
            permitted the soldiers to gather wood from the royal <lb/>
            park, and gave them leave to cut down the trees, without <lb/>
            sparing either fir trees or cypresses. As they hesitated, <lb/>
            and wished to spare the trees because of their size and <lb/>
            beauty, he himself took an axe and cut down the largest <lb/>
            and finest tree of all. After this they provided them­ <lb/>
            seives with wood, lighted many fires, and passed a com­ <lb/>
            fortable night.</p>
          <p>On his return from this campaign he found that he had <lb/>
            lost many brave men, and almost all his horses. He <lb/>
            fancied that he was regarded with contempt because of <lb/>
            his failure, and began to view all the great men of the <lb/>
            kingdom with suspicion. Many of them he put to death <lb/>
            in anger, but more because he feared them-for fear makes <lb/>
            kings cruel, while cheerful confidence renders them <lb/>
            gentle, merciful, and unsuspicious. For this reason ,the <lb/>
            beasts that start at the least noise are the most difficult <lb/>
            to tame, while those which are of a more courageous spirit <lb/>
            have more confidence and do not shrink from men's <lb/>
            advances.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Artaxerxes, who was now very old, perceived <lb/>
            that his sons were caballing with their friends and with <lb/>
            the chief nobles of the kingdom to secure the succession. <lb/>
            The more respectable of these thought that Artaxerxes <lb/>
            ought to leave the crown to his eldest son Darius, as he <lb/>
            himself had inherited it, but Ochus his younger son, who <lb/>
            was of a vehement and fierce disposition, had a very con­ <lb/>
            siderable party, who were ready to support his claims, and <lb/>
            hoped to be able to influence his father by means of <lb/>
            Atossa; for he paid her especial attention, and gave out <lb/>
            that he intended to marry her and make her his queen <lb/>
            after his father's death. It was even said that he intrigued <lb/>
            with her during his father's life. Artaxerxes knew <lb/>
            nothing of this : but as he wished to out off the hopes of <lb/>
            Ochus at once, for fear that he might do as Cyrus had <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            lone, and again plunge the kingdom in wars and disorders, <lb/>
            he proclaimed Darius his heir, and allowed him to wear his <lb/>
            tiara erect. There is a custom among the Persians that <lb/>
            whoever is declared heir to the throne may ask for any­ <lb/>
            thing that he pleases, and that the king who has <lb/>
            nominated him must, if possible grant his request. <lb/>
            Darius, in accordance with this custom, asked for Aspasia, <lb/>
            the favourite of Cyrus, who was at that time living in <lb/>
            the harem of Artaxerxes. This lady was a native of the <lb/>
            city of Phokæa in Ionia, born of free parents, and respect­ <lb/>
            ably brought up. When she was introduced to Cyrus at <lb/>
            supper, with several other women, the others sat down <lb/>
            beside him, permitted him to touch them and sport with <lb/>
            them, and were not offended at his familiarities, but she <lb/>
            stood in silence near the couch on which Cyrus reclined, <lb/>
            and refused to come to him when he called her. When <lb/>
            his chamberlains approached her, meaning to bring her to <lb/>
            him by force, she said, “ Whoever lays hands on me shall <lb/>
            smart for it." The company thought her very rude and <lb/>
            in-mannered, but Cyrus was pleased with her spirits, and <lb/>
            said, with a smile, to the man who had brought her, " Do <lb/>
            you not see that this is the only ladylike and respectable <lb/>
            one of them all." After this he became much attached to <lb/>
            her, loved her above all other women, and used to call her <lb/>
            “ Aspasia the wise." When Cyrus fell and his camp was <lb/>
            plundered she was taken prisoner.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Now, Darius vexed his father by asking for <lb/>
            this lady; for the Persians are excessively jealous about <lb/>
            their women; indeed, not only all who approach and speak <lb/>
            to one of the king's concubines, but even any one who <lb/>
            drives past or crosses their litters on the high road, is <lb/>
            punished with death. Yet, Artaxerxes, through sheer <lb/>
            passion, had made Atossa his wife, and kept three hundred <lb/>
            most beautiful concubines. However, when Darius made <lb/>
            this request, he replied that Aspasia was a free <lb/>
            woman, and said that if she was willing he might take <lb/>
            her, but that he would not force her to go against her <lb/>
            will. When she was sent for, as she, contrary to the <lb/>
            king's expectation, chose to go to Darius, the king let her <lb/>
            go, for the law compelled him to do so, but he soon after­ <lb/>
            wards took her away from him again : for he appointed <lb/>
             <pb n="481"/>
            her priestess of the temple of Artemis, called Anäitis, at <lb/>
            Ekbatana, in order that she might spend the rest of her <lb/>
            life in chastity. This he considered to be not a harsh, but <lb/>
            rather a playful way of reproving his son; but Darius was <lb/>
            much enraged at it, either because he was so deeply <lb/>
            enamoured of Aspasia, or because he thought that he was <lb/>
            being wantonly insulted by his father. Teribazus, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving his anger, confirmed him in it, because he saw in <lb/>
            the treatment which Darius had received the counterpart <lb/>
            of that which had befallen himself. The king, who had <lb/>
            several daughters, promised Apama to Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            Rhodogoune to Orontes, and Amestris to Teribazus. He <lb/>
            kept his word with the two former, but broke it to <lb/>
            Teribazus by marrying Amestris himself, and betrothing <lb/>
            his youngest daughter Atossa to him in her stead. When, <lb/>
            as has been related, he fell in love with her also and <lb/>
            married her, Teribazus became bitterly enraged against <lb/>
            him, being of an unstable and fickle disposition, without <lb/>
            any steady principles. For this reason he never could <lb/>
            bear either bad or good fortune, but at one time he was <lb/>
            honoured as one of the greatest men in the kingdom, and <lb/>
            then swaggered insufferably, while when he was disgraced <lb/>
            and reduced to poverty he could not bear his reverse of <lb/>
            fortune with a good grace, but became insolent and <lb/>
            offensive.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. It may be imagined that the company of <lb/>
            Teribazus was to Darius as fuel to fire, for Teribazus was <lb/>
            constantly repeating to him that it was of no use for him <lb/>
            to wear his tiara upright if he did not mean to advance <lb/>
            his own interests, and that he was a fool if he imagined <lb/>
            that he could inherit the crown without a struggle when <lb/>
            his brother was bringing female influence to bear to <lb/>
            secure his own succession, and when his father was in <lb/>
            such a vacillating and uncertain frame of mind. He who <lb/>
            could break the laws of the Persians-which may not be <lb/>
            broken-out of his passion for a Greek girl, cannot be <lb/>
            urged, be trusted, to keep the most important engage­ <lb/>
            ments. It was, moreover, a very different thing for Ochus <lb/>
            not to obtain the crown, and for him to be deprived of <lb/>
            it, for there was no reason why Ochus should not live <lb/>
            happily in a private station, whereas he, having been <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            appointed heir to the throne, must either become king <lb/>
            or perish. <lb/>
            Generally speaking, perhaps we may say with Sophocles, <lb/>
            " Swift runneth evil counsel to its goal," for men find the <lb/>
            path smooth and easy towards what they desire, and <lb/>
            most men desire what is wrong, because of their ignorance <lb/>
            and low mindodness. Yet, besides all these considerations, <lb/>
            the greatness of the empire, and the fear with which <lb/>
            Ochus inspired Darius, also afforded arguments to Ten­ <lb/>
            bazus. Nor was the goddess of Love entirely blameless <lb/>
            in the matter, for Darius was already incensed at the loss <lb/>
            of Aspasia.</p>
          <p>XXIX. He, therefore, placed himself entirely in the <lb/>
            hands of Teribazus; and many joined in their conspiracy. <lb/>
            But the plot was betrayed to the king by a eunuch, who <lb/>
            had a perfect knowledge of their plans, and knew that <lb/>
            they had determined to break into the king's chamber by <lb/>
            night and murder him in his bed. When Artaxerxes <lb/>
            heard this he was perplexed; for he felt that it would be <lb/>
            wrong for him to neglect the information which he had <lb/>
            received of so great a danger, and yet that it would be <lb/>
            even worse to believe the eunuch's story without any <lb/>
            proofs of its truth. He therefore ordered the eunuch to <lb/>
            join the conspirators, and to enter bis chamber with them. <lb/>
            Meanwhile he had a door made in the wall behind his bed, <lb/>
            and concealed it with tapestry. When the appointed time <lb/>
            arrived, of which he was warned by the eunuch, he lay <lb/>
            upon his bed, and did not rise before he had seen the faces <lb/>
            of the conspirators and clearly recognised each of them. <lb/>
            But when he saw them draw their daggers and rush upon <lb/>
            him, he quickly raised the tapestry, passed into the inner <lb/>
            room, and slammed the door, crying aloud for help. The <lb/>
            would-be murderers, having been seen by the king, but hav­ <lb/>
            ing effected nothing, rushed away through the gates of the <lb/>
            palace, and especially warned Teribazus to fly, as he had <lb/>
            been distinctly seen. The others dispersed and escaped, <lb/>
            but Teribazus was surrounded, and after killing many of <lb/>
            the king's body guard with his own hand was at last <lb/>
            despatched by a javelin hurled from a distance. Darius <lb/>
            and his children were brought before a court formed of <lb/>
            the royal judges, who were appointed by the king to try <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            him. As the king himself did not appear but impeached <lb/>
            him by proxy, he ordered clerks to write down the <lb/>
            decision of each judge and to bring it to ham. As all <lb/>
            decided alike, and sentenced Darius to death, the officers <lb/>
            of the court removed him into a prison hard by. The <lb/>
            executioner now came, bearing in his hand the razor, with <lb/>
            which the heads of criminals are cut off, but when he saw <lb/>
            Darius he was dismayed, and ran back to the door with his <lb/>
            face averted, declaring that he could not and dared not <lb/>
            lay hands upon his king. As, however, he was met <lb/>
            outside by the judges, who threatened him and ordered <lb/>
            him to do his duty, he returned, took hold of Darius's hair <lb/>
            with his left hand, dragged down his head, and severed <lb/>
            his neck with the razor. Some historians state that the <lb/>
            king himself was present at the trial, and that Darius, <lb/>
            when proved guilty, fell on his face and begged for mercy : <lb/>
            at which the king sprung up in anger, drew his dagger, <lb/>
            and stabbed him mortally. They add that Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            after he had returned to his palace, came forwai d publicly, <lb/>
            did obeisance to the sun, and then said aloud, " Men of <lb/>
            Persia, be of good cheer, and go, tell the rest of my sub­ <lb/>
            jects that the great Oromasdes has executed judgment upon <lb/>
            those who formed a wicked and treasonable plot."</p>
          <p>XXX. This was the end of the conspiracy; and now <lb/>
            Ochus was encouraged by Atossa to form high hopes, <lb/>
            though he still feared his remaining legitimate brother <lb/>
            Ariaspes, and his natural brother Arsames. The Persians <lb/>
            wished Ariaspes to be their king, not because he was older <lb/>
            than Ochus, but because he was of a gentle and kind dis­ <lb/>
            position; while Ochus observed that Arsames was of a <lb/>
            keen intellect, and was especially beloved by his father. <lb/>
            He, therefore, plotted against both of them, and as he was <lb/>
            by nature both crafty and cruel, he indulged his cruelty in <lb/>
            his treatment of Arsames, while he made use of his cunning <lb/>
            to ruin Ariaspes. He kept sending to this latter eunuchs <lb/>
            and friends of the king, who, with an affection of secrecy, <lb/>
            continually told him frightful tales of how his father had <lb/>
            determined to put him to death with every circumstance <lb/>
            of cruelty and insult. These messengers, by daily com­ <lb/>
            municating these fabrications to him, saying that the <lb/>
            king was on the very eve of carrying them into operation, <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            threw the unhappy man into such a terrible state of de­ <lb/>
            spair and excitement of mind that he ended his life by <lb/>
            poison. The king, on hearing of the manner of his death, <lb/>
            lamented for him, and had some suspicions about how he <lb/>
            came by his end; but as he was unable to verify them and <lb/>
            discover the truth, on account of his great age, he attached <lb/>
            himself all the more warmly to Arsames, so that he was well <lb/>
            known to trust and confide in him above all others. Yet, <lb/>
            Ochus was not discouraged by this, but finding a suitable <lb/>
            instrument in Arpates the son of Teribazus, induced him <lb/>
            to assassinate Arsames. Artaxerxes, when this happened, <lb/>
            was so old that his life hung by a mere thread; and when <lb/>
            this last blow fell, he could bear up no longer, but sunk <lb/>
            at once through grief and misery. He lived ninety-four <lb/>
            years, and reigned sixty-two, and was thought to be a mild <lb/>
            prince, and a lover of his subjects, though this was chiefly <lb/>
            because of his successor, Ochus, who was the most savage <lb/>
            and cruel tyrant that ever ruled in Persia..</p><pb n="485"/>

          <p>I. It seems to me, my Polykrates, that it was in order to <lb/>
            avoid the ill-omened sound of the old proverb, that the <lb/>
            philosopher Chrysippus altered it into what he thought <lb/>
            a better version: <lb/>
            "Who vaunt their fathers, save the beat of sons?" <lb/>
            but Dionysodorus of Trœzene proves him to be wrong, and <lb/>
            restores the proverb to its original form: <lb/>
            “ Who vaunt their fathers, save the worst of sona?” <lb/>
            and explains that the proverb was intended to apply to <lb/>
            those who are utterly worthless in themselves, but who <lb/>
            shelter their own evil lives behind the virtues of their <lb/>
            ancestors, and who pride themselves on their ancestors' <lb/>
            glory as though it were their own. Yet, in one who, like <lb/>
            yourself, " by birth inherits glory from a noble race," as <lb/>
            Pindar has it, and who, as you do, imitates in his own life <lb/>
            the noblest examples of his ancestry, may well take plea­ <lb/>
            sure in discoursing upon the lives of well-born men, and <lb/>
            in listening to the remarks of others about them. They <lb/>
            do not depend for praise upon the lives of other men, <lb/>
            because there is nothing to be admired in themselves, but <lb/>
            they combine the glory of their ancestors with their own, <lb/>
            and honour them both as having founded their families <lb/>
            and as having set examples to be imitated. For this <lb/>
            reason I have sent to you the life of Aratus, which I have <lb/>
            compiled, not that I was not aware that you had carefully <lb/>
            studied all his achievements and were well acquainted <lb/>
            with them, but with the hope that your sons, Polykrates <lb/>
            and Pythokles, might be brought up to imitate the glo. <lb/>

            rious example of their forefathers, and might learn to walk <lb/>
            in their footsteps by reading and discussing the history of <lb/>
            their exploits. Indeed, to imagine that one has already <lb/>
            arrived at perfection, argues self-conceit rather than true <lb/>
            greatness of character.</p>
          <p>II. The city of Sikyon, as soon as it lost its original <lb/>
            oligarchic Dorian constitution, became distracted by in­ <lb/>
            ternal faction, and at last fell into the hands of a series of <lb/>
            despotic rulers. After the last of these, named Kleon, had <lb/>
            been put to death, the citizens placed the government in <lb/>
            the hands of Timokleides and Kleinias, two of their most <lb/>
            honourable and influential men. But as soon as a settled <lb/>
            form of government began to be established, Timokleides <lb/>
            died, and Abantidas, the son of Paseas, in order to obtain <lb/>
            the supreme power for himself, assassinated Kleinias, <lb/>
            and either banished or put to death all his i elatives and <lb/>
            friends. He endeavoured to kill Kleinias's son, Aratus, <lb/>
            who was left an orphan at the age of seven; however, <lb/>
            during the confusion which prevailed in the house, the <lb/>
            child wandered out into the city, and, terrified and help­ <lb/>
            less, made his way unnoticed into the house of Soso, Aban­ <lb/>
            tidas's sister, whose husband was Prophantus, the brother <lb/>
            of Kleinias. She was naturally a high-souled lady, and <lb/>
            thought also that the child must have been directed by <lb/>
            heaven to take refuge in her house. She hid him from his <lb/>
            enemies, and that night sent him away to Argos.</p>
          <p>III. This adventurous escape from so terrible a danger <lb/>
            produced in the mind of Aratus the fiercest hatred of all <lb/>
            despots. He was brought up by his father's friends at <lb/>
            Argos in a manner becoming his birth, and as lie grew up <lb/>
            tall and strong, he devoted himself to gymnastic exercises <lb/>
            in the palæstra, and even gained a crown for success in <lb/>
            the pentathlum. We can trace the effects of this training <lb/>
            in his statues, which represent an intellectual and com­ <lb/>
            manding countenance, and also the effects of the liberal <lb/>
            diet and work- with the spade practised by the pro­ <lb/>
            fessional athlete. For this reason he paid less attention <lb/>
            to oratory than became a public man; yet he was a better <note type="footnote"> * See Grote on Epameinondas. "The muscularity, purchased by <lb/>

            speaker than some suppose, which is proved by the study <lb/>
            of his hastily and plainly-written memoirs.</p>
          <p>As time went on, Deinias and Aristotle the logician <lb/>
            formed a plot against Abantidas, who was accustomed to <lb/>
            come and spend his leisure time in the open market-place <lb/>
            with them, listening to their discourse and arguing with <lb/>
            them. They drew him into a discussion and assassinated <lb/>
            him. He was succeeded by his father, Pascas, who was <lb/>
            soon treacherously slain by Nikokles, who now declared <lb/>
            himself despot of Sikyon. We are told that this man was <lb/>
            singularly like Periander, the son of Kypselus, just as the <lb/>
            Persian Orontes bore a striking resemblance to Alkmæon, <lb/>
            the son of Amphiaraus, and a certain young Spartan so <lb/>
            closely resembled Hector, that he was trampled to death <lb/>
            by the multitudes who came to see him and satisfy their <lb/>
            curiosity.</p>
          <p>IV. Nikokles reigned four months, during which time <lb/>
            he did the city much hurt, and very nearly lost it to the <lb/>
            Ætolians, who had formed a plot to surprise it. Aratus <lb/>
            was now nearly grown up, and possessed great influence, <lb/>
            both on account of his noble birth, and because he was <lb/>
            already well known to be possessed of an enterprising <lb/>
            spirit, combined with a prudence beyond his years. In <lb/>
            consequence of this, all the other Sikyonian exiles looked <lb/>
            upon him as their leader, and Nikokles himself regarded <lb/>
            him with apprehension, and quietly took precautions <lb/>
            against him, never supposing that he would attempt so <lb/>
            audacious an enterprise as he did, but thinking ho would <lb/>
            probably make overtures to some of the successors of <lb/>
            Alexander, who had been guests * and friends of his father. <lb/>
            Indeed, Aratus did attempt to obtain assistance from some <lb/>
            of them; but since Antigonus, though he promised his <lb/>
            aid, temporised and hesitated to act, and his hopes from <lb/>
            Egypt and Ptolemy were too remote, he determined to <lb/>
            overthrow the despot alone.</p>
          <p>V. The first persons to whom he communicated his <lb/>
            design were Anstomachus and Ekdelus, of whom the <lb/>
            former was an exile from Sikyon, while Ekdelus was an <lb/>
            Arcadian of Megalopolis, a man of culture as well as of <lb/>
            action, who had been an intimate friend of Arkesilaus, the <note type="footnote"> * See vol. iii. Life of Agesilaus, e. 13, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            Academic philosopher at Athens. As both those men <lb/>
            readily accepted his proposals, Aratus began to discuss the <lb/>
            project with the other exiles. Some few felt ashamed to <lb/>
            abandon all hope of restoration to their country, and joined <lb/>
            Aratus, but most of them tried to hinder him from making <lb/>
            the attempt, alleging that his daring was the result of <lb/>
            inexperience. While Aratus was meditating whether he <lb/>
            could not seize some strong place within the territory of <lb/>
            Sikyon, and make it the base of his operations against the <lb/>
            despot, there came to Argos a certain Sikyonian who had <lb/>
            escaped from prison. This man was the brother of Xeno­ <lb/>
            kles, one of the exiles; and when brought to Aratus by <lb/>
            his brother, told him that the city wall, at the place where <lb/>
            he himself climbed over it and made his escape, was very <lb/>
            nearly level with the ground on the inside, as it was built <lb/>
            up against high and rocky ground, while on the outside it <lb/>
            was not so high as to be beyond the reach of scaling-ladders. <lb/>
            Aratus, when he heard this, sent Xenokles with two of his <lb/>
            own servants, named Seuthas and Technon, to reconnoitre <lb/>
            the spot, for he was determined, if possible, to risk every­ <lb/>
            thing by one sudden and secret assault, rather than openly <lb/>
            to engage in what might prove a long and tedious war, <lb/>
            waged, as it would be by a private man against the des­ <lb/>
            potic ruler of a state. Xenokles, on his return, reported <lb/>
            that he had measured the height of the walls, and that <lb/>
            the ground presented no difficulties for their attempt, but <lb/>
            he said that it would be difficult to reach the place unob­ <lb/>
            served, because of the dogs of a gardener who dwelt near, <lb/>
            which, though small, were peculiarly ferocious and savage. <lb/>
            Upon hearing this, Aratus at once began to prepare for the <lb/>
            attempt.</p>
          <p>VI. The use of arms was, at that period, familiar to all <lb/>
            men, because of the constant marauding incursions which <lb/>
            each state continually made upon the territory of its neigh­ <lb/>
            bours. The scaling-ladders were made openly by Euph­ <lb/>
            ranor the carpenter, one of the exiles, whose trade enabled <lb/>
            him to construct them without exciting suspicion.</p>
          <p>The Argive friends of Aratus each contributed ten men <lb/>
            from their own households; while he himself was able to <lb/>
            pam thirty slaves of his own. He also hired from Xeno­ <lb/>
            krilus, the well-known captain of robbers, a small band of <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            soldiers, who were told that the object of the incursion <lb/>
            into the Sikyonian territory was to carry off some horses <lb/>
            belonging to King Antigonus. Most of the band were <lb/>
            ordered to make their way in scattered parties to the tower <lb/>
            of Polygnotus, and there to wait for their leaders. Kaphi­ <lb/>
            sias, in light marching order, with four others, was sent on <lb/>
            in advance, with instructions to present himself at the <lb/>
            house of the gardener about nightfall. Under the pretext <lb/>
            of being wayfaring men seeking for hospitality, they were <lb/>
            to obtain lodgings there for the night, and secure both the <lb/>
            man and his dogs, for unless this was done it would be <lb/>
            impossible to reach the walls. The scaling-ladders, which <lb/>
            were made to take to pieces, were packed in chests, covered <lb/>
            over, and sent forward in waggons. Meanwhile, as several <lb/>
            spies sent by Nikokles had appeared in Argos, who were <lb/>
            said to be quietly watching the movements of Aratus, he <lb/>
            rose at daybreak, and spent the day in the open market- <lb/>
            place, conversing with his friends. Towards evening he <lb/>
            anointed himself in the palæstra, and then went home, <lb/>
            taking with him several of the companions with whom he <lb/>
            was accustomed to drink and amuse himself. Soon after <lb/>
            this his servants were seen crossing the market-place, one <lb/>
            carrying garlands, another buying torches, and another <lb/>
            bargaining with the female musicians who were wont to <lb/>
            attend at banquets. The spies, seeing all these prepara­ <lb/>
            tions, were deceived and laughingly said to one another, <lb/>
            “ Surely there is nothing more cowardly than a tyrant, if <lb/>
            Nikokles, with such a city and armed force at his disposal, <lb/>
            really fears this youth, who wastes the income on which <lb/>
            he has to subsist in exile, on amusements and on wine <lb/>
            parties before it is even dark."</p>
          <p>VII. Thus the spies were thrown off their guard; but <lb/>
            Aratus, immediately after supper, sallied forth, met his <lb/>
            men at the tower of Polygnotus, and led them to Nemea <lb/>
            where he explained, to most of them for the first time, what <lb/>
            he was about to attempt. After promising them rewards <lb/>
            in case of success, and addressing to them a few words of <lb/>
            encouragement, he gave Propitious Apollo as the watch­ <lb/>
            word, and proceeded towards the city, regulating his <lb/>
            march according to the moon, so that he was able to make <lb/>
            use of its light to march by, and when it was setting <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            arrived at the garden outside the walls. Here Kaphisias <lb/>
            met him, with the news that he had not been able to <lb/>
            secure the dogs, which had run away, but that he that <lb/>
            locked up the gardener in his house. On hearing this <lb/>
            most of the conspirators became disheartened, and de­ <lb/>
            manded to be led back again; but Aratus pacified them by <lb/>
            promising that, if the dogs attacked them and gave the <lb/>
            alarm, he would give up the attempt. lie now sent for­ <lb/>
            ward a party with the scaling-ladders, under the command <lb/>
            of Ekdelus and Mnesitheus, and himself proceeded at a <lb/>
            leisurely pace. The dogs at once set upon the party under <lb/>
            Ekdelus, and kept up a continuous barking; nevertheless <lb/>
            they reached the wall and placed the ladders against it un­ <lb/>
            disturbed. While the foremost were mounting, the officer <lb/>
            who was being relieved by the morning guard passed that <lb/>
            way carrying a bell, and there was a great flashing of <lb/>
            lights and trampling of marching soldiers. The con­ <lb/>
            spirators remained where they were, crouching upon their <lb/>
            ladders, and without difficulty escaped the notice of this <lb/>
            patrol, but they were terribly near being discovered by a <lb/>
            second body of guards marching in the opposite direction. <lb/>
            As soon as this also had passed by without noticing them, <lb/>
            the leaders, Mnesitheus and Ekdelus, at once mounted <lb/>
            upon the walls, secured the passage along the walls both <lb/>
            on the right and on the left, and despatched Teohnon to <lb/>
            Aratus, bidding him hasten to the spot.</p>
          <p>VIII. At no great distance from the garden there stood <lb/>
            a tower upon the walls, in which a great hound was kept <lb/>
            for a watch. This hound had not noticed the approach of <lb/>
            the escalading party, either because he was dull of hearing, <lb/>
            or because he was tired with exercise the day before. <lb/>
            When, however, the gardener's little dogs roused him by <lb/>
            their clamour at the foot of the wall, he at first set up a <lb/>
            low growling, and then, as the party drew nearer, began <lb/>
            to bark furiously. He made so much noise that the <lb/>
            sentry on the next tower called out in a loud voice to the <lb/>
            huntsman in charge of the dog, asking him at what <lb/>
            the hound was barking so savagely, and whether any­ <lb/>
            thing was wrong. The huntsman replied from his tower <lb/>
            that all was well, only that the hound had been disturbed <lb/>
            by the lights of the patrol and the sound of their bell. <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            This gave great encouragement to Aratus's party, who <lb/>
            imagined that tha huntsman spoke thus because he had <lb/>
            seen them and wished to screen .them from observation and <lb/>
            assist their plot, and that many others in the city might <lb/>
            be willing to do the same. Yet, the scaling of the walls <lb/>
            was a long and dangerous operation, as the ladders were <lb/>
            too weak to bear the weight of more than one man <lb/>
            mounting slowly at a time, yet time pressed, for the cocks <lb/>
            had already begun to crow, and soon the country people <lb/>
            might be expected to arrive, bringing their wares to market. <lb/>
            So, now, Aratus, himself hastily mounted, after forty of his <lb/>
            men had reached the top, and while the remainder were <lb/>
            still mounting, he marched straight to the despot's <lb/>
            house, and the guard-room in which his mercenary troops <lb/>
            passed the night. By a sudden assault he took them <lb/>
            all prisoners without killing one of them, and at once <lb/>
            sent messengers to summon his own friends from their <lb/>
            houses. Day was breaking while they assembled, and <lb/>
            soon the theatre was filled with an excited crowd with­ <lb/>
            out any distinct idea of what was happening, until a herald <lb/>
            came forward and announced to the people that Aratus, <lb/>
            the son of Kleinias, invited his fellow-citizens to regain <lb/>
            their liberty.</p>
          <p>IX. The people now, at last, believed that their long­ <lb/>
            looked-for deliverers had indeed come, and rushed in a <lb/>
            body to set fire to the despot's house. The burning house <lb/>
            made such a prodigious blaze that it was seen as far as <lb/>
            Corinth, where the citizens were so much astonished, that <lb/>
            they were within a little of setting out to rescue Sikyon <lb/>
            from the flames. Nikokles himself escaped by a subter­ <lb/>
            ranean passage, and got clear away from the city, and his <lb/>
            soldiers, with the assistance of the citizens, put out the <lb/>
            fire and plundered his house. Aratus did not attempt to <lb/>
            stop this proceeding, and distributed the remainder of <lb/>
            the despot's treasure among the citizens. No one was <lb/>
            killed or wounded, either of the attacking or defending <lb/>
            party, but by good fortune this great exploit was accom­ <lb/>
            plished without spilling a drop of blood. Aratus now <lb/>
            restored the citizens whom Nikokles had banished, who <lb/>
            were eighty in number, and also those who had been <lb/>
            driven into exile by his predecessors, who amounted to no <lb/>
             <pb n="492"/>
            less than five hundred. These latter had been forced <lb/>
            to wander from place to place for a period of nearly <lb/>
            fifty years. They now returned, very poor for the most <lb/>
            part, and at once laid claim to the property which had <lb/>
            once been theirs. Their attempts to gain possession of <lb/>
            their houses and lands caused the greatest disquietude to <lb/>
            Aratus, who saw the city plotted against from without, <lb/>
            and viewed with dislike by Antigonus on account of its <lb/>
            free constitution, while within it was full of faction and <lb/>
            disturbance. Under these circumstances he did what he <lb/>
            thought was best, by making the city a member of the <lb/>
            Achaean league: and the people of Sikyon, Dorians as <lb/>
            they were, willingly adopted the name and entered into <lb/>
            the confederacy of the Achæans, who at that time were <lb/>
            neither famous nor powerful. Most of them dwelt in small <lb/>
            towns, and their territory was both confined and unpro­ <lb/>
            ductive, while the sea-shore, near which they lived, was <lb/>
            without harbours, and for the most part exposed to a <lb/>
            terrible surf. Yet these men, more than any others, <lb/>
            proved that Greeks are invincible wherever they are col­ <lb/>
            lected into regularly organised communities, and with a <lb/>
            capable general to lead them. They were but an insigni­ <lb/>
            ficant fraction of the mighty Greece of former times, and <lb/>
            had not altogether the strength of one single considerable <lb/>
            city; yet, by wise counsel and agreement among them­ <lb/>
            selves, and by following and obeying their greatest man, <lb/>
            instead of being jealous of his power, they not only pre­ <lb/>
            served their own liberties, although surrounded by so many <lb/>
            powerful cities and despots, but were constantly able to <lb/>
            assist the rest of the Greeks in recovering and defending <lb/>
            their freedom.</p>
          <p>X. Aratus was by nature a politician, and was of a mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous disposition, more careful of the interests of the <lb/>
            state than of his own. He regarded all despots with a <lb/>
            peculiarly rancorous hatred, but in respect to other per­ <lb/>
            sons, made his personal likes and dislikes subordinate to <lb/>
            the good of his country. For this reason his zeal for his <lb/>
            friends does not appear to have been so remarkable as his <lb/>
            mild and forgiving treatment of his enemies; for he regu­ <lb/>
            lated his private feelings entirely by considerations of <lb/>
            public expediency. He loved to form alliances between <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            states, to connect cities into confederations, and to teach <lb/>
            the leaders and the people alike to act together with <lb/>
            unanimity. Singularly timid and faint-hearted in open <lb/>
            war and in battles fought by daylight, he nevertheless was <lb/>
            most dexterous at planning surprises, winning cities, and <lb/>
            overthrowing despots. For this reason he often succeeded <lb/>
            in his rashest enterprises, and often, through excessive <lb/>
            caution, failed when success would have been comparatively <lb/>
            easy. Some wild animals see best in the dark, and are <lb/>
            nearly blind during the daytime, because the moist nature <lb/>
            of their eyes cannot endure the dry and searching rays of <lb/>
            the sun; and so, too, it appears that some men lose their <lb/>
            courage and are easily disconcerted when they are fighting <lb/>
            openly in broad daylight, but yet recover all their bravery <lb/>
            as soon as they engage in secret stratagems and midnight <lb/>
            surprises. These anomalies must be attributed to a want <lb/>
            of philosophic reflection in noble minds, which effect great <lb/>
            things naturally, and without acting by rule or method, <lb/>
            just as we see good fruit produced by wild and uncul­ <lb/>
            tivated trees. I will now proceed to prove this by <lb/>
            examples.</p>
          <p>XI. Aratus, after he had joined himself and his native <lb/>
            city to the Achæan league, served in the cavalry force, <lb/>
            and made himself generally beloved by the ready obedience <lb/>
            which he showed to his commanders; for he, although he <lb/>
            had rendered the league such important services in putting <lb/>
            his own illustrious name and the power of the city of <lb/>
            Sikyon at its disposal, yet, as if he were a mere private <lb/>
            man, obeyed whoever might be in command, even though <lb/>
            he were a citizen of Dyme, or of Tritæa, or even some more <lb/>
            insignificant city. Aratus was now presented with the <lb/>
            sum of five-and-twenty talents by the king.- This he <lb/>
            received, but spent it all on relieving his destitute fellow- <lb/>
            countrymen, and in ransoming them from slavery.</p>
          <p>XII. As the returned exiles could not be withheld from <lb/>
            attacking those whom they found in possession of their <lb/>
            property, and by doing so seemed likely to bring the state <lb/>
            to ruin, Aratus, thinking that nothing but the kindness of <lb/>
            Ptolemy could save his country, started upon a voyage to <lb/>
            Egypt, to beg the king to furnish him with a sum of <note type="footnote"> * Ptolemy, King of Egypt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            money, by means of which he might persuade the oon­ <lb/>
            tending parties to come to an amicable agreement. He <lb/>
            started from the port of Mothone, and sailed beyond Cape <lb/>
            Millea, meaning to cross directly over the sea to Egypt. <lb/>
            However, the sea was very rough, and the wind contrary, <lb/>
            which caused the captain of the ship to bear up, and run <lb/>
            along the coast until, with great difficulty, he reached <lb/>
            Adria,* which was an enemy's country, for it was in the <lb/>
            possession of Antigonus, who had placed a Macedonian <lb/>
            garrison in it. Aratus contrived to keep out of the way <lb/>
            of the garrison, and, leaving the ship, proceeded a long <lb/>
            way inland, accompanied by one single friend, named <lb/>
            Timanthes. They concealed themselves in a thick wood, <lb/>
            and passed the night as best they could. Shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards the Macedonian officer in charge appeared, and en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to find Aratus, but was put off the scent by the <lb/>
            slaves of Aratus, who had been instructed to say that their <lb/>
            master, as soon as he left them, had sailed in another <lb/>
            vessel bound to Eubœa. However, the Macedonian de­ <lb/>
            clared the cargo, the vessel, and the slaves to be a lawful <lb/>
            prize, as being enemy's property, and detained them as <lb/>
            such. A few days after this, when Aratus was almost at <lb/>
            his wit's end, by good fortune a Roman ship touched at the <lb/>
            place where he was spending his time in looking out for <lb/>
            means of escape by sea, and in trying to conceal himself <lb/>
            from his enemies on land. The ship was bound for Syria, <lb/>
            but Aratus would not sail in it until he had persuaded the <lb/>
            captain to land him in Karia. On his voyage thither he <lb/>
            again encountered great dangers: but at length he suo­ <lb/>
            ceeded in obtaining a passage from Karia to Egypt, where <lb/>
            he was warmly received by the king, who had always had <lb/>
            a favourable opinion of him, and who had lately received <note type="footnote">* The reading Adria is obviously wrong. Droysen suggests Andros, <lb/>
            but Thirlwall much more reasonably conjectures that the word should <lb/>
            be Hydrea, observing that the geographical position of Andros does <lb/>
            not suit the account given in the text. Clough prefers to read Andros, <lb/>
            saying that “Aratus would hardly be thought to have gone from <lb/>
            Hydrea to Eubœa, which is near enough to Andros to make the <lb/>
            supposition in this case not unnatural." But I think that this argu­ <lb/>
            ment makes just the other way, for the object of Aratus's slaves was <lb/>
            to tell the Macedonian officer that their muster was gone to a place <lb/>
            so far away that it would be useless to attempt to follow him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            from him many drawings and paintings by Greek artists. <lb/>
            Aratus, who had considerable taste in these matters, con­ <lb/>
            stantly purchased and collected the works of the most <lb/>
            skilful and famous painters, especially those of Pamphilus <lb/>
            and Melanthus, and used to send them as presents to <lb/>
            King Ptolemy.</p>
          <p>XIII. At that time the Sikyonian school of painting was <lb/>
            still celebrated throughout Greece, and was thought more <lb/>
            than any other to have preserved the purity of the ancient <lb/>
            style. Even the great Apelles, when already famous, had <lb/>
            come to Sikyon and paid a talent for some lessons from <lb/>
            the masters there, although by doing so be hoped to <lb/>
            increase his reputation rather than to improve his art. <lb/>
            When Aratus set the city free, he at once destroyed all <lb/>
            the portraits - of the despots, except that of Aristratus, <lb/>
            who flourished in the time of Philip, t about which he <lb/>
            hesitated for a long time; for the picture in which <lb/>
            Aristratus was represented standing beside the chariot <lb/>
            which won him a prize in the games, was the joint work <lb/>
            of all the pupils of Melanthus, and we are told by <lb/>
            Polemon the geographer, that some parts of it were painted <lb/>
            by Apelles himself. The execution was so admirable that <lb/>
            Aratus for a moment relented, but soon afterwards his <lb/>
            fierce hatred of all the despots made him order it to be <lb/>
            destroyed. However, Nealkes the painter, who was a <lb/>
            friend of Aratus, interceded for the picture with tears, and <lb/>
            as he could not move Aratus, at last said, " We ought to <lb/>
            make war against despots themselves, but not against their <lb/>
            surroundings. Let us leave the chariot and the figure of <lb/>
            Victory, and I will deliver up Aristratus to you, by wiping <lb/>
            him out of the picture." Aratus allowed Nealkes to do <lb/>
            this, and he effaced the figure of Aristratus, and painted <lb/>
            a palm tree in its place, without venturing to add any­ <lb/>
            thing else. It is said that after destroying the figure of <lb/>
            Aristratus, the painter forgot his feet, and that they were <lb/>
            still to be seen under the chariot. By presents of such <lb/>
            paintings as these Aratus had already disposed Ptolemy to <note type="footnote"> * The word which I have here translated w portraits" generally <lb/>
            means statues, but not necessarily. Probably most of the despots were <lb/>
            commemorated by statues. </note><note type="footnote"> t Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, I suppose it meant. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            regard him with favour; and when they met, Arabia so <lb/>
            charmed the king by his conversation that he received <lb/>
            from him a present of one hundred and fifty talents for the <lb/>
            use of his native city. Aratus carried forty talents home <lb/>
            with him at once to Peloponnesus, and afterwards received <lb/>
            the rest of the sum in instalments from the king.</p>
          <p>XIV. It was a truly great action for Aratus to bestow so <lb/>
            much money upon his fellow-countrymen, especially at a <lb/>
            time when for much smaller sums the kings were usually <lb/>
            able to bribe the other chiefs and popular leaders to betray <lb/>
            their native cities and sacrifice their constitutional liberties; <lb/>
            but it was even more admirable that by means of this <lb/>
            money he reconciled the rich and the poor, and saved the <lb/>
            state from all the danger of revolution, while his own <lb/>
            conduct was marked by the greatest moderation in spite <lb/>
            of his enormous power. When he was appointed as sole <lb/>
            arbitrator with unlimited authority, to decide upon the <lb/>
            claims of the exiled families to their inheritances, he refused <lb/>
            to act alone, and associated fifteen of the other citizens <lb/>
            with himself, with whose help, after much labour and <lb/>
            difficulty, he restored peace and union amongst his country­ <lb/>
            men. For these services the state bestowed upon him <lb/>
            fitting honours, but in addition to these the exiles gave <lb/>
            him a special mark of their regard by erecting a brazen <lb/>
            statue, upon which was inscribed the following verses :­ <lb/>
            "For wisdom, valour, and great deeds in war <lb/>
            Thy fame, Aratus, has been noised afar. <lb/>
            We, that unhappy exiles were of late, <lb/>
            Brought home by thee, this statute dedicate <lb/>
            To all the gods who helped thee to restore <lb/>
            Peace and goodwill amongst us as before."</p>
          <p>XV. By this important measure Aratus so thoroughly <lb/>
            earned the gratitude of his countrymen as to be placed <lb/>
            above the reach of party jealousy; but King Antigonus <lb/>
            was much displeased at his success, and with the object <lb/>
            either of making him his friend, or of causing him to be <lb/>
            distrusted by Ptolemy, bestowed upon him several marks <lb/>
            of favour, and when sacrificing to the gods at Corinth even <lb/>
            sent some of the meat of the victim to Sikyon as a present <lb/>
            for him. At dinner that evening he said aloud in the <lb/>
            hearing of many guests: “ I thought this young Sikyoniau <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            was merely a well-bred and patriotic youth ; but it seems <lb/>
            that he is a very shrewd judge of the lives and politics of <lb/>
            us kings. At first he used to despise me, and looked <lb/>
            beyond me to Egypt, because he had heard so much about <lb/>
            the elephants and fleets of Ptolemy, and about the <lb/>
            splendour of nis court, but now that he has been admitted <lb/>
            behind the scenes there and has discovered it to be all empty <lb/>
            show and parade, he has thrown himself into my arms <lb/>
            without reserve So now I receive the youth into my own <lb/>
            service, and shall employ him in all my affairs; and I beg <lb/>
            you all to treat him as a friend. " <lb/>
            All those who were jealous of Aratus and who wished <lb/>
            him ill, as soon as they heard these words, vied with one <lb/>
            another in sending letters to Ptolemy, full of abuse of <lb/>
            Aratus, until at length Ptolemy himself wrote to Aratus <lb/>
            and reproached him for his disloyalty. So much jealousy <lb/>
            and ill-feeling does the friendship of kings produce among <lb/>
            those who most eagerly struggle to gain it.</p>
          <p>XVI. Aratus, who was now for the first time elected <lb/>
            general of the Achæans, invaded and plundered the <lb/>
            countries of Kalydonia and Lokris on the other side of the <lb/>
            Corinthian gulf, but though he marched with ten thousand <lb/>
            men to help the Bœotians he came too late to take part in <lb/>
            the battle, in which they were defeated near Chæronea by <lb/>
            the Ætolians. In this battle a thousand Bœotians perished, <lb/>
            amongst whom was Aboeokritus the Boeotarch himself. <lb/>
            Next year Aratus was again chosen general, and began to <lb/>
            arrange his plot for the capture of the Akrocorinthus, or <lb/>
            citadel of Corinth. He made this attempt not to benefit <lb/>
            the Achæans, or his own city of Sikyon, but solely with <lb/>
            the object of driving out the Macedonian garrison, which <lb/>
            was established there as the common despot over all Greece. <lb/>
            The Athenian Chares, after gaining some success in battle <lb/>
            over the generals of the King of Persia, sent home a des­ <lb/>
            patch to the Athenian people in which he declared that he <lb/>
            had W'on the sister victory to that of Marathon : and this <lb/>
            exploit of Aratus may be most truly described as sister to <lb/>
            those of Pelopidas the Theban and of Thrasybulus the <lb/>
            Athenian, in which they each killed the despots of their <lb/>
            respective cities; except that this assault was not delivered <lb/>
            against Greeks, but against a foreign and alien sovereignty. <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            Now the isthmus, which bars out the two seas, connects <lb/>
            together the two parts of our continent; but the Acro­ <lb/>
            corinthus, which is a lofty mountain placed in the middle <lb/>
            of Greece, if it be held by an armed force, cuts off the land <lb/>
            beyond the isthmus from all intercourse with the rest of <lb/>
            Greece, whether for warlike or commercial purposes, and <lb/>
            places the whole country at the mercy of the commander <lb/>
            of its garrison; so that the younger Philip was not in jest <lb/>
            but in earnest when he called the city of Corinth the “ key <lb/>
            of Greece."</p>
          <p>XVII. The possession of this place was always coveted <lb/>
            by all princes and rulers, but the desire of Antigonus for <lb/>
            it became a frantic passion, and his whole thoughts were <lb/>
            occupied with plots to obtain it by stratagem, since it was <lb/>
            hopeless to attempt to take it by force. After the death <lb/>
            of Alexander,* who originally held it, and who, it is said, <lb/>
            was poisoned by Antigonus, his wife Nikæa succeeded to <lb/>
            his kingdom, and held the Acrocorinthus. Antigonus now <lb/>
            at once sent his son Demetrius to her, and by holding out <lb/>
            the dazzling prospect of a royal alliance and a handsome <lb/>
            young husband to a woman somewhat past her prime, <lb/>
            made a conquest of her by means of his son, whom he em­ <lb/>
            ployed without scruple to tempt his victim. As, however, <lb/>
            she would not give up the citadel, but kept it strongly <lb/>
            guarded, Antigonus pretended to be indifferent to it, and <lb/>
            prepared a wedding feast in Corinth, spending the whole <lb/>
            day in attendance at spectacles and in wine-drinking, as if <lb/>
            he had entirely given himself up to pleasure and enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment. When the time drew near for the attempt, he him­ <lb/>
            self accompanied Nikæa to the theatre to hear Amœbeus <lb/>
            sing. They were carried together in royal state in a <lb/>
            splendidly ornamented litter, and she was delighted at the <lb/>
            respect which he showed her, and was as far as possible <lb/>
            from guessing his real purpose. When they arrived at the <lb/>
            point where the road turned off towards the citadel, he <lb/>
            begged her to proceed alone to the theatre, and without <lb/>
            troubling himself further about Amœbeus or the marriage, <lb/>
            ran up to the Acrocorinthus faster than one would have <lb/>
            expected in a man of his age. Finding the gate shut, he <note type="footnote"> * This Alexander was the son of Kraterus, and grandson of <lb/>
            Alexander the Great's general of that name. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            knocked at it with his stick, bidding the garrison open it; <lb/>
            and they, astounded at his audacity, threw it open. When <lb/>
            he had thus obtained possession of the place he could no <lb/>
            longer restrain himself, but although he was now an old <lb/>
            man, and had experienced great vicissitudes of fortune, he <lb/>
            drank wine and jumped for joy in the streets, and swaggered <lb/>
            riotously across the market-place, crowned with flowers, <lb/>
            and accompanied by singing-girls, greeting and shaking <lb/>
            hands with every one whom he met. So true it is that <lb/>
            unexpected joy disturbs the right balance of the mind <lb/>
            more than either grief or terror.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Now Antigonus, having, as above related, <lb/>
            gained possession of the Acrocorinthus, entrusted the <lb/>
            place to some of his most faithful officers, among whom <lb/>
            was Persæus the philosopher. Aratus, during the life of <lb/>
            Alexander, had begun to form a plan for surprising the <lb/>
            citadel, but desisted from his plot when Alexander became <lb/>
            an ally of the Achæans. He now began to form fresh <lb/>
            schemes, in the following manner:-There were in Corinth <lb/>
            four brothers, Syrians by birth, one of whom, named <lb/>
            Dickies, was serving in the garrison, and quartered in the <lb/>
            citadel. The other three, having robbed the king's <lb/>
            treasury, came to Sikyon to dispose of the plunder to a <lb/>
            banker named Ægias, who was well known to Aratus <lb/>
            from having had dealings with him. They disposed of a <lb/>
            considerable part of their plunder at first, and afterwards, <lb/>
            one of them, named Erginus, came quietly over from <lb/>
            time to time with the remainder. In this way he became <lb/>
            intimate with Ægias, and, being led on by him to talk <lb/>
            about the citadel, said that when going up the hill to visit <lb/>
            his brother, he had noticed a narrow path on one side, <lb/>
            which led to the lowest part of the wall of the fortress. <lb/>
            On hearing this, Ægias laughingly said to him, “My good <lb/>
            sir, why do you rob the king's treasury to gain such <lb/>
            pitiful sums of money, when you might gain great riches <lb/>
            in a single hour ? Do you not know that burglary and <lb/>
            treachery are alike punished with death?" Erginus <lb/>
            smiled at this, and agreed to sound his brother Diokles <lb/>
            upon this point; for he could not, he said, place much <lb/>
            confidence in the other two.</p>
          <p>In a few days he returned, undertook to lead Aratus to <note type="footnote"> 2 K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="500"/>
            i part of the wall which was not more than fifteen feet <lb/>
            high, and arranged that both he and his brother Dickies <lb/>
            would do all in their power to assist him.</p>
          <p>XIX. Aratus promised that he would give them sixty <lb/>
            talents if successful, and that, in case of failure, if he and <lb/>
            they survived, he would give each of them a house and a <lb/>
            talent. As the money had to be deposited with Ægias <lb/>
            for the satisfaction of Erginus, Aratus, who did not pos­ <lb/>
            sess the sum necessary, and who did not wish to lead <lb/>
            others to suspect his design by borrowing, took the greater <lb/>
            part of his own plate and his wife's jewels, and pledged <lb/>
            them with Ægias for the money. Indeed, he was of so <lb/>
            lofty a soul, and so passionately desirous of glory, that <lb/>
            although he knew that Phokion and Epameinondas had <lb/>
            gained the reputation of being the most just and noble of <lb/>
            the Greeks, by refusing large bribes and not sacrificing <lb/>
            honour to money, he preferred to expend his fortune <lb/>
            secretly in enterprises in which he alone risked his life on <lb/>
            behalf of the many, who did not even know what he was <lb/>
            doing. Who, even in our own day, could refrain from <lb/>
            admiring and longing to share the fortunes of a man who <lb/>
            bought for himself so great a danger at so high a price, <lb/>
            and who pawned the most valuable of his possessions in <lb/>
            order that he might make his way into the fortress of his <lb/>
            enemies by night and fight for his life there, gaining by <lb/>
            his deposit the hope of glory, but nothing else ?</p>
          <p>XX. The plot, dangerous enough in itself, was rendered <lb/>
            even more so at its very outset by a blunder. Technon, <lb/>
            the servant of Aratus, was sent to examine the wall <lb/>
            together with Diokles. He had never before met Dickies, <lb/>
            but imagining that he knew his appearance from Erginus's <lb/>
            description of him as a man with close curly hair, a dark <lb/>
            complexion, and no beard, went to the rendezvous, and <lb/>
            waited outside the city, near the place called Omnis, for <lb/>
            Erginus, who was to meet him there with his brother <lb/>
            Dickies. In the meantime the brother of Erginus and <lb/>
            Dickies, named Dionysius, who was not in the plot, and <lb/>
            knew nothing of what was going on, happened to come up. <lb/>
            He was very like Diokles, and Technon, influenced by the <lb/>
            likeness, inquired of him if he were in any way connected <lb/>
            with Erginus. As he answered that he was his brother, <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            Technon was quite certain that he was addressing Diokles; <lb/>
            and without asking his name or waiting for any further <lb/>
            proof of identity he gave him his hand, spoke of the compact <lb/>
            with Erginus, and asked him questions about it. He <lb/>
            cleverly encouraged Technon in his error, agreed to every­ <lb/>
            thing that he said, and, turning round, walked with him <lb/>
            towards the city without exciting his suspicions. When <lb/>
            he was close to the gate, and had all but inveigled Technon <lb/>
            through it, it chanced that Erginus met them. Perceiving <lb/>
            the trick which his brother had played, and the danger in <lb/>
            which Technon was placed, he warned him by a sign to <lb/>
            make his escape, and both of them, running away at full <lb/>
            speed, got safe back to Aratus. Yet he did not despair, <lb/>
            but at once sent Erginus to take some money to Dionysius, <lb/>
            and to beg him to hold his tongue. Erginus accomplished <lb/>
            his commission, and brought Dionysius back with him to <lb/>
            Aratus. When he arrived there they would not let him <lb/>
            go again, but kept him a close prisoner, while they them­ <lb/>
            selves prepared to make the attempt.</p>
          <p>XXI. When all was ready, Aratus ordered the greater <lb/>
            part of his force to pass the night under arms, and himself <lb/>
            with a chosen body of four hundred men, few of whom <lb/>
            were in the secret, proceeded towards the gates of Corinth, <lb/>
            near the temple of Hera. The time was the height of <lb/>
            summer. The moon was at the full, and as the night <lb/>
            was clear and cloudless, they began to fear that the light <lb/>
            gleaming from their arms would betray them to the <lb/>
            sentinels. However, when the leading men were near to <lb/>
            the wall a log came up from the sea, and enveloped the <lb/>
            whole city and its neighbourhood. Now, the men all sat <lb/>
            down and took off their shoes; for men who mount ladders <lb/>
            with naked feet make very little noise and are not so liable <lb/>
            to slip. Meanwhile Erginus, with seven youths dressed <lb/>
            as wayfaring men, made his way up to the gate un­ <lb/>
            suspected. They killed the keeper of the gate, and the <lb/>
            guard : while at the same time the scaling-ladders were <lb/>
            placed against the walls. Aratus hastily crossed the walls <lb/>
            with a hundred men. Bidding the remainder follow as <lb/>
            fast as they could, he ordered the ladders to be drawn up, <lb/>
            and, followed by his hundred men, ran through the town <lb/>
            to the citadel, overjoyed at having got so far without raising <lb/>
             <pb n="502"/>
            an alarm, and already certain of success. While they <lb/>
            were still some distance off, they met a patrol of four men <lb/>
            carrying a light. These men could not see them because <lb/>
            they were in the shadow of the moon, but the four men <lb/>
            were clearly visible as they marched straight towards <lb/>
            them. Aratus now drew his force a little aside among <lb/>
            some ruins and low walls, so as to form an am bush, and <lb/>
            set upon the men. Three were killed on the spot, but the <lb/>
            fourth, though wounded in the head by a blow from a <lb/>
            sword, ran away shouting that the enemy were within the <lb/>
            walls. Soon after this trumpets were sounded, the whole <lb/>
            city was disturbed, and all the streets became thronged <lb/>
            with men running to and fro, while many lights appeared, <lb/>
            some in the lower town, and some in the citadel above, <lb/>
            and a confused murmur of voices was heard on every <lb/>
            Bide.</p>
          <p>XXII. While this was going on, Aratus persevered in <lb/>
            his march, and was toiling laboriously up the cliff. At first <lb/>
            he proceeded slowly and with difficulty, without making <lb/>
            any real progress, because he had entirely missed the path, <lb/>
            which wound about under the shadow of the precipitous <lb/>
            rocks by many turnings and windings up to the citadel. <lb/>
            At this moment it is said that the moon shone through <lb/>
            the clouds and threw her light upon the most difficult <lb/>
            part of the ascent in a wonderful manner, until Aratus <lb/>
            reached the part of the wall of the citadel which he wished <lb/>
            to attack. When he was there, she again concealed and <lb/>
            shaded her rays behind a barrier of clouds. While this <lb/>
            was being done, the three hundred men of Aratus’s force, <lb/>
            who had been left outside the gate near the temple of Hera, <lb/>
            when they made their way into the city, which was now <lb/>
            full of confusion and lights, were not able to find the same <lb/>
            path which had been followed by the others, or any trace of <lb/>
            the way by which they had gone, and so in a body crouched <lb/>
            down in a dark corner in the shade of a cliff, and waited <lb/>
            there in great anxiety and alarm: for now the party led <lb/>
            by Aratus was being shot at by the garrison of the citadel, <lb/>
            and was fighting with them hand to hand, and the shouts <lb/>
            of the battle could be plainly heard below, though the <lb/>
            echoes of the mountains made it impossible to tell from <lb/>
            what quarter the noise proceeded. While they were at a <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            to-is to know which way to turn, Archelaus, the leader of <lb/>
            the Macedonian toop, marched out with a large force, <lb/>
            with loud shouts and trumpets sounding, to attack the <lb/>
            party under Aratus, and marched past where the three <lb/>
            hundred lay as it were in ambush. They rushed out, <lb/>
            charged the Macedonians, killed the first of them, and drove <lb/>
            Archelaus and the remainder before them panic-stricken, <lb/>
            until they dispersed themselves about the city. No sooner <lb/>
            had this victory been won, than Erginus arrived from the <lb/>
            citadel, announcing that Aratus was engaged with the <lb/>
            enemy, who were offering a stubborn resistance, that a great <lb/>
            battle was going on at the wall itself, and that immediate <lb/>
            assistance was required. They at once bade him lead <lb/>
            them, and mounted the hill, shouting to their friends to <lb/>
            let them know who they were, and to encourage them. <lb/>
            The full moon, too, as it shone upon their arms, made their <lb/>
            numbers appear greater to the enemy on account of the <lb/>
            length of the path, and the midnight echoes made their <lb/>
            shouts appear to come from a much larger party of men. <lb/>
            At last they joined their friends above, and by a united <lb/>
            effort drove out the enemy, won the heights, and gained <lb/>
            possession of the citadel just as day was dawning. Soon <lb/>
            the sun r, so upon their victory, and the remainder of <lb/>
            Aratus's force from Sikyon came up, and was welcomed <lb/>
            by the Corinthians, who opened their gates to them, and <lb/>
            assisted them to capture the soldiers of the Macedonian <lb/>
            garrison.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When all appeared to be safe, Aratus descended <lb/>
            from the citadel to the theatre, where an enormous mul­ <lb/>
            titude of persons was collected, eager to see him and <lb/>
            to hear the bpeech which he was about to address to the <lb/>
            Corinthians. He placed a guard of Achæans on each side <lb/>
            of the stage, and himself appeared in the middle, still <lb/>
            wearing his corslet, and pale with the labours of a sleepless <lb/>
            night, so that the triumph and delight which he felt were <lb/>
            weighed down by sheer bodily lassitude. His appearance <lb/>
            was greeted with enthusiastic applause, and, shifting hia <lb/>
            spear into his right hand, and slightly leaning his body <lb/>
            against it, he stood for a long time silent, receiving the <lb/>
            plaudits and shouts of those who praised his courage and <lb/>
            congratulated him on his good fortune. When they had <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            ceased and resumed their seats, he drew himself up and <lb/>
            made them a speech worthy of the occasion, on behalf of <lb/>
            the Achæan league, in which he prevailed upon the <lb/>
            Corinthians to join the league, and gave up to them the <lb/>
            keys of their gates which now came into their posses­ <lb/>
            sion for the first time since the days of king Philip. He <lb/>
            dismissed Archelaus, who had been taken prisoner, but <lb/>
            put Theophrastus to death because he refused to leave his <lb/>
            post. Pergæus, when the citadel was taken, escaped to <lb/>
            Kenchreæ. Afterwards it is said that in philosophic con­ <lb/>
            versation, when some one said that he thought that the <lb/>
            philosopher was the only true general, he answered, "By <lb/>
            heaven, this once used to please me more than any other <lb/>
            of Zeno's aphorisms, but I have changed my mind since the <lb/>
            refutation of it which I received from a young man of <lb/>
            Sikyon.” This anecdote of Persæus is related by most <lb/>
            historians.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Aratus now at once made himself master of the <lb/>
            temple of Hera, and of Lechæum, where he seized a fleet <lb/>
            of five-and-twenty ships belonging to King Antigonus, and <lb/>
            sold five hundred horses and four hundred Syrians whom <lb/>
            he found there. The Achæans now garrisoned the citadel <lb/>
            of Corinth with a force of four hundred heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldiers, and with a pack of fifty hounds and as many <lb/>
            huntsmen, who were all kept in the citadel.-</p>
          <p>The Romans in their admiration of Philopœmen used to <lb/>
            call him the last of the Greeks, as though no great actions <lb/>
            were performed in Greece after his time: but I should be <lb/>
            inclined to say that this was both the last and the most <lb/>
            remarkable of all the great achievements of the Greeks, for <lb/>
            both in the daring with which it was accomplished, and the <lb/>
            good fortune with which it was attended, it will bear <lb/>
            comparison with the noblest of deeds, as was at once <lb/>
            proved by its results. Megara revolted from Antigonus <lb/>
            and joined Aratus, Troezene and Epidaurus became <lb/>
            members of the Achæan league, and Aratus made his first <lb/>
            campaign by an expedition into Attica, in the course of <lb/>
            which he cro sed into Salamis and laid it waste, being <lb/>
            able to make what use he pleased of the power of the <lb/>
            Achæan league, now that it was no longer, as it were, <note type="footnote"> * A common precaution against surprise. See above, ch. viii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            locked up in Peloponnesus. He sent back all the freemen <lb/>
            whom he captured to Athens without ransom, hoping to <lb/>
            rouse them to revolt against the Macedonians. He also <lb/>
            brought Ptolemy into alliance with the Achæan league, <lb/>
            and constituted him commander-in-chief of their forces by <lb/>
            land and by sea. His influence with the Achæans was so <lb/>
            great, that, since it was illegal to elect him as their chief <lb/>
            every year, they elected him every other year, while <lb/>
            practically they followed his advice in all their transao­ <lb/>
            tions ; for they saw that he preferred neither wealth, nor <lb/>
            fame, nor the friendship of kings, nor the advantage of <lb/>
            his own native country to the furtherance of the <lb/>
            prosperity of the Achæans. He conceived that cities <lb/>
            which by themselves were weak might obtain safety by <lb/>
            means of one another, bound together by their common <lb/>
            interest, and that just as the various parts of the human <lb/>
            body live and move when connected with one another, <lb/>
            but waste away and perish when cut asunder, so cities are <lb/>
            ruined by isolation, and prosper by confederation, when <lb/>
            they form parts of one great body, and adopt a common <lb/>
            line of policy.</p>
          <p>XXV. Observing that the most famous of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring cities were independent, he became grieved that <lb/>
            the Argives lived under the rule of a despot, and began to <lb/>
            plot the destruction of Aristomachus, their ruler; wishing <lb/>
            also to bestow its freedom upon the city to which he owed <lb/>
            his education, and to gain it over to the Achæan league. <lb/>
            Men were found who dared to make the attempt, chief <lb/>
            among whom were AEschylus and Charimenes the sooth­ <lb/>
            sayer, but they had no swords, because the despot had <lb/>
            prohibited the possession of arms to the citizens under <lb/>
            severe penalties. However, Aratus prepared at Corinth a <lb/>
            number of small daggers, which he caused to be sewn up <lb/>
            in pack-saddles. He then placed the saddles on pack­ <lb/>
            horses and sent them to Argos, laden with ordinary <lb/>
            merchandise.</p>
          <p>But Charimenes the soothsayer took another person into <lb/>
            the ploit, which so enraged AEschylus and his party that <lb/>
            they determined to act alone, and would have nothing <lb/>
            more to do with Charimenes. In anger at this treatment <lb/>
            he betrayed his comrades just as they were on the point of <lb/>
             <pb n="506"/>
            attacking the despot, yet most of them had time to make <lb/>
            their way out of the market-place and escape to Corinth. <lb/>
            Shortly afterwards Aristomachus was assassinated by his <lb/>
            own servants, and was immediately succeeded by Aria­ <lb/>
            tippus, a more cruel tyrant than himself. Aratus upon <lb/>
            hearing of this at once made a hurried march to Argos at <lb/>
            the head of as many Achæans as he could collect, hoping to <lb/>
            find the city ready to join him. As, however, most of the <lb/>
            Argives were now accustomed to the loss of their liberty, <lb/>
            and no one answered his appeal, he retired, having done <lb/>
            no more than expose the Achæans to the charge of making <lb/>
            a warlike invasion in time of peace. For this they were <lb/>
            tried before the Mantineans as judges, and, as Aratus did <lb/>
            not appear, Aristippus, who was prosecutor, won his cause <lb/>
            and got a fine of thirty minæ laid upon the Achæans. As <lb/>
            he both hated and feared Aratus himself, he now, with the <lb/>
            connivance of King Antigonus, endeavoured to have him <lb/>
            assassinated; and they soon had their emissaries everywhere, <lb/>
            watching their opportunity. There is, however, no such <lb/>
            certain safeguard for a ruler as the love of his people; for <lb/>
            when both the masses and the leading men have learned <lb/>
            not to fear their chief, but to fear for him, he sees with <lb/>
            many eyes, hears with many ears, and soon gains intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of any conspiracies. And in this place I wish to stop <lb/>
            my narrative for a moment, and describe the mode of life <lb/>
            which Aristippus was compelled to lead in consequence of <lb/>
            being a despot, and possessing that position of absolute <lb/>
            ruler which men are wont so greatly to admire and <lb/>
            envy.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Aristippus had Antigonus for his ally, kept a <lb/>
            large force on foot for his own protection, and left none of <lb/>
            his enemies alive in the city of Argos. He used to make <lb/>
            bis oody-guard and household troops encamp in the <lb/>
            porticoes outside his palace, and always, after supper, sent <lb/>
            all his servants out of the room, locked the door himself, <lb/>
            and betook himself with his mistress to a little upper <lb/>
            chamber which was reached by a trapdoor, upon which <lb/>
            he placed his bed and slept, as one may expect, a disturbed <lb/>
            and frightened sleep. His mistress's mother used to take <lb/>
            away the ladder by which they mounted, and lock it up in <lb/>
            another room. At daybreak she used to bring it back <lb/>
             <pb n="507"/>
            again, and call down this glorious monarch, who came out <lb/>
            like a snake out of his den.</p>
          <p>Aratus, who dressed in the plainest of clothes, and was <lb/>
            the declared enemy of despots wherever they were to be <lb/>
            found, gained for himself a lasting command, not by force <lb/>
            of arms, but by legal means by his own courage, and has <lb/>
            left a posterity which even at the present day enjoys the <lb/>
            greatest honour in Greece; whereas of all those men who <lb/>
            seized strongholds, kept body-guards, and protected their <lb/>
            fives with arms and gates and trapdoor,,;, few escaped being <lb/>
            knocked on the head like hares, and no one has left either <lb/>
            a palace, or a family, or a monument to do honour to his <lb/>
            memory.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Aratus made many attempts, both by intrigues <lb/>
            and open violence, to overthrow Aristippus, and take <lb/>
            Argos. Once he succeeded in placing scaling-ladders <lb/>
            against the walls, ascended them recklessly with a few <lb/>
            followers, and killed the soldiers who came from within <lb/>
            the city to oppose him. Afterwards, when day was <lb/>
            breaking and the troops of the despot were attacking him <lb/>
            on all sides, the people of Argos, just as if they were <lb/>
            sitting as judges at the Nemean games, and the battle was <lb/>
            not being fought on behalf of their liberty, sat by with <lb/>
            the utmost calmness, like impartial spectators. Aratus <lb/>
            fought bravely, and though wounded in the thigh by a <lb/>
            spear, yet succeeded in effecting a lodgement in the city <lb/>
            and in spite of the attacks of the enemy held his ground <lb/>
            until nightfall. If he could have found strength to remain <lb/>
            and fight during the night also, he would not have failed <lb/>
            in his attempt; for the despot was already making <lb/>
            preparations for flight and had sent on much of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty to the sea-coast: but as no one brought news of this <lb/>
            to Aratus, and water failed him, while his wound incapaci­ <lb/>
            tated him for any personal exertions, he drew off his forces.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. He now gave up this method of attack, and <lb/>
            openly invaded the Argive country with an army and laid <lb/>
            it waste. At the river Chares he fought a desperate <lb/>
            battle with Aristippus, and was thought to have given up <lb/>
            the contest too soon, and lost the victory; for when the <lb/>
            other part of his army had decidedly won the day and <lb/>
            forced their way a long distance forward, he himself, not so <lb/>
             <pb n="508"/>
            much overpowered by the forces opposed to him as hope­ <lb/>
            less of success and fearing disaster, lost his presence of <lb/>
            mind, and led his men back into their camp. When the <lb/>
            others returned from their victorious charge, and com­ <lb/>
            plained bitterly that, after having routed the enemy, and <lb/>
            slain many more men than they themselves had lost, Aratus <lb/>
            had allowed the vanquished to erect a trophy, he was stung <lb/>
            to the quick, decided to fight rather than to allow the <lb/>
            trophy to be erected, and after an interval of one day again <lb/>
            led out his forces. When, however, he learned that the troops <lb/>
            of the despot had been largely reinforced, and were full of <lb/>
            confidence, he did not venture to risk a battle, but made a <lb/>
            truce for the recovery of the dead, and retired. Yet he <lb/>
            continued to repair this fault by his diplomatic skill and <lb/>
            persuasive powers, for he won over the city of Kleonae to <lb/>
            the Achæan league, and held the Nemean festival at Kleonae, <lb/>
            declaring it to be the privilege of its citizens to do so by <lb/>
            right of descent. The Argives also celebrated the festival, <lb/>
            and on this occasion for the first time the right of safe­ <lb/>
            conduct of the competitors was violated, for the Achæans <lb/>
            seized and sold for slaves all who passed through their <lb/>
            territory on their return from the games at Argos. So stem <lb/>
            and inexorable was Aratus in his hatred of despots.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Shortly after this, hearing that Aristippus was <lb/>
            meditating an attack upon Kleonae, but feared him, because <lb/>
            he was living at Corinth, he ordered an army to be mustered. <lb/>
            Bidding his men collect provisions for several days, he <lb/>
            marched as far as Kenchreae, hoping to draw out Aristippus <lb/>
            to attack Kleonae during his absence, as indeed happened. <lb/>
            Aristippus at once came from Argos with his entire force; <lb/>
            but Aratus meanwhile returned by night to Corinth from <lb/>
            Kenchreae, and, having placed guards upon all the roads, <lb/>
            led the Achæans by so swift, well-managed, and orderly a <lb/>
            march, that while it was still dark he not only reached <lb/>
            Kleonae, but drew up his men in order of battle before <lb/>
            Aristippus discovered their presence. At daybreak the <lb/>
            city gates were thrown open, and charging with loud <lb/>
            shouts to the sound of the trumpet, he at once routed the <lb/>
            enemy, and pursued in the direction in which he thought <lb/>
            Aristippus most probably was fleeing, the country being <lb/>
            full of ways to escape pursuit. The chase was kept up <lb/>
             <pb n="509"/>
            as far as Mykenae, where the despot was overtaken <lb/>
            and slain by a Cretan named Tragiskus, according to the <lb/>
            historian Deinias. With him fell more than fifteen hundred <lb/>
            of his men. Yet, Aratus, after gaining such a brilliant <lb/>
            success without losing one of his own soldiers, did not take <lb/>
            Argos or restore it to liberty, as Agias and Aristomachus <lb/>
            the younger marched into the town with some Macedonian <lb/>
            troops and seized the government.</p>
          <p>However, by this action, Aratus pretty well silenced the <lb/>
            illnatured joke, which had been made about himself, and the <lb/>
            stories, invented by the courtiers of despots; for they <lb/>
            described the general of the Achaeans as being subject to <lb/>
            violent internal disorders during a battle, and said that as <lb/>
            soon as the trumpeter appeared he became faint and dizzy, <lb/>
            and that, after having arrayed his forces, given the word, <lb/>
            and inquired of his lieutenants and officers whether they <lb/>
            had any further need of his presence, when the die was <lb/>
            finally cast, he used to retire and await the result at a <lb/>
            distance. These stories had such an extensive currency, <lb/>
            that even philosophers in their studies when discussing <lb/>
            whether violent beating of the heart, changing of colour, <lb/>
            and the like in time of danger be a mark of cowardice or of <lb/>
            distemperature and of a cold habit of body, always mention <lb/>
            Aratus as being a good general, but always being affected <lb/>
            in this manner when in battle.</p>
          <p>XXX. When he had slain Aristippus, he at once began <lb/>
            to plot against Lydiades of Megalopolis, who had made <lb/>
            himself despot of his native city. Lydiades was naturally <lb/>
            of a noble and ambitious nature, and had not, like so many <lb/>
            despots, been led to commit the crime of enslaving his fel­ <lb/>
            low-citizens by any selfish desire of money or of pleasure; <lb/>
            but when a young man he had become inflamed with a <lb/>
            desire of distinguishing himself, and listening to all the <lb/>
            vain and untrue talk about despotic power being so fine <lb/>
            and happy a thing, he, like a high-spirited youth, made <lb/>
            himself despot, and soon became overwhelmed with the <lb/>
            cares of state. As he now both envied the happiness of <lb/>
            Aratus and feared the results of his plots, he adopted a <lb/>
            new and most glorious course, which was first to set him­ <lb/>
            self free from hatred and terror and soldiers and life-guards, <lb/>
            and next to become the benefactor of his country. He seat <lb/>
             <pb n="510"/>
            fur Aratus, gave up his rule, and united the city to the <lb/>
            Achæan league. The Achaeans admired his conduct in this <lb/>
            matter so much that they elected him general. He now <lb/>
            at once began to strive to outdo Aratus in glory, and en­ <lb/>
            gaged in many unnecessary enterprises, one of which was <lb/>
            a campaign against the Lacedæmonians. Aratus opposed <lb/>
            him, and was therefore thought to be jealous of him ; <lb/>
            yet Lydiades was a second time elected general, in spite of <lb/>
            the open opposition of Aratus, who used all his influence on <lb/>
            behalf of another candidate. Aratus himself, as has been <lb/>
            said, was general every other year. Lydiades continued <lb/>
            in the full tide of success and was elected general alter­ <lb/>
            nately with Aratus up to his third year of office; but as <lb/>
            he made no secret of his hatred for Aratus, and often <lb/>
            attacked him in the public assembly of the Achaeans, they <lb/>
            cast him off and would not listen to him, thinking that <lb/>
            his good qualities were but counterfeit when compared <lb/>
            with the genuine virtues of Aratus. Just as Æsop tells <lb/>
            us in his fables that when the cuckoo asked the little birds <lb/>
            why they fled from him, they answered that some day he <lb/>
            would be a hawk, so it seems that, even after he had given <lb/>
            up his despotism, some blighting suspicion always clung to <lb/>
            the character of Lydiades.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Aratus gained great glory also in the Ætolian <lb/>
            war, because when the Achaeans were eager to join battle <lb/>
            with the Ætolians on the Megarian frontier, and Agis the <lb/>
            King of Lacedæmon had arived with a large force and <lb/>
            urged the Achaeans to fight, he opposed it, and in spite of <lb/>
            being reproached, abused, and jeered at as a coward, <lb/>
            refused to be led astray by any high-flown ideas of honour <lb/>
            from the course which he had decided upon as the best, <lb/>
            made way for the enemy, and without striking a blow <lb/>
            permitted them to cross Geranea and pass into Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus. When, however, they marched by him and suddenly <lb/>
            seized Pellene, he was no longer the same man. He would <lb/>
            not wait until his entire force was assembled, but with what <lb/>
            troops he had with him at once marched against the enemy, <lb/>
            who, after their victory, were easily conquered on account <lb/>
            of their want of discipline and licentiousness. As soon as <lb/>
            they made their way into the city of Pellene, the soldiers <lb/>
            dispersed themselves among the various houses, driving each <lb/>
             <pb n="511"/>
            other out of them and fighting one another for the plunder, <lb/>
            while the chiefs and generals were occupied in carrying off <lb/>
            the wives and daughters of the citizens. They took off their <lb/>
            own helmets and placed them on the heads of these women, <lb/>
            in order that no one else might take them, but that the owner <lb/>
            of each one might be known by the helmet which she wore. <lb/>
            While they were thus engaged the news suddenly came <lb/>
            that Aratus was about to attack. A panic took place, as <lb/>
            one might readily expect with such want of discipline, and <lb/>
            before all of them heard of the danger, the foremost, meeting <lb/>
            the Achæans near the gates and suburbs of the city, lost <lb/>
            heart and fled away at once, and in their frantic haste threw <lb/>
            into disorder those who were forming to come to their <lb/>
            support.</p>
          <p>XXXII. During this tumult one of the captive women, <lb/>
            the daughter of an eminent citizen named Epigethus, <lb/>
            who herself was remarkably tall and handsome, happened <lb/>
            to be sitting in the temple of Artemis, where she had been <lb/>
            stationed by the commander of a picked company of <lb/>
            soldiers, who had placed upon her head his own helmet <lb/>
            with its triple plume. She, hearing the disturbance, <lb/>
            suddenly ran out, and as she stood at the door of the <lb/>
            temple, looking down upon the combatants, with the triple­ <lb/>
            plumed helmet upon her head, she appeared even to her <lb/>
            own countrymen to be something more glorious than a <lb/>
            mere mortal, while the enemy, who imagined that they <lb/>
            beheld an apparition, were struck with terror and affright, <lb/>
            so that none of them attempted to offer any resistance. <lb/>
            The people of Pellene themselves say that the wooden <lb/>
            statue of the goddess is never touched except when it is <lb/>
            carried out by the priestess, and that then no one dares to <lb/>
            look upon it, but all turn their faces away ; for the sight <lb/>
            of it is not only fearful and terrible for mankind, but it <lb/>
            even makes the trees barren and blights the crops through <lb/>
            which it is carried. This it was, they say, which the <lb/>
            priestess carried out of the temple on this occasion, and <lb/>
            by continually turning the face of the figure towards the <lb/>
            Ætolians, made them frantic and took away their reason. <lb/>
            Aratus, however, in his memoirs makes no mention of <lb/>
            anything of the kind, but says that he routed the <lb/>
            Ætolians, broke into city together with the fugitives, and <lb/>
             <pb n="512"/>
            killed seven hundred of them. The exploit became cele­ <lb/>
            brated as one of his most glorious actions, and the artist <lb/>
            Timanthes has painted an admirable picture of the battle.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. However, as many nations and princes were <lb/>
            combining together against the Achæans, Aratus at once <lb/>
            made peace with the Ætolians, and with the assistance of <lb/>
            Pantaloon, the most powerful man in Ætolia, even made <lb/>
            an alliance between that country and the Achæans. He <lb/>
            was anxious to set free the Athenians, and was severely re­ <lb/>
            proached by the Achæans because, during a cessation of <lb/>
            arms, when they had made a truce with the Macedonians, <lb/>
            he attempted to seize Peiræus. In the memoirs which he <lb/>
            has left Aratus denies this, and throws the blame of it upon <lb/>
            Erginus, with whose aid he seized the citadel of Corinth. <lb/>
            This man, he says, attacked Peiræus on his own respon­ <lb/>
            sibility, and when the scaling-ladder broke and he was <lb/>
            forced to fly, frequently called on Aratus by name as <lb/>
            though he were present, and by this artifice deceived the <lb/>
            enemy and escaped. This justification does not, however, <lb/>
            seem a very credible one. There was no probability that <lb/>
            Erginus, a private man and a Syrian, should have ever <lb/>
            thought of such an enterprise, if he had not been urged <lb/>
            to it by Aratus, who must have supplied him with the <lb/>
            necessary forces and pointed out the proper opportunity <lb/>
            for the attack. And Aratus himself proves this to be true <lb/>
            by having not merely twice or thrice, but frequently, like <lb/>
            a rejected lover, made attempts upon Peiræus, and not <lb/>
            being disconcerted by his failures, but ever gathering <lb/>
            fresh hopes by observing how nearly he had succeeded. <lb/>
            On one of these occasions he sprained his leg in a hasty <lb/>
            retreat across the Thriasian plain. Several incisions had <lb/>
            to be made to cure it, and he was obliged for a long time <lb/>
            to be carried in a litter when conducting his campaigns.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. When Antigonus died and Demetrius* suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the throne, Aratus was more eager than ever to <lb/>
            gain over Athens, and began to treat the Macedonians <lb/>
            with contempt. When he was defeated in a battle which <lb/>
            he fought against Bithys, a general of Demetrius, and <lb/>
            many rumours were current that he had been taken <note type="footnote"> * This was Demetrius II., the son of Antigonus Gonataa, wha <lb/>
            succeeded his father on the throne of Macedonia, B.C. 259. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="513"/>
            prisoner or had been slain, Diogenes. the commander of <lb/>
            the garrison of Peiræus, sent a letter to Corinth bidding <lb/>
            the Achæans leave that city now that Aratus was dead. <lb/>
            When this letter arrived Aratus himself was present in <lb/>
            Corinth, and the messengers of Diogenes had to return <lb/>
            after having afforded him much amusement. The King of <lb/>
            Macedonia also sent a ship, on board of which Aratus was <lb/>
            to be brought back to him in chains. But the Athenians, <lb/>
            outdoing themselves in levity and servility to the Ma­ <lb/>
            cedonians, crowned themselves with garlands when they <lb/>
            heard the news of his death. Enraged at this Aratus <lb/>
            at once invaded their country, and marched as far as <lb/>
            the Academy, but there he suffered his anger to be appeased, <lb/>
            and did no damage. The Athenians did, nevertheless, ap­ <lb/>
            preciate his courage, for when on the death of Demetrius, <lb/>
            they attempted to regain their freedom, they invited him <lb/>
            to assist them. Although Aratus was not at that time <lb/>
            general of the Achaeans, and was confined to his bed with <lb/>
            a long illness, yet he responded to this appeal by proceed­ <lb/>
            ing to Athens in a litter, and prevailed upon Diogenes, the <lb/>
            chief of the garrison, to surrender Peiræus, Munychia, <lb/>
            Salamis, and Sunium to the Athenians for the sum of one <lb/>
            hundred and fifty talents, twenty of which he himself contri­ <lb/>
            buted. The states of Ægina and Hermione now joined the <lb/>
            Achæan league, and the greater part of Arcadia contributed <lb/>
            to it; for the Macedonians were engaged in wars with their <lb/>
            neighbours, and the Achæans, with the help of their <lb/>
            allies, the Ætolians, now gained a large accession of force.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Aratus was still true to his original principles, <lb/>
            and, grieving at the spectacle of a despotism established <lb/>
            in the neighbouring state of Argos, sent to Aristomachus, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to persuade him to give up his authority, <lb/>
            bring the city over to the Achæan league, and imitate <lb/>
            Lydiades by becoming the glorious and respected general <lb/>
            of so great a people rather than remain exposed to <lb/>
            constant danger as the hated despot of one city. Aristo­ <lb/>
            machus acceded to these proposals of Aratus, but asked <lb/>
            him for the sum of fifty talents, for the payment of the <lb/>
            mercenaries whom he was to disband. While the money <lb/>
            was being procured, Lydiades, who was still in office as <lb/>
            general, and wished to gain the credit of this negotiation <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="514"/>
            for himself, told Aristomachus that Aratus was really the <lb/>
            bitter and implacable foe of all despots, persuaded him <lb/>
            to intrust the management of the affair to himself, and <lb/>
            introduced Aristomachus to the Achæan assembly. On <lb/>
            this occasion the Achæan representatives gave Aratus a <lb/>
            notable proof of their love and confidence in him; for <lb/>
            when he indignantly opposed the proposition they drove <lb/>
            away Aristomachus; and yet, when Aratus had become <lb/>
            his friend and again brought forward the matter, they <lb/>
            readily accepted his proposal, admitted the cities of Argos <lb/>
            and Phlius into the league, and the following year <lb/>
            elected Aristomachus general. Aristomachus, finding <lb/>
            himself cordially received by the Achæans, and wishing <lb/>
            to invade Laconia, sent for Aratus from Athens. Aratus <lb/>
            replied by a letter in which he dissuaded him from <lb/>
            making this campaign, being unwilling to involve the <lb/>
            Achæans in hostilities with Kleomenes, who was a bold <lb/>
            general and had already gained surprising successes. As, <lb/>
            however, Aristomachus was determined to begin the war, <lb/>
            Aratus returned, and made the campaign with him. When <lb/>
            near Pallantium they met Kleomenes, and Aratus was <lb/>
            reproached by Lydiades for restraining Aristomachus from <lb/>
            joining battle. The year after, Lydiades stood against <lb/>
            Aratus as a candidate for the office of general, when <lb/>
            Aratus was chosen general for the twelfth time.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. During this term of office Aratus was defeated <lb/>
            by Kleomenes near Mount Lykaeum, and took to flight. <lb/>
            He lost his way during the night, and was supposed <lb/>
            to have fallen. The same rumours now again ran through <lb/>
            Greece about him; but he got safely away, and having <lb/>
            rallied his men was not satisfied with retiring home un­ <lb/>
            molested, but making an admirable use of his opportunity, <lb/>
            as no one expected an attack, he suddenly fell upon the <lb/>
            Mantineans, who were the allies of Kleomenes. He took <lb/>
            the city, placed a garrison in it, and insisted on the resi­ <lb/>
            dent foreigners being admitted to the franchise, thus alone <lb/>
            gaining for the Achæans after a defeat, a success which <lb/>
            they could hardly have obtained by a victory. When the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians marched against Megalopolis, Aratus came <lb/>
            to the assistance of that city. He would not fight with <lb/>
            Kleomenes, though the latter endeavoured to entice him <lb/>
             <pb n="515"/>
            into a battle, but he kept back the men of Megalopolis <lb/>
            who were eager to fight; for he was at no time well-fitted <lb/>
            for the direction of pitched battles, and on this occasion <lb/>
            was inferior in numbers, besides being opposed to a young <lb/>
            and daring antagonist, while he himself was past the <lb/>
            prime of life, and inclined to fail in spirit. He thought, <lb/>
            too, that while it was right for Kleomenes to gain glory <lb/>
            by daring, it was best for him to be careful to keep the <lb/>
            glory which he had already obtained.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Though the light-armed troops ran out to <lb/>
            meet the Spartans, drove them back to their camp, and <lb/>
            even fought round their tents, yet Aratus would not move <lb/>
            on with the heavy-armed force, but halted them behind a <lb/>
            water-course which he forbade them to cross. Lydiades, <lb/>
            irritated at this, reproached Aratus, called upon the cavalry <lb/>
            to follow him and reinforce the victorious light troops, <lb/>
            and not to lose the victory or desert him when he was <lb/>
            fighting for his country. Many brave men joined him, <lb/>
            and with them he charged the right wing of the enemy, <lb/>
            overthrew them, and pursued with reckless ardour until <lb/>
            he became entangled in difficult ground, full of fruit trees <lb/>
            and wide ditches, where he was attacked by Kleomenes, <lb/>
            and fell fighting bravely in the noblest of causes, at the <lb/>
            very gates of his native city. His companions fled back to <lb/>
            the main body, where they disordered the ranks of the <lb/>
            hoplites, and brought about the defeat of the entire army. <lb/>
            Aratus was greatly blamed, because he was thought to <lb/>
            have left Lydiades to perish. The Achæans angrily retired <lb/>
            to Ægium, and forced him to accompany them. There <lb/>
            they held a meeting, at which it was decided that he <lb/>
            should not be supplied with any money nor any mercenary <lb/>
            troops maintained for him, but that if he wished to go to <lb/>
            war he must furnish them for himself.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After being thus disgraced, Aratus deter­ <lb/>
            mined at once to give up the seals * and lay down his office <lb/>
            of general, but after consideration he put up with the affront <lb/>
            led out the army of the Achaeans, and fought a battle with <lb/>
            Megistonous, the step-father of Kleomenes, in which he was <lb/>
            victorious, slew three hundred of the enemy, and took <note type="footnote">* Apparently the great seal of the league is meant, which we must <lb/>
            suppose was entrusted to the general for the time being. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="516"/>
            prisoner Megistonous himself. He had hitherto been always <lb/>
            elected general every other year, but now, when the time <lb/>
            for his election came round, he refused to take the office, <lb/>
            although pressed to do so, and Timotheus was chosen <lb/>
            general. It was thought that his anger with the people <lb/>
            was merely a pretext for his refusal, and that the real reason <lb/>
            was the perilous situation of the Achæan league; for Kleo­ <lb/>
            menes no longer operated against it by slow degrees as <lb/>
            before, when he was embarrassed by the other Spartan <lb/>
            magistrates, but now that he had put the Ephors to death, <lb/>
            redistributed the land, and admitted many of the resi. <lb/>
            dent aliens to the franchise, he found himself an irrespon- <lb/>
            Bible ruler at the head of a large force, with which he at <lb/>
            once assailed the Achæans, demanding himself to be acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged as their chief. For this reason Aratus has been <lb/>
            blamed for having like a pilot during a terrible storm and <lb/>
            tempest yielded up the helm to another when it was his duty <lb/>
            to stand by it, even against the will of the people, and save <lb/>
            the commonwealth; or, if he despaired of the Achæans being <lb/>
            able to resist, he ought to have made terms with Kleomenes <lb/>
            and not to have allowed Peloponnesus to fall back into the <lb/>
            hands of the uncivilised Macedonians and be occupied by <lb/>
            their troops, and to have garrisoned the citadel of Corinth <lb/>
            with Illyrian and Gaulish soldiers, thus inviting into the <lb/>
            cities, under the name of allies, those very men whom he <lb/>
            had passed his life in out-manoeuvring and over-reaching, <lb/>
            and whom in his memoirs he speaks of with such hatred. <lb/>
            Even if Kleomenes were, as some might call him, a despot <lb/>
            and a law-breaker, yet Sparta was his native country, and <lb/>
            the Herakleidæ were his ancestors, and surely any man <lb/>
            who respected Greek nobility of birth would have chosen <lb/>
            the least illustrious of such a family for his chief rather <lb/>
            than the greatest man in all Macedonia. Moreover, <lb/>
            Kleomenes, when he asked the Achæans to appoint him as <lb/>
            their ruler, promised that in return for that title he would <lb/>
            do great things for them by land and sea, whereas Antigonus, <lb/>
            when offered the title of supreme ruler by land and sea, <lb/>
            would not accept it until he received the citadel of Corinth <lb/>
            as a bribe, exactly like the huntsman in Æsop's fable; <lb/>
            for he would not mount upon the backs of the Achæans, <lb/>
            though they begged him to do so, and offered themselves <lb/>
             <pb n="517"/>
            to him by embassies and decrees, before, by means of his <lb/>
            garrison in Corinth and the hostages which he received, he <lb/>
            had, as it were, placed a bit in their mouths.</p>
          <p>Aratus makes a laboured defence of his conduct, pleading <lb/>
            the necessities of his situation. Yet Polybius tells us that <lb/>
            long before any such necessities existed, Aratus had felt <lb/>
            alarm at the daring spirit of Kleomenes, and had not only <lb/>
            been carrying on secret negotiations with Antigonus, but <lb/>
            even had urged the people of Megalopolis to propose to <lb/>
            the Achaeans that Antigonus should be invited to assist <lb/>
            them. It was the people of Megalopolis who were the great­ <lb/>
            est sufferers by the war, as Kleomenes constantly ravaged <lb/>
            their territories. The historian Phylarchus gives a similar <lb/>
            account of the transaction, though we could hardly receive <lb/>
            his narrative with confidence if it were not supported by <lb/>
            the testimony of Polybius ; for he is so enthusiastic an ad­ <lb/>
            mirer of the character of Kleomenes that in his history he <lb/>
            writes as though he were pleading his cause in a court of <lb/>
            justice, and continually disparages Aratus, and, vindicates <lb/>
            Kleomenes.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. The Achæans now lost Mantinea, which was <lb/>
            recaptured by Kleomenes, and they were so dispirited by <lb/>
            a great defeat, which they sustained near Hekatombaeon, <lb/>
            as to send at once to Kleomenes, inviting him to come to <lb/>
            Argos and assume the supreme command. Aratus, as soon <lb/>
            has he learned that Kleomenes had set out, and was march­ <lb/>
            ing past Lerna at the head of his army, became alarmed, <lb/>
            and sent an embassy to him, begging him, to come to the <lb/>
            Achæans as to friends and allies, with only three hundred <lb/>
            men, and offering hostages to him, if he suspected them of <lb/>
            treachery. Kleomenes regarded this message as a mockery <lb/>
            and an insult to himself. He immediatly retired, after <lb/>
            writing a letter to the Achæans in which he brought <lb/>
            many grave charges against Aratus. Aratus, in turn, <lb/>
            wrote several letters to them assailing Kleomenes ; and <lb/>
            they abused one another so outrageously as not even to <lb/>
            spare the reputation of each other's wives. After this, <lb/>
            Kleomenes sent a herald to declare war against the <lb/>
            Achæans, and very nearly succeeded in making himself <lb/>
            master of Sikyon by the treachery of some of its citizens. <lb/>
            Failing in this, he turned aside, attacked Pellene drove <lb/>
             <pb n="518"/>
            out the commander, and took the city. Shortly afterwards <lb/>
            he took Phenes and Penteleum. Upon this the Argives at <lb/>
            once joined him, and the citizen of Phlius admitted a <lb/>
            Spartan garrison: so that the Achæans seemed to be in <lb/>
            danger of losing all their conquests, and Aratus became <lb/>
            seriously alarmed at the disturbed condition of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, for he saw that in every quarter cities, <lb/>
            encouraged by revolutionary agitators, were preparing <lb/>
            to throw off their allegiance to the league.</p>
          <p>XL..None were quiet or satisfied with things as they <lb/>
            were, but many citizens of Corinth and of Sikyon itself <lb/>
            openly corresponded with Kleomenes, and expressed the <lb/>
            disaffection which they had long felt to the league, and <lb/>
            their wish to obtain the supreme power for themselves. <lb/>
            In dealing with these persons, Aratus took the law into <lb/>
            his own hands and put to death all Sikyonians whom he <lb/>
            found corrupted ; but when he attempted to seek out and <lb/>
            punish the Corinthian conspirators, he enraged the popu­ <lb/>
            lace which already was disaffected, and weary of the Achaean <lb/>
            domination. The people ran together to the temple of <lb/>
            Apollo, and sent for Aratus, being determined either to kill <lb/>
            him or take him prisoner, before they proceeded openly <lb/>
            to revolt from the league. Aratus appeared before them, <lb/>
            leading his horse, without betraying any suspicion or <lb/>
            alarm, and when many of them leaped up and showered <lb/>
            abusive language upon him, he, with an admirable com­ <lb/>
            posure of countenance and manner, quietly bade them be <lb/>
            seated, and not stand up talking loudly and confusedly <lb/>
            but let in also those who were outside the gates. While <lb/>
            speaking thus he retired at a foot's pace, as though he <lb/>
            were looking for some one to take care of his horse. By <lb/>
            this means he got away from them and proceeded on his <lb/>
            way, talking unconcernedly to all the Corinthians whom <lb/>
            he met, whom he bade go to the temple of Apollo, until he <lb/>
            came near to the citadel. Here he sprang upon his horse'a <lb/>
            back, gave orders to Kleopater, the commander of the <lb/>
            garrison, to hold the place stoutly, and rode away to <lb/>
            Sikyon, followed by only thirty soldiers, as the rest had <lb/>
            all remained behind and dispersed.</p>
          <p>After a short time the Corinthians discovered that he had <lb/>
            taken to flight, and pursued, but as they could not overtake <lb/>
             <pb n="519"/>
            him, they sent to Kleomenes and delivered up their city <lb/>
            to him. Yet Kleomenes considered that he had lost more <lb/>
            by the escape of Aratus than he had gained by the ac­ <lb/>
            quisition of Corinth. Kleomenes was at once joined by the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the seaside district known as Akte, who <lb/>
            surrendered their cities to him, and with their assistance <lb/>
            he completely invested the citadel of Corinth with a rampart <lb/>
            and palisade.</p>
          <p>XLI. Aratus was joined at Sikyon by the representatives <lb/>
            of most of the cities of the Achaean league. An assembly <lb/>
            was held, at which he was elected general, with unlimited <lb/>
            powers. He now surrounded himself with a body-guard <lb/>
            selected from among his fellow-citizens. Aratus had <lb/>
            conducted the affairs of the league for thirty-three years, <lb/>
            during which he had made himself the first man in Greece, <lb/>
            both in power and in renown, though now he was utterly <lb/>
            ruined and cast down, forced to cling to his native city <lb/>
            as his only chance of safety amidst the general wreck of <lb/>
            his fortunes. For the Ætolians refused to help him when <lb/>
            he implored their aid, and Eurykleides and Mikion held <lb/>
            back the Athenians from offering any assistance, though <lb/>
            they were eager to do so out of regard for Aratus. Aratus <lb/>
            had a house at Corinth and some property, which Kleomenes <lb/>
            refused to touch, or to let any one else meddle with, but <lb/>
            sent for Aratus's friends and those whom he had left in <lb/>
            charge of his property, and bade them keep everything in <lb/>
            good order, as they would have to answer to Aratus for <lb/>
            their conduct. Kleomenes also sent Tripylus and his uncle <lb/>
            Megistonous to Aratus to negotiate with him, promising <lb/>
            him among many other advantages a yearly pension of <lb/>
            twelve talents, thus over-bidding Ptolemy by one half: <lb/>
            for Ptolemy paid Aratus six talents a year. Kleomenes <lb/>
            proposed that he himself should receive the title of chief <lb/>
            of the Achaeans, and that the citadel of Corinth should be <lb/>
            garrisoned partly by Achæans and partly by Spartan troops. <lb/>
            To this Aratus answered that he was not able to direct <lb/>
            events, but rather was directed by them. As this language <lb/>
            proved that he had no intention of negotiating seriously, <lb/>
            Kleomenes at once invaded the territory of Sikyon, ravaged <lb/>
            the country, and encamped for three months before the walls <lb/>
            of the city. Aratus remained quiet within the walls, but <lb/>
             <pb n="520"/>
            began to consider whether it would be necessary for him to <lb/>
            obtain the assistance of Antigonus by surrendering the <lb/>
            citadel of Corinth to him: for his help was not to be had <lb/>
            on any other terms.</p>
          <p>XLII. The Achæans now assembled at Ægium and in­ <lb/>
            vited Aratus thither. The journey was a dangerous one <lb/>
            for him to make, at a time when Kleomenes was encamped <lb/>
            outside the city of Sikyon; and his fellow-countrymen <lb/>
            endeavoured to keep him back by entreaties and even by <lb/>
            threatening that, when the enemy was so close, they <lb/>
            would not permit him to leave the city; while the women <lb/>
            and children hung upon him weeping, as though he were <lb/>
            the common father and preserver of them all. However, <lb/>
            after addressing a few words of encouragement to them he <lb/>
            rode away towards the sea, accompanied by ten of his <lb/>
            friends and by his son, who was now grown up. At the <lb/>
            beach they embarked on board of some vessels which were <lb/>
            riding at anchor, and proceeded by sea to the assembly at <lb/>
            Ægium, at which it was decreed that Antigonus should be <lb/>
            invited to aid them, and that the citadel of Corinth should <lb/>
            be handed over to him. Aratus even sent his son to <lb/>
            Antigonus among the other hostages. The Corinthians, <lb/>
            disgusted with these proceedings, now confiscated his <lb/>
            property, and presented his house to Kleomenes.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Antigonus now approached with his army, which <lb/>
            was composed of twenty thousand Macedonian foot soldiers, <lb/>
            with thirteen hundred cavalry. Aratus, with the chief <lb/>
            officers of the Achæan league, proceeded by sea to Pegæ to <lb/>
            meet him, thus avoiding the enemy, although he had no <lb/>
            great confidence in Antigonus, and distrusted the <lb/>
            Macedonians. He felt that he owed his own greatness to <lb/>
            the injuries which he had done them, and that his first <lb/>
            rise as a politician was due to his hatred of the old An­ <lb/>
            tigonus. Yet, driven by inexorable necessity, and by the <lb/>
            exigencies of the times, to which men in authority are <lb/>
            really slaves, he took this desperate course.</p>
          <p>Antigonus, as soon as he learned that Aratus was ap­ <lb/>
            proaching, met him, and welcomed his companions in a <lb/>
            friendly manner, but showed him especial honour at their <lb/>
            first meeting, and as he found upon trial that Aratus was <lb/>
            a worthy and sensible maIls he contracted closer relations <lb/>
             <pb n="521"/>
            with him than those of mere business. Indeed, Aratus <lb/>
            was not only useful to Antigonus for the management of <lb/>
            great political negotiations, but when the king was at <lb/>
            leisure, proved a more agreeable companion to him than <lb/>
            any one else. Antigonus, young as he was, perceived that <lb/>
            Aratus was not spoiled by royal favour, and soon preferred <lb/>
            him not only above all other Achæans, but even beyond <lb/>
            his own Macedonian courtiers. Thus was the sign which <lb/>
            the god had given him in the sacrifice brought to pass : <lb/>
            for it is said that a short time before this, Aratus was <lb/>
            offering sacrifice and that there appeared in the liver of <lb/>
            the victim two gall bladders enclosed in one caul. The <lb/>
            soothsayer explained this to portend that Aratus would <lb/>
            shortly form an intimate friendship with his greatest <lb/>
            enemy. At the time he disregarded this saying, for he <lb/>
            was always more inclined to follow the dictates of common <lb/>
            sense than to be guided by prophecies and portents. <lb/>
            Afterwards, however, as the war proceeded successfully, <lb/>
            Antigonus made a great feast at Corinth to which he <lb/>
            invited many guests. Among these was Aratus, whom <lb/>
            he placed next to himself. Presently he sent for a <lb/>
            wrapper, and asked Aratus if he also did not feel chilly. <lb/>
            Aratus answered that he was very cold, and Antic-onus <lb/>
            then bade him come closer to himself, so that the servants <lb/>
            who brought the wrapper enveloped them both in it. <lb/>
            Then Aratus, remembering the portent, burst out laughing, <lb/>
            and told the king about the sacrifice and the prophecy. <lb/>
            This, however, happened after the times of which I am <lb/>
            writing.</p>
          <p>XLIV. At Pegæ Aratus and Antigonus each plighted <lb/>
            their faith to the other, and then at once marched against <lb/>
            the enemy. Before Corinth several battles took place, for <lb/>
            Kleomenes was securely entrenched there, and the <lb/>
            Corinthians vigorously assisted him. But now one <lb/>
            Aristoteles of Argos, a friend of Aratus, sent secretly to him <lb/>
            to say that he could cause that city to revolt from <lb/>
            Kleomenes, if Aratus would appear before it with some <lb/>
            Macedonian soldiers. Aratus laid the matter before <lb/>
            Antigonus, and hurriedly crossed over to Epidaurus by <lb/>
            sea with a force of fifteen hundred men. The Argives <lb/>
            rose in revolt before his arrival, attacked the troops of <lb/>
             <pb n="522"/>
            Kleomenes, and drove them to take refuge in the citadel; <lb/>
            and Kleomenes, hearing of this, and fearing that if the <lb/>
            enemy made themselves masters of Argos they might cut <lb/>
            off his retreat, abandoned Corinth and marched by night <lb/>
            to help the garrison of Argos. He arrived there before <lb/>
            Aratus, and won a partial success, but soon afterwards, <lb/>
            as Aratus was marching to attack him, and King Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus was coming on behind Aratus, he retired to <lb/>
            Mantinea. Upon this all the cities of Peloponnesus again <lb/>
            joined the Achæans, and Antigonus received the citadel <lb/>
            of Corinth. The people of Argos now elected Aratus <lb/>
            their commander-in-chief, and he persuaded them to make <lb/>
            a present to Antigonus of all the property of their late <lb/>
            despots and of all traitors. Aristomachus was put to the <lb/>
            torture at Cenchreae and then drowned in the sea, a <lb/>
            proceeding which brought great discredit upon Aratus <lb/>
            for having allowed a man of considerable merit, with <lb/>
            whom he had formerly been intimately connected, and <lb/>
            whom he had persuaded to abdicate his throne and bring <lb/>
            over Argos to the league, to be put to death in this cruel <lb/>
            and illegal manner.</p>
          <p>XLV. By this time also many other charges were <lb/>
            brought against Aratus by the other cities, as, for instance, <lb/>
            that the league had given Corinth to Antigonus just <lb/>
            as if it were some obscure village, and that it had <lb/>
            permitted him to sack Orchomenus and place in it a <lb/>
            Macedonian garrison ; that it had passed a decree, that no <lb/>
            letter or embassy should be sent to any other king if <lb/>
            Antigonus did not approve of it; that they were <lb/>
            forced to maintain and pay the Macedonians, and that <lb/>
            they celebrated religious services, processions, and games <lb/>
            in honour of Antigonus, in which the fellow-citizens of <lb/>
            Aratus took the lead, and invited him into their city <lb/>
            where he was the guest of Aratus. All blamed Aratus foi <lb/>
            this, not considering that he had given over the reins tc <lb/>
            Antigonus, and was now compelled to follow his lead, <lb/>
            having no longer anything except his tongue which he <lb/>
            could call his own, and not daring to use even that with <lb/>
            entire freedom. It was clear that much of what was being <lb/>
            done distressed Aratus, as for instance the affair of the <lb/>
            statues ; for Antigonus restored the statues of the despots <lb/>
             <pb n="523"/>
            at Argos which had been thrown down, and threw down <lb/>
            all the statues of the captors of the citadel of Corinth, <lb/>
            except only that of Aratus himself : and that, too, although <lb/>
            Aratus begged him earnestly to spare those of the others. <lb/>
            At Mantinea, too, the behaviour of the Achæans was <lb/>
            repugnant to Hellenic patriotism, for having by the help <lb/>
            of Antigonus captured that city, they put to death all <lb/>
            the leading men, and of the rest they sold some and sent <lb/>
            others to Macedonia loaded with fetters, while they made <lb/>
            slaves of the women and children. Of the proceeds of the <lb/>
            sale they divided one-third among themselves, and gave <lb/>
            two-thirds to the Macedonians. Yet this can be justified <lb/>
            by the law of revenge ; for though it is a shocking thing <lb/>
            to deal so cruelly with men of one's own nation, through <lb/>
            anger, still, in great political crises, revenge is sweet and <lb/>
            not bitter, and in the words of Simouides, soothes and <lb/>
            relieves the angry spirit. But what happened afterwards <lb/>
            cannot be thought honourable to Aratus, nor can it be <lb/>
            attributed to political exigencies : for when the city was <lb/>
            presented by Antigonus to the Achæans, and they <lb/>
            decided upon colonising it, Aratus being chosen as its <lb/>
            founder, and being at the time general of the Achæans, <lb/>
            decreed that it should no longer be called Mantinea, but <lb/>
            Antigoneia, which remains its Dame to this day. Thus, <lb/>
            by his means, the lovely Mantinea, as Homer calls it,. <lb/>
            was wiped out of the map of Greece, and there remains <lb/>
            in its stead a city whose name recalls its destroyer and <lb/>
            the murderer of its citizens.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Subsequently to this, Kleomenes was defeated in <lb/>
            a great battle at Sellasia, left Sparta and sailed to Egypt. <lb/>
            Antigonus, after showing every kindness to Aratus, re­ <lb/>
            turned to Macedonia, where, as he already was suffering <lb/>
            from the illness which caused his death, he sent the heir <lb/>
            to his kingdom, Philip, who was now a mere lad, into <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, advising him to pay the greatest attentions <lb/>
            to Aratus, and through him to negotiate with the cities, <lb/>
            and make the acquaintance of the Achæans. Aratus <lb/>
            welcomed Philip, and so treated him that he returned to <lb/>
            Macedonia full of good will towards himself, and full of <lb/>
            generous feelings and impulses towards the Greeks. <note type="footnote"> * I., ii. 607. </note> <pb n="524"/>
            </p>
          <p>XLVII. When Antigonus died, the Ætolians, who <lb/>
            regarded the Achæans with contempt because of their <lb/>
            cowardice (for indeed they had become accustomed to be <lb/>
            protected by others, and trusting, entirely to the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian arms, had fallen into a condition of complete in­ <lb/>
            dolence and want of discipline), began to interfere in the <lb/>
            politics of the Peloponnesus. During their invasion they <lb/>
            incidentally plundered the territory of Patræ and Dyme, <lb/>
            and then marched into the country of Messenia and began <lb/>
            to lay it waste. Aratus, distressed at this, and seeing <lb/>
            that Timoxenus, the general of the Achæans, was acting <lb/>
            slowly and without spirit because his year of office had <lb/>
            almost expired, anticipated his own election as general <lb/>
            by five days, in order to assist the Messenians. He <lb/>
            assembled an Achæan army : but the men were without <lb/>
            military training and were destitute of warlike spirit. <lb/>
            This army was defeated in a battle near Kaphyæ, and <lb/>
            Aratus, who was reproached with having been too rash a <lb/>
            general, now fell into the opposite extreme, and showed <lb/>
            such apathy as often to refuse to seize opportunities for <lb/>
            attack which were offered by the Ætolians, and to permit <lb/>
            them to riot through Peloponnesus with every kind of <lb/>
            wanton insult. Now, a second time, the Achaeans stretched <lb/>
            forth their hands towards Macedonia and brought Philip <lb/>
            to interfere in the affairs of Greece. They were the more <lb/>
            willing to take this step because they knew the regard <lb/>
            which Philip felt for Aratus, and the trust which he <lb/>
            placed in him, and they hoped that they should find him <lb/>
            gentle and manageable in all respects.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. At first the king, influenced by the slanders of <lb/>
            Apelles, Megaleas, and some other of his courtiers against <lb/>
            Aratus encouraged those of the opposite faction, and <lb/>
            eagerly pressed for the election of Eperatus as general of <lb/>
            the league. However, as he was utterly despised by the <lb/>
            Achaeans, and as nothing useful could be effected while <lb/>
            Aratus was out of office, Philip perceived that he had <lb/>
            made a complete mistake. He now came entirely over to <lb/>
            the side of Aratus, and acted entirely at his dictation. <lb/>
            As he was now gaining both renown and power, he <lb/>
            attached himself more and more to Aratus, imagining <lb/>
            that it was by his means that he gained his successes. <lb/>
             <pb n="525"/>
            Indeed it began to be thought that Aratus was able to <lb/>
            school kings as well as he could free cities ; for the impress <lb/>
            of his character was to be traced in every one of Philip's <lb/>
            acts. Thus the lenity with which the young prince treated <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians after they had offended him, his per­ <lb/>
            sonal interviews with the Cretans, by means of which he <lb/>
            gained possession of the whole island in a few days, and <lb/>
            his brilliantly successful campaign against the Ætolians, all <lb/>
            gained for Aratus the credit of giving good advice, and <lb/>
            for Philip that of knowing how to follow it: All this <lb/>
            made Philip's courtiers more and more jealous of Aratus. <lb/>
            As they could effect nothing against him by secret intrigues, <lb/>
            they proceeded to open abuse, and assailed him at wine­ <lb/>
            parties with the most scurrilous impertinence, and once <lb/>
            when he was retiring to his tent after dinner they even <lb/>
            sent a shower of stones after him. Philip was very in­ <lb/>
            dignant at these proceedings, and at once imposed upon <lb/>
            them a fine of twenty talents. Afterwards, as they were <lb/>
            embroiling and troubling his affairs by their intrigues, <lb/>
            he had them all put to death.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Now that Philip was borne along upon the full <lb/>
            tide of success, he developed many vehement lusts, and the <lb/>
            natural wickedness of his nature broke through all the <lb/>
            artificial restraints by which it had been hitherto held in <lb/>
            check, and gradually revealed him in his true colours. <lb/>
            His first act was to seduce the wife of the younger Aratus. <lb/>
            This intrigue he earned on for a long time unsuspected, <lb/>
            as he lived in their house and was treated as an honoured <lb/>
            guest. Next, he began to treat the Greeks in a much <lb/>
            harsher fashion, and evidently intended to rid himself <lb/>
            of Aratus. His conduct at Messene first gave rise to this <lb/>
            suspicion. The Messenians revolted, and Aratus marched <lb/>
            to attack them, but Philip reached Messene one day before <lb/>
            him, and when he entered the city stirred up the passions <lb/>
            of the citizens by asking the aristocracy of the Messenians <lb/>
            in private whether they had no laws to keep down the po­ <lb/>
            pulace, and then again in private inquiring of the leaders <lb/>
            of the people whether they had no hands wherewith to <lb/>
            quell despots. After this the chief men took heart and <lb/>
            fell upon the popular leaders, but they, with the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of the people, killed all the magistrates and nearly <lb/>
            two hundred of the other leading citizens. <pb n="526"/>
            </p>
          <p>L. After Philip had thus wickedly exasperated the <lb/>
            Messenians against one another, Aratus arrived. He made <lb/>
            no secret of his distress at what had happened, and did <lb/>
            not restrain his son when he bitterly reproached and <lb/>
            abused Philip. The young man was thought to have <lb/>
            been Philip's lover; and he now told Philip that after <lb/>
            such deeds he did not any longer think him handsome, but <lb/>
            hideous. Philip made no answer, although he was thought <lb/>
            likely to do so, as he often had burst into a fury when <lb/>
            thus spoken to, but, just as though he had patiently <lb/>
            endured the reproof and was really of a moderate and <lb/>
            statesmanlike disposition, he took the elder Aratus by the <lb/>
            hand, led him out of the theatre, and proceeded with him <lb/>
            as far as the summit of Ithome, to sacrifice to Zeus and to <lb/>
            view the place, which is naturally as strong as the <lb/>
            citadel of Corinth, and if garrisoned would become a <lb/>
            thorn in the side of the neighbouring states, and quite <lb/>
            impregnable. After mounting the hill and offering <lb/>
            sacrifice, when the soothsayer brought him the entrails of <lb/>
            the ox, he, taking them into his own hands, kept show­ <lb/>
            ing them first to Aratus and then to Demetrius of <lb/>
            Pharos, alternately placing them before each, and asking <lb/>
            what they thought was the meaning of the entrails, that <lb/>
            he would keep possession of the citadel, or that he would <lb/>
            restore it to the Messenians. At this Demetrius laughed <lb/>
            and said, " If you have the soul of a soothsayer, you will <lb/>
            give up the place; but if you have that of a king, you will <lb/>
            clutch the ox by both horns," alluding to Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            which, if he held the citadels of Messene and of Corinth, <lb/>
            would be quite tame and at his mercy.</p>
          <p>Aratus remained silent for a long while, but when Philip <lb/>
            begged him to say what he thought, he answered, “ My <lb/>
            king, there are many high mountains in Crete, and there <lb/>
            are many strong positions in Bœotia and Phokis. I believe <lb/>
            too, that there are many places of surprising strength in <lb/>
            Acarnania, both on the sea coast and inland, yet you <lb/>
            have not taken any of these, and nevertheless the people <lb/>
            of those countries willingly execute your commands. <lb/>
            Brigands cling to high cliffs and haunt precipitous places, <lb/>
            but kings find nothing so secure as loyalty and goodwill. <lb/>
            This it is that opened to you the Cretan ses, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="527"/>
            Peloponnesus. By these arts you, young as you are, have <lb/>
            made yourself the master of the one, and the leader of the <lb/>
            other." While Aratus was yet speaking Philip gave back <lb/>
            the entrails to the soothsayer, and, taking Aratus by the <lb/>
            hand, said,“ Come now, let us go back again," having been, <lb/>
            as it were, overruled by him into letting the city remain free.</p>
          <p>LI. Aratus now began to withdraw himself from the <lb/>
            court, and by degrees to break off his intimacy with Philip, <lb/>
            When Philip conveyed his army across the Corinthian <lb/>
            gulf into Epirus,* and desired Aratus to make the <lb/>
            campaign with him, Aratus refused and remained at home, <lb/>
            fearing that he might share the disgrace of Philip's <lb/>
            operations. Philip, after his fleet had been ignominiously <lb/>
            destroyed by the Romans, and his whole enterprise had <lb/>
            failed,t returned to Peloponnesus, and, as he did not <lb/>
            succeed in a second attempt to outwit the Messenians <lb/>
            and to gain possession of their citadel, he threw off the <lb/>
            mask and openly wronged them by ravaging their <lb/>
            territory. Aratus now became quite estranged from him, <lb/>
            and was misrepresented to him. He had by this time <lb/>
            learned the domestic dishonour which he had sustained <lb/>
            from Philip, and grieved over it, though he kept it secret <lb/>
            from his son ; for when he had discovered it, he was power­ <lb/>
            less to avenge it. Indeed Philip's character seems to have <lb/>
            undergone a very great and remarkable change, as from a <lb/>
            mild ruler and a modest youth he grew into a profligate man <lb/>
            and an atrocious tyrant. This change was not due to any <lb/>
            alteration of his real nature, but to the fact that he could <lb/>
            now with impunity indulge the vices which fear had <lb/>
            hitherto forced him to conceal.</p>
          <p>LII. His treatment of Aratus showed that he had <lb/>
            always regarded him with a mixture of respect and fear ; <lb/>
            for though he desired to make away with him, and con­ <lb/>
            sidered that during Aratus's life-time he should not even <lb/>
            be a free man, much less a despot or king, yet he would <lb/>
            not openly attack him, but bade Taurion, one of his <note type="footnote"> * Philip's object in this expedition was to make himself master of <lb/>
            Apollonia and Oricum. </note><note type="footnote"> t “ He was forced to barn his ships and retreat overland, leaving his <lb/>
            baggage, ammunition, and a great part of the arms of his troops in <lb/>

            generals and friends, to do this secretly, by poison if pos­ <lb/>
            sible, during his own absence. This man gained the con­ <lb/>
            fidence of Aratus, and administered drugs to him, whose <lb/>
            action was not quick and sudden, but which produced <lb/>
            slight heats in the body and a chronic cough, and so <lb/>
            gradually undermined his strength. He did not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, do this without being discovered by Aratus; but he, <lb/>
            as he could gain nothing by convicting him, continued <lb/>
            to enduie his malady just as if it were some ordinary <lb/>
            disorder. Only once when he spat blood, and one of his <lb/>
            friends who was in the same room noticed it and expressed <lb/>
            his concern, Aratus said, “ This, Kephalon, is the return I <lb/>
            get for my friendship for the king."</p>
          <p>LIII. Thus died Aratus at Ægium, when holding the <lb/>
            office of general of the league for the seventeenth time. <lb/>
            The Achæans wished his funeral to take place in that <lb/>
            city, and to raise a suitable monument over so great a <lb/>
            man ; but the people of Sikyon regarded it as a national <lb/>
            misfortune that he should not be buried in their city, and <lb/>
            prevailed upon the Achæans to deliver up the body to <lb/>
            them. As there was a law which was regarded with <lb/>
            superstitious reverence, forbidding any one to be interred <lb/>
            within the walls of Sikyon, they sent ambassadors to Delphi <lb/>
            to consult the oracle. The Pythia returned the following <lb/>
            answer :— <lb/>
            “ Dost thou, fair Sikyon, hesitate to raise <lb/>
            A fitting tomb to thy lost hero's praise? <lb/>
            Curst be the laud, nay, curst the air or wave <lb/>
            That grudges room for thy Aratus' grave."</p>
          <p>When this response was brought back all the Achæans <lb/>
            were delighted, and the Sikyonians in particular, turning <lb/>
            their mourning into joy, put on white robes, crowned <lb/>
            themselves with garlands, and removed the body of Aratus <lb/>
            from Ægium to Sikyon in festal procession with songs <lb/>
            and dances. They chose a conspicuous spot, and interred <lb/>
            him in it with as much reverence as though he were the <lb/>
            founder and saviour of their city. The place is called the <lb/>
            Arateum to the present day, and on the day upon which <lb/>
            he freed the city from its despot, which is the fifth day of <lb/>
            the month Daisius, or Anthesterion in the Athenian <lb/>
            calendar, a sacrifice, called the thanksgiving for safety, is <lb/>
            offered, and also on the day of the month on which Aratus <lb/>
             <pb n="529"/>
            was born. The former sacrifice used to be conducted by <lb/>
            the priest of Zeus the Saviour, and the latter by the priest <lb/>
            of Aratus, who wore a headband, not all white, but mixed <lb/>
            with purple. Songs used to be chanted to the music of the <lb/>
            harp by the actors, called the servants of Dionysius, and <lb/>
            the president of the gymnasiums took part in the procession, <lb/>
            leading the boys and young men, after whom followed the <lb/>
            council of the city, crowned with flowers, and any of the <lb/>
            citizens who wished to do so. Some traces of these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings still survive, as religous ceremonies; but the most <lb/>
            part of the honours paid to Aratus have died out through <lb/>
            lapse of time and change of circumstances.</p>
          <p>LIV. This is the account which history gives us of the <lb/>
            life and character of the elder Aratus. As for his son, <lb/>
            Philip, who was naturally a villain, and whose disposition <lb/>
            combined insolence with cruelty, administered drugs to <lb/>
            him, which were not deadly, but which deprived him of <lb/>
            his reason; so that he conceived a passion for monstrous <lb/>
            lusts and shameful debaucheries, by which he was soon so <lb/>
            worn out that, although he was in the flower of his age, <lb/>
            death appeared to him to be a release from sufferings rather <lb/>
            than a misfortune. Yet Zeus, the patron of hospitality and <lb/>
            of friendship, exacted a notable penalty from Philip for <lb/>
            his wickedness, and pursued him throughout his life : for <lb/>
            he was utterly defeated by the Romans, and forced to sur­ <lb/>
            render at discretion to them. He lost all his empire, was <lb/>
            obliged to deliver up all his fleet, except five ships, had to <lb/>
            pay a thousand talents and give up his own SOIl as a <lb/>
            hostage, and then only was allowed, by the pity of his <lb/>
            conquerors to keep Macedonia itself and its dependencies. <lb/>
            As he always put to death all the loading men of his <lb/>
            kingdom, and all his nearest relations, he inspired the <lb/>
            whole country with terror and hatred. Amidst all his <lb/>
            miseries he had one piece of good fortune, in having a son <lb/>
            of remarkable promise, and him he put to death out of <lb/>
            jealousy and envy at the honours which were paid him by <lb/>
            the Romans. He left his kingdom to his other son Perseus, <lb/>
            who was said not to be legitimate, but to be the son of a <lb/>
            sempstress named Gnathæna. Over him Paulus Æmilius <lb/>
            triumphed, and so put an end to the dynasty of Antigonus. <lb/>
            However, the family of Aratus survived in Sikyon and <lb/>
            Pellene down to my own times. <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 M </note> <pb n="530"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. The Athenian general Iphikrates thought that a mer­ <lb/>
            cenary soldier ought to be fond both of money and pleasure, <lb/>
            as in that case he would risk his life the more freely to <lb/>
            obtain the means of procuring enjoyment. Most persons, <lb/>
            however, are of opinion that an army, like a healthy body, <lb/>
            should receive no impulses save from its head. Thus we <lb/>
            are told that Paulus .Emilius, when he assumed the com­ <lb/>
            mand of the army in Macedonia, and found that the soldiers <lb/>
            did nothing but talk and meddle, as though each man were <lb/>
            a general, gave them orders to keep their hands ready and <lb/>
            their swords sharp, and leave the rest to him. And Plato <lb/>
            likewise, seeing that a good general is useless without a <lb/>
            disciplined and united army, thought that soldiers should <lb/>
            be mild and gentle, as well as spirited and energetic, <lb/>
            because those who know how to obey require a noble <lb/>
            nature and a philosophic tiaining as much as those who <lb/>
            know how to command. The events which took place at <lb/>
            Rome after Nero's death prove most conclusively that <lb/>
            nothing is more terrible than a military force which is <lb/>
            guided only by its own blind and ignorant impulses. <lb/>
            Demades, when he saw the disorderly and senseless move­ <lb/>
            ments of the Macedonian army after the death of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, compared it to the Cyclops after he had been <lb/>
            blinded; but the state of the Roman Empire resembled <lb/>
            the fabled rebellion of the Titans, as it was torn asunder <lb/>
            into several portions, which afterwards fought with one <lb/>
            another, not so much because of the ambition of those who <lb/>
            were proclaimed emperors, as through the avarice and <lb/>
            licentiousness of the soldiers, who made use of one emperor <lb/>
            to drive out another, just as one nail drives out another. <lb/>
            When Alexander of Pheræ was assassinated, after reigning <lb/>
             <pb n="531"/>
            in Tbessaly for ten months, Dionysius, sneering at the <lb/>
            shortness of his reign, called him a mere tragedy king; <lb/>
            but the palace of the Cæsars in a shorter time than this <lb/>
            saw four emperors, for the soldiers brought one in and <lb/>
            drove another out, as if they were actors on a stage. The <lb/>
            only consolation which the unhappy Romans enjoyed was <lb/>
            that the authors of their miseries required no avenger to <lb/>
            destroy them, for they fell by one another's hands, and <lb/>
            first of all, and most justly, perished the man who had <lb/>
            seduced the army into expecting such great things from a <lb/>
            change of Cæsars, and who brought dishonour upon a <lb/>
            glorious action, the dethronement of Nero, by bribing men <lb/>
            to do it as though it were a treason.</p>
          <p>II. Nymphidius Sabinus, who, as has been related, was <lb/>
            together with Tigellinus, Præfect of the Praetorian Guard,. <lb/>
            when Nero's cause was quite hopeless, and he was evi­ <lb/>
            dently preparing to escape to Egypt, persuaded the soldiers <lb/>
            to salute Galba as emperor, as though Nero were already <lb/>
            gone. He promised to each of the prætorians, or household <lb/>
            troops, seven thousand five hundred drachmas, and to each <lb/>
            of the legionary soldiers serving in the provinces twelve <lb/>
            hundred and fifty drachmas ; a sum which it would have <lb/>
            been impossible to collect without inflicting ten thousand­ <lb/>
            fold more misery on mankind than Nero himself had done.</p>
          <p>This offer at once caused the downfall of Nero, and soon <lb/>
            afterwards that of Galba; for the soldiery deserted Nero <lb/>
            in hopes of receiving the money, and murdered Galba <lb/>
            because they did not receive it. After this they sought so <lb/>
            eagerly for some one who would give them as much, that <lb/>
            before they obtained the hoped-for bribe, their own treasons <lb/>
            and rebellions proved their ruin. To relate each event <lb/>
            exactly as it happened belongs more properly to the pro­ <lb/>
            fessed historian; yet, those words and deeds of the Cæsars <lb/>
            which are worthy of record ought not to be passed over <lb/>
            even by an essayist like myself.</p>
          <p>III. It is generally agreed that Servius Sulpicius Galba <lb/>
            was the richest private person who ever was raised to the <lb/>
            throne of the Caesars. Though illustrious by birth, being <lb/>
            descended from the noble family of the Servii, he prided <note type="footnote"> * See Merivale'a ‘ History of the Romans under the Empire,’ <lb/>
            eh. Iili. vol. vi. page 142, note. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="532"/>
            himself even more upon his relationship with Catulus,* <lb/>
            who, though he shrank from taking any active part in <lb/>
            politics, was yet one of the most virtuous and eminent <lb/>
            men of the time. Galba was likewise related to Livia, <lb/>
            the wife of Augustus, and by her influence he had been <lb/>
            raised from the post which he held in the palace to the <lb/>
            office of consul. He is said to have ably commanded the <lb/>
            army in Germany, and to have gained especial praise by <lb/>
            his conduct as pro-consul in Libya. But when he became <lb/>
            emperor, his simple and inexpensive mode of life was <lb/>
            thought to be sheer meanness, while his ideas of discipline <lb/>
            and sobriety appeared obsolete and ridiculous. Nero, <lb/>
            before he had learned to fear the most eminent of the <lb/>
            Romans, had appointed Galba to a command in Spain. <lb/>
            Indeed, besides the mildness of his character, it was <lb/>
            thought that his advanced age was a guarantee against <lb/>
            his engaging in any rash enterprise.</p>
          <p>IV. While Galba was in Spain, the procurators of the <lb/>
            emperor treated the provincials with the greatest harsh­ <lb/>
            ness and cruelty. Galba could not afford them any assist­ <lb/>
            ance, but he made no secret of his sympathy with them <lb/>
            and sorrow at their wrongs, and thus afforded them some <lb/>
            relief while they were being condemned unjustly and sold <lb/>
            into slavery. Many scurrilous songs also were written <lb/>
            about Nero and sung and circulated everywhere, and as <lb/>
            Galba did not discourage this, and did not share the indigo <lb/>
            nation of the procurators, he became even more endeared <lb/>
            to the natives, with whom he was already intimately <lb/>
            acquainted, as he was now in the eighth year of his com. <lb/>
            mand, during which Junius Vindex, who commanded the <lb/>
            army in Gaul, revolted.</p>
          <p>It is said that before Vindex committed any overt act <lb/>
            of rebellion he wrote to Galba, and that Galba neither <lb/>
            agreed to his proposals nor yet denounced him, as some <lb/>
            other generals did; for many of them sent Vindex's letters <lb/>
            to Nero, and as far as they were able ruined his cause. <lb/>
            Yet these men afterwards became traitors, and so proved <lb/>
            that they could betray themselves as well as Vindex. <lb/>
            When, however, Vindex openly raised the standard of <lb/>
            revolt, and called upon Galba to accept the offer of em­ <note type="footnote"> * Quintus Catulus Capitolinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="533"/>
            pire, and constitute himself the head of a strong body— <lb/>
            namely, the troops in Gaul, a hundred thousand armed <lb/>
            men, and many times more men capable of bearing arms— <lb/>
            Galba called a council of his friends. Some of them advised <lb/>
            him to temporise, and watch the progress of events at <lb/>
            Rome; but Titus Vinius, the captain of the praetorian <lb/>
            cohort, said, “Galba, why do you hesitate? for yon <lb/>
            cannot remain quiet, and yet think of remaining faithful <lb/>
            to Nero. If Nero is to be your foe, you must not refuse <lb/>
            the proffered alliance of Vindex, or else you must at <lb/>
            once denounce him and attack him, because he wishes <lb/>
            the Romans to have you for their chief rather than Nero <lb/>
            for their tyrant."</p>
          <p>V. After this, Galba by an edict appointed a day upon <lb/>
            which he would grant manumi-sion to whoever might wish <lb/>
            it, and rumour and gossip drew together on that day a great <lb/>
            multitude of people eager for revolution. No sooner did <lb/>
            Galba appear upon the tribune than all with one voice <lb/>
            saluted him as emperor. Galba did not at once accept this <lb/>
            title, but spoke in disparagement of Nero, deplored the <lb/>
            best citizens of Rome who had been murdered by him, and <lb/>
            promised that he would watch over his country to the <lb/>
            best of his power, not as Caesar or Emperor, but merely as <lb/>
            the general of the Senate and people of Rome. That <lb/>
            Vindex acted justly and on due reflection when he offered <lb/>
            the empire to Galba, is proved by the conduct of Nero <lb/>
            himself ; for though he affected to despise Vindex and to <lb/>
            regard Gaul as of no importance, yet as soon as he heard <lb/>
            of Galba's rising, which was when he was at breakfast <lb/>
            after his bath, he overturned the table. However, as the <lb/>
            Senate declared Galba a public enemy, Nero, wishing to <lb/>
            show his courage and to jest with his friends, said that this <lb/>
            gave him a good pretext for raising the money of which <lb/>
            he stood in need ; for when he had conquered the Gauls <lb/>
            he would sell their spoils by public auction, and in the <lb/>
            meantime he could at once confiscate the estate of Calba, <lb/>
            as he had been declared a public enemy. Nero, after <lb/>
            this, ordered Galba's property to be sold, and Galba, when <lb/>
            he heard of this, ordered all Nero's property in Spain to be <lb/>
            put up to auction and found people much more ready to <lb/>
            purchase it.</p><pb n="534"/>
            
          <p>VI. Many now revolted from Nero, and all these, as <lb/>
            might be expected, declared for Galba, with the exception <lb/>
            of Clodius Macer, in Africa, and Virginius Rufus. who <lb/>
            commanded the German army in Gaul, who each acted for <lb/>
            themselves, though for different reasons. Clodius, who <lb/>
            had plundered his province, and put many men to death <lb/>
            from cruelty and covetousness, hesitated, because he could <lb/>
            neither continue to hold his command nor yet give it <lb/>
            up with safety. Virginius on the other hand, who was at <lb/>
            the head of the most powerful force in the empire, and <lb/>
            who was constantly saluted as emperor by his soldiers <lb/>
            and urged to assume the purple, declared that he would <lb/>
            neither become emperor himself nor yet allow any one else to <lb/>
            do so without the consent of the Senate. Galba was at first <lb/>
            much disturbed at this. Soon the two armies of Vindex <lb/>
            and Virginius, like horses that have taken the bit between <lb/>
            their teeth, fought a severe battle with one another. <lb/>
            After two thousand Gauls had fallen, Vindex committed <lb/>
            suicide; and a rumour became prevalent that after so <lb/>
            signal a victory the whole army would either place <lb/>
            Virginius upon the throne, or would return to their <lb/>
            allegiance to Nero. Galba, who was now greatly alarmed, <lb/>
            wrote to Virginius, begging him to act in concert with <lb/>
            him, and preserve the empire and liberty of the Romans. <lb/>
            Meanwhile he retired with his friends to Colonia, a city <lb/>
            of Spain, where he occupied himself more in repenting <lb/>
            of the steps which he had taken, and in regretting the loss <lb/>
            of his usual life of ease and leisure more than in doing <lb/>
            anything to further his cause.</p>
          <p>VII. Summer was just beginning, when one evening, <lb/>
            shortly before dark, there arrived lcelus, one of Galba's <note type="footnote">* Nero set a price upon the head of Vindex, whose designs were <lb/>
            speedily revealed to him, and though the forces of the Gaulish <lb/>
            province were di posed to follow their chief, the more powerful legions <lb/>
            of Lower Germany, under Virginia Rufus, were in full march against <lb/>
            them. The armies met at Vesontio, and there Virginius and Vindex <lb/>
            at a private interview agre d to conspire together, but their troops <lb/>
            could come to no such understanding; the Virginians attacked the <lb/>
            soldiers of Vindex, and almost cut them to pieces. Vindex thereupon, <lb/>
            with the haste and levity of his race, threw himself upon his sword, <lb/>
            and the rebellion seemed for a moment to be crushed. Merivale's <lb/>
            ‘ History of the Romans under the Empire,' vol. vi. oil. lv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="535"/>
            freed men, who had travelled from Rome in seven days. <lb/>
            Hearing that Galba was retired to rest, he proceeded at <lb/>
            once to his chamber, forced open the door in spite of the <lb/>
            resistance of the attendants, made his way in and told <lb/>
            him that while Nero was still alive, first the army, and <lb/>
            then the people and Senate had declared Galba emperor : <lb/>
            and that shortly afterwards a report was spread of Nero's <lb/>
            death. The messenger said that he had not believed this <lb/>
            rumour, and that he had not left Rome before he had seen <lb/>
            the corpse of Nero. This news very greatly raised the <lb/>
            credit of Galba, and a multitude of men, whose confidence <lb/>
            in him had been restored by this message, flocked to his <lb/>
            doors to salute him. Yet the time * in which he received <lb/>
            the news seemed incredibly short. But, two days after­ <lb/>
            wards Titus Vinius arrived with several other persons, <lb/>
            who brought a detailed account of the proceedings both <lb/>
            of the prætorians and of the Senate. He was at once <lb/>
            promoted to a post of honour; while Icelus was presented <lb/>
            with a gold t ring, received the surname of Marcianus, and <lb/>
            took the first place among the freed men of Galba.</p>
          <p>VIII. Meanwhile at Rome Nymphidius Sabinus, not <lb/>
            quietly and by degrees, but by one bold stroke, attempted <lb/>
            to get all departments of the state into his own hands. He <lb/>
            pointed out that Galba was an old man who would scarcely <lb/>
            live long enough to be carried to Rome in a litter; and <lb/>
            indeed Galba was in his seventy-third year. The soldiers <lb/>
            in the provinces, be declared, had long been his friends, <lb/>
            and they now depended on him alone because of the <lb/>
            enormous presents which he offered them, which made <lb/>
            them regard him as their benefactor, and Galba as their <lb/>
            debtor. Nymphidius now at once ordered his colleague <lb/>
            Tigellinus to give up his sword, and entertained all men <lb/>
            of consular or praetorian rank at state banquets, although <lb/>
            he still invited them in the name of Galba, while he <lb/>
            suborned many of the prætorian guard to say that they <note type="footnote">* Nero died on the 9th of June, A.D. 68. </note><note type="footnote"> t The gold ring was presented by the Roman emperors in much the <lb/>
            same way as the insignia of an order of chivalry is given by modern <lb/>
            sovereigns. Under the republic it had been the distinguishing mark of <lb/>
            the equestrian order, and its possession still continued to raise its <lb/>
            recipients to the rank of ‘ eques,' of. Plin. H. N. 33, 2, and Paulus i. 5, <lb/>

            must petition Galba to appoint Nymphidius as their <lb/>
            prefect for life without any colleague. He was urged to <lb/>
            even more audacious pretensions by the conduct of the <lb/>
            Senate, who added to his fame and power by addressing <lb/>
            him as their benefactor, by assembling daily to pay their <lb/>
            respects to him, and by requiring him to propose and to <lb/>
            ratify every decree : so that in a short time he became an <lb/>
            object not only of jealousy but of terror to his supporters. <lb/>
            When the consuls chose public messengers to carry the <lb/>
            decrees of the Senate to the emperor, and had given them <lb/>
            the sealed documents known as diplomas,. at the sight of <lb/>
            which the local authorities in all towns assist the bearer <lb/>
            on his journey by relays of horses at each stage. Nym­ <lb/>
            phidius was much vexed at their not having come to him <lb/>
            to affix the seals and to provide messengers from the <lb/>
            praetorian guard, and he is even said to have thought of <lb/>
            wreaking his displeasure on the consuls; but when they <lb/>
            begged his pardon he forgave them. In order to win the <lb/>
            favour of the people he permitted them to massacre any of <lb/>
            Nero's creatures who fell into their hands: and they <lb/>
            killed Spicillus the gladiator by throwing him under the <lb/>
            statues of Nero when they were being dragged about the <lb/>
            Forum; laid Aponius, one of the informers, on the ground <lb/>
            and drove waggons loaded with stones over his body, and <lb/>
            tore to pieces many other persons, some of whom were <lb/>
            perfectly innocent, so that Mauriscus, who was justly held <lb/>
            to be one of the noblest men in Rome, openly declared in <lb/>
            the Senate that he feared they would soon wish to have <lb/>
            Nero back again.</p>
          <p>IX. Nymphidius, who thus began to draw nearer to <lb/>
            the object of his hopes, did not dislike being called the son <lb/>
            of Caius Cæsar, who was emperor after Tiberius. It seems <lb/>
            that Caius, when a boy, did have an intrigue with the <lb/>
            mother of Nymphidius, who was a good looking woman, <lb/>
            the daughter of a hired sempstress and of one Callisto, a <lb/>
            freed man of the emperor. But it appears that her intrigue <note type="footnote"> * Clough well remarks that here we may observe the beginning of <lb/>
            a state-post, which still exists on the continent of Europe, by which <lb/>
            all government couriers, &amp;c., were forwarded free of expanse. The <lb/>
            modern terms of “ diplomacy,” “ diplomatist,” &amp;c., is derived from the <lb/>
            “ diplomata,” or folded and sealed dispatcher carried by such persona. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="537"/>
            with Caius must have taken place after the birth of <lb/>
            Nymphidius, whose father was generally supposed to have <lb/>
            been Martianus the gladiator, for whom Nymphidia <lb/>
            conceived a passion because of his renown as a swordsman; <lb/>
            and this belief was confirmed by the likeness which he <lb/>
            bore to the gladiator. However, though he did not deny <lb/>
            that Nymphidia was his mother, he nevertheless boasted <lb/>
            that the dethronement of Nero was entirely his own work, <lb/>
            and, not satisfied with having gained by it both honours <lb/>
            and riches, and the embraces of Sporns, the favourite of <lb/>
            Nero, whom he had fetched away from the funeral pyre <lb/>
            of his late master and now treated as his wife, calling her <lb/>
            Poppaea, he was intriguing to gain the throne for himself. <lb/>
            He employed several of his friends, among whom were <lb/>
            some ladies of rank and senators, to further his interests <lb/>
            in Rome, and sent one Gellianus to Spain to watch the <lb/>
            proceedings of Galba.</p>
          <p>X. After Nero's death all went well with Galba, though <lb/>
            he still felt uneasy about Virginius Rufus, who had not <lb/>
            declared his intentions, and, who, being at the head of a <lb/>
            great and warlike army, with the glory of having over­ <lb/>
            thrown Vindex and made himself master of a great part of <lb/>
            the Roman Empire, was not unlikely to listen to the <lb/>
            solicitations of those who wished him to assume the purple, <lb/>
            especially as the whole of Gaul was in an excited condition <lb/>
            and ready to revolt. No name was greater or more glo­ <lb/>
            rious than that of Virginius, who was credited with having <lb/>
            saved Rome both from a cruel tyranny and from a war <lb/>
            with Gaul. He, however, according to his original inten­ <lb/>
            tion, referred the choice of an emperor to the Senate ; <lb/>
            though when the death of Nero was known the soldiers <lb/>
            renewed their solicitation of Virginius to make himself <lb/>
            emperor, and one of the tribunes who attended him in his <lb/>
            tent drew his sword, and bade Virginius choose between <lb/>
            the steel and the throne. But when Fabius Valens, the <lb/>
            commander of one legion, swore allegiance to Galba, and <lb/>
            dispatches arrived from Rome containing an account of <lb/>
            what the Senate had decreed, Virginius, though not with. <lb/>
            out difficulty, prevailed upon his soldiers to salute Galba <lb/>
            as emperor; and when Galba sent Hordeonius Flaccus to <lb/>
            supersede him, he received him as his successor, delivered <lb/>
             <pb n="538"/>
            up the troops to him, met Galba, who was now on the <lb/>
            march for Rome, and joined him without receiving from <lb/>
            him any token either of favour or resentment. Galba <lb/>
            respected Virginius too much to injure him, and Titus <lb/>
            Vinius and Galba's other adherents opposed his advance­ <lb/>
            ment out of jealousy, though in truth they only assisted <lb/>
            the good genius of Virginius in withdrawing him from the <lb/>
            wars and troubles in which all the other commanders were <lb/>
            involved, and enabling him to live in peaceful retirement <lb/>
            to a good old age.</p>
          <p>XI. At Narbo, a city of Gaul,. Galba was met by <lb/>
            envoys from the Senate, who greeted him and invited him <lb/>
            to show himself as soon as possible to his people who were <lb/>
            eager to behold him. Galba showed the envoys every <lb/>
            kindness and hospitality, but at his entertainments would <lb/>
            only use his own plate and other things, though Nymphi­ <lb/>
            dins had forwarded from Nero's stores sumptuous services of <lb/>
            everything necessary for great banquets, and the imperial <lb/>
            household servants. By this conduct Galba gained the <lb/>
            reputation of being a magnanimous man, above any ideas <lb/>
            of vulgar ostentation ; but Vinius presently told him that <lb/>
            this noble and patriotic simplicity seemed merely an artifice <lb/>
            to gain popularity with the lower classes, and that it was <lb/>
            affectation to behave as though he were not worthy of this <lb/>
            magnificence. By these arguments Vinius prevailed upon <lb/>
            him to use Nero's riches, and not to shrink from an imperial <lb/>
            extravagance at his banquets. Indeed the old man seemed <lb/>
            as though by degrees he would come to be altogether ruled <lb/>
            by Vinius.</p>
          <p>XII. This Vinius was more passionately fond of money <lb/>
            than any one else of his time, and by no means free from <lb/>
            blame in respect of women. When a young man, serving <lb/>
            on his first campaign under Calvisius Sabinus, he intro­ <lb/>
            duced his general's wife, a dissolute woman, into the camp <lb/>
            disguised as a soldier, and passed the night with her in <lb/>
            the general's headquarters, which the Romans call the <lb/>
            “ Principia." For this outrage Caius Cæsar imprisoned <lb/>
            him; but on the death of Caius he was fortunate enough <lb/>
            to obtain his release. Once when dining with the emperor <lb/>
            Claudius he stole a silver cup. When Claudius heard of <note type="footnote"> * Narbonne. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="539"/>
            it he asked him to dinner on the following day, but when <lb/>
            he came ordered the attendants to serve him entirely from <lb/>
            earthenware, not from silver. Cæsar by this comic pun­ <lb/>
            ishment showed that he regarded him as more worthy of <lb/>
            ridicule than of serious anger; but when he had obtained <lb/>
            complete control over Galba, and was the most powerful <lb/>
            man in the empire, his passion for money led him into acts <lb/>
            which partly caused and partly led others to bring about <lb/>
            the most tragic scenes of sorrow.</p>
          <p>XIII. Nymphidius, as soon as Gellianus, whom he had <lb/>
            sent as a spy upon Galba, was returned, learned from him <lb/>
            that Cornelius Laco was appointed præfect of the palace <lb/>
            and of the praetorian guard, but that all real power was in <lb/>
            the hands of Vinius.* Gellianus also said that he had had <lb/>
            no opportunity of meeting Galba, and of conversing <lb/>
            privately with him. At this news Nymphidius was much <lb/>
            alarmed. He assembled the officers of the prætorians, <lb/>
            and addressed them, saying that Galba himself was a <lb/>
            kind and moderate old man, but that he never acted <lb/>
            according to his own judgment and was entirely led astray <lb/>
            by Vinius and Laco. " Before these men, therefore," he con­ <lb/>
            tinued, " insensibly obtain for themselves the position <lb/>
            and influence which was formerly enjoyed by Tigellinus, <lb/>
            it is our duty to send an embassy from the praetorian <lb/>
            guard to our chief, to inform him that he will be more <lb/>
            acceptable to us and more popular if he removes these two <lb/>
            of his friends from his court." As this language was not <lb/>
            approved, for indeed it seemed a strange and unheard of <lb/>
            proceeding, to lecture an old general upon the choice of <lb/>
            his friends, as though he were a young boy just appointed <lb/>
            to his first command, Nymphidius tried another course, and <lb/>
            attempted to intimidate Galba by writing letters to him, <lb/>
            in which he at one time declared that Rome was in an <lb/>
            excited and disaffected condition, and at another that <lb/>
            Clodius Macer had laid an embargo on the corn-ships in <lb/>
            African ports, and that the German legions were rising <lb/>
            in revolt, and that he heard much the same news about <lb/>
            the troops in Syria and Judæa. As Galba did not pay <note type="footnote"> * Tacitus sums up the characters of these two men after his <lb/>
            manner. “ Titus Vinius and Cor elius Laco, the one the worst, the <lb/>
            other the laziest of men, &amp;c.” Tac. Hist. i. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="540"/>
            much attention to his letters or attach much credit to the <lb/>
            assertions which they contained, he resolved to make his <lb/>
            attempt before Galba's arrival, though Clodius Celsus of <lb/>
            Antioch, who was a sensible man and a faithful friend, <lb/>
            dissuaded him, saying that he did not believe that there <lb/>
            was one single family in Rome that would address <lb/>
            Nymphidius as Cæsar. Many, however, scoffed at Galba, <lb/>
            and Mithridates of Pontus * in particular, sneering at his <lb/>
            bald head and wrinkled face, said that the Romans thought <lb/>
            a great deal of Galba, now that he was absent, but that <lb/>
            when he came they would think him a disgrace to the age <lb/>
            that called him Cæsar.</p>
          <p>XIV. It was now determined that Nymphidius should <lb/>
            be conducted to the camp of the prætorians at midnight <lb/>
            and there proclaimed emperor. Towards evening An­ <lb/>
            tonius Honoratus, the first military tribune, assembled <lb/>
            the soldiers under his command and addressed them, <lb/>
            beginning by blaming himself and them for having in a <lb/>
            short time so often changed their allegiance, which they <lb/>
            had done, not according to any fixed plan, or in order to <lb/>
            choose the best masters, but as though they were driven <lb/>
            to commit one treason after another by some infatuation <lb/>
            sent by the gods. Their desertion of Nero was indeed <lb/>
            justified by his crimes; but they could not accuse Galba of <lb/>
            having murdered his mother or his wife; nor could they <lb/>
            allege that he had ever disgraced the purple by appearing <lb/>
            on the stage. " Yet," he continued, “ it was not any of <lb/>
            these things that made us desert Nero, but Nymphidius <lb/>
            persuaded us into doing so when Nero had already deserted <lb/>
            us and fled to Egypt. Shall we then kill G alba as well <lb/>
            as Nero? Shall we choose the son of Nymphidia for our <lb/>
            emperor, and slay the son of Livia as we slew the son of <lb/>
            Agrippina? Or shall we rather punish this fellow for his <lb/>
            crimes, and thus prove ourselves the avengers of Nero, and <lb/>
            the faithful guards of Galba ?”</p>
          <p>This speech of the tribune was agreed to by all his <lb/>
            soldiers, who proceeded to their comrades, and urged them <lb/>
            to remain faithful to Galba, and most of them promised to <note type="footnote"> * No doubt Galba's personal appearance offered a striking contrast <lb/>
            to that of “ the implacable, beautiful tyrant" Nero. See infra, ch. 16, <lb/>
            and Tao. Hist. i. 7 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="541"/>
            do so. Soon a shout was raised, either because, according <lb/>
            to some writers, Nymphidius believed that the soldiers <lb/>
            were already calling for him, or else because he wished to <lb/>
            be beforehand with them and fix them while they were <lb/>
            wavering and uncertain whom they should follow. <lb/>
            Nymphidius came forward in the glare of many torches, <lb/>
            carrying in his hand a speech written by Cingonius <lb/>
            Varro, which he had learned by heart and intended to <lb/>
            address to the soldiers. When, however, he saw that the <lb/>
            gates of the camp were closed, and that the walls were <lb/>
            covered with armed men, he was alarmed, and, coming <lb/>
            up to the gates, asked what they wanted, and by whose <lb/>
            orders they were under arms. They all answered with one <lb/>
            voice that they looked upon Galba as their emperor. At <lb/>
            this Nymphidius went up to them, applauded their reso­ <lb/>
            lution, and bade his followers do likewise. The soldiers <lb/>
            at the gate let him pass in, with a few others. Pre­ <lb/>
            sently a spear was hurled at him, which Septimius caught <lb/>
            before him on his shield; but as many now attacked Nym­ <lb/>
            phidius with drawn swords, he ran away, was pursued <lb/>
            into a soldier's room, and slain tkere. The corpse was <lb/>
            dragged into a public place where a railing was put round <lb/>
            it, and it was left exposed to public view the next day.</p>
          <p>XV. When Galba heard how Nymphidius had perished, <lb/>
            he ordered such of his accomplices as had not voluntarily <lb/>
            made away with themselves to be put to death: among <lb/>
            whom were Cingonius Varro who wrote the speech, and <lb/>
            Mithridates of Pontus. In this Galba was thought to <lb/>
            have shown himself harsh beyond all usage, if not beyond <lb/>
            all law, and this execution of men of rank without a trial­ <lb/>
            was a most unpopular message. Indeed, all men had <lb/>
            expected a very different kind of rule, for they had been <lb/>
            deceived, as is usually the case, by the reports spread at <lb/>
            the beginning of Galba's reign. They were still further <lb/>
            grieved at the fate of Petronius Turpilianus, a man of <lb/>
            consular rank and a faithful servant of Nero, whom Galba <lb/>
            ordered to destroy himself. In Africa Macer had, it is <lb/>
            true, been put to death by Trebonianus, and Fonteius in <lb/>
            Germany by Fabius Valens, acting under Galba's orders: <lb/>
            vet in both these cases he had the excuse that he feared, <note type="footnote"> * 6 Tanquam innocentes,’ Tac. Hist. i. &amp; </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="542"/>
            them, as they were in open rebellion against him; but <lb/>
            there could be no reason for refusing a trial to Turpilianus, <lb/>
            an old and helpless man, if the emperor had any intention <lb/>
            of carrying out in his acts the moderation of which he <lb/>
            spoke in his proclamations. For all this, therefore, Galba <lb/>
            was blamed by the Romans. When on his journey he <lb/>
            arrived within five-and-twenty stadia (about three English <lb/>
            miles) of the city, he met a disorderly mob of sailors * who <lb/>
            occupied the entire road. These were the men whom <lb/>
            Nero had formed into a legion and treated as soldiers. <lb/>
            They now wished to have their appointment confirmed, <lb/>
            and pushed forward towards the emperor noisily demand­ <lb/>
            ing standards for their legion and quarters to encamp in, <lb/>
            crowding round him in such disorder that he could neither <lb/>
            be seen nor heard by those citizens who had come out to <lb/>
            meet him on his arrival. When he endeavoured to put <lb/>
            the matter off, and said that he would give them an <lb/>
            answer at another time, they, taking his delay to mean a <lb/>
            refusal of their demand, became indignant, and followed <lb/>
            him with loud shouts. As some of them drew their <lb/>
            swords, Galba ordered his cavalry to charge them. No <lb/>
            resistance was offered, but some were cut down in the act <lb/>
            of turning to flee, and some while they ran. It was <lb/>
            thought to be a very bad omen that Galba should make <lb/>
            his entry into the city in the midst of so much blood and <lb/>
            slaughter; but all who had before jeered at him as a <lb/>
            feeble old man now looked upon him with fear and horror.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the giving of presents Galba wished to show <lb/>
            a marked change from the profuse liberality of Nero: but <lb/>
            he seems to have missed his mark, as for example, when <lb/>
            Canus, the celebrated flute-player, performed before him <lb/>
            at dinner, Galba praised his playing and ordered his purse <lb/>
            to be brought. From this he took several gold pieces and <lb/>
            gave them to Canus, telling him that the money came <lb/>
            from his own pocket, not from the revenues of the state. <lb/>
            He also demanded the restitution of the largesses, which <lb/>
            Nero had bestowed on his favourite actors and athletes, <lb/>
            leaving them only a tenth part. As he could scarcely get <lb/>
            any part of the money back from them, for the major part <note type="footnote"> * More properly “ rowers," men employed to row in ships of war, <lb/>
            who regarded it as promotion to become legionary soldiers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="543"/>
            being reckless profligates who lived only for the day'is <lb/>
            enjoyment, had spent it all, he began to search out those <lb/>
            who had bought anything or received any presents from <lb/>
            them, and obliged them to refund. This investigation <lb/>
            caused infinite trouble, for it affected so many persons; it <lb/>
            covered Galba with disgrace and made Vinius loathed and <lb/>
            detested for making the emperor show himself so mean <lb/>
            and pettifogging towards his subjects, while he himself <lb/>
            used his power recklessly, confiscating and selling every <lb/>
            one's property. Hesiod, indeed, bids us drink deep of­ <lb/>
            " The end and the beginning of the cask;" <lb/>
            and Vinius, seeing that Galba was old and feeble took his <lb/>
            fill of his fortune, as though it were both beginning and <lb/>
            ending.</p>
          <p>XVII. The old emperor received much wrong, first from <lb/>
            the bad arrangements made by Vinius, and also because <lb/>
            Vinius blamed or defeated his best intentions. An instance <lb/>
            of this was his punishment of Nero's favourites. He did, <lb/>
            indeed, put to death many wretches, among whom were <lb/>
            Helius, Polykleitus, Petinus, and Patrobius. The people <lb/>
            applauded, and cried out as these men were being led <lb/>
            through the Forum, that the sight was a fair one and <lb/>
            pleasing to the gods, but that both gods and men de­ <lb/>
            manded the punishment of Tigellinus, Nero's tutor and <lb/>
            instructor in wickedness. That worthy, however, had <lb/>
            previously attached Vinius to himself by a most important <lb/>
            pledge.- So, they argued, Turpilianus perished though <lb/>
            he had committed no crime except that he remained faith­ <lb/>
            ful and did not betray a bad master; while the man, who <lb/>
            first made Nero unfit to live, and then deserted and <lb/>
            betrayed him, was still alive, an evident example that <lb/>
            anything could be obtained from Vinius by those who <lb/>
            could pay for it. The Roman people, who would have <lb/>
            enjoyed no spectacle so much as that of Tigellinus dragged <lb/>
            away to execution, and who never ceased to demand his <lb/>
            head when they assembled in the theatre or the circus, <lb/>
            were astonished at a proclamation in which the emperor, <lb/>
            after declaring that Tigellinus was suffering from a wast­ <note type="footnote">* Vinius had engaged to marry the daughter of Tigellinus, who was <unclear/> <lb/>
            a widow with a large dower. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="544"/>
            ing disease and could not live long, begged his people <lb/>
            not to urge him to disgrace his reign by acts of tyranny <lb/>
            and ferocity. In ridicule of the public exasperation <lb/>
            Tigellinus offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods <lb/>
            for the recovery of his health, and prepared a splendid <lb/>
            banquet; while Vinius left the table of the emperor after <lb/>
            dinner and led his widowed daughter to the house of <lb/>
            Tigellinus in a riotous procession. Tigellinus made <lb/>
            her a present of five-and-twenty thousand drachmas, and <lb/>
            bade 1 is chief concubine take off the necklace which she <lb/>
            wore, which was said to be worth fifteen thousand drach­ <lb/>
            mas, and put it round his daughter's neck.</p>
          <p>XVIII. A fter these outrages Galba received no credit <lb/>
            even when he acted mildly, as for instance, when he <lb/>
            granted a remission of tribute and the Roman franchise to <lb/>
            the Gauls who bad risen in rebellion under Vindex, for it <lb/>
            was believed that they had not received these privileges <lb/>
            from the kindness of the emperor, but had bought them <lb/>
            from Vinius. Thus the people began to dislike the <lb/>
            emperor most cordially, but the praetorian guard, who had <lb/>
            not received their looked-for donative, still cherished a <lb/>
            hope that Galba would give them at least as much money <lb/>
            as they had been wont to receive from Nero, if not as much <lb/>
            as they had been promised by Nymphidius. When Galba <lb/>
            heard of their discontent, he made that remark, so worthy <lb/>
            of a great commander, that " he was wont to enlist his <lb/>
            soldiers, not to buy them," and this caused the soldiers to <lb/>
            hate him bitterly, for they thought that, besides depriving <lb/>
            them of what was their due, he was trying to regulate <lb/>
            the conduct of future emperors towards them. Yet <lb/>
            disaffection at Rome had not hitherto assumed any dis­ <lb/>
            tinct form, for the awe inspired by the presence of Galba <lb/>
            acted as a kind of check upon revolutionary schemes, and <lb/>
            men concealed the dislike with which they regarded him <lb/>
            because they did not see any distinct opportunity of <lb/>
            effecting a change in the government. But the troops in <lb/>
            Germany who had served under Virginius, and who were <lb/>
            now commanded by Flaccus,* were elated with pride at <lb/>
            the victory which they had won over Vindex, and as they <lb/>
            were given nothing, became quite unmanageable by their <note type="footnote"> * ‘ Hordeonius Flaccus,' Tac. Hist. i. 12, 53, etc. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="545"/>
            officers. They paid no attention whatever to Flaccus, <lb/>
            who, indeed, besides being quite helpless from his violent <lb/>
            attacks of gout, was entirely without military experience. <lb/>
            Once when the army was assembled at a public spectacle, <lb/>
            and the tribunes and officers offered prayers, as is usual <lb/>
            among the Romans, for the prosperity of the emperor <lb/>
            Galba, the soldiers broke into loud murmurs of dissent, <lb/>
            and then, as their chiefs continued the prayers, shouted <lb/>
            aa a response, " If he be worthy."</p>
          <p>XIX. Very similar reports to these reached Galba con­ <lb/>
            cerning the conduct of the legions under the command of <lb/>
            Tigellinus.* The emperor, fearing that it was not only <lb/>
            his age, but his want of children which brought him into <lb/>
            contempt, now determined to adopt some noble youth as <lb/>
            his son, and make him heir to the throne. There was one <lb/>
            Marcus Otho, a man of illustrious family, and steeped <lb/>
            from childhood in luxury and pleasure beyond most <lb/>
            Romans of his time. As Homer calls Alexander the <lb/>
            “ spouse of fair-haired Helen," celebrating him for the <lb/>
            beauty of his wife, in default of any noble qualities of his <lb/>
            own, so Otho was notorious at Rome in consequence of <lb/>
            his marriage with Poppæa, with whom Nero fell in love <lb/>
            when she was the wife of Crispinus, and, as he had still <lb/>
            some feelings of respect for his own wife, and feared his <lb/>
            mother, made use of Otho to obtain her for him. Otho's <lb/>
            extravagance made him a friend and companion of Nero, <lb/>
            who was amused at being reproached by Otho for mean­ <lb/>
            ness and parsimony. It is said that once Nero scented <lb/>
            himself with a very costly perfume, and sprinkled a <lb/>
            little of it over Otho. On the next day Otho entertained <lb/>
            Nero, when suddenly a number of gold and silver pipes <lb/>
            squirted out the same perfume over them both as abun­ <lb/>
            dantly as if it were water. Otho seduced Poppæa for <lb/>
            Nero, and prevailed upon her by holding out hopes of an <lb/>
            intrigue with Nero to divorce her husband and marry him. <lb/>
            After she became his wife, he did not like to share her <note type="footnote">* Tigellinus, we have learned from the last chapter but one, was <lb/>
            living at Rome. Moreover he was never in command of any legions; <lb/>
            and evidently some legions in the provinces are meant. Clough con­ <lb/>
            jectures that we should read Vitellius instead of Tigellinus; and this <lb/>
            I think very reasonable. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="546"/>
            favours, but showed great jealousy, at which it is said <lb/>
            Poppæa was not offended, for she used sometimes to <lb/>
            exclude Nero even when Otho was absent, either because <lb/>
            she feared to surfeit him with her society, or according <lb/>
            to some writers, because she did not wish to marry the <lb/>
            emperor, though she was willing enough to have him for <lb/>
            her lover. Otho ran a great risk of losing his life ; and <lb/>
            it is strange that Nero, who put to death his own wife and <lb/>
            sister for Poppæa's sake, should have spared Otho.</p>
          <p>XX. But Seneca was Otho's friend, and he persuaded <lb/>
            Nero to appoint Otho to the command of the province of <lb/>
            Further Lusitania. Otho gained the love and respect of <lb/>
            his subjects, although he well knew that his appointment <lb/>
            was merely intended as an honourable exile. When <lb/>
            Galba revolted, Otho was the first to join him, brought all <lb/>
            his silver and gold plate for Galba to coin into money, and <lb/>
            presented him with slaves who knew how to wait upon <lb/>
            an emperor. In everything he proved his fidelity to <lb/>
            Galba, while he showed a rare capacity for business, and <lb/>
            on the march to Rome he travelled for days together in <lb/>
            the same chariot with Galba. During this journey, while <lb/>
            he was so familiar with the emperor, he paid special court <lb/>
            to Vinius, both by conversing with him and by giving <lb/>
            him presents, and he firmly established his right to the <lb/>
            second place in the emperor's favour by always yield­ <lb/>
            ing the first to Vinius. He was more successful than <lb/>
            Vinius in avoiding unpopularity, for he assisted all <lb/>
            petitioners to obtain their demands without taking bribes <lb/>
            from them, and showed himself easy of access and affable <lb/>
            to all. He took special interest in the common soldiers, <lb/>
            and obtained promotion for many of them, sometimes by <lb/>
            applying directly to the emperor, at others by means of <lb/>
            Vinius, or of the freedmen, Icelus and Asiaticus,* who <lb/>
            were the most powerful personages of the court. When­ <lb/>
            ever Otho entertained Galba, he always presented each <lb/>
            soldier of the guard in attendance on the emperor with a <lb/>
            gold piece, and thus corrupted the army and won their <lb/>
            affections for himself while he appeared to be doing <lb/>
            honour to Galba. <note type="footnote"> * This seems to be a mistake, as Asiaticus was a freed man of <lb/>
            Vitellius See Tac. (Hist. it. 57). </note> <pb n="547"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXI. Now, when Galba was deliberating about the <lb/>
            choice of a successor, Vinius suggested Otho to him. <lb/>
            Vinius did not do Otho even this service gratis, but <lb/>
            because he hoped to have him for a son-in-law, for they <lb/>
            had made a compact that Vinius's daughter should marry <lb/>
            Otho if he were adopted by Galba and declared his <lb/>
            successor on the throne. But Galba always preferred the <lb/>
            good of the state to his own private advantage, and always <lb/>
            looked, not to what was most pleasant for himself, but <lb/>
            to what was best for Rome. It seems probable that he <lb/>
            would never have chosen Otho even to be heir to his own <lb/>
            estate, for he knew well his licentiousness and extrava­ <lb/>
            gance and his debts, which amounted to fifty millions.- <lb/>
            Wherefore Galba, after having graciously and in silence <lb/>
            listened to Vinius, postponed his decision : only he <lb/>
            appointed himself consul, and Vinius his colleague, and it <lb/>
            was supposed that he would name his successor at <lb/>
            the beginning of the new year. The soldiers eagerly <lb/>
            hoped that this successor would be Otho.</p>
          <p>XXII. While Galba was deliberating and hesitating, <lb/>
            the German army broke out into open rebellion. All the <lb/>
            soldiers alike hated Galba for not having given them <lb/>
            their promised donative, and the troops in Germany <lb/>
            regarded it as a special insult to themselves, that Virgin­ <lb/>
            ius Rufus had been so discourteously deprived of his <lb/>
            command, that those Gauls who had fought against them <lb/>
            under Vindex had been rewarded, while those who had <lb/>
            not joined him were punished, and that Galba should <lb/>
            show such gratitude to Vindex and pay him such honour <lb/>
            after his death, as though it was Vindex who had made <lb/>
            him emperor of the Romans. This kind of language was <lb/>
            being openly held in the camp when on the first day of <lb/>
            the new year,t which the Romans call the Calends of <lb/>
            January, Flaccus assembled the army to renew the <lb/>
            customary oath of fidelity to the emperor. The soldiers <lb/>
            overthrew and tore down the images of Galba, swore <lb/>
            fealty to the Senate and people of Rome, and then <lb/>
            dispersed. After this outbreak the officers began to fear <lb/>
            anarchy among the soldiers as much as rebellion : and one <note type="footnote"> * Of sest(rces. </note><note type="footnote"> t A.D. 69. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="548"/>
            of them spoke as follows: " What will become of uas, <lb/>
            fellow-soldiers, if we neither remain faithful to our <lb/>
            present emperor nor yet create another, as though we had <lb/>
            not merely thrown off our allegiance to Galb . but refused <lb/>
            to obey any master whatever ? As for Hordeonius Flaccus <lb/>
            we must pass him over, for he is merely a feeble shadow of <lb/>
            Galba ; but within one day's march of us there is Vitellius, <lb/>
            the chief of the army of Lower Germany, whose father <lb/>
            was censor and thrice consul, and who can point to the <lb/>
            poverty for which some reproach him as a shining proof <lb/>
            of honesty and greatness of soul. Come, let us choose this <lb/>
            man, and show that we know better than the Iberians <lb/>
            or Lusitanians how to elect an emperor." While some <lb/>
            approved, and some rejected this advice, a standard-bearer <lb/>
            stole quietly away and brought the news of it to Vitellius, <lb/>
            who was entertaining a large company at supper. Soon <lb/>
            the matter became noised abroad throughout the army, <lb/>
            and on the following day Fabius Valens, who commanded <lb/>
            one legion,* rode over to Vitellius's quarters† with a number <lb/>
            of horsemen and saluted him emperor. It is said that on the <lb/>
            previous days he had refused the purple, and had shrunk <lb/>
            from the burden of empire, but that now, excited by food <lb/>
            and wine which he had taken at midday, he came forward <lb/>
            and willingly heard himself addressed as Germanicus, <lb/>
            though he declined the title of Caesar. The troops under <lb/>
            Flaccus now at once forgot their patriotic oaths of fidelity <lb/>
            to the Senate, and swore to obey the emperor Vitellius.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Thus was Vitellius proclaimed emperor in <lb/>
            Germany. Galba, when he heard of the rising there, no <lb/>
            longer postponed the choice of his successor. He knew <lb/>
            that some of his friends desired the election of Otho, and <lb/>
            some that of Dolabella; but as he himself approved of <lb/>
            neither candidate, he suddenly without any warning <lb/>
            sent for Piso, the son of Crassus and Scribonia, who perished <lb/>
            under Nero, a young man remarkable for his virtues, and <lb/>
            especially for the modesty and austerity of his life. Galba <lb/>
            now at once took this youth to the camp of the praetorian <lb/>
            guard to declare him Cæsar and heir to the empire, though <note type="footnote"> * The First Legion, in Lower Germany, </note><note type="footnote"> † At Cologne. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Tsc. (Hist. i 62). </note> <lb/>

            aa he left the palace he was at once met by evil omens, <lb/>
            and when he began to address the soldiers and to read <lb/>
            aloud a prepared speech it thundered and lightened so <lb/>
            often, and such rain and darkness overshadowed the camp <lb/>
            and the city, that it was impossible to doubt that Heaven <lb/>
            did not approve of the adoption of Piso, and that no good <lb/>
            would come of it. The soldiers were sulky and scowling, <lb/>
            as not even on this occasion was any largesse given to <lb/>
            them. Piso himself was admired by all who saw him, <lb/>
            for as far as they could judge from his voice and manner <lb/>
            he was not bewildered by his good fortune, although he <lb/>
            was not insensible of it, while Otho's countenance bore <lb/>
            manifest tokens of the bitterness of his disappointment, as <lb/>
            he thought that Galba's refusal to appoint him after hav­ <lb/>
            ing chosen him and all but raised him to the throne was <lb/>
            a clear proof of the emperor's dislike and hatred for him. <lb/>
            Otho was not without fears for the future, and went away <lb/>
            full of hatred for Piso, blaming Galba, and angry with <lb/>
            Vinius. The prophets and Chaldæans whom he kept about <lb/>
            his person would not permit him to give up his hopes, and <lb/>
            especially one Ptolemæus,* who laid great stress upon a <lb/>
            prophecy which he had often repeated to him, that Nero <lb/>
            would not kill him, but would perish before him, and that <lb/>
            he should rule over the Romans; for having proved the one <lb/>
            part of his prophecy to be true, this man bade him not <lb/>
            despair of the other part also coming to pass, while he <lb/>
            was much encouraged by those who came to offer their <lb/>
            sympathy, and treated him as an ill-used man: for many <lb/>
            of the partizans of Nymphidius and Tigellinus, who had <lb/>
            once been in positions of honour, and now had been dis­ <lb/>
            missed and were in poverty, attached themselves to him <lb/>
            and urged him to revolt.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Among these were Veturius and Barbius, one <lb/>
            of whom was an adjutant, and the other an orderly of the <lb/>
            corps of guides t as the Romans call the scouts and <lb/>
            messengers of their armies. Together with them a freed­ <lb/>
            man of Otho's, named Onomastus, went about from man to <note type="footnote"> * Suetonius (Otho, 4) calls him Seleukus. </note><note type="footnote"> t So I have ventured to translate " speculator." The speculator <lb/>
            under the empire were employed as special adjutants, messengers, and <lb/>
            bodyguards of a general </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="550"/>
            man, and by bribes and promises induced them to stand <lb/>
            by Otho, which they were willing enough to do, as they <lb/>
            were thoroughly disloyal to Galba and only wanted an <lb/>
            excuse to desert him. Indeed, a loyal army could not have <lb/>
            been corrupted in four days, which was all the interval <lb/>
            that elapsed between the adoption of Piso by Galba, and <lb/>
            the murder of them both : for they perished on the sixth­ <lb/>
            day after, which the Romans call the sixteenth before the <lb/>
            Calends of February. Early in the morning of that day <lb/>
            Galba was offering sacrifice in the palace, accompanied by <lb/>
            many of his friends. The aruspex, Umbricius, as soon as <lb/>
            he took the entrails of the victim into his hands and looked <lb/>
            at them, said distinctly that they portended great disturb­ <lb/>
            ances, and danger to the emperor from a plot at head­ <lb/>
            quarters. Thus was Otho all but delivered up to justice <lb/>
            by the hand of God : for he stood close behind Galba and <lb/>
            heard what Umbricius said as he pointed to the entrails. <lb/>
            He was much alarmed, and turned all manner of colours <lb/>
            through fear, when his freedman Onomastus came up to <lb/>
            him and said that the architect was waiting for him at his <lb/>
            house. This was the preconcerted signal of the time <lb/>
            when Otho was to meet the soldiers. He, therefore, <lb/>
            explaining that he had just bought an old house, and <lb/>
            wished to point out its defects to those who had sold it, <lb/>
            went away through what is called the house of Tiberius <lb/>
            into the Forum, where stands a gilded columnt at which <lb/>
            all the public roads in Italy terminate.</p>
          <p>XXV. Here they say that he was met and saluted as <lb/>
            emperor by the first of the conspirators, who were not more <lb/>
            than three and twenty in number. Though the luxury <lb/>
            and effeminacy in which he lived had not affected his <lb/>
            courage, for he was a most daring man, yet now his heart <lb/>
            failed him. The others, however, would not let him draw <lb/>
            back, but drew their swords and, standing round his litter, ‡ <lb/>
            ordered it to proceed, while Otho frequently urged the <lb/>
            bearers to go faster, and often muttered to himself, " I am <note type="footnote"> * Counting inclusively in the Roman fashion. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Miliarium Aureum, or Golden Milestone. London Stone <lb/>
            was established by the Romans in Britain for the same purpose. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This habit of the ancient Romans, of being carried about Rome <lb/>

            a lost man;" for several persons had heard what had passed, <lb/>
            and looked on more in wonder than alarm, because of the <lb/>
            small number of the conspirators. While he was being <lb/>
            thus carried through the Forum, about as many more men <lb/>
            joined him, and then others came up by twos and threes. <lb/>
            At length they all faced around, and saluted him as Cæsar, <lb/>
            brandishing their naked swords, The tribune Martialis, <lb/>
            who was on guard at the camp of the prætorians, is said <lb/>
            not to have been in the plot, but to have been terrified and <lb/>
            bewildered at Otho's sudden appearance, and let him pass <lb/>
            in. When he was once within the camp, no one opposed <lb/>
            him; for those who did not know what was being done <lb/>
            found themselves enclosed in small parties of two or three <lb/>
            together by the conspirators, and being thus cut off from <lb/>
            one another, followed the party of Otho at first through <lb/>
            fear, and soon, when the matter was explained to them, of <lb/>
            their own free will.</p>
          <p>News of the rising was brought to Galba at the palace <lb/>
            while the aruspex still held the victim in his hands, so <lb/>
            that even those who generally refused to believe in the <lb/>
            omens drawn from sacrifices were astonished at the evident, <lb/>
            interposition of Heaven. As a crowd of all kinds of persons <lb/>
            now ran up from the Forum, Vinius and Laco and a few of <lb/>
            the emperor's freedmen stood round him with drawn swords <lb/>
            while Piso went forward and addressed the soldiers who <lb/>
            were on guard at the palace, and Marius Celsus, a brave <lb/>
            man, was sent to assure himself of the fidelity of a corps of <lb/>
            Illyrians who were quartered in the Portico of Agrippa.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Galba wished to go forth, but Vinius dissuaded <lb/>
            him, while Celsus and Laco urged him to do so, and abused <lb/>
            Vinius roundly. At this time a persistent rumour arose that <lb/>
            Otho had been murdered in the camp of the prætorians; <lb/>
            and presently one Julius Atticus, one of the chiefs of the <lb/>
            emperor'is guards, came up with his sword drawn, shouting <lb/>
            that he had slain the enemy of Cæsar. Pushing his way <lb/>
            through the bystanders, he showed Galba his sword, which <lb/>
            was covered with blood. Galba looked at him, and said, <lb/>
            " Who ordered you to kill him? " As, however, the man <lb/>
            spoke of his loyalty, and the oath of fealty which he had <lb/>
            sworn, and as the crowd shouted that he had done well, <lb/>
            and clapped their hands, Galba got into his litter with the <lb/>
             <pb n="552"/>
            intention of sacrificing to Jupiter and showing himself to <lb/>
            his subjects. Just as he entered the Forum, like a change <lb/>
            of wind there came a rumour that Otho was at the head of <lb/>
            the soldiers. And now, while in that vast crowd some <lb/>
            called to Galba to turn back, and some to go on, some bade <lb/>
            him be of good courage and others warned him to beware, <lb/>
            and the litter was frequently shaken and swayed to and <lb/>
            fro as if it were on a stormy sea, there suddenly appeared a <lb/>
            body of horsemen, and then some foot-soldiers, who came <lb/>
            through the basilica of Paulus, and loudly shouted to the <lb/>
            people to take “that citizen" away. The populace took to <lb/>
            their heels, but did not run away in fear, but posted them­ <lb/>
            selves on the tops of the porticoes and on the highest parts of <lb/>
            the Forum as though they were spectators at a public show. <lb/>
            The civil war was begun by Attilius Vergilio,* who tore <lb/>
            down the image of Galba which he carried on his staff, <lb/>
            and dashed it upon the ground. Many now hurled their <lb/>
            javelins at the litter; and, missing their aim at Galba <lb/>
            with these, they drew their swords and rushed upon him. <lb/>
            No one remained with him or defended him except one <lb/>
            man, the only one of all that vast multitude whom the <lb/>
            sun beheld that day acting worthilyof the Roman Empire. <lb/>
            This was a centurion named Sempronius Densus, who <lb/>
            had never received any especial favour from Galba, but <lb/>
            who, prompted merely by his own honour and fidelity, <lb/>
            stood firm in front of his litter. Raising the vine stick, <lb/>
            which is carried by centurions to correct their men, he <lb/>
            shouted aloud and ordered the men who rushed towards <lb/>
            him to spare the emperor. After this, as they tried to <lb/>
            push past him, he drew his sword and defended the <lb/>
            emperor fur a long time, until he was brought to the <lb/>
            ground by a blow under the knee,</p>
          <p>XX VII. Galba's litter was overset near the place called <lb/>
            the Lake of Curtius. As he fell to the ground, wearing a <lb/>
            corslet,† many ran upon him and stabbed him. He, <lb/>
            offering his throat to them, said “ Strike, if this be best <note type="footnote"> * We learn from Tacitus that this man was i;he standard-bearer <lb/>
            (vexillarius) of a cohort which still accompanied Galba. Tac. (Hist. <lb/>
            i. 41). </note><note type="footnote"> t Galba before leaving the palace had put on a light, quilted tunie, <lb/>
            Suet. (Galba, chi. 19). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="553"/>
            for Rome." He received many cuts in the legs and arms, <lb/>
            but the mortal blow in the throat was given, according to <lb/>
            the most common account, by one Camurius, a soldier of <lb/>
            the fifteenth legion. Some writers say that his murderer's <lb/>
            name was Terentius, some Lecanius, and some Fabius <lb/>
            Fabulus, who is said to have cut off his head and carried <lb/>
            it away wrapped in his toga, for being bald, it was difficult <lb/>
            to hold with the hands. Afterwards, as those who were <lb/>
            with him would not allow him to carry it so, but wished <lb/>
            him to display his feat of arms, he stuck it on a spear, <lb/>
            and ran along like a Bacchanal, brandishing aloft the aged <lb/>
            head of one who had been a virtuous emperor, a pontiff, <lb/>
            and a consul, often turning himself about and shaking the <lb/>
            spear, down which the blood still ran. When the head of <lb/>
            Galba was brought to Otho, he said, " This is nothing, my <lb/>
            comrades; show me the head of Piso." Before long it was <lb/>
            brought to him : for the youth had been wounded and fled, <lb/>
            but had been pursued by one Marcus who slew him near <lb/>
            the temple of Vesta. Vinius also was killed, though he <lb/>
            admitted that he had been a party to the conspiracy <lb/>
            against Galba ; for he cried out that " Otho did not mean <lb/>
            him to be killed." However, both his head and that of <lb/>
            Laco were cut off and taken to Otho, from whom the <lb/>
            bearers demanded a present. As Archilochus says, <lb/>
            “ Though there be of us a thousand, each of whom his man <lb/>
            hath slain, <lb/>
            Yet we find but corpses seven, when we come to search <lb/>
            the plain."</p>
          <p>So many who took no part in these murders neverthe­ <lb/>
            less dipped their hands and their swords in the blood and <lb/>
            showed them to Otho, and sent petitions to him asking for a <lb/>
            reward. A hundred and twenty persons were afterwards <lb/>
            discovered to have done this by the written petitions <lb/>
            which they sent to the emperor, all of whom afterwards <lb/>
            Vitellius caused to be searched for and put to death. <lb/>
            Besides these men, Marius Celsus came to the camp. <lb/>
            Many at once accused him of having incited the soldiers <lb/>
            to help Galba, and the mob clamoured for his execution. <lb/>
            Otho, however, did not wish to kill him; but as he did <lb/>
            not dare to directly oppose the soldiers, he said that he <lb/>
             <pb n="554"/>
            would not put him to death in such a hurry, for there <lb/>
            wore several questions which he wished to put to him. <lb/>
            On this pretence he ordered him to be imprisoned, and <lb/>
            entrusted him to his own most faithful followers.</p>
          <p>XX VIII. The Senate was at once called together. Just <lb/>
            as though they had become different men, or worshipped <lb/>
            different gods, the senators took the oath of fealty to <lb/>
            Otho, which Otho himself had just broken: and they <lb/>
            addressed him as Cæsar and Augustus while the headless <lb/>
            corpses, dressed in their consular robes, were still lying <lb/>
            in the Forum. As the murderers had no further use for <lb/>
            the heads, they sold that of Vinius to his daughter for <lb/>
            two thousand five hundred drachmas. Piso's head was <lb/>
            given to his wife Verania,* at her earnest entreaty; and <lb/>
            that of Galba was given to the slaves of Patrobius t and <lb/>
            Vitellius, who subjected it to every kind of indignity, and <lb/>
            at last threw it into the place which is called the Sessorium, <lb/>
            where they execute those who are put to death by the <lb/>
            emperor's orders. Galba's body was removed by Helvi­ <lb/>
            dius Priscus, with the permission of Otho: and during <lb/>
            the night it was buried by one Argius,‡ the emperor'a <lb/>
            freedman.</p>
          <p>XXIX. This was the fate of Galba, who was second to <lb/>
            few of the Romans in birth or wealth, being almost the <lb/>
            first man of his time in both. He lived through the <lb/>
            reigns of five emperors and obtained a great reputation, <lb/>
            by which more than by any power at his disposal he drove <lb/>
            out Nero: for of the many pretenders of that time some <lb/>
            were declared by all to be unfit to reign, and some of their <lb/>
            own accord withdrew their pretensions; but Galba was <lb/>
            offered the throne and accepted it, so that his mere name <lb/>
            caused the rising of Vindex, which had been regarded as <lb/>
            a mere revolt, to be called a civil war, because an emperor <lb/>
            took part in it. As therefore he considered that he had <lb/>
            not so much sought for the management of the empire as <lb/>
            be had had it pressed upon him, he thought to govern the <note type="footnote"> * She was obliged to pay for it. Tac. (Hist. i. 47). </note><note type="footnote"> t Patrobius was a freedman of Nero who had been punished by <lb/>

          <p>Though his faculties were somewhat impaired by age <lb/>
            he proved himself in all military matters a thoroughly <lb/>
            capable commander of the old school; but he put himself <lb/>
            entirely into the hands of Vinius and Laco, who, just like <lb/>
            the greedy crew that had surrounded Nero, sold every­ <lb/>
            thing in the state to the highest bidder; so that no one <lb/>
            looked back with regret to his reign, though many were <lb/>
            grieved at his death. <lb/>

          <p>THE young emperor- proceeded at daybreak to the Capitol, <lb/>
            and offered sacrifice there. Next, he ordered Marine Celsus <lb/>
            to be brought to him, and having embraced him, spoke <lb/>
            kindly to him, and invited him to forget the charge which <lb/>
            had been made against him rather than to remember his <lb/>
            acquittal. Celsus answered with dignity, yet not without <lb/>
            appreciation of Otho's kindness, that the crime laid to his <lb/>
            charge, being that of fidelity to Galba, to whom he owed <lb/>
            nothing, ought of itself to bear witness to his character. <lb/>
            By these words both Otho and Celsus were thought to <lb/>
            have done themselves equal honour, and were applauded <lb/>
            by the soldiers. After this, Otho made a mild and gracious <lb/>
            speech to the Senate. He assigned part of the time ap­ <lb/>
            pointed for his own consulship to Virginius Rufus, and <lb/>
            left in force all the other appointments to consulships <lb/>
            which had been made by Nero or Galba. He gratified <lb/>
            several persons of advanced age, or eminent in other ways, <lb/>
            by appointing them to offices in the priesthood, and restored <lb/>
            to those senators who had been banished by Nero, and had <lb/>
            returned under Galba, all of their property which had not <lb/>
            been sold. In consequence of this, many of the leading <lb/>
            men in Rome, who had at first shuddered at Otho's acces­ <lb/>
            sion, regarding him as some avenging demon who had <lb/>
            suddenly been placed upon the throne, began to look <lb/>
            much more hopefully upon a reign by which they them­ <lb/>
            selves profited.</p>
          <p>II. At the same time nothing delighted the common <lb/>
            people and reconciled them to Otho so much as his treat­ <lb/>
            ment of Tigellinus. This wretch had hitherto escaped <lb/>
            notice, for all thoughtful men considered him sufficiently <note type="footnote">* This life must be read as the sequel to that of Galba.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="557"/>
            punished already by his fear of the punishment which the <lb/>
            people demanded as a debt due to the public, and by the <lb/>
            incurable bodily diseases from which he suffered, while <lb/>
            they regarded the foul debaucheries which he still even <lb/>
            when dying continued to lust after, as a greater misery to <lb/>
            him than death itself. Yet many thought it shame that <lb/>
            he should still see the light of day, of which he had <lb/>
            deprived so many noble spirits. Otho sent a messenger <lb/>
            to the country house near Sinuessa, where Tigellinus <lb/>
            dwelt, and where several ships were always riding at <lb/>
            anchor in case he should wish to flee farther from Rome. <lb/>
            Tigellinus at first offered the messenger a vast bribe to <lb/>
            allow him to escape; and as the man refused to do so, he <lb/>
            gave him the money nevertheless, begged of him to wait <lb/>
            until he had shaved, and then, taking up a razor, cut his <lb/>
            throat.</p>
          <p>III. The emperor, though he gratified the people by <lb/>
            this well-deserved execution, yet bore no malice against <lb/>
            Any one else of his personal enemies. To please the people <lb/>
            he at first allowed them to address him at public spectacles <lb/>
            as " Nero "; and he allowed several statues of Nero to be <lb/>
            replaced in public. Claudius Rufus states that the diplo­ <lb/>
            mas,* or imperial despatches, which were sent to Spain <lb/>
            by the hands of public couriers, were inscribed with the <lb/>
            name of Nero as well as with that of Otho. However, as <lb/>
            he perceived that this practice gave offence to the first <lb/>
            and most powerful citizens, he put a stop to it. The <lb/>
            soldiers of the praetorian guard were extremely dissatisfied <lb/>
            with the moderate manner in which Otho began his reign, <lb/>
            and they warned him to be on his guard, and cut off all <lb/>
            disaffected persons, either out of a genuine anxiety for his <lb/>
            safety, or merely as a pretext for causing disturbances and <lb/>
            civil wars. One day Otho sent Crispinus to Ostia to <lb/>
            bring back the seventeenth manipulus ‡ from thence. As <lb/>
            Crispinus, while it was still dark, began to make prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for the journey, and loaded waggons with the men's <lb/>
            arms, some of the most daring soldiers openly declared <note type="footnote"> * See Life of Galba, ch. viii., note. </note><note type="footnote"> t Tac. (Hist. i. 80, 82, a. 99). </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ A body of troops, consisting of two centuriae (Polyb ii. 23, 1), <lb/>
            and consequently commanded by two centurions. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="558"/>
            that he had come with disloyal intentions, that the Senate <lb/>
            meditated a coup d'etat, and that the arms were meant to <lb/>
            be used against Otho, not for him. As many took up this <lb/>
            idea and became much excited, some seized on the waggons, <lb/>
            others killed Crispinus and their own two centurions who <lb/>
            tried to oppose them, and all, in confusion, calling upon <lb/>
            one another to come to the rescue of Cæsar, marched to <lb/>
            Rome. Hearing that Otho was entertaining eighty of the <lb/>
            senators at dinner, they rushed to the palace, exclaiming <lb/>
            that now was the time to put to death all the enemies of <lb/>
            Cæsar at one stroke. The city was panic-stricken, ex­ <lb/>
            pecting at once to be pillaged by the troops; the palace <lb/>
            was filled with confusion and alarm, and Otho himself <lb/>
            terribly perplexed as to what to do; for while he feared <lb/>
            for the safety of his guests, some of whom had brought <lb/>
            their wives to the banquet, they mistrusted him, and he <lb/>
            saw them watching his every movement in silent terror. <lb/>
            He therefore ordered the prefects of the guard to go and <lb/>
            pacify the soldiers, while at the same time he dismissed <lb/>
            his guests by another door. They were scarcely gone <lb/>
            when the soldiers burst tumultuously into the dining-hall, <lb/>
            asking what had become of the enemies of Cæsar. Otbo <lb/>
            now mounted on a couch and addressed them; and by <lb/>
            entreaties, and even by tears, at last prevailed upon them <lb/>
            to retire. On the following day, having presented every <lb/>
            soldier with twelve hundred and fifty drachmas, he entered <lb/>
            the camp, where he praised * their zeal on his behalf, and <lb/>
            begged them to join him in punishing a few whose in­ <lb/>
            trigues had made both his clemency and their own steady <lb/>
            loyalty to be questioned. As all approved, and bade him <lb/>
            do so, he, after selecting for punishment two men whose <lb/>
            fate no one could regret, left the camp.</p>
          <p>IV. Some of the soldiers believed that Otho's character <lb/>
            was really changed, and admired him for his conduct; while <lb/>
            others bethought that he was only courting popularity <lb/>
            perforce, because of the war which was impending. It <lb/>
            was indeed reported that Vitellius had already assumed <lb/>
            the imperial title and authority; and couriers were con. <lb/>
            stantly arriving with the news of some fresh accession to <lb/>
            his forces, though other messengers came who stated that <note type="footnote"> * Tacitus (Hist. i. 83, 84) gives Otho's speech at length. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="559"/>
            the troops in Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Mœsia had, with <lb/>
            their officers, declared for Otho. Soon also friendly letters <lb/>
            reached him from Mucianus and Vespasianus, the former <lb/>
            of whom was at the head of a great army in Syria, and the <lb/>
            latter in Judæa. Encouraged by these, Otho wrote to <lb/>
            Vitellius, bidding him act like a loyal soldier, and pro­ <lb/>
            mising that he would bestow on him a great sum of money <lb/>
            and a city in which he might dwell in the utmost peace <lb/>
            and happiness. Vitellius replied at first with dissimula­ <lb/>
            tion, but soon they became irritated, and overwhelmed <lb/>
            one another with abuse, which each well deserved, though <lb/>
            it was ridiculous for either of them to reproach the other <lb/>
            with vices which were common to them both.* Indeed <lb/>
            it was hard to say which of them was the more profligate <lb/>
            or the more effeminate, which had the least experience of <lb/>
            war, or which had been plunged the more deeply in debt <lb/>
            by his former poverty.</p>
          <p>At this time many prodigies t and omens were reported, <lb/>
            many of which were vague and could not be traced to any <lb/>
            trustworthy source, though all men saw the reins fall <lb/>
            from the hands of the figure of Victory in the capitol, <lb/>
            who is represented driving a chariot, as though she were <lb/>
            no longer able to hold them; and the statue of Caius ‡ <lb/>
            Cæsar, which stands upon the island in the Tiber, without <lb/>
            any wind or earthquake, was turned round, so as to face <lb/>
            east instead of west. This is said to have taken place <lb/>
            about the time when Vespasianus openly pretended to the <lb/>
            throne. Many also regarded the flooding of the Tiber as <lb/>
            an evil omen; for though it was the season of the year at <lb/>
            which rivers usually are full of water, yet it never rose so <lb/>
            high or did so much damage before; for it laid a great <lb/>
            part of the city under water, especially in the corn­ <lb/>
            market, and caused great scarcity of provisions for several <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>V. About this time news was brought to Rome that <lb/>
            Cæcina and Valens, acting as the lieutenants of Vitellius, <lb/>
            had seized the parses of the Alps. The prætorians also <lb/>
            conceived suspicions of the loyalty of Dolabella,§ a man <note type="footnote"> * Almost literally translated by Plutarch from Tacitus (Hist. i. 74) </note><note type="footnote"> t Tac. (Hist. i. 86). </note><note type="footnote">‡ Caius Julius Cæsar. </note><note type="footnote"> § Tac. (Hist. i. 86). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="560"/>
            of patrician family. Whether Otho feared him or some <lb/>
            one else is uncertain: however, he assured him of his <lb/>
            friendship, and sent him to reside at the city of Aquinum. <lb/>
            Otho now selected the officers who were to company him <lb/>
            on his campaign. Amongst these was Lucius, the brother <lb/>
            of Vitellius, whom he neither promoted nor removed <lb/>
            from the rank in the army which he held. He also took <lb/>
            especial care of the mother and wife of Vitellius, that they <lb/>
            might not have any fear for their own safety. He entrusted <lb/>
            the government of Rome to Flavius Sabinus, either because <lb/>
            he wished to show his respect for Nero (for Sabinus had <lb/>
            been appointed to this post by Nero, and had been <lb/>
            deprived of it by Galba), or because by the promotion of <lb/>
            Sabinus he declared his good will and confidence in <lb/>
            Vespasianus. He himself remained at Brixellum, a city <lb/>
            of Italy situated upon the river Padus, and sent on his <lb/>
            forces under the command of Marius Celsus, Suetonius <lb/>
            Paullinus, and of Gallus and Spurinna, who were all gene­ <lb/>
            rals of renown, but who, on account of the want of disci­ <lb/>
            pline of their troops, were unable to conduct the campaign <lb/>
            according to the plans which they had arranged. Indeed <lb/>
            the soldiers of the guard refused to obey any authority <lb/>
            except that of the emperor himself, for he alone, they <lb/>
            declared, had the right to command them. Nor were the <lb/>
            enemy's troops altogether obedient and well-behaved, but <lb/>
            the same causes rendered them also swaggering and un­ <lb/>
            trustworthy. Yet they possessed experience of actual <lb/>
            war, and were accustomed to fatigue; whereas Otho's troops <lb/>
            were weak from their life of unwarlike leisure, for they <lb/>
            spent most of their time in the theatres and at public <lb/>
            shows, or else in their quarters, and affected such a degree <lb/>
            of insolence that they refused to perform the necessary <lb/>
            labours of a campaign, alleging that to do so was beneath <lb/>
            their dignity, not that it was beyond their strength. <lb/>
            Spurinna, when he endeavoured to force them to do their <lb/>
            duty, came within a very little of losing his life. The <lb/>
            soldiers insulted him grossly, and set no bounds to their <lb/>
            language, calling him a traitor to Cæsar and the ruin of <lb/>
            his cause. Some of them actually got drunk and went to <lb/>
            Spurinna's tent at night to demand money for a journey; <lb/>
            for they said they must go and impeach him before Cæsar.</p><pb n="561"/>
            
          <p>VI. However, the cause of Otho, and Spurinna with it, <lb/>
            received some advantage from the abusive language which <lb/>
            these same soldiers met with at Placentia. Here the <lb/>
            Vitellians who were besieging the city ridiculed Otho's men <lb/>
            whom they saw on the battlements, calling them stay-at­ <lb/>
            home soldiers, sword-dancers, and spectators of games, <lb/>
            declaring that they had never seen or tasted of real war, <lb/>
            but were full of pride at having cut off the head of an <lb/>
            unarmed old man, meaning Galba, though they dared not <lb/>
            come out and fight like men. The soldiers were so <lb/>
            furiously exasperated by these reproaches that they eagerly <lb/>
            besought Spurinna to employ them in whatever service he <lb/>
            pleased, assuring him that they would not shrink from <lb/>
            any toils or dangers. When the enemy furiously assaulted <lb/>
            the walls, and brought up many battering engines,. <lb/>
            Spurinna's men won the victory, drove back their oppo­ <lb/>
            nents with great slaughter, and saved from ruin one of <lb/>
            the most famous and prosperous cities of Italy.</p>
          <p>The generals of Otho were found both by cities and by <lb/>
            individuals to be much less offensive to deal with than <lb/>
            those of Vitellius. Among the latter was Cæcina, a man <lb/>
            who neither spoke nor dressed like a citizen of Rome, but <lb/>
            was harsh and overbearing, of great stature, wearing the <lb/>
            Gaulish trousers and sleeves, and using signs t even when <lb/>
            addressing Roman magistrates. He was accompanied by <lb/>
            his wife ‡ who rode with him in a showy dress, escorted by <lb/>
            a picked body of cavalry.</p>
          <p>The other general, Fabius Valens,§ was so avaricious that <lb/>
            neither the plunder which he took from the enemy, nor yet <lb/>
            the thefts which he committed or the bribes which he <note type="footnote"> * These are more particularly described in Tac. (Hist. ii. 21). <lb/>
            t I imagine that Cæcina made himself disliked by using signs <lb/>
            Instead of speaking, not that he had forgotten his language, but because <lb/>
            he did not choose to speak to the provincial magistrates. Tacitus <lb/>
            (Hist. ii. 20) says that he conducted himself modestly while in Italy. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ We learn from Tacitus (Hist. ii. 20) that her name was Salonina. <lb/>

            of plunder and conflagration." Merivale (History of the Romans, <lb/>

            received from the allied states could satiate him ; and he <lb/>
            was even suspected of having been too late for the first <lb/>
            battle of the war because he delayed his march to amass <lb/>
            wealth for himself. Others blame Cæcina, because in his <lb/>
            haste to win a victory before Valens came up, he, besides <lb/>
            other blunders of less consequence, began a battle so <lb/>
            unseasonably and conducted it so remissly that he very <lb/>
            nearly brought the cause of Vitellius to ruin.</p>
          <p>VII. After Ceecina's repulse at Placentia he proceeded <lb/>
            to Cremona, another large and flourishing city. Mean­ <lb/>
            while Annius Gallus, who was on his way to Placentia to <lb/>
            reinforce Spurinna, hearing while on the march that the <lb/>
            troops at Placentia had been victorious, but that Cremona <lb/>
            was in danger, changed the direction of his march towards <lb/>
            that place, and encamped close to the enemy. Here Cæcina <lb/>
            concealed many foot-soldiers in rough and wooded ground <lb/>
            ordering his cavalry to ride forward and, if they fell in <lb/>
            with the enemy, to retire little by little so as to draw <lb/>
            them into the ambuscade. This plan was betrayed to <lb/>
            Celsus by deserters. Celsus attacked them with the best <lb/>
            of his cavalry, pursued them with caution, taking care to <lb/>
            avoid the ambuscade, and then surrounded the troops in <lb/>
            ambush, and threw them into confusion. He now sent <lb/>
            for his infantry from the camp: and it was thought that <lb/>
            if they had come up promptly after the cavalry, the whole <lb/>
            army of Cæcina might have been destroyed; but as it <lb/>
            was, Paullinus brought them up slowly and too late, and <lb/>
            tarnished his glory as a general by overcaution. The mass <lb/>
            of the soldiers charged him with treason, and tried to <lb/>
            exasperate Otho against him by boasting that they had <lb/>
            won the victory, but that their success was not followed <lb/>
            up owing to the cowardice of their generals. Otho, though <lb/>
            he did not believe their accusations, yet feared to be thought <lb/>
            to disbelieve them. He accordingly sent his brother <lb/>
            Titianus to the army, and with him Julius Proculus, the <lb/>
            prefect of the prætorians, who virtually had the supreme <note type="footnote"> * Tacitus (Hist.. i. 87) describes Julius Proculus as active in the <lb/>
            discharge of his duties at Rome, but ignorant of real war. He was, <lb/>
            Tacitus adds, a knave and a villain, who got himself preferred before <lb/>
            honest men by the unscrupulous accusations which he brought against <lb/>
            them. </note> <lb/>

            command, though Titianus was the nominal chief, while <lb/>
            Celsus and Paullinus were given the titles of counsellors <lb/>
            and friends, but were not allowed the least real power or <lb/>
            authority.</p>
          <p>The enemy also showed want of discipline, especially in <lb/>
            the army of Valens. These men, when they heard of the <lb/>
            ambuscade and the defeat to which it had led, were greatly <lb/>
            enraged at not having been there in time to prevent so <lb/>
            great a slaughter of their friends. Valens * was forced <lb/>
            to beg for his life; for the soldiers were preparing to stone <lb/>
            him. He pacified them with difficulty, and led them to <lb/>
            join the forces of Cæcina.</p>
          <p>VIII. When Otho arrived at the camp at Bedriacum, t <lb/>
            which is a village near Cremona, he held a council of war. <lb/>
            Proculus and Titianus were of opinon that, as the troops <lb/>
            were full of confidence and flushed with victory, it would <lb/>
            be best to fight a decisive battle at once, and not blunt <lb/>
            their spirit by delay, which would also bring Vitellius <lb/>
            down upon them from Gaul. On the other hand Paullinus <lb/>
            argued that the enemy had already collected their entire <lb/>
            available force, whereas Otho might expect another army <lb/>
            as large as his present one to join him from Mcesia and <lb/>
            Pannonia, if he would only wait until it suited him to <lb/>
            fight, and not play into the hands of the enemy by engaging <lb/>
            prematurely. The troops, he said, after being so largely <lb/>
            reinforced, would be no less confident than at present, <lb/>
            when they are but few ; indeed, they would fight with a <lb/>
            great superiority of numbers. Besides this, delay would <lb/>
            be all in their favour, as they had abundance of supplies, <lb/>
            while the opponents, who were in an enemy's country, <lb/>
            would soon be reduced to great straits by the want of pro­ <lb/>
            visions. Marius Celsus agreed with the views of Paullinus. <lb/>
            Annius Callus was not present at the council, having <lb/>
            been disabled by a fall from his horse: but when Otho <lb/>
            wrote a letter to him, asking his opinion, he advised the <lb/>
            emperor not to be hasty, but to await the arrival of the <note type="footnote"> * Tac. Hist. ii so. </note><note type="footnote"> t Tacitus, (Hist. ii. 39) says that Otho was not present, but sent <lb/>
            letters to the generals urging them to make haste. He adds that it <lb/>
            is not so easy to decide what ought to have been done as to condemn <lb/>
            what was actually done. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 O 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="564"/>
            legions which were already on their way from Moesia. <lb/>
            However Otho was not convinced by these arguments, but <lb/>
            agreed with those who urged him to fight at once.</p>
          <p>IX. Many other reasons for this decision are given by <lb/>
            various writers, and it is evident that the prætorians, or <lb/>
            bodyguard of the emperor, who now for the first time had <lb/>
            experience of actual warfare, were eager to return to their <lb/>
            old haunts at Rome, and the unwarlike pleasures of the <lb/>
            theatre and the circus, and that their eagerness for battle <lb/>
            could not be restrained, as they imagined that they would <lb/>
            overthrow their antagonists at the first onset. It seems, <lb/>
            too, that Otho himself could no longer endure the un­ <lb/>
            certainty of his position, for his ignorance of war and his <lb/>
            life of enervating luxury had unfitted him for a calm <lb/>
            calculation of his chances of success, and, worn out as he <lb/>
            was with anxiety, he longed to let the matter be settled <lb/>
            whichever way chance might determine, like a man who <lb/>
            covers his face through dizziness at looking over a precipice. <lb/>
            This is the account which is given by the orator Secundus, <lb/>
            who acted as private secretary to Otho. Other * authorities <lb/>
            relate that many efforts were made by the soldiers of both <lb/>
            armies to combine, and agree to elect an emperor from <lb/>
            among their own officers: or, if this proved impossible, to <lb/>
            place the election in the hands of the senate. It seems <lb/>
            indeed rightly probable, considering the ill-repute of both <lb/>
            claimants of the throne, that the more sedate and thought­ <lb/>
            ful of the soldiers should have reflected that it would be a <lb/>
            horrible and shameful thing that the Romans should be <lb/>
            made to suffer for a second time all the miseries which <lb/>
            they had once endured in the civil wars of Bulla and of <lb/>
            Marius and of Caesar and Pompeius, merely in order to pro­ <lb/>
            vide an empire to bear the charges of the gluttony and <lb/>
            drunkenness of Vitellius, or of the luxury and profligacy of <lb/>
            Otho. It is suspected that Marius Celsus, knowing that <lb/>
            this feeling was gaining ground, endeavoured to gain time, <lb/>
            hoping that the whole matter might be decided with­ <lb/>
            out fighting; and that Otho, fearing this, hurried on an <lb/>
            engagement.</p>
          <p>X. After the council Otho again retired to Brixellum. <lb/>
            This was a mistake, not only because the army would <note type="footnote"> * Tac. (Hist. ii. 37). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="565"/>
            have fought with greater zeal and discipline when under <lb/>
            the eye of the emperor, but because by taking away the <lb/>
            best and most loyal troops, both of cavalry and infantry, <lb/>
            to act as his bodyguard, he made his army like a spear <lb/>
            which has lost its steel point. At this time a battle took <lb/>
            place on the bank of the Padua, across which Cæcina en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to throw a bridge, while the Othonians tried <lb/>
            to prevent him from doing so. As they did not succeed" <lb/>
            in this, they threw lighted sulphur and pitch into the <lb/>
            boats which formed the bridge, and a wind suddenly <lb/>
            springing up carried the fire across the stream towards the <lb/>
            enemy. At first volumes of smoke, and then a mass of <lb/>
            flames burst out, so that the enemy were thrown into <lb/>
            confusion and forced to leap from the bridge into the <lb/>
            river, upsetting the boats and exposing themselves to the <lb/>
            missiles and the ridicule of the enemy. However, the <lb/>
            Germans were victorious in a fight with Otho's corps of <lb/>
            gladiators for the possession of an island in the river, and <lb/>
            slew many of them.</p>
          <p>XL As, after this, the soldiers in Otho's camp at Bed­ <lb/>
            riacum were frantically eager for battle, Proculus led <lb/>
            them forward about six miles from that place and en­ <lb/>
            camped in such an ignorant and ridiculous fashion that the <lb/>
            men suffered from want of water, although it was spring <lb/>
            time, and all the surrounding country was full of springs <lb/>
            and perennial streams. On the next day he wished to <lb/>
            lead them at least twelve miles nearer the enemy, but <lb/>
            Suetonius Paullinus would not allow him to do so, think­ <lb/>
            ing that the soldiers ought to have some rest, and not <lb/>
            first be fatigued with a long march, and then while they <lb/>
            were confusedly mixed up with baggage animals and <lb/>
            campfollowers, be brought to fight against an enemy who <lb/>
            could quietly and deliberately place themselves in order <lb/>
            of battle. While the generals were at variance, one of <lb/>
            the horsemen called Numidians rode up bearing a letter <lb/>
            from Otho, in which he ordered them not to waste any <lb/>
            time, but to march against the enemy at once. On <lb/>
            receiving this they started. Cæcina, hearing of their <lb/>
            march, was much disquieted, abandoned his operations <lb/>
            by the river, and proceeded to the camp. Here after <lb/>
            Valens had got the men under arms, and had given them <lb/>
             <pb n="566"/>
            the watchword, he sent forward the best of the cavalry <lb/>
            while the legions were taking up their respective posi­ <lb/>
            tions in the line of battle.</p>
          <p>XII. For some reason or other the men of Otho's <lb/>
            vanguard conceived an idea that the generals of Vitellius <lb/>
            intended to desert to their side : and so, when they came <lb/>
            near to one another, they saluted the Vitellians and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them as friends and comrades. As the Vitellians <lb/>
            made an angry and fierce response, the Othonians were <lb/>
            discouraged, while their opponents imagined that they in­ <lb/>
            tended to desert. This incident at the first onset caused <lb/>
            some confusion among the troops of Otho: and, besides <lb/>
            this, everything was in disorder, for the baggage train <lb/>
            was entangled among the ranks, and the line was broken <lb/>
            in many places by the ditches and trenches with which <lb/>
            the ground was intersected, so that the soldiers, in trying <lb/>
            to avoid these obstacles, were forced to attack in detail, and <lb/>
            in disorganised crowds. Two. legions alone, that named <lb/>
            “ Rapax " on the side of Vitellius, and “ Adjutrix" on <lb/>
            that of Otho, were able to find a level plain, upon which <lb/>
            they deployed into a regular line of battle and fought front <lb/>
            to front for a long time. Otho's soldiers were active and <lb/>
            brave, but had never been in action before, while those of <lb/>
            Vitellius had fought many battles, but were somewhat <lb/>
            elderly and past their prime. At the first charge the <lb/>
            Othonians drove them back, and captured their eagle, <lb/>
            killing almost every man in the front rank ; but the <lb/>
            Vitellians, filled with shame and rage, charged in their <lb/>
            turn, slew Orfidius, the legate in command of the legion, <lb/>
            and took many standards. The corps of gladiators, who <lb/>
            were supposed to possess both courage and practice in close <lb/>
            combat, were attacked by Alphenus Varus with the <lb/>
            Batavians, who inhabit an island formed by the river <lb/>
            Rhine, and who are the best horsemen in Germany. <lb/>
            Few of the gladiators stood to receive their charge, but <lb/>
            most of them fled towards the river, where they fell in <lb/>
            with other bodies of the enemy, by whom they were en­ <lb/>
            tirely cut to pieces. The worst fight of all was made by <lb/>
            the Prætorians, who did not even wait until the enemy <note type="footnote"> * Tac. (Hist. ii. 43). The legions were the 21st “ Rapax,” and the <lb/>
            Ist " Adjutrix.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="567"/>
            reached them, but by their panic flight struck terror even <lb/>
            into the unbroken troops through whose ranks they fled. <lb/>
            Yet many of Otho's troops, after having conquered their <lb/>
            immediate opponents, forced their way back through their <lb/>
            victorious enemies to their own camp.</p>
          <p>XIII. Of the generals, neither Proculus nor Paullinus <lb/>
            dared to return with their men, but went off another way, <lb/>
            fearing the soldiers, who already began to throw the blame <lb/>
            of their defeat upon the generals. Annius Gallus assumed <lb/>
            the command of the soldiers as they assembled in the town <lb/>
            of Bedriacum, and encouraged them by assurances that <lb/>
            the battle had been a drawn one, and that in many cases <lb/>
            they had beaten the enemy. Marius Celsus called a meet­ <lb/>
            ing of the generals, and bade them take measures for the <lb/>
            common good. He said that after so great a disaster and <lb/>
            so much slaughter of their countrymen not even Otho him­ <lb/>
            self, if he were a right-thinking man, would wish to make <lb/>
            any further trial of fortune ; since even Cato and Scipio, <lb/>
            although they fought in defence of the liberty of Rome, <lb/>
            were blamed for having wasted the lives of many brave <lb/>
            men in Africa, by not yielding to Cæsar immediately after <lb/>
            the battle of Pharsalia. All men, he urged, are equally <lb/>
            liable to the caprices of fortune; but they have the advan­ <lb/>
            tage, even when defeated, of being able to form wise resolu­ <lb/>
            tions. By this reasoning Celsus convinced the generals: and <lb/>
            when, on trying the temper of the soldiers, they found them <lb/>
            desirous of peace, and Titianus himself bade them begin <lb/>
            negotiations for agreement, Celsus and Gallus determined <lb/>
            to go and discuss the matter with Cæcina and Valens. On <lb/>
            their way they were met by some centurions, who informed <lb/>
            them that Vitellius's army was already advancing, and <lb/>
            that they had been sent on before by their generals to <lb/>
            arrange terms of peace. Celsus spoke with approval of <lb/>
            their mission, and bade them return and conduct him to <lb/>
            Cæcina. It happened that when they drew near the army, <lb/>
            Celsus was like to have lost his life: for the cavalry who <lb/>
            formed the advance guard were the same who had been de­ <lb/>
            feated in the ambuscade, and when they saw Celsus ap­ <lb/>
            proaching, they set up a shout of rage and rode towards him. <lb/>
            However the centurions stood before Celsus and kept them <lb/>
            back; and as the other officers called to them to spare him <lb/>
             <pb n="568"/>
            Cæcina perceived that some disturbance was taking place <lb/>
            and rode up. He quickly repressed the disorderly move­ <lb/>
            ment of the cavalry, greeted Celsus affectionately, and <lb/>
            proceeded with him to Bedriacum. Meanwhile Titianus <lb/>
            had repented of having sent the embassy. He manned the <lb/>
            walls of the camp with those soldiers who had recovered <lb/>
            their spirits, and was encouraging the rest to fight. How­ <lb/>
            ever, when Cæcina rode up and held out his hand no one <lb/>
            resisted him, but some of the soldiers greeted his troops <lb/>
            from the walls, and others opened the gates, came out and <lb/>
            mingled with the new-comers. No violence was done to <lb/>
            any one, but they all fraternised and shook each other <lb/>
            by the hand, swore fealty to Vitellius and joined his <lb/>
            army.</p>
          <p>XIV. The above is the account which most eye-witnesses <lb/>
            give of the battle, though they themselves admit that they <lb/>
            do not know all the details of it because of the confusion <lb/>
            which prevailed and the irregularity of the ground. Some <lb/>
            time afterwards when I was journeying across the battle­ <lb/>
            field, Mestrius Florus, a man of consular rank, who had <lb/>
            fought under Otho not from choice but from necessity, <lb/>
            showed me an ancient temple, and related that after the <lb/>
            battle he came there and saw so huge a pile of corpses, that <lb/>
            those on the top were level with the pinnacles of the roof. <lb/>
            He said that he could not discover himself or learn from <lb/>
            any one else the cause of this heap ; for though a greater <lb/>
            slaughter of the vanquished is made in civil wars than in <lb/>
            any others, because no quarter is given, as no use can be <lb/>
            made of prisoners, yet it was hard to imagine how <lb/>
            such a mass of carcasses came to be piled together on <lb/>
            that spot.</p>
          <p>XV. Otho, as is usual in such cases, first heard only <lb/>
            confused rumours of how the battle went. When how­ <lb/>
            ever wounded men came from the scene of action bringing <lb/>
            the news of the defeat, not only his friends, as might be <lb/>
            expected, bade him keep up his spirits and not despair, <lb/>
            but his soldiers were wonderfully affected. None of them <lb/>
            left him, or deserted to the enemy, and no one consulted <lb/>
            his own safety when his chief despaired of his. All of <lb/>
            them alike repaired to his quarters, and called him their <lb/>
            emperor. When he came out to them, they fell at his feet <lb/>
             <pb n="569"/>
            and caught hold of his hands with shouts, and prayers, <lb/>
            and tears, beseeching him not to desert them, or betray <lb/>
            them to the enemy, but to make use of them to fight for <lb/>
            him, body and soul, until their last breath. While all <lb/>
            besought him thus, one of the common soldiers drew his <lb/>
            sword, and crying, “ Cæsar, this is what we are all <lb/>
            prepared to do for you," stabbed himself. Otho, unmoved <lb/>
            by any of these entreaties, gazed round upon them all <lb/>
            with a calm and composed countenance, and said: " My <lb/>
            comrades, your noble conduct and your loyal devotion <lb/>
            make this a happier day to me than that on which you <lb/>
            elected me your emperor. Yet do not deprive me of the <lb/>
            etill greater happiness of dying for so many and such <lb/>
            noble friends. If I am worthy to be an emperor of Rome, <lb/>
            I ought not to grudge my life to my country. I am aware <lb/>
            that our enemy's victory is not decisive or crushing. <lb/>
            News has reached me that the Mcesian legions have <lb/>
            already reached the Adriatic, and are not many days' <lb/>
            march distant. Asia, Syria, Egypt, and the army en­ <lb/>
            gaged with the Jews are all on our side, while we have in <lb/>
            our power both the senate, and the wives and children <lb/>
            of our enemy. But we are not defending Italy from <lb/>
            Hannibal, or Pyrrhus, or the Cimbri, but Romans are <lb/>
            fighting against Romans, and our native land will suffer <lb/>
            equally whichever side is victorious, for she must lose <lb/>
            what the conqueror gains. Believe me, I pray you, <lb/>
            that it is more to my honour to die than to reign: for I <lb/>
            cannot imagine that if victorious I could do anything <lb/>
            which would benefit the Romans so much as I can by <lb/>
            giving my life to obtain peace and concord, and to save <lb/>
            Italy from seeing another day such as this."</p>
          <p>XVI. After speaking thus, he tore himself away from <lb/>
            the soldiers, who tried to hold him back and bade him <lb/>
            take courage. He ordered his friends and such senators <lb/>
            as were present to leave his camp: and to those who were <lb/>
            not present he sent similar orders, and also rescripts tc <lb/>
            the magistrates of the cities through which they would <lb/>
            have to pass, that they might accomplish their journey * <lb/>
            with honour and in safety. He next sent for his nephew <lb/>
            Cocceius, who was still a youth, and bade him be of good <note type="footnote"> * Their journey was, DO doubt, back to Rome. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="570"/>
            cheer and not fear Vitellius, whose mother, children, and <lb/>
            wife he himself had protected as carefully as if they had <lb/>
            been members of his own family. He had wished, he said, <lb/>
            to adopt the boy as his heir, but had put off doing so till the <lb/>
            end of the war, meaning to make him his colleague if he <lb/>
            succeeded, but not wishing to involve him in his own <lb/>
            destruction if he failed. " My last charge to you," he <lb/>
            continued, “ is that you neither forget altogether nor yet <lb/>
            remember too well that you have had a Cæsar for your <lb/>
            uncle." Shortly after this interview Otho heard a <lb/>
            shouting and disturbance outside his quarters ; for the <lb/>
            senators were preparing to depart, and the soldiers were <lb/>
            threatening to murder them if they did so, and reproached <lb/>
            them with deserting their emperor. Otho, who feared <lb/>
            for their lives, now came out a second time, no longer in <lb/>
            a mild and supplicatory manner, but, frowning savagely, <lb/>
            he cast so terrible a look upon the most turbulent of the <lb/>
            rioters that they shrank away terrified and abashed.</p>
          <p>XVII. Towards evening he became thirsty, and drank <lb/>
            a little water: after which he spent a long time in ex­ <lb/>
            amining the blades of two swords. At last he rejected one <lb/>
            of them, and hid the other in his clothes. He now called <lb/>
            together his servants, and distributed his money amongst <lb/>
            them, not recklessly, as though he were dealing with <lb/>
            property not his own, but giving them each various sums, <lb/>
            carefully apportioned according to each man's deserts. <lb/>
            When he sent them away he rested for the remainder of <lb/>
            the night, and those about his bed-chamber noticed how <lb/>
            soundly he slept. At daybreak he called to a freedman <lb/>
            who had been entrusted with the management of the de­ <lb/>
            parture of the senators, and ordered him to learn what <lb/>
            had happened to them. When he was told that they had <lb/>
            left the camp, and had received every attention they could <lb/>
            wish, he said, " Go now, and show yourself to the soldiers <lb/>
            unless you wish to perish miserably at their hands; for <lb/>
            they will suspect you of having assisted me to die." <lb/>
            When this man was gone, Otho held the sword upright <lb/>
            with both his hands and fell upon it, dying with only one <lb/>
            groan, which apprised those without of his fate. The <lb/>
            wailing of his slaves was taken up by the whole of the <lb/>
            camp and city. The soldiers noisily forced their way into <lb/>
             <pb n="571"/>
            his quarters and lamented over him with bitter grief, re­ <lb/>
            preaching themselves for not having guarded their emperor, <lb/>
            and prevented his dying for them. None of Otho's body­ <lb/>
            guard deserted him, although the enemy was drawing <lb/>
            near, but after laying out his body, and erecting a funeral <lb/>
            pile, they bore him to it, armed at all points; and happy <lb/>
            was the man who could find a place among the bearers. <lb/>
            Of the rest, some kissed his wounds, some pressed his hands, <lb/>
            and some, who could not come near him, knelt as his body <lb/>
            passed by them. Some, who had received no especial <lb/>
            favours from Otho, and had nothing to fear from his suc­ <lb/>
            cessor, slew themselves after they had applied the torch to <lb/>
            his funeral pile. It seems, indeed, that no king or despot <lb/>
            ever was possessed with so frantic a desire to rule, as these <lb/>
            men had to be ruled by Otho and to serve him ; for their <lb/>
            love for him did not cease with his life, but remained im­ <lb/>
            planted in their breasts, causing them to regard Vitellius <lb/>
            with the bitterest hatred. Of what followed from this I <lb/>
            shall give an account in its proper place.</p>
          <p>XVIII. After the remains of Otho were buried they <lb/>
            erected over him a tomb which could offend no one either <lb/>
            by its size or by the pomp of its inscription. When I was <lb/>
            at Brixellum I myself saw a small monument on which <lb/>
            was written in the Latin language " In memory of Marcus <lb/>
            Otho.”</p>
          <p>Otho died in his thirty-seventh year, after a reign of three <lb/>
            months. Many good men, though they blamed his life, yet <lb/>
            could not refrain from admiring his death; for though his <lb/>
            life had been no better than that of Nero, his end was a <lb/>
            far nobler one. When he was dead, Pollio, one of the two <lb/>
            prefects, offended the soldiers by requiring them at once <lb/>
            to swear fealty to Vitellius. Some of the senators were <lb/>
            still left in Brixellum; and the soldiers, hearing of this, <lb/>
            let them go with the exception of Virginius Rufus, whom <lb/>
            they greatly embarrassed by coming to his house under <lb/>
            arms, and bidding him either take the command of them or <lb/>
            at any rate act as ambassador on their behalf. Virginius, <lb/>
            who had refused the crown when it was offered him by <lb/>
            a victorious army, thought that it would be the act of a <lb/>
            madman to accept it from a beaten one. He feared, also, <lb/>
            to go as an ambassador to the Germans, who thought that <lb/>
             <pb n="572"/>
            in time post he had forced them to do many things against <lb/>
            their will. Accordingly, he escaped from his house by a <lb/>
            back door; and the soldiers, when they discovered that he <lb/>
            was gone, took the oaths to the new emperor. They were <lb/>
            pardoned by him, and were sent to serve with the troops <lb/>
            under the command of Cæcina.</p><pb n="573"/>
