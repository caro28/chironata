          <p>MADAM, <lb/>
            I <lb/>
            BEG leave to return all imagin­ <lb/>
            able thanks to your Ladyship, <lb/>
            for permitting me to adorn, with <lb/>
            your illuftrious name, the enduing <lb/>
            translation, made by two young per­ <lb/>
            sons, whole happinefs is of infinite <lb/>
            concern to me; and who present <note type="footnote"> A3 </note> <lb/>

             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            their most humble duty, and most <lb/>
            profound respects to your Ladyship.</p>
          <p>I was particularly encouraged to <lb/>
            request this great honour, from a <lb/>
            reflection, that your noble progeni­ <lb/>
            tors, while they fignalized them­ <lb/>
            felves, both in the cabinet and in <lb/>
            the field, indulged the most ge­ <lb/>
            nerous protection to the Mufes. On <lb/>
            this occafion, the late Dutchefs of <lb/>
            Somerset, your Ladyship's mo­ <lb/>
            ther, shines with peculiar lustre: Her <lb/>
            Grace having been not only a most <lb/>
            bountiful patroness to every genius: <lb/>
            But alfo infpiring them to excel, <lb/>
            by <lb/>
            <pb n="-"/>
             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            by the models she herfelf produced <lb/>
            for their imitation.</p>
          <p>The Greek original was written <lb/>
            a great many centuries ago, and <lb/>
            found but of late years. Being an <lb/>
            elegant performance, it is prefumed <lb/>
            that it may prove a subject of cu­ <lb/>
            riofity to people of taRe; and give <lb/>
            them as much pleasure, as would <lb/>
            the discovery of a beautiful antique <lb/>
            flatue, or a groop of figure. It is <lb/>
            well known, that the Greeks are <lb/>
            the most perfect fources, of all <lb/>
            things great and excellent, in every <note type="footnote"> A 4 </note> <lb/>

            Species of literature, and the polite <lb/>
            arts.</p>
          <p>The word ROMANCE, is apt to <lb/>
            prejudice many againft all works <lb/>
            under that title; as supposing them <lb/>
            to be a meer rhapfody of incredible <lb/>
            events; treating of puerile loves, and <lb/>
            written in an inflated and unna­ <lb/>
            tural style. But the present offering <lb/>
            has much the appearance of a true <lb/>
            story; it containing a great variety of <lb/>
            incidents, all well prepared ; and <lb/>
            very artfully interwoven; with scarce <lb/>
            any thing improbable or improper; <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            <pb n="-"/>
             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            and the whole drawn up with a gra­ <lb/>
            vity of ftile becoming an hiftorian. <lb/>
            Chæreas and Callirrhoe are extreme­ <lb/>
            ly unfortunate, but then they are <lb/>
            virtuous : Circumftances which muft <lb/>
            endear their characters to a perfon of <lb/>
            the COUNTESS of NORTHUMBER­ <lb/>
            LAND'S distinguished humanity.</p>
          <p>Your Ladyship, after having add­ <lb/>
            ed radiance to a court, and been <lb/>
            the delight of one kingdom, will <lb/>
            loon accompany your noble LORD <lb/>
            to another: the government where­ <lb/>
            of, our gracious SOVEREIGN <lb/>
            has conferred on him; and thereby <lb/>

            rious an opportunity now offers, for <lb/>
            his EXCELLENCY to immortalize <lb/>
            himfelf; by continuing the exercife <lb/>
            of the moft exalted of all passions, <lb/>
            (a passion fo familiar to him) that of <lb/>
            DOING GOOD! How vastly <lb/>
            extensive will be his circle on that <lb/>
            auguft occasion ! Methinks I hear <lb/>
            the people of Ireland blessing his <lb/>
            delegated fway; and praying, that <lb/>
            he might preside over them, for ever. <lb/>
            But as this would be impossible, me­ <lb/>

            H E loves of Chæreas and Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe, by Chariton of Aphrodifios, <lb/>
            being one of the few Greek romances <lb/>
            which have escaped the injuries of time; <lb/>
            are thought to be no inconfiderable ac­ <lb/>
            quifition to the republic of letters.</p>
          <p>The original Greek manuscript, fup­ <lb/>
            pored to be transcribed in the thirteenth <lb/>
            century, was found in the celebrated <lb/>
            abbey at Florence; intermixed with <lb/>
            twenty-two other pieces by various <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            authors <lb/>
            <pb n="-"/>
             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            authors; among which are Achilles <lb/>
            Tatius, Longus, Xenophon Ephefius, <lb/>
            and Æsop's Fables. The subjects of the <lb/>
            other treatifes relate to the chrifcian re­ <lb/>
            ligion, or to the Byzantine hiflorians. <lb/>
            It was imagined, that another manu­ <lb/>
            fcript of Chariton was lodged in the <lb/>
            Vatican Library; but, after the moft <lb/>
            strict Search, no fuch copy could be <lb/>
            found. Many perfons of great erudi­ <lb/>
            tion, particularly Father Montfaucon, <lb/>
            and Mr. Burmann, were vastly defirous <lb/>
            of feeing this work in print ; and ufed <lb/>
            their utmost endeavours to promote an <lb/>
            edition of it, but without fuccefs.</p>
          <p>But about forty years fince, Salvini <lb/>
            and Cocchi, whose literary productions <lb/>
            reflect great honour on their native coun­ <lb/>
            try, transcribed very accurately, in the <lb/>
            above- <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>

             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            above-mentioned abbey, the Greek ma­ <lb/>
            nufcript of Chariton, with an intent to <lb/>
            publifh it: a merit, however, that was <lb/>
            reserved for the very learned Mr. D'Or­ <lb/>
            ville of Amsterdam.</p>
          <p>For that gentleman, after having <lb/>
            visited England and France, travelled <lb/>
            into Italy ; and getting acquainted in <lb/>
            Florence, with the above-mentioned <lb/>
            Dr. Cocchi; this latter, with the hu­ <lb/>
            manity and politeness which throw a <lb/>
            lustre round the fcho;ar, not only showed <lb/>
            him the copy he had taken of Chari­ <lb/>
            ton, with his own curious obfervations, <lb/>
            and thole of Salvini upon it; but de­ <lb/>
            livered all thefe pieces into his hand?, <lb/>
            with full liberty for him to publish the <lb/>
            whole. <lb/>
            Mr. <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
             </p>
          <p>Mr. D'Orville carrying thefe Several <lb/>
            pieces to Holland, was obliged, through <lb/>
            a multiplicity of affairs, to fufpend in a <lb/>
            great meafure, during fome years, his <lb/>
            defign of preparing Chariton for the <lb/>
            prefs. But eighteen years ago, he fet <lb/>
            ferioufly about it, and pursued his tafk <lb/>
            with vail: application. Afterwards Mr. <lb/>
            Reiskius, Arabic professor in Leipfic, <lb/>
            and an intimate friend of Mr. D'Or­ <lb/>
            ville, favoured him with a Latin tranfla­ <lb/>
            tion of Chariton, with many curious <lb/>
            emendations and conjectures: all which, <lb/>
            with the Greek original, and a furpriz­ <lb/>
            ing variety of learned notes, by Mr. <lb/>
            D'Orville, were published by him, in <lb/>
            a very fair and voluminous quarto at <lb/>
            Amsterdam, anno 1750. That work <lb/>
            is dedicated to the late Prince of Orange, <lb/>
            whofe <lb/>
            <pb n="-"/>
             <lb/>
            <lb/>
            whose most amiable disposition, and <lb/>
            great love of learning and learned men, <lb/>
            are well-known. The munificence of <lb/>
            that Prince, gave Mr. D'Orville leisure <lb/>
            to pursue, with eafe and chearfulness, <lb/>
            his literary toils; for which he discovers <lb/>
            the deepeft fenfe of gratitude, in his <lb/>
            Dedication to that excellent Prince.— <lb/>
            Thus far as to the manuscript.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Author, we find <lb/>
            no traces concerning him among the <lb/>
            antients, and he is but transiently men­ <lb/>
            tioned by writers fince the revival of <lb/>
            letters. It is probable, that he was <lb/>
            born in Aphrodifios, a city of Caria, <lb/>
            famous for the worship of Venus, and <lb/>
            in which learning and the polite arts <lb/>
            flourifhed considerably; except we are <lb/>
            to fuppofe, that Chariton feigned both <note type="footnote"> VOL. Is </note><note type="footnote">a </note> <lb/>
            his <lb/>
            <pb n="-"/>
             his name and his country, to accom­ <lb/>
            modate them to the subject of his work; <lb/>
            and to give it the greater air of a true <lb/>
            history, which seems to have been his <lb/>
            view in every part of it. He stiles him­ <lb/>
            felf Amanuenfis to Athenagoras, which <lb/>
            employment, though a Servile one among <lb/>
            the Romans, was honourable in fome <lb/>
            countries. Nicholas Damafcenus, who <lb/>
            wrote many orations, and went on feveral <lb/>
            embassies from Herod, was called Ama­ <lb/>
            nuenfis to that Jewifh Prince.</p>
          <p>Chariton teems to be posterior to <lb/>
            Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, Longus, <lb/>
            and Xenophon Ephefius. He proba­ <lb/>
            bly lived about the beginning of the <lb/>
            fifth century, and under the Chrif­ <lb/>
            tian Emperors : but whether he himfelf <lb/>
            professed the Christian Faith is uncer­ <lb/>
            tain. <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
            <lb/>
            tain. It appears, however, from some <lb/>
            passages in his book, that he had feen <lb/>
            the Sacred writings. We muft not in­ <lb/>
            fer that he was a heathen, becaufe he <lb/>
            makes great ufe of the pagan mythology, <lb/>
            fince the texture of his story required <lb/>
            him to have frequent recourse to it.</p>
          <p>With respect to the work, the inci­ <lb/>
            dents in it are fuppofed to have hap­ <lb/>
            pened about four hundred years before <lb/>
            the birth of Chrift. The diction of <lb/>
            Chariton is singular, and lets pure than <lb/>
            thofe of Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, <lb/>

            there is Scarce a phrafe in Chariton, <lb/>

            diction is less florid than thofe of <lb/>
            the above-mentioned authors; owing <lb/>
            probably to his defire of appearing <lb/>
            every where like an hiftorian, as was <lb/>
            hinted. But he cannot be too much <lb/>
            applauded for the charity of his pen <lb/>

            be ascribed to the licentioufnefs of the <lb/>
            times they lived in. Most of the <lb/>
            above particulars are from the Latin <lb/>
            Preface and the Notes to Chariton, by <lb/>
            Mr. D'Orville, whose lucubrations on <lb/>

            to the Princefs of Sulmona. It was <lb/>
            afterwards compared with Mr. Reifkius's <lb/>

            by name; a wonderful maiden, and the or- <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>

            nament of all Sicily. Her exquifite beauty <lb/>
            did not referable that of a mortal, of a Ne­ <lb/>
            reid, or of a mountain-nymph; but ibone <lb/>
            lovely as that of Venus, when in her virgin <lb/>
            state. The fame of Callirrhoe's peerless <lb/>
            charms fpread far around; fo that not only <lb/>
            the fons of many Sicilian princes, as well as <lb/>
            private gentlemen; but also a multitude of <lb/>
            others, from Italy, Epirus, and from all the <lb/>
            adjacent iflands, came to pay their court to <lb/>
            her. The God of love having assembled <lb/>
            thefe fuitors, gave here a fignal proof of his <lb/>
            mighty power : for there was a moft engaging <lb/>
            youth, named Chæreas, who, as Achilles is <lb/>
            described in Homer, or, like Alcibiades, <lb/>
            surpassed all other men in beauty. Ariston, <lb/>
            his father, was next in rank at Syracufe to <lb/>
            Hermocrates. 'An obstinate hatred, arising <lb/>
            from the administration of affairs, had long <lb/>
            fobfifted between them; whence they opposed <lb/>
            cach other on every occasion, both- public and <lb/>
            pri­ <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            private. Cupid, who delights in novelty; <lb/>
            and whore greater pleasure is the working of <lb/>
            miracles, fought for an opportunity like to <lb/>
            that which follows. It was the festival of Ve­ <lb/>
            nus, at which feafon all the youths of both <lb/>
            fexes went to the temple. The procession <lb/>
            being ended, Callirrhoe came out from the <lb/>
            fane; when the people would have adored <lb/>
            her as a goddess. Chæreas having left the <lb/>
            Gymnasium, or school of bodily exercifes, 'rent, <lb/>
            bright as a star, into the temple. His vigorous <lb/>
            exertions had added beauty to his limbs; and <lb/>
            raCy health glowed in his countenance *. Now <lb/>
            it happened, that Chæreas and Callirrhoe <lb/>
            came to the fame part of the temple, the son <lb/>
            of Venus having ordained this meeting ; and <lb/>
            as this goddefs had projected an amour, their <lb/>
            hearts were reciprocally inflamed. Chæreas <note type="footnote"> * The original fays, He glittered like gold and <lb/>

            returned home, deeply wounded, but man­ <lb/>
            fully concealed the conquer made over him; <lb/>
            lie appearing ashamed of his weakness. But <lb/>
            the maiden, prostrating herself at the feet of <lb/>
            Venus, and kissing them, cried thus :—Ah! <lb/>
            why didst thou bring fo lovely a youth before <lb/>
            mine eyes in thy fane ?Their affection <lb/>
            increasing, it tortured them exceedingly; <lb/>
            when night coming on, Callirrhoe blufhed at <lb/>
            the thoughts of her having difclofed her paf­ <lb/>
            sion; and Chæreas, though pining with love, <lb/>
            had yet resolution enough to confefs to his <lb/>
            parents, that he was deeply Smitten; and that <lb/>
            were not Callirrhoe given to him in marriage, <lb/>
            it would be impoffible for him to live. Ari­ <lb/>
            ston, his father, venting a deep figh, faid to <lb/>
            him: -O L my son, thou art an undone <lb/>
            youth; since it is certain, that Hermocrates <lb/>
            will never bellow his only daughter on thee; <lb/>
            when there are fo many fuitors, fo greatly thy <lb/>
            superiors <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            superiors both in rank and power. This <lb/>
            ought not to be even attempted, except thou <lb/>
            wouldeft chufe to become the object of public <lb/>
            ridicule. In this manner did Arisen en­ <lb/>
            deavour to confole his son, whore malady in­ <lb/>
            creased daily; infomuch that he discontinued <lb/>
            his accustomed exercises and amufements. <lb/>
            The Gymnasium was very near become a de­ <lb/>
            fart, for want of Chæreas; all the young <lb/>
            people being very fond of him. On making <lb/>
            a strict enquiry, they discovered the caufe of his <lb/>
            malady; and all were moved to pity, on <lb/>
            reflecting that fo lovely a youth was in danger <lb/>
            of lofing his life through fo noble a passion. <lb/>
            It was one of thofe Hated days on which the <lb/>
            people ufed to assemble; who being feated, <lb/>
            they made this first and most ardent requeft, <lb/>
            crying aloud Excellent Hermocrates! mighty <lb/>
            captain! fave! O rave Chæreas ! This will <lb/>
            be thy moft illustrious trophy.- The whole <lb/>
            city demands thefe nuptials, worthy of both <note type="footnote">B 3 </note> <lb/>

            parties.--.!-- Who could duly describe this <lb/>
            assembly, summoned together, and difpofed <lb/>
            by Cupid ? Hermocrates having the warmer <lb/>
            affection for his fellow citizens, could not re­ <lb/>
            fuse their petition, fo earnestly implored; and <lb/>
            he, having complied with their request, all <lb/>
            the people, rifing up on a Sudden in the <lb/>
            theatre, the young men flew to Chæreas ; and <lb/>
            the senators, with the chief magistrate, follow­ <lb/>
            ed Hermocrates. The Syracufian women <lb/>
            came likewise in crouds, to conduct Callirrhoe <lb/>
            to the bridegroom's houfe. Every quarter of <lb/>
            the city refounded with Epithalamiums. The <lb/>
            squares and streets were filled with chaplets <lb/>
            and lighted torches. Ointments and wine <lb/>
            were poured on the thresholds ; and the Sy­ <lb/>
            racusians were more joyful this day, than on <lb/>
            that when they triumphed over the Athenians. <lb/>
            The virgin, being ignorant of all thefe mat­ <lb/>
            ters, lay in bed fadly weeping, fient, and <lb/>
            her head veiled. The nurfe approaching her, <lb/>
            faid — <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            said:-Arise, my child;! this is the day more <lb/>
            ardently wished for, by us, than any other. <lb/>
            The city bestows thee in marriage.-Instantly, <lb/>
            Her heart, her knees, were with a trembling seiz'd : <lb/>
            Callirrhoe not knowing to whom she was to <lb/>
            be efpoufed. She was immediately struck <lb/>
            fpeechlefs; her eyes were veiled in darkness; <lb/>
            and she almoft died away, which was con­ <lb/>
            fidered by the spectators as the effect of mo­ <lb/>
            desty. But fo foon as her waiting-maids had <lb/>
            dressed and adorned her; the parents, leav­ <lb/>
            ing the croud at the door, introduced, the <lb/>
            bridegroom to the bride. Chæreas flying to <lb/>
            the virgin, gave her a thoufand kisses : when <lb/>
            Callirrhoe perceiving him to be the man the <lb/>
            loved, shone forth with greater beauty ; as a <lb/>
            lamp whore dying flame receives new fplendor <lb/>
            by pouring in fresh oil. When she after­ <lb/>
            wards appeared in public, the multitude in <note type="footnote"> B 4 </note> <lb/>
            gene­ <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            general were feized with astonishment, and a <lb/>
            Sacred kind of horror; like as when Diana <lb/>
            is fuddenly perceived by the hunters, in the <lb/>
            deep Solitude of a foreft. Many then pre­ <lb/>
            fent worshipped her; and all being charmed <lb/>
            with Chæreas, they pronounced Callirrhoe <lb/>
            thrice happy. In like manner, (according to <lb/>
            the poets) were the nuptials of Thetis cele­ <lb/>
            brated on mount Pelion. Nevertheless fome <lb/>
            envious Deity intruded here ; as it is related, <lb/>
            that Difcord was prefent at that marriage.</p>
          <p>II. For the various suitors, being thus <lb/>
            baulked in their expectations, were fired with <lb/>
            grief and rage. Though they had hitherto <lb/>
            been enemies, they now joined as friends ; <lb/>
            and, upon this union, each looking upon <lb/>
            himself as injured, they met together. Envy <lb/>
            prompted them to make war on Chæreas : <lb/>
            when a certain Italian youth, fon to the prince <lb/>
            of Rhegium, rising first, fpake thus ,-Had any <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            of us obtained Callirrhoe; it would not have <lb/>
            raifed my indignation; as one of the cam-. <lb/>
            batants, in the Gymnastic exercifes, mull ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily bear away the prize. But for us to <lb/>
            be fupplanted, by a man who never under­ <lb/>
            went the least fatigue, in order to win Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe, is an infult I can no ways brook. <lb/>
            We were amufed, were incessantly on the <lb/>
            watch at her door; were careffing her nurfes <lb/>
            and waiting-maids ; and making rich presents <lb/>
            to her other attendants. How long have we <lb/>
            been her Haves ! but the word circumstance is, <lb/>
            the hatred which it has excited among us, <lb/>
            who are rivals. Who cart bear the thoughts <lb/>
            that a pathic, a beggar, a worthless wretch, <lb/>
            should be the conqueror ; at a time when <lb/>
            princes contended for the victory ? ani that <lb/>
            he, without even risking the dangers of battle, <lb/>
            should bear away the prize ? Yet Chareas shall <lb/>
            not reap any advantage from it; and this <lb/>
            marriage shall prove fatal to him. The <lb/>
            whole <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            whole assembly applauded this speech, (the <lb/>
            prince of Agrigentum excepted) who object­ <lb/>
            ed to the proposal; but this not out of re­ <lb/>
            gard to Chæreas. I differ (faid he) from <lb/>
            you in opinion, with respect to what is now <lb/>
            offered ; but will lay before you a much fafer <lb/>
            plan. Call to mind that Hermocrates, being <lb/>
            very powerful, is not to be contemned; and <lb/>
            therefore, should you attack him openly, it <lb/>
            will be to no purpose. We had better have <lb/>
            recourse to ftratagem ; for even a principality <lb/>
            is won by artifice fooner than by violence. <lb/>
            Elect me, unanimoufly, your captain, in the <lb/>
            war you are now declaring against Chæreas ; <lb/>
            and I will engage to dissolve this marriage. <lb/>
            J wilt inflame his breaft with jealoufy ; which <lb/>
            being enforced by love, will excite him to <lb/>
            revenge this injury. Callirrhoe poUcHes great <lb/>
            strength of mind ; and is free from evil fuf­ <lb/>
            picions: but as Chæreas was brought up in the <lb/>
            Gymnafium, and consequently is, no stranger <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            to the wild sallies of youth ; he may eafiJy <lb/>
            (his fufpicion being raifed) be fired with jea­ <lb/>
            lousy, fo natural to young men. Nor will it <lb/>
            be difficult to get accefs, or to fpeak to him.— <lb/>
            Scarce had he finished his harangue, when <lb/>
            the unanimous voice of the assembly declared, <lb/>
            how greatly they approved of his propofal. <lb/>
            They thereupon left the whole management <lb/>
            of the affair to this prince ; thinking him per­ <lb/>
            fectly well qualified to execute the most wily <lb/>
            enterprize. He thereupon put his plan in <lb/>
            execution in manner following.</p>
          <p>in. One evening, a messenger brought word <lb/>
            to Chæreas, that Arisen his father, then at <lb/>
            his country feat, had fallen down flairs ; and <lb/>
            that there were little hopes of his life. The <lb/>
            instant Chaereas heard this news, though he <lb/>
            was extremely fond of his father, he yet re­ <lb/>
            gretted his being obliged to go alone; as he <lb/>
            could not yet, with decency, take his bride <lb/>
            with <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            with him. No one had had the boldnefs to <lb/>
            bring openly before the nuptial houfe, the * <lb/>
            riotous banquet that night; but the wooers <lb/>
            coming thither privately, left behind them the <lb/>
            indications of fuch banquet. They adorned <lb/>
            the doors with chaplets, and poured oint­ <lb/>
            ments. Libations of wine flowed along the <lb/>
            ground ; and torches, half burnt, were feat­ <lb/>
            tered about. Day light being returned, every <lb/>
            one who passed by stopt ; agreeably to the <lb/>
            illaudable curiosity of mankind, ever fond of <lb/>
            prying into the affairs of others. Chæreas <lb/>
            finding his father Somewhat recovered, went <lb/>
            back to Callirhoe with the utmost speed. <lb/>
            And now, feeing a vail croud of people at <lb/>
            the door, he was all amazement at firft ; but <lb/>
            being told the caufe, he rufhed forward <note type="footnote"> * This was a more than Serenade, given by rakes <lb/>
            to their mistresses; the marks of which were left <lb/>
            before the door on this occafion, by Chæreas's ri­ <lb/>
            vals ,in order to excite his jealousy. </note> <lb/>
            like <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            like one distracted. Finding the chamber­ <lb/>
            door shut, he knocked violently; upon which <lb/>
            the Servant let him in. Flying inflantly to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, his indignation softened into grief; <lb/>
            when tearing his garments, he wept bitterly. <lb/>
            Being afked what misfortune had befallen him, <lb/>
            he remained speechless; for it was not in his <lb/>
            power to disbelieve his eyes; though he yet <lb/>
            was unwilling to credit what was fo repug­ <lb/>
            nant to his defires. While he continued <lb/>
            thus perplexed, and trembled in every limb, <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, who knew nothing of what had <lb/>
            happened; humbly besought him to tell her <lb/>
            what it was that offended him. To this he <lb/>
            replied, (his eyes darting fire) and being <lb/>
            grieved to the foul at the fuppofed transactions <lb/>
            of the past night.- I bewail, (faid he) <lb/>
            my unhappiness in reflecting, that so fhort <lb/>
            a fpace of time should have blotted me from <lb/>
            thy memory :——and then reproached her <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            with the nocturnal rioting. But Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            exasperated at so unjust an accufation, thus <lb/>
            answered, with a fpirit becoming the daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of the proctor :No one has feared <lb/>
            before my father's houfe this night. This door <lb/>
            may, very poffibly, be accustomed to fuch <lb/>
            kind of revelry; and thy marrying me, is a <lb/>
            mortal wound to thy rivals Saying this, <lb/>
            she turned from him ; and drawing her veil <lb/>
            over her face, wept bitterly. But lovers are <lb/>
            eafily reconciled $ and willingly admit of their <lb/>
            mutual excufes. Chaereas's foul being then <lb/>
            foftened, he tenderly embraced his bride, who <lb/>
            was presently fatisfied with his repentance. <lb/>
            Thefe difputes ferved only to increafe their <lb/>
            passion : and both their parents thought them­ <lb/>
            felves fupremely happy, in finding fuch con­ <lb/>
            cord between their children.</p>
          <p>IV. But now the prince of Agrigentum <lb/>
            having failed in his firft stratagem, refolved <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            to put in execution a still deeper plot. He <lb/>
            had, among his dependants, a parasite of a <lb/>
            facetious disposition, and possessed of every <lb/>
            winning grace. The prince ordered this man <lb/>
            to act the lover. And now this latter, mak­ <lb/>
            ing his addresses to Callirrhoe's firft waiting. <lb/>
            woman, he, by his passionate and repeated <lb/>
            intreaties, stole insensibly into her heart. It <lb/>
            was indeed with very great difficulty that he <lb/>
            could prevail on her to listen to him; but the, <lb/>
            at -lift, was gained by presents; and by his <lb/>
            protesting, that he would certainly hang him­ <lb/>
            felf, in cafe the did not indulge his ardent <lb/>
            wishes. A woman is easily won by a man <lb/>
            whom she fuppofes to be fond of her. Mat­ <lb/>
            ters being thus prepared, the author of this <lb/>
            project fixed on another actor, who, though <lb/>
            not so handfome as the parafite, was master <lb/>
            of the deepest cunning; and of fo fmooth <lb/>
            and subtle a tongue, that his fimulated can­ <lb/>
            dor gained him the confidence of every hearer. <note type="footnote"> 6 </note> <lb/>
            Having <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            Having instructed this perfon previously in <lb/>
            all he was to fay or do; he fent him, (though <lb/>
            not known) to Chæreas, whom he met walk­ <lb/>
            ing at leifure, about the Palæstra, or place <lb/>
            for bodily exercifes, when the man in question <lb/>
            thus accosted him.—I once had a fon of your <lb/>
            age; who, so long as he lived, greatly ad­ <lb/>
            mired and efteemed you. Now he being <lb/>
            dead, I look upon you as my offspring : and <lb/>

            you of things of the utmoft importance to <lb/>
            your future life. This wretch having, by <lb/>
            his artful Speeches, excited in Chæreas the <lb/>
            various paffions of hope and fear, toge­ <lb/>
            ther with a violent curiosity ; Chæreas, COIl­ <lb/>
            juring him to proceed, he shuffled ; and <lb/>
            Scarce a word more could be got from him; <lb/>
            be faying, in faultering accents: That this <lb/>
            was not a proper time; the business he was <lb/>

            preying; he expecting to hear fome vastly dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable particulars. And now this vile sy­ <lb/>
            cophant taking him by the hand, led him to <lb/>
            a folitary place; when knitting his brows, <lb/>
            and affecting an air of borrow, he shed a few <lb/>
            tears, saying :—— Oh! Chæreas, it is with <lb/>
            the utmost reluaance I disclose to you a most <lb/>
            deteftable affair, which I long attempted to. <lb/>
            reveal; yet could not, till now, prevail upon <lb/>
            myself to break it to you. But since you are <lb/>
            publickly laughed at, and your misfortune <lb/>
            is become the topic of every conversation; <lb/>
            I having a natural antipathy to vice, and the <lb/>

            longer. Know then, that your wife is false <lb/>
            to you ; and if you will not believe me, I am <lb/>

            I yet would forgive her.The other re­ <lb/>
            plied :—Pretend Pretend that you are going into <lb/>
            the country. About mid-night be upon the <lb/>

            Chæreas, unable to bear the prefence of Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe, fent her word, that he was going <lb/>
            out of town. In the mean time this disturber <lb/>
            of harmony, this black villain, prepared <lb/>
            every thing for his abominable purpose. <lb/>
            Night being come, Chæreas went to his post ; <lb/>
            while the man who had corrupted Callirrhoe's <lb/>
            waiting woman, hid himfelf in a narrow paf­ <lb/>
            sage; acting as one, who attempting a dark <lb/>
            work, endeavoured to conceal himfelf; though, <lb/>
            at the fame time he did all he could to be <lb/>
            feen. The ringlets of his hair shone, they <lb/>
            being perfumed with fragrant ointments ; his <lb/>
            eyes were painted; his garments gay and <lb/>
            effeminate, and his pumps thin. As his <lb/>
            weighty rings were deep in colour, they <lb/>
            glittered on his fingers, though it was dark. <lb/>
            Looking then very carefully round, he drew <lb/>
            near the door ; and knocking gently, gave <note type="footnote"> C 2 </note> <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            the usual fignal. The waiting woman, who­ <lb/>
            also was fearful, opened the door Softly; <lb/>
            when taking turn by the hand, she led him <lb/>
            into the houfc. Chæreas feeing this, could <lb/>
            no longer retrain his fury; but ran to stab <lb/>
            the adulterer in the act. The latter, after <lb/>
            standing a little at the entry- door, disappear­ <lb/>
            ed. Callirrhoe was fitting on the bed-fide, <lb/>
            wifhing for her Chæreas ; and so deep was her <lb/>
            melancholy, that she had not even permitted <lb/>
            her lamp to be lighted. At the found of <lb/>
            feet, she heard her hufband breathe; and <lb/>
            thereupon flew joyfully to meet him. Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas had now no voice left to upbraid her; <lb/>
            but being overcome by rage, he, as she ap­ <lb/>
            proached him, gave her an unhappy blow <lb/>
            with his heel on the stomach; which stopping <lb/>
            her breath, she fell on the floor, and was <lb/>
            carried to bed by the fervants. Callirrhoe <lb/>
            lying thus fetched out, and speechless, was <lb/>
            sup­ <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            supposed to be dead by every one who <lb/>
            Jaw her.</p>
          <p>V. Fame, that Speedy messenger, soon <lb/>
            spread the news of this fad diMer over the <lb/>
            whole city. Sighs and wailings echoed from <lb/>
            street to street, till they reached the fea- <lb/>
            shore. The lamentations were as great, and <lb/>
            as universal, as if the city had been taken <lb/>
            by the enemy. Chæreas, Hill fired with <lb/>
            anger, shut himfelf up; and, during the <lb/>
            whole night, put his female fervants to the <lb/>
            torture, by fire and fword. Callirrhoe's <lb/>
            waiting-woman was the first and last who <lb/>
            suffered on this occasion; and, by this <lb/>
            means, he finally extorted the truth; when <lb/>
            being moved to companion, for his (imagined) <lb/>
            dear, deceafed bride ; he would have killed <lb/>
            himfelf, had he not been prevented by Poly­ <lb/>
            charmus his bofom friend; fuch as Homer <lb/>
            describes Patroclus to have been with regard <note type="footnote"> C 3 </note> <lb/>

            to Achilles. Next morning the chief magi­ <lb/>
            crates arraigned the fuppofed murtherer; <lb/>
            they being refolved to prosecute Chæreas, out <lb/>
            of respect to Hermocrates. The populace <lb/>
            ran in crouds to the public Square, or court <lb/>
            of justice; and were greatly divided in opi­ <lb/>
            nion ; fome crying one thing, fome another. <lb/>
            The difappointed fuitors inflamed them; and <lb/>
            especially the prince of Agrigentum, who <lb/>
            stalking up and down, felt a fecret pride, at <lb/>
            his having accomplished a defign, which every <lb/>
            one else would have thought impracticable. <lb/>
            Now there happened an incident, till then <lb/>
            unheard of in a court of justice ; which was, <lb/>
            that the indictment being read, the culprit, <lb/>
            to whom a certain time was allowed for <lb/>
            making his defence; instead of pleading Not <lb/>
            guilty, accused himself very Wrongly; and <lb/>
            was the first to pronounce his own condemna­ <lb/>
            tion. He did not even alledge any thing to <lb/>
            alleviate <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            alleviate the charge; neither calumny, jea­ <lb/>
            loufy, nor accident; but fpake thus to the <lb/>
            people: Stone me, (I befeech ye!) with <lb/>
            your own hands, by a public decree. I <lb/>
            have bereaved the people of their crown, <lb/>
            their glory ; and it would be treating me with <lb/>
            too much lenity, should I be delivered over <lb/>
            to the executioner. I mull: have deferved the <lb/>
            most cruel punishment, had I only killed a <lb/>
            she-slave of Hermocrates. Invent then some <lb/>
            new kind of torture; for I have been guilty <lb/>
            of a crime worfe than facrilege or parricide. <lb/>
            Do not give me burial; let not the earth be <lb/>
            polluted with my impious body, but throw <lb/>
            it into the sea.—These words were no fooner <lb/>
            uttered, than a general moan broke forth; <lb/>
            and the whole assembly, forgetting the de­ <lb/>
            ceased, testified the utmoft grief for the fur­ <lb/>
            vivor. Hermocrates was the firft who de­ <lb/>
            fended Chæreas.— I know (faid he) that <note type="footnote"> C 4 </note> <lb/>
            tht <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            the blow must have been involuntary. I ob­ <lb/>
            serve yonder fome people who arelayingsnares <lb/>
            for us; but they shall not have the satisfac­ <lb/>
            lion to fee two funerals; nor will I heighten <lb/>
            the affliction of my deceased daughter, whom <lb/>
            I have often heard declare, that Chæreas’s <lb/>
            life was dearer to her than her own. Let <lb/>
            us then give over this needless trial, and go <lb/>
            and prepare the requisite obfequies. Let us <lb/>
            not permit the corps of Callirrhoe to be <lb/>
            preyed upon by time; as this would lessen <lb/>
            her beauty. Let us lay her in the sepulchre, <lb/>
            while thus lovely. —The judges thereupon <lb/>
            pronounced him not guilty.</p>
          <p>VI. But Chæreas could by no means discul­ <lb/>
            pate himfelf; on the contrary, being desi­ <lb/>
            rous of dying, he fought every method to <lb/>
            put an end to his life. Polycharmus finding <lb/>
            that there was. but one way left to fave him, <lb/>
            fpake <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            fpake thus Thou traitor to thy wife ! <lb/>
            wilt thou not live till thou fhalt have paid the <lb/>
            laft honours due to her memory ? and wilt <lb/>
            thou truft her body to orange hands ? Now <lb/>
            is the time for thee to attend to the sepulchral <lb/>
            rites, and to Solemnize them with royal splen­ <lb/>

            lion on Chæreas; he exerted his utmoft en­ <lb/>
            deavours, in order to haften the interment. <lb/>

            of folid gold. She appeared more charming <lb/>
            than ever; and all the spectators compared <lb/>
            her to the lleeping Ariadne. Firft marched <lb/>
            the Syracufian cavalry; themfelves and their <lb/>
            horfes richly caparifoned; and they preced­ <lb/>
            ed immediately the bier. Then followed the <lb/>
            infantry, bearing the trophies of the victo­ <lb/>
            lies gained by Hermocrates. Next came the <lb/>
            senate ; <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            senate; and afterwards Hermocrates furround­ <lb/>
            ed by thousands of people. Arisen was car­ <lb/>
            ried, though in a very languishing condi­ <lb/>
            tion ; he often calling Callirrhoe, his daughter <lb/>
            and mistress. Then proceeded the wives of <lb/>
            the citizens in fable vestments. Next were <lb/>
            feen the sepulchral riches, all of them worthy <lb/>
            of kings ; the first of which was Callirrhoe's <lb/>
            dower, in gold and filver: then exquisitely <lb/>
            beautiful garments, and other female orna­ <lb/>
            ments; and Hermocrates had fent thither <lb/>
            many of the enemy's fpoils. Here likewise <lb/>
            were fecn the presents made by her relations <lb/>
            and friends; lastly, came the wealth of Cho­ <lb/>
            reas, who would gladly have burnt his whole <lb/>
            possessions with Callirrhoe's body. The bier <lb/>
            or bed was carried by Syracusian youths; and <lb/>
            the proceffion was clofed by a promifcuous <lb/>
            multitude of people; among whom Chæreas <lb/>
            was heard to vent the most bitter wrailings. <lb/>
            Near <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            Near the fea-fhore flood a magnificent fepul­ <lb/>
            chre, belonging to Hermocrates; which was <lb/>
            plainly feen at a great distance by thofe who <lb/>
            were out at fea. Such vaft wealth was brought <lb/>
            to this Mausolæum, that when the whole <lb/>
            was deported therein, it feemed a treasury. <lb/>
            But now the honours which were thus paid <lb/>
            to the deceased Callirrhoe, gave rife to inci­ <lb/>
            dents of a more extraordinary nature.</p>
          <p>VII. There was a certain pyra'e, a wicked <lb/>
            man, Theron by name, who frequented the <lb/>
            seas from an unjust Spirit of gain ; and who <lb/>
            kept many watchful spies about the ports. <lb/>
            This man had a band of pyrates always ready <lb/>
            at hand, under the title of a Society of pilots. <lb/>
            Theron, having been present at the inter­ <lb/>
            ment, call a wishful eye on the riches of it ; <lb/>
            and at night, when in bed, he could not <lb/>
            sleep for thinking on them; he saying thus <note type="footnote"> 9 </note> <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            to himself:—Shall I live in perpetual danger; <lb/>
            struggling for ever with the waves, and mur­ <lb/>
            thering the living for a meer pittance; when <lb/>
            I now have an opportunity of making my <lb/>
            fortune, by one dead person ? I mutt make <lb/>
            an attempt. This booty shall not efcape me. <lb/>
            Whom then shall I make choice of for my <lb/>
            companions, on this occasion ? Consider well, <lb/>
            (Theron) among thy brave fellows, who is <lb/>
            fit for this enter prize. Zenophanes of Thu­ <lb/>
            rium is sagacious, but then he is fearful. <lb/>
            Meno of Messene is bold, but treacherous.— <lb/>
            Thus did he run over, in imagination, all the <lb/>
            pyrates; weighing their respective abilities, <lb/>
            in like manner as a banker does his money ; <lb/>
            rejecting many pieces ; but, at laft, approv­ <lb/>
            ing fome as fit for his purpose. Early next <lb/>
            morning, he ran from the ship to the port, <lb/>
            to feek for them fingly: when he found part <lb/>
            At the brothel, and others at the tavern ; all <lb/>
            fit <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            fit comrades for fuch a captain. Then say­ <lb/>
            ing, that he had fame necessary bufinefs to, <lb/>
            communicate ; he took them behind the har­ <lb/>
            bour, and fpake thus :—I, having found <lb/>
            a treafure, have chofen you to share it with <lb/>
            me; it being too great a booty for one man. <lb/>
            The acquiring it will not cost you much <lb/>
            pains; and one night’s work may enrich us <lb/>
            all. We are not unacquainted with certain <lb/>
            arts, which, though held in defecation by <lb/>
            fools, are yet found of the higher utility to <lb/>
            men of judgment. The pyrates, immedi­ <lb/>
            ately fuppofing that he hinted at a robbery ; <lb/>
            the breaking into a sepulchre, or fome fa­ <lb/>
            crilegious act, cried ;-there need no more <lb/>
            arguments; what you have faid is sufficient. <lb/>
            Only point out the affair, and let us not lofe <lb/>
            time. Theron, continued thus: You <lb/>
            faw the gold and filver which belonged to <lb/>
            the deceased Callirrhoe ; but surely we, who <note type="footnote"> * </note> <lb/>
            are <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            are living, have a more just title to it. Hence <lb/>
            I am refolved to break open the Mausolæum <lb/>
            this night; then, feizing the treafure, we <lb/>
            will put it on board a vessel; and afterwards <lb/>
            fail to what ever foreign country the winds <lb/>
            may drive us, and there fell the cargo. <lb/>
            This propofal meeting with universal ap­ <lb/>
            plause, their captain said: Return now <lb/>
            to your rendezvous, and your ufual occupa­ <lb/>
            tions, and at midnight go all on board the <lb/>
            vessel; every one taking the proper tools, <lb/>
            with whatever elfe may be necessary: and they <lb/>
            did fo.</p>
          <p>VIlI. Callirrhoe, in the mean time, received <lb/>
            a fecond birth, as it were ; for her breath <lb/>
            having not quite left her, the found fome <lb/>
            fymptoms of hunger ; and revived by insen­ <lb/>
            fible degrees. She afterwards began to move <lb/>
            in every limb; when opening her eyes, Ohe <lb/>
            per­ <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            perceived a fenfation like to that felt by per­ <lb/>
            sons, juft waking from a deep sleep; when <lb/>
            imagining Chæreas to lay by her, she called <lb/>
            him by his name. But as neither her huf­ <lb/>
            band, nor her waiting-women, heard her; <lb/>
            and all was solitude and darknefs, she, tremb­ <lb/>
            ling like an afpen leaf, was Seized with hor­ <lb/>
            ror ; being quite unable to conjecture where <lb/>
            she was. Having raised herself with difficul­ <lb/>
            ty, she felt gently the coronets and fillets, <lb/>
            which, by their tinkling, feemed of gold and <lb/>
            silver. There also was a vaft heap of aro­ <lb/>
            matics, on and about the bier, which called <lb/>
            to her remembrance the sad blow the had re­ <lb/>
            ceived ; and how the fainted away. CaJlir­ <lb/>
            rhoe, recovering from her trance, and being <lb/>
            grieved to the foul, now found the was in a <lb/>
            sepulchre. She thereupon screamed, as loud <lb/>
            as poffible : — Alas ! I am buried alive. <lb/>
            Help, 0 help me ! But not receiving any <lb/>
            benefit <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            benefit from her repeated moans, the quite <lb/>
            defpaired of succour; when reclining her head <lb/>
            on her knees, she thus broke forth into lamenta­ <lb/>
            tions. Ah ! wretched Cure am I, to be <lb/>
            thus interred alive, when guilty of no crime; <lb/>
            and to die of a dreadfully-lingering death! <lb/>
            I am in health, while my fad relations are be­ <lb/>
            wailing my loss. How will it be possible for <lb/>
            me to inform them, that I still live ! 0 unjuft <lb/>
            Chæreas! I do not accufe thee, for having <lb/>
            attempted to kill me ; but becaufe thou didft <lb/>
            drive me away fo fuddenly out of thy houfe. <lb/>
            Thou shouldest not have buried Callirrhoe so <lb/>
            hastily, she not being really dead ; but thou <lb/>
            art, perhaps, already thinking of another <lb/>
            bride.</p>
          <p>IX. Now while she thus vented her grief <lb/>
            in the most doleful accents; Theron, finding <lb/>
            it was midnight, advanced towards the Mau­ <lb/>
            solæum, <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            solæum, without making the least noise; the <lb/>
            oars, for that purpofe, lightly skimming the <lb/>
            waves. His men then going ashore, be sta­ <lb/>
            tioned them in manner following. He font <lb/>
            out four, to fpy if any perfons came near to <lb/>
            the sepulchre; with orders to kill them : but <lb/>
            in cafe this was not practicable, then to make <lb/>
            known, by a signal agreed among themselves, <lb/>
            that such persons were approaching. Theron <lb/>
            himself (being the fifth) went towards the <lb/>
            tomb. The rest (they being fixteen in all) <lb/>
            were commanded to remain on board the vef­ <lb/>
            fel, and to hold their oars in readinefs ; in <lb/>
            order that they, in cafe of any sudden acci­ <lb/>
            dent, might immediately carry off thofe who <lb/>
            were on flere, and fail away. Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            now hearing them at work with their iron <lb/>
            crows ; and a mighty stroke burfling open <lb/>
            the sepulchre; her foul was instantly feized <lb/>
            with the various passions of fear, joy, grief, <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
            sur­ <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            fut prize, hope and distrust. —From whence <lb/>
            (faid she to herfelf) can this noife proceed ? <lb/>
            Perhaps fome infernal spirit, purfuant to the <lb/>
            law enjoyned the dead, is come to vifit wretch­ <lb/>
            ed me. This is not a meer noife, but the <lb/>
            shrill voice of fome daemon, which calls me <lb/>
            hence; or it is rather a noife made by thieves, <lb/>
            who are forcing open the Maufolæm ; for, to <lb/>
            add to my mifery, I was buried here with <lb/>
            riches which can be of no- ufe to the dead.— <lb/>
            While Callirrhoe was ruminating on thefe <lb/>
            things, one of the pyrates thruft forward his <lb/>
            head; and, at laft, got in his whole body. <lb/>
            And now Callirrhoe, falling on her knees, <lb/>
            would have implored his compassion ; but the <lb/>
            robber, greatly terrified, leaped back again ; <lb/>
            and, with trembling accents, faid to his com­ <lb/>
            panions :Let us fly this place; for fome <lb/>
            genius guards the treasures here entombed, <lb/>
            and will not permit us to enter.——Theron <lb/>
            laugh­ <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            laughing, called him coward; and faid : <lb/>
            Thou art as lifeless as the dead woman! <lb/>
            He thereupon commanded another to go in ; <lb/>
            but as none of them had courage to do this, <lb/>
            he himfelf rushed in, with his drawn sword, <lb/>
            the glitter of which made Callirrhoe afraid <lb/>
            the should be murthered ; when linking to the <lb/>
            ground, in a corner, she, with a low voice, <lb/>
            thus conjured him: Whoever thou art, <lb/>
            bestow that pity on me, which I have not <lb/>
            met with either from my husband, or from j <lb/>
            my parents. Do not kill a woman whom <lb/>
            thou hast rather saved.—Theron fummoned <lb/>
            up all his fpirits; and being naturally Saga­ <lb/>
            cious, and of great pretence of mind, he im­ <lb/>
            mediately guessed the whole affair. But he <lb/>
            was doubtful, at firft, whether it would not <lb/>
            be beft for him to kill Callirrhoe ; as the pre­ <lb/>
            ferving of her life might be an obstacle to <lb/>
            every part of his enterprize. However, views <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            of interest foon made him change his mind, <lb/>
            when he fpake thus to himfelf: Let this <lb/>
            woman form part of the sepulchral riches. <lb/>
            Great treafures, of gold and filver, are here <lb/>
            buried ; but the beauty of this female is more <lb/>
            precious than them all. Then taking Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe by the hand, he led her forth; <lb/>
            and-calling to his companion: Behold, <lb/>
            (faid he) the genius who to greatly alarmed <lb/>
            you. A fine pyrate, indeed, to be afraid of <lb/>
            a woman ! Do you then take her in charge, <lb/>
            for I will restore her to her parents. Let us­ <lb/>
            carry off the Several articles here deposited; <lb/>
            they being no longer guarded by a dead <lb/>
            woman.</p>
          <p>X. After they had loaded the vessel with <lb/>
            the fpoils, Theron ordered him, who had the <lb/>
            care of Callirrhoe, to retire with her at fome <lb/>
            little diftance. They then held a conference <lb/>
            with <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            with regard to her; and were greatly divided <lb/>
            in opinion. The first saying:—O my com­ <lb/>
            panions ! we came hither with quite different <lb/>
            views; and the booty which fortune has <lb/>
            thrown in our way, far exceeds our most fan­ <lb/>
            guine expectations. Let us make a proper <lb/>
            ufe of it: becaufe it is in our power, fpite of <lb/>
            what we have done, to come off with impu­ <lb/>
            nity. I therefore think that it will be bell <lb/>
            for us to leave every article, in the Mauso­ <lb/>
            læum, as we found it; and restore Callirrhoe <lb/>
            to her hufband, and to her father. We then <lb/>
            may declare that, pursuant to the custom of <lb/>
            fishermen, we ran our vessel ashore near to <lb/>
            the sepulchre ; and that having heard a voice, <lb/>
            humanity prompted us to break open the <lb/>
            tomb; to preserve the life of the perfon who <lb/>
            was shut up in it. Let us compel the wo­ <lb/>
            man, by an oath, to bear testimony to all <lb/>
            we have done ; to which she will readily con- <note type="footnote"> D 3 </note> <lb/>
            rent, <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            Cent, out of gratitude to us her benefactors, <lb/>
            who snatched her from the jaws of death. <lb/>
            What joy shall we then Spread through all <lb/>
            Sicily? What a number of rich prefents shall <lb/>
            we receive ? Consider that, in doing this, we <lb/>
            shall act justly with regard to men, and pi­ <lb/>
            oufly with respect to the gods.He had <lb/>
            no sooner ended, but another contradicted <lb/>
            him faying :What a troublesome fool art <lb/>
            thou ! Is this a time to moralize ? Doll: thou <lb/>
            imagine, that our having broke open a fe­ <lb/>
            pulchre has improved our honefty ? And Shall <lb/>
            we have mercy on a woman whofe hufband, <lb/>
            to far from being moved to pity, attempted <lb/>
            to kill her ? You will fay, that she has not <lb/>
            done us any injury: True: but this <lb/>
            would be doing ourselves an infinitely great <lb/>
            one. In the firft place, fhould we restore <lb/>
            the woman to her parents, it is uncertain <lb/>
            what construction they might put upon that <lb/>
            action ; <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            action; and it would be impossible for them <lb/>
            not to suspect the true motive of our going <lb/>
            to the sepulchre. But fuppofe her relations <lb/>
            should be fo very generous as to forgive us; <lb/>
            yet the chief magnates, and the people, <lb/>
            would not release men who had forced open <lb/>
            a Mausolæum; and brought from it, and <lb/>
            boldly fet before their eyes, fo valuable a trea­ <lb/>
            fare. Possibly fume will fay; that it were <lb/>
            more profitable for us, to fell the woman, as <lb/>
            her beauty may fetch a high price: but this <lb/>
            alfq would be dangerous : for gold is dumb, <lb/>
            and filver could not blab the place from <lb/>
            whence we had it. Farther : in the latter <lb/>
            cate, we might invent many fictions; but how <lb/>
            would it be possible for us to conceal a cargo, <lb/>
            furnished with eyes, ears, and a tongue ? <lb/>
            Moreover, as Callirrhoe's charms are more <lb/>
            than human; did we say that (he is a slave, we <lb/>
            should certainly be treated as impostors; for <note type="footnote"> D 4 </note> <lb/>

            what person who beheld her, could believe <lb/>
            that the had ever been in fuch an abject <lb/>
            ftate ?——Let us then kill her upon the spot; <lb/>
            and not carry our accuser up and down with <lb/>
            us.-Many contented to this proposal, but <lb/>
            Theron objected to both :—For, thou, faid <lb/>
            he, (turning to the first) wouldest plunge us <lb/>
            into imminent danger: and thou (turning to <lb/>
            the other) wouldeft bereave us of our profit. <lb/>
            I will Sooner difpofe of the woman than kill <lb/>
            her; because she, while felling, will be a­ <lb/>
            fraid of discovering her quality : but when <lb/>
            fold, let her accufe us, if fhe pleafes; as we <lb/>
            then shall be far removed from her. The life <lb/>
            we lead is exposed to dangers. Away then <lb/>
            on board. Let us fet fail, for day-light is at <lb/>
            hand.</p>
          <p>XI. Hereupon they weighed anchor ; and <lb/>
            the weather being very fine, the ship foon <lb/>
            got <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            got into the main ; where they had neither <lb/>
            advert winds nor waves to contend with, the <lb/>
            vessel not being bound to any particular port; <lb/>
            fo that every gale was favourable to them, <lb/>
            and blew right a-stern. Theron endeavoured <lb/>
            to console the afflicted Callirrhoe, by employ­ <lb/>
            ing every deceitful amusement in his power. <lb/>
            At the fame time (he guessed the evil he was <lb/>
            meditating; and did not doubt but that he <lb/>
            intended to fell her. However, she feigned <lb/>
            not to fee through his villainy, but to believe <lb/>
            all he faid; the being afraid that he would <lb/>
            murther her, should (he fhow the leaft disgust. <lb/>
            Thereupon, laying that (he was lick, the co­ <lb/>
            vered her head ; and weeping, fpake thus to <lb/>
            herself: ——O my father ! Thou wert victo­ <lb/>
            nous on this very sea, and didst destroy a <lb/>
            fleet of Athenians consisting of three hundred <lb/>
            ships; and now that a vile galley robs thee <lb/>
            of thy daughter, thou doll: not fuccour her. <lb/>
            I am <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            I am hurried away to a orange land: and <lb/>
            though of noble birth, mull become a Gave ; <lb/>
            and, perhaps, Come Athenian master may pur­ <lb/>
            chafe the daughter of Hermocrates. How <lb/>
            much better had it been for me, to have re­ <lb/>
            mained dead in the sepulchre ! My dearest <lb/>
            Chæreas would surely, one day or other, have <lb/>
            laid by my fide; but now we are feparated, <lb/>
            living and dead.-—While Callirrhoe was thus <lb/>
            bewailing her Mad fate, the pyrates passed by <lb/>
            many inconsiderable issands ; their cargo being <lb/>
            a purchafe for the rich, not for poor people. <lb/>
            And now they took shelter under a bank, <lb/>
            against which the rea beat, oppofite to Attica, <lb/>
            and there cast anchor. In this place was a <lb/>
            copious Spring, whence a transparent rivulet <lb/>
            flowed. They then conducted Callirrhoe to <lb/>
            a flowery meadow ; and after she was washed, <lb/>
            they requested her to be chearful, and to re­ <lb/>
            cover herfelf a little from the fatigues of the <lb/>
            ocean, <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            ocean, they being very defirous to preserve <lb/>
            her beauty. And now the ruffians, consult­ <lb/>
            ing together apart, with regard to the courfe <lb/>
            they should fleer, one of them faid :——We <lb/>
            are near to Athens, a great and opulent city. <lb/>
            We shall there meet with a very considerable <lb/>
            number of merchants and wealthy men ; A­ <lb/>
            thens being fo exceedingly populous, that <lb/>
            the inhabitants of all other cities feem assem­ <lb/>
            bled in it It was therefore the general <lb/>
            opinion that they should fail for Athens. But <lb/>
            Theron objected to this; the Athenians being <lb/>
            naturally too curious and inquifitive for his <lb/>
            purpofe. You only (faid he) have not <lb/>
            heard, how limply and impertinently they <lb/>
            delight in prying into the affairs of other men. <lb/>
            They are a chattering people, and fond of <lb/>
            wrangling. Their ports are crowded with <lb/>
            sharpers and informers. Thefe will not fail <lb/>
            to enquire who we are; and how we came by <lb/>
            this <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
             <lb/>
            this cargo; and they will certainly suspect <lb/>
            fome evil defign. We should immediately be <lb/>
            examined by the Areopagus, and by the <lb/>
            chief magistrates, more cruel even than ty­ <lb/>
            rants. The Syracusians are less to be dread­ <lb/>
            ed than the Athenians. Ionia is the country <lb/>
            to anfwer our purpofe; many of its inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants being as wealthy as princes, by the riches <lb/>
            they draw from upper Afia. The Ionians are <lb/>
            a very luxurious and indolent people, who <lb/>
            hate law-fuits; and I hope to meet with fame <lb/>
            of my acquaintance among them. ——Having <lb/>
            then taken in water, and got provifions out <lb/>
            of certain trading vessels lying in the har­ <lb/>
            bour ; they failed directly for Miletus. The <lb/>
            third day they came to a bay, about eighty <lb/>
            furlongs from the city; a place formed by na­ <lb/>
            ture as a Secure shelter for fhips. Here The­ <lb/>
            ron commanded them to lay up their oars ; <lb/>
            and throw up the most commodious houfe <lb/>
            they <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            they could for Callirrhoe; he being resolved <lb/>
            to treat her as voluptuoufly as poffible. This <lb/>
            behaviour did not arife from humanity, but <lb/>
            from a thirst of gain; he acting as a merchant, <lb/>
            rather than as a pyrate.</p>
          <p>XII. Theron then hasted to the city, tak­ <lb/>
            ing with him two of his trusly companions. <lb/>
            He would not feek publickly a purchaser, nor <lb/>
            Spread abroad his intentions; but endeavour­ <lb/>
            ed to fell Callirrhoe privately, and for ready <lb/>
            money. However, he found it very difficult <lb/>
            to do this. She was too rich a purchase for <lb/>
            many ; and no inconsiderable person was able <lb/>
            to buy her. Her price could be paid only by <lb/>
            there possessed of vast wealth, or by kings ; <lb/>
            but fuch Theron was afraid of, and therefore <lb/>
            would not approach them. Tired then with <lb/>
            delay, he resolved to be no longer in suspence. <lb/>
            The night afforded him no sleep, he spake <note type="footnote"> 7 . </note> <lb/>
            thus <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            thus to himfelf: ——What a fool art thou, <lb/>
            to have left without a guard, during fo many <lb/>
            days, and in a folitary place, fuch great fums <lb/>
            in gold and livet, as though thou Wert the <lb/>
            only pyrate ! Knowest thou not, that there <lb/>
            are other pyrates like thyfelf, who fcour the <lb/>
            ocean and art thou fure that thine own peo­ <lb/>
            ple will not abandon thee, and run away with <lb/>
            the (hip ? The companions thou haft made <lb/>
            choice of, fo far from being honest, or likely <lb/>
            to prove true to thee, are the moft wicked <lb/>
            wretches thou art acquainted with. Take <lb/>
            therefore thy sleep, as nature now calls for <lb/>
            repofe : then, when morning approaches, fly <lb/>
            to the ship, and throw this woman, who is <lb/>
            now fo very incommodious, into the fea ; and <lb/>
            be no longer encumbered with a cargo, for <lb/>
            which thou canst find fo few buyers.—The­ <lb/>
            ron then falling afleep, faw, in a dream, the <lb/>
            door of the houfe shut against him; which <lb/>
            made <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            made him resolve to flay in this place all that <lb/>
            day -. Not long after, being wrapt in <lb/>
            thought, he fat himfelf down in a shop, great­ <lb/>
            ly disturbed in mind. In this situation, he <lb/>
            perceived a long train of people, both free <lb/>
            and bonds-men, passing by; in the midft of <lb/>
            whom was a middle aged man, clad in mourn­ <lb/>
            ing, and with a most forrowful countenance. <lb/>
            At this fight, Theron rofe from his feat: and <lb/>
            with the curiosity natural to mankind, afked <lb/>
            one of the attendants, who that perfon <lb/>
            was ? —— The attendant replied : —— You <lb/>
            Purely must be a foreigner, or returned from <lb/>
            tome far-distant country, not to know Diony­ <lb/>
            sius ; the noblest, the richer, and the wifeft <lb/>
            of all the Ionians; and whom the great <note type="footnote"> * The ancients were very superstitious with re­ <lb/>
            lard to dreams; and this, which Theron had, made <lb/>
            him refolve to continue longer in that place. </note> <lb/>
            king <lb/>

            king - ranks among his friends. But why <lb/>
            in a fable habit ?Because he has loft his <lb/>
            wife, whom he tenderly loved. Theron <lb/>
            was the more felicitous in his enquiries, as he <lb/>
            had, at last, met with an opulent person, and <lb/>
            a lover of women. And now Theron would <lb/>
            not permit this attendant to leave him ; but <lb/>
            afked what office he held under Dionyfius?— <lb/>
            The other replied :———I aiD his chief slew­ <lb/>
            ard ; and intruded with the care of his in­ <lb/>
            sant daughter, whofe hapless mother was <lb/>
            thatched from her immaturcly. Pray, what <lb/>
            may be your name? Theron. ——And <lb/>
            yours ——Leonas.How lucky am I (cried <lb/>
            the former) 0 Leonas! in meeting with you. <lb/>
            I am a merchant, and juli arrived from Italy ; <lb/>
            and to am wholly unacquainted with the af­ <lb/>

            you then be the gainer. You may either keep <lb/>
            her as a nurfe to the child (she having been <lb/>
            extremely well educated) or oblige your Lord <lb/>
            with her. It will be to your advantage for <lb/>
            him to purchase a bonds-woman; fince this <lb/>
            may prevent his bringing into your family, a <lb/>
            mother-in-law to your infant charge.—— <lb/>
            Leonas listened with great pleasure to this <lb/>
            difcourfe ; and faid :-Surely fome propiti­ <lb/>
            ous Deity rent you hither; for you represent <lb/>
            to me, in clear day-light, what I faw in a <lb/>

            friend and my gueft. After feeing the wo­ <lb/>
            man, I shall be the better able to judge, whe­ <lb/>
            ther fle will be worthy of my Lord, or only <lb/>
            fit for me.</p>
          <p>XIII. When they were got home, Theron <lb/>
            was struck with wonder, at the splendor of <lb/>
            the furniture, and the fpacioufnefs of the <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
            palace; <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            palace; which was prepared for the recep­ <lb/>
            tion of the great king. The first thing Leo­ <lb/>
            nas did, was to defire Theron to wait for <lb/>
            him, till he should have transacted fome bu­ <lb/>
            finefs with his Lord. He afterwards conduct­ <lb/>
            ed him to his own apartments, which teemed <lb/>
            every way fit for a gentleman. He then gave <lb/>
            orders for the table to be fpread ; when The­ <lb/>
            ron, being an artful man who could full <lb/>
            himfelf to all times and circumstances, eat <lb/>
            and drank very freely with Leonas, to pre­ <lb/>
            vent his being suspected ; and still more, to <lb/>
            show how proud he should be of his friend­ <lb/>
            ship. While they were thus at dinner, they <lb/>
            bad a long conference concerning the wo­ <lb/>
            man. Theron made greater encomiums on <lb/>
            the beauties of her mind, than on thofe of <lb/>
            her perfon; well knowing, that what is not <lb/>
            feen requires praife; but that what we do <lb/>
            fee, recommends itself.—Come, (faid Leo­ <lb/>
            nas) <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            nas) let us go; let me fee her.She is <lb/>
            not here, (replied the other) we having avoid­ <lb/>
            ed the city for fear of the farmers of the <lb/>
            customs ; and our ship lies at anchor, eighty <lb/>
            furlongs from hence.—Theron then defcribed <lb/>
            the place. Your vessel (faid Leonas) is <lb/>
            moored upon our estate.—So much the better <lb/>
            (replied the former) fortune having conduct­ <lb/>
            ed us to Dionysius.Let us therefore go <lb/>
            into the country (added Leonas) in order that <lb/>
            you may recover yourfelf, from the fatigues <lb/>
            of the sea ; for Dionyfius's noble Villa is near to <lb/>
            where your ship lies. Theron was great­ <lb/>
            ly rejoiced at this ; be imagining, that he <lb/>
            should more eafily difpofe of his prize in a <lb/>
            solitude, than in a public market.— We <lb/>
            will go. (faid he) early to-morrow morning; <lb/>
            you to the country feat, and I to the ship ; <lb/>
            whence I will bring the woman to you. Mat­ <lb/>
            ters being thus adjusted, they shook hands <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
            and <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            apd parted. The Succeeding night appear­ <lb/>
            ed vaftly long to both ; the one being eager <lb/>
            to buy, the other to fell. Next day Leonas, <lb/>
            parting along the fea-coaft in a fmall vessel, <lb/>
            arrived at the Villa ; he having brought with <lb/>
            him the money, in order to be ready for <lb/>
            the merchant. During this interval, Theron <lb/>
            came unawares upon his companions, who <lb/>
            were on the strand, and very impatient to fee <lb/>
            him ; when telling them his fuccefs, he em­ <lb/>
            braced Callirrhoe, and fpake thus: I in­ <lb/>
            tended (my child !) to have restored you im­ <lb/>
            mediately to your parents; but contrary <lb/>
            winds prevent my doing this. You know <lb/>
            the infinite care I have taken of you; and <lb/>
            above all, that I have not made the lead <lb/>
            attempt on your chastity. Chæreas will re­ <lb/>
            ceive you from the sepulchre (you having been <lb/>
            preserved by our means) as unviolated as on <lb/>
            the bridal night. We are now obliged to fail <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            to Lycia.—But why afflict yourfelf to no pur­ <lb/>
            pofe; you who are fo lick at fea ? I shall <lb/>
            leave you here with fome faithful friends ; <lb/>
            and, at my return, will take you on board ; <lb/>
            'and conduct you to Syracufe, with the utmoft <lb/>
            regard and attention. Take then whatever <lb/>
            you think fit, of your clothes and other <lb/>
            things ; and we will keep the rest for you.— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe now Smiled within herfelf, though <lb/>
            her heart was oppressed with borrow. She <lb/>
            looked upon Theron as very filly, in imagin­ <lb/>
            ing that the could believe him; well know­ <lb/>
            ing that she was fold. Nevertheless she was to <lb/>
            extremely defirous of being freed from the py­ <lb/>
            rates, that she thought the should be more hap­ <lb/>
            py, though a nave, than when free, and enjoy­ <lb/>
            ing the fplendor of her birth.—O ! my father, <lb/>
            (faid she) I return you a multitude of thanks, <lb/>
            for your great humanity to me ; and may the <lb/>
            gods reward you all accordingly! but to ac­ <note type="footnote"> E 3 </note> <lb/>

            cept of any thing which was interred with <lb/>
            me, I should look upon as an evil omen. <lb/>
            Do you therefore preserve them carefully for <lb/>
            me. All I would take, is a little ring, which <lb/>
            was buried with me. She then drew the <lb/>
            veil over her face, faying: Theron ! carry <lb/>
            me whitherfoever you pleafe; for any place <lb/>
            would be preferable to the sepulchre, or to <lb/>
            the fea.</p>
          <p>XIV, As foon as Theron was got near to <lb/>
            the Villa, he made ufe of the following arti­ <lb/>
            fice. Unveiling Callirrhoe, and untying her <lb/>
            hair, fo that it flowed negligently over her <lb/>
            (houlders ; he then opened the door, and or­ <lb/>
            dered her to enter first. Leonas, and thofe <lb/>
            in the room with him, feeing fo exquifite a <lb/>
            beauty appear on a fudden, were all amaze­ <lb/>
            ment. Some thought that a goddefs flood <lb/>
            before them, as Venus was strongly reported <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            to reveal herfelf, Sometimes, in thofe Chades. <lb/>
            All prefent were Seized with surprize ; when <lb/>
            Theron, following clofe behind, accosted <lb/>
            Leonas with thefe words.—Rise, and pre­ <lb/>
            pare to receive the woman ; for this is she <lb/>
            whom thou art defirous to purchase. — <lb/>
            At this declaration the beholders were struck <lb/>
            with joy and wonder. Callirrhoe being then <lb/>
            put to bed, in a moft fplendid room, they <lb/>
            left her ; grief, fatigue, and fear, calling for <lb/>
            repofe. Theron then taking Leonas by the <lb/>
            hand, faid :—I have acquitted myfelf faith- <lb/>
            fully of all I promised. Do you now take <lb/>
            possession of the woman. You furely are my <lb/>
            friend. Come to the city; get a writing <lb/>
            drawn; and then give me what price you <lb/>
            may think proper. But Leonas being re­ <lb/>
            solved to vie with him in courier faid :—I <lb/>
            will truft you with the money, before the <lb/>
            instrument is executed ; and thereu pon pressed <note type="footnote"> E 4 </note> <lb/>
            him <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            him to accept of the turn, left he fhould after­ <lb/>
            wards go from the agreement; Leonas know­ <lb/>
            ing that many In the city, would gladly pur­ <lb/>
            chafe Callirrhoe. Leonas now offering him <lb/>
            a talent of filver, conjured him to take it ; <lb/>
            which the pyrate, with a multitude of words, <lb/>
            pretended to refuse ; but afterwards accepted, <lb/>
            though feemingly with infinite reluctance. <lb/>
            Leonas intreated his guest to fup with him, <lb/>
            as it was late; but Theron faid :I will <lb/>
            fail for the city this very night: and to mor­ <lb/>
            row we will compleat the contract, in the <lb/>
            port.—The appointment being thus made, <lb/>
            they feparated. Theron being got on board <lb/>
            his vessel, ordered his people to weigh an­ <lb/>
            char ; and fet fail with all poffible expedi­ <lb/>
            lion, to prevent their being discovered. Now <lb/>
            while the pyrates were flying whithersoever <lb/>
            the winds might carry them ; Callirrhoe being <lb/>
            left alone, and at full liberty to bewail her <lb/>
            sad <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            fad misfortunes, cried thus:- Behold me now <lb/>
            shut up, by Theron, in a sepulchre, still <lb/>
            more lonely than the other: for to that <lb/>
            my father and mother would have come; and <lb/>
            Chaereas had bedewed it with his tears ; of <lb/>
            which, I, though dead *, fhould have been <lb/>
            tenable. But who can I here invoke ? Thou <lb/>
            knowest (0 envious Fortune !) that thou art <lb/>
            not yet satisfied with perfecuting the wretch­ <lb/>
            ed Callirrhoe, both by sea and land. Firft, <lb/>
            thou didft induce my lover to kill me. <lb/>
            That very Chæreas who never beat a flave, <lb/>
            gave me, who loved him to distraction, a <lb/>
            deadly blow. Thou didst afterwards deliver <lb/>
            me up to robbers of tombs; and, from the <lb/>
            Mausolæum, didft drag me to the ocean, <note type="footnote"> * We may suppose that distraction made Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe express herself in this manner, as alfo when <lb/>
            the afterwards fays, that Chæreas had killed <lb/>
            her. </note> <lb/>
            where <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            where I was under the yoke of pyrates, more <lb/>
            tremendous than even the billows. Was I <lb/>
            then fo greatly celebrated for beauty, only <lb/>
            that Theron, the pyrate, might receive an <lb/>
            extraordinary price for it ? I was fold in a <lb/>
            folitary place ; and not taken, like other things <lb/>
            of that kind, to the city. Thou didst fear <lb/>
            (0 Fortune !) that had any one feen me, I <lb/>
            fhould have been fuppofed a perfon of noble <lb/>
            birth and liberal education. For this I have <lb/>

            EONAS having ordered Phocas, <lb/>
            the deputy steward, to take all pos­ <lb/>
            fible care of the woman; he, though it was <lb/>
            night, fet out for Miletus, with the utmost <lb/>
            fpeed ; being impatient to inform his Lord <lb/>
            of the good news, with regard to the slave <lb/>
            he <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            he had purchased ; and imagining that this <lb/>
            might alleviate his grief. Leonas found Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius in bed; he being oppressed with fuch a <lb/>
            variety of woe, that he could feldom be pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon to go abroad, though his coun­ <lb/>
            try stood in great need of his advance. On <lb/>
            the contrary, he confined himself to the nup­ <lb/>
            tial chamber, as if his wife had been there. <lb/>
            The moment he raw Leonas, he cried :— <lb/>
            This has been the only pleafant night I have <lb/>
            enjoyed, fince the death of my dear, haplefs <lb/>
            wife; for I faw her very vifibly, in a dream, <lb/>
            more beautiful, more charming than ever ; <lb/>
            and she cohabited with me, as when awake. <lb/>
            Methought it was our nuptial day; that I <lb/>
            was conducing my bride home,. through my <lb/>
            grounds, along the beach ; and that you was <lb/>
            singing our Epithalamium. Dionyfius had <lb/>
            no fooner done fpeaking, than Leonas cried <lb/>
            O my Lord! Thou art fortunate both sleep­ <lb/>
            ing <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            ing and waking. I will now interpret what thou <lb/>
            haft feen : upon which he began thus.—I hap­ <lb/>
            pened to meet with a merchant who had a <lb/>
            female, of wonderful beauty, to difpofe of; <lb/>
            but he being afraid of. the farmers of the <lb/>
            customs, his people ran their vessel a shore <lb/>
            at fome distance from the city, near to your <lb/>
            estate. Then the merchant and I went, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to appointment, to the Villa ; where <lb/>
            fettling the conditions of fale, I gave him a <lb/>
            talent of filver; and am now come to exe­ <lb/>
            cute the central pursuant to the laws. <lb/>
            Dionyfius listened, with great pleasure, to <lb/>
            the inchanting picture which Leonas drew <lb/>
            of this woman ; he being a lover of the fair­ <lb/>
            fex, except of fuch as were in bonds; for <lb/>
            having the spirit of a king, and being the <lb/>
            firft man both in rank and knowlcge, of all <lb/>
            Ionia, he fcorned to bed with a Have <lb/>
            It is impossible, 0 Leonas ! (faid he) that any <lb/>
            one <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            one Ihould be exquisitely handfome who is <lb/>
            not born free *. Haft thou not learnt, from <lb/>
            the poets, that the offspring of the gods are <lb/>
            beautiful; and, still more fo, the children <lb/>
            of perfons of rank. This woman pleaded <lb/>
            you in a Solitary place, while you compared <lb/>
            her to the peasants round you. However, as <lb/>
            you have purchased her, go to the market; <lb/>
            and there Adraflus, who is perfectly well <lb/>
            skilled in the laws, will draw up a proper in­ <lb/>
            strument, and fee it executed. — Leonas was <lb/>
            overjoyed that Dionyfius did not believe the <lb/>
            account he gave of Callirrhoe ; he imagining, <lb/>
            that the fight of fuch unexpected beauty <lb/>
            would strike him the more forcibly. He then <lb/>
            went to all the ports of Miletus ; to every <lb/>
            banker's; and over the whole city; yet no <lb/>
            Theron could bp found. He next enquired <note type="footnote">* What false reasoning is this, as well as what <lb/>
            follows? </note><note type="footnote">8 </note> <lb/>
            very <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            very diligently (to as little purpose however) <lb/>
            of the merchants, and ship-masters ; but none <lb/>
            of them knew any fuch perfon. In this per­ <lb/>
            plexity he took a galley, and rowing along <lb/>
            the sea-coast, landed and went to the Villa ; <lb/>
            Hill unable to find the man he wanted, who, <lb/>
            by this time, was roving over the ocean. <lb/>
            Hereupon Leonas returned flowly and de­ <lb/>
            jected to his Lord, who perceiving the <lb/>
            melancholy which overspread his counte­ <lb/>
            nance, afked what had befallen him ? <lb/>
            The former replied : O my Lord ! I have <lb/>
            loft you a talent. This misfortune (faid <lb/>
            Dionyfius) will make you more cautious for <lb/>
            the future. But tell me what has happen­ <lb/>
            ed ; has not our new-bought slave made her <lb/>
            efcape ?—No, my Lord (answered Leonas) <lb/>
            but he who fold her is fled. This fellow <lb/>
            (added Dionyfius) muft therefore be a man­ <lb/>
            stealer, who having run away with fome- <note type="footnote">VOL. I. </note><note type="footnote">F <lb/>
            </note>body's <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            body's slave, thought it prudent to fell her <lb/>
            to you, in an unfrequented place where were <lb/>
            no witnesses.—Of what country did he fay <lb/>
            the is ? Of Sybaris in Italy (answered <lb/>
            Leonas ;) to which he added, that he had pur­ <lb/>
            chafed her of her jealous mistrefs. Diony­ <lb/>
            fius then ordered his fteward to enquire, if <lb/>
            there were any Sybarites in the city; bidding <lb/>
            him leave, in the mean time, the woman at <lb/>
            the Villa. Leonas quitted the room with an <lb/>
            air of forrow ; imagining that he had not <lb/>
            Succeeded in this bufinefs. He nevertheless <lb/>
            watched carefully for an, opportunity, to per­ <lb/>
            fuade his Lord to go to his country-feat; the <lb/>
            only hopes now left him, being in Dionyfius's <lb/>
            having a fight of Callirrhoe.</p>
          <p>II. In the mean time the country-women <lb/>
            flocked to Callirrhoe, to whom they paid their <lb/>
            duty; and deemed as fond of her as if the <lb/>
            had <lb/>
            . <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            had been their mistress. Plangon, wife to the <lb/>
            under steward, being a fenfible woman, and <lb/>
            who knew the world, thus addressed her :- <lb/>
            My child! You doubtless are in fearch of <lb/>
            your parents and relations; but be assured, <lb/>
            t <lb/>
            that.you will find fuch here; for Dionyfius, <lb/>
            our Lord, is a good man, and of a most be­ <lb/>
            nevolent difpofition. God has moft propi­ <lb/>
            tiously conduced you to an excellent family; <lb/>
            where you may live as happily as in your na­ <lb/>
            tive country. Wash therefore away the un­ <lb/>
            cleanness contracted by your having been so <lb/>
            long at fca. The maids attend here for that <lb/>
            purpose.—— Callirrhoe would fcarce confent <lb/>
            to this; fo that it was with much difficulty <lb/>
            they got her to the bath. The women enter­ <lb/>
            ing, anointed, washed, and wiped her with <lb/>
            the utmoft care. When they faw her naked, <lb/>
            they were infinitely more furprized. Her <lb/>
            face charmed them while she had her clothes <note type="footnote">F 2 </note> <lb/>
            on; <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            on ; but now there were thrown afide, she <lb/>
            appeared to them as a goddefs. Rays of <lb/>
            silver, like the refulgent lightning, feemed <lb/>
            to dart from Callirrhoe's fnowy skin. Her <lb/>
            flesh was so vastly delicate, that they were <lb/>
            afraid the most gentle touch of their fingers <lb/>
            would hurt her, by making a deep impref­ <lb/>
            sion ; upon which they thus whifpered one <lb/>
            another —Our late mistress was justly ce­ <lb/>
            lebrated for her beauty ; but she might have <lb/>
            past for this woman's slave.——These en­ <lb/>
            comiums were very disgustful to Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            who easily guessed what was to follow. Thus <lb/>
            lovely in their eyes, they bound up her di­ <lb/>
            shevelled locks, and brought her fplendid <lb/>
            veflments; but she urged, that such finery <lb/>
            did no ways fuit a newly-purchased slave.— <lb/>
            Give me (faid she) ruflic, fervile weeds, for <lb/>
            you are my fuperiors. Callirrhoe then put <lb/>
            on mean attire 3 but even this became her; <lb/>
            it <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            it appearing, now irradiated by her beauty, <lb/>
            as a rich habit. So fOOD as the women had <lb/>
            dined, Plangon faid to her: Now haste <lb/>
            to Venus, and address her in prayer. The <lb/>
            goddefs reveals herself in this- country ; and <lb/>
            not only thofe in the neighbourhood, but <lb/>
            alfo multitudes from the city, come and offer <lb/>
            up sacrifices to her. The goddefs has always <lb/>
            been remarkably propitious to our master ; <lb/>
            who never passes by her shrine, without bow­ <lb/>
            ing to it. All the peasants present boafted <lb/>
            the appearance of the goddefs; when a wo­ <lb/>
            man, of more Simplicity than the reft, cried :- <lb/>
            Think that thou, in beholding Venus, wilt <lb/>
            fee thine own image. Callirrhoe, at there. <lb/>
            words, burst into tears, and thus whimpered <lb/>
            herfelf: Alas! wretched creature that I <lb/>
            am ! In this place likewise is Venus the caufe <lb/>
            of all my woes. I yet will go to her; and <lb/>
            having a thousand things to complain of, will <note type="footnote"> F 3 </note> <lb/>

            expostulate with her The temple flood <lb/>
            near the Villa, in the high-road. Callirrhoe <lb/>
            prostrating herself at the feet of the goddefs, <lb/>
            and embracing them, cried: Thou didst <lb/>
            first prefent Chæreas to my eyes; but, after <lb/>
            having joined a lovely pair, didst feparate <lb/>
            them ; although we ever paid thee, with <lb/>
            all poffible veneration, due homage. But <lb/>
            sincc thou hast thus ordained, I have one only <lb/>
            boon to request, which is that, after Chaereas, <lb/>
            I may pleafe no other man.— At there words <lb/>
            Venus made a sign in the Negative, fle being <lb/>
            the mother of Cupid; not to, mention that fhe <lb/>
            had already meditated new Hymeneal bands, <lb/>
            which also were to be dissolved. Callirrhoe <lb/>
            being freed from the dread of pyrates, and <lb/>
            the dangers of the ocean, recovered her <lb/>
            former beauty; so that the peafants were <lb/>
            much surprized at her daily-increafing <lb/>
            charms. <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>III. And now Leonas, finding a proper <lb/>
            opportunity, fpake thus to Dionyfius : <lb/>
            My Lord, it is a long time fince you vidited <lb/>
            your edtate on the dea-coadt, and your affairs <lb/>
            require your presence. It is necessary that <lb/>
            you view and enquire into your herds and <lb/>
            plantations ; and you will please to recollect, <lb/>
            that the feafon for reaping the corn, and ga­ <lb/>
            thering the fruits, is at hand. Occupy at laft, <lb/>
            (my Lord) the houses which we, by your <lb/>
            command, have built and furnished magni­ <lb/>
            ficently. Amufed by there various employ­ <lb/>
            ments, and delighted with the rural beau­ <lb/>
            ties round, you then will be the better able <lb/>
            to fupport your late grievous lofs. When­ <lb/>
            ever you (hall think fit to praise fome herds­ <lb/>
            man or shepherd, you then may give him the <lb/>
            new Have in marriage.—Dionysius was pleafed <lb/>
            with this proposal; and gave orders for fet­ <lb/>
            ting out on a certain day. Hereupon his coach- <note type="footnote"> F 4 </note> <lb/>
            men <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            men got ready the equipages, his grooms the <lb/>
            hordes, and his mariners the barges. His <lb/>
            friends were invited to accompany him in the <lb/>
            journey, as also his whole tribe of freedmen ; <lb/>
            Dionyfius being naturally fond of fplendor. <lb/>
            When every thing was ready, he ordered his <lb/>
            attendants, with the baggage, to go by sea ; <lb/>
            and his coaches to follow him, after himfelf <lb/>
            Should be fet out; as a vast retinue would no­ <lb/>
            ways become one in mourning. Next morning <lb/>
            at day-break Dionyfius, unperceived by most of <lb/>
            his Servants or the country people, mounted <lb/>
            his horfe, accompanied by four friends, one <lb/>
            of whom was Leonas ; and then proceeded on <lb/>
            the journey towards his Villa. And now Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe having feen Venus the fame night, re­ <lb/>
            folved to go and worship her. At the time <lb/>
            she was standing, and offering up her prayers <lb/>
            in the temple, Dionyfius, alighting from his <lb/>
            horfe, went in first. Callirrhoe, hearing the <lb/>
            found <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            found of feet, turned towards Dionyfius, when <lb/>
            he perceiving her, cried aloud :—O Venus ! <lb/>
            be propitious to me ; and do now appear to <lb/>
            me for my good. Then going to fall pro­ <lb/>
            strate before her, Leonas withheld him, fay­ <lb/>
            ing :Be not troubled : This (my Lord) <lb/>
            is the newly-purchafed Have. Do thou, (O <lb/>
            woman !) approach thy mafter.—At the word <lb/>
            Master, Callirrhoe, bowing down her head, <lb/>
            and being unable to forget her former free­ <lb/>
            dom, the burft into a flood of tears. But <lb/>
            Dionyfius, striking his reward, faid :—Im­ <lb/>
            pious wretch that thou art ! to fpeak to di­ <lb/>
            vinities as thou wouldest to mortals. Thou <lb/>
            fayeft that this woman was purchased by thee, <lb/>
            for money ; and that thou canft not find the <lb/>
            perfon, who fold her to thee. Haft thou <lb/>
            not read Homer *, who informs us, that <note type="footnote"> * In the Odyssey. </note> <lb/>
            Oft <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            Ost deities will from the fries descend, <lb/>
            And, in the guise of pilgrims, visit mortals ; <lb/>
            To pry into their deeds, or good or evil.</p>
          <p>Ceafe therefore there opprobrious expressions, <lb/>
            and make ufe of others more fuitable to god­ <lb/>
            desses, or I will drive thee hence.—Callirrhoe <lb/>
            then fpake as follows:—Ah! do not mock <lb/>
            my woe, by imagining me to be a goddefs ; <lb/>
            fince I am not even a fortunate woman. <lb/>
            While file uttered there words, her voice <lb/>
            feemed divine to the ear of Dionyfius; for it <lb/>
            was remarkably melodious, and fweet as the <lb/>
            accents of the lyre. Being now confufed, <lb/>
            and ashamed to converfe any longer with the <lb/>
            woman, Dionyfius, already inflamed by love, <lb/>
            went to the Villa. His great croud of atten­ <lb/>
            dants and equipages arrived there, from the <lb/>
            city, not long after; and the adventure of <lb/>
            Callirrhoe was foon Spread round. Immedi­ <lb/>
            ately <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            ately all hafted to fee the woman, though <lb/>
            upon pretence of worshipping Venus. Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe was in fuch confufion, on obferving fo <lb/>
            vaft a concourse of people, that she knew <lb/>
            not how to behave; all being quite Grangers <lb/>
            to her; and she not feeing her confidante <lb/>
            Plangon, who was then employed in receiving <lb/>
            her Lord. The appointed hour being past; <lb/>
            and none of Dionyfius's people returning to <lb/>
            the Villa (all of them fitting or standing in <lb/>
            the temple,) Leonas reflected what this mull <lb/>
            be owing to ; upon which he went to it, and <lb/>
            conduced Callirrhoe out of that place of wor­ <lb/>
            ship. It was then feen, that kings are born <lb/>
            kings, as in a bee-hive; for all followed Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe, whofe beauty had proclaimed and <lb/>
            elected her their mistress. She then returned <lb/>
            to her former residence.</p>
          <p>IV. Dionyfius had received a wound, which <lb/>
            he endeavoured carefully to qonceal. Having <lb/>
            had <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            had an excellent education, and adhering <lb/>
            strictly to the dilates of the purest virtue; <lb/>
            he was loth to appear contemptible in the eyes <lb/>
            of his domestics, or puerile and lafcivious in <lb/>
            thofe of his friends. He therefore struggled <lb/>
            all that night; hoping, by this means, to <lb/>
            conceal his paffion, which yet his filence <lb/>
            (though unperceived by himfelf) betrayed. <lb/>
            Taking then part of the fupper : Let this <lb/>
            (cried he) be carried to our Granger. How­ <lb/>
            ever, do not fay that it comes from her matter, <lb/>
            but from Dionyfius. He continued carouz­ <lb/>
            ing longer than ufual, knowing that it would <lb/>
            be impoffible for him to fleep; and therefore <lb/>
            wished to fpend the night with his friends. <lb/>
            Neverthelefs, when it was far advanced, he <lb/>
            broke up from the company, and went to <lb/>
            bed ; but found sleep a stranger to his eyes. <lb/>
            Fancy then carried him into the temple of Ve­ <lb/>
            nus ; and recalled to his memory every cir­ <lb/>
            cumflance <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            cumftance relative to Calhrrhoe ; her face, <lb/>
            her flowing tresses, her air, her voice, her <lb/>
            glance, her drefs, her difcourfe; but what <lb/>
            inflamed him, was her tears. Then might be <lb/>
            feen the confflict betwixt love and reafon ; for <lb/>
            though Dionyfius was deeply fmitten, he yet <lb/>
            had too much wifdom and strength of mind <lb/>
            not to oppofe his passion ; and thereupon, like <lb/>
            one who lifts his head above the waves, he <lb/>
            cried:—O Dionyfius ! thou who art the firft <lb/>
            man for virtue and for glory, in Ionia, whom <lb/>
            kings, governors, and cities admire; doft thou <lb/>
            not blush to act like a child ? Shall a tranfient <lb/>
            view caufe thee to love that female fo violent <lb/>
            ly; and ere thou haft expiated the shade of thy <lb/>
            haplefs contort ? Doll thou, Hill clad in mourn. <lb/>
            ing, retire into the country to celebrate the <lb/>
            facred nuptial rites with a Have; and perhaps <lb/>
            with another manIs wife, as thou had ft not <lb/>
            any instrument or contract with her her?- The <lb/>
            amo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            amorous god took a delight in perplexing <lb/>
            Dionyfius, while he argued fo wifely with <lb/>
            himself; Cupid considering this moderation <lb/>
            as an infult to his power ; and as Dionyfius <lb/>
            moralized thus philosophically in love, he <lb/>
            therefore inflamed him still more. Our Ionian <lb/>
            being no longer able to bear this felf-converfe, <lb/>
            rent for Leonas; who coming in, and gueffing <lb/>
            the caufe of this message, though he feigned <lb/>
            not to know it; fpake thus in a feeding con­ <lb/>
            fufion: -Whence is it (my Lord !) that <lb/>
            flumbers fly your eyelids ? Are your forrows, <lb/>
            for the lofs of your departed lady, renew­ <lb/>
            ed ? 1 grieve (faid Dionyfius) for a wo­ <lb/>
            man, but not for the deceased. Thy affec­ <lb/>
            tion and fidelity will not permit me to conceal <lb/>
            a fingle fecret from thee. Thou haft undone <lb/>
            me (0 Leonas!) and art the caufe of all my <lb/>
            present anguish. Thou haft fet my houfe on­ <lb/>
            fire ; or rather my heart. It disturbs me <lb/>
            alfo. <lb/>

             <pb n="79"/>
            also, that I am rot able to discover who this <lb/>
            nave is ? Thou teller me an idle tale of a <lb/>
            winged merchant, who came from, thou canst <lb/>
            not fay where ; and is fled thou knowefl not <lb/>
            whither ? And where is the man, who pof­ <lb/>
            fessed of fuch a miracle in beauty, would have <lb/>
            fold her to me, in an unfrequented place, for <lb/>
            a talent; when she is worth the treafures of <lb/>
            the great king ? Some of the gods muft cer­ <lb/>
            tainly have impofed upon thee. Do thou then <lb/>
            recoiled every circumstance relating to this <lb/>
            affair. Whom didft thou fee? With what <lb/>
            people didst thou difcourfe ? Tell me the <lb/>
            whole truth. Thou hadft not a fight of the <lb/>
            fhip ?1 had not, my Lord (replied Leo­ <lb/>
            nas) but I heard it mentioned. The very <lb/>
            thing (faid Dionyfius) I suspected and fore­ <lb/>
            told : One of the nymphs, or nereids, is risen <lb/>
            from the feat The genii are, at certain fea­ <lb/>
            sons, compelled by the fates, to converse <lb/>
            with <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            with mortals, and to dwell upon earth. This <lb/>
            we are told by poets and profe writers <lb/>
            Dionyfius would willingly have perfuaded his <lb/>
            steward to extol Callirrhoe's charms, and her <lb/>
            conversation, which deemed greatly to surpass <lb/>
            that of mortals. Leonas being defirous of <lb/>
            pleating his master, faid :-Let us not per­ <lb/>
            plex ourselves too much, in enquiring who <lb/>
            this woman is, I will now conduct her to you, <lb/>
            unlefs this fhould be thought improper. Be <lb/>
            not thus dejeted; nor despair of success in <lb/>
            your paffion, since every thing is in your own <lb/>
            power. 1 will not have her brought (re­ <lb/>
            fumed Dionyfius) till I first know who she is, <lb/>
            and whence she came. We will enquire the <lb/>
            truth to-morrow, from her own lips. I will <lb/>
            fend for her, but not to this houfe, that (he <lb/>
            may not suspect any violence. We will hold <lb/>
            our conference under the eye and aufpiccs of <lb/>
            Venus, in whofe temple I first faw her. <lb/>
            V. This <pb n="81"/>
            </p>
          <p>V. This being refolved, the next day Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius went to the temple; taking with him <lb/>
            his friends, his freedmen, and the moft faith­ <lb/>
            ful among his domestics; in order that they <lb/>
            might be as witnesses. He did not go care- <lb/>
            Jelly attired, but fet off with fuch ornaments <lb/>
            as were most: advantageous to his perfon ; and <lb/>
            as one going to converge with the miftrefs of <lb/>
            his affections. Dionyfius was naturally hand­ <lb/>
            fome; tall; and remarkably venerable in his <lb/>
            afpeft. Leonas, accompanied by Plangon, <lb/>
            and by thofe waiting-women who were moft <lb/>
            familiar with Callirrhoe, went to her apart­ <lb/>
            ment, and thus addreft her :Dionyfius is <lb/>
            a man of the strictest justice, and an exaft ob­ <lb/>
            server of the laws. He is now gone to the <lb/>
            temple, where thou (O woman !) mull: declare, <lb/>
            at last, who thou art; and then thou wilt <lb/>
            not fail of meeting with every assistance that <lb/>
            justice may require. Thou needed but speak <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
            to <lb/>

            to him frankly, and without concealing a <lb/>
            fingle circumstance of the truth ; and by this <lb/>
            means thou wilt excite, Hill more, his good <lb/>
            will towards thee. Callirrhoe consented <lb/>
            to go, though with the utmost reluctance. <lb/>
            However, she assumed more confidence when <lb/>
            the reflected that the temple was to be the scene <lb/>
            of their conference. Being entered it, all the <lb/>
            spectators were still more inchanted with her <lb/>
            beauty ; and Dionyfius, loft in wonder, was <lb/>
            struck dumb. After a long filence, he, at <lb/>
            last, but with the greater difficulty, broke <lb/>
            into the following words;—Thou haft been <lb/>
            informed (0 woman !) of the whole state of my <lb/>
            affairs. I am Dionyfius, the first man in Mi­ <lb/>

            ed for my piety towards the gods, and my <lb/>
            humanity towards men. It is juft that thou, <lb/>
            on,the other hand, do give me a faithful ac­ <lb/>
            count of thy felf; for thofe who difpofed of <lb/>

            thee, faid, that thou art of Sybaris; and wert <lb/>
            fold by a mistress who was jealous of thee.— <lb/>
            Here a blufh overspread Callirrhoe's cheek; <lb/>
            when turning her eyes to the ground, the <lb/>
            fpake thus :1 never was fold till now ; <lb/>
            nor have I once feen Sybaris. 1 told thee, <lb/>
            (faid Dionyfius, looking at his steward) that <lb/>
            she was not a Have ; and I even imagine her <lb/>
            to be of noble birth. Inform me (0 woman !) <lb/>
            of every thing relative to thy felf; but first <lb/>
            tell me thy name. Callirrhoe (anfwered <lb/>
            she.)—Her very name was pleating to Diony­ <lb/>
            sius ; and this was all she then revealed. But <lb/>
            he, being still very urgent, and employing the <lb/>
            warmed prayers and entreaties :The only <lb/>
            favour (cried she, my Lord) I humbly requefl <lb/>
            is, that I may be permitted to conceal my ftory. <lb/>
            The paft appears all like a dream or as a fa­ <lb/>

            ing this, she endeavoured to wave making any <lb/>
            farther anfwer; when the tears trickling fi­ <lb/>
            lently down her cheeks ; Dionysius, and all <lb/>
            the reft of the spectators, could not for­ <lb/>
            bear fympathizing with her ; while fome <lb/>
            imagined that they beheld the sorrowing Ve­ <lb/>

            more enflamed, adding further intreaties, <lb/>
            continued thus :O Callirrhoe ! the first <lb/>

            not afraid ; even though thou shouldest have <lb/>
            committed fome wicked crime ? There <lb/>
            words excited Callirrhoe's indignation: <lb/>
            Alas ! (faid (he) fpeak not thus injuriously to <lb/>
            me. My conscience does not upbraid me with <lb/>
            guilt of any kind : But as my birth and for­ <lb/>
            tune were infinitely more illuftrious than my <lb/>
            prefent <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            prefent condition; I would not be thought <lb/>
            a vain boaster, nor relate particulars, which <lb/>
            must appear incredible to all who might be <lb/>
            unacquainted with them. The recollection <lb/>
            of my former happy state would be of no ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to me now. Dionyfius, admiring <lb/>
            the woman's noble Spirit, faid : I under­ <lb/>
            hand thee, though thou speakest not, fo <lb/>
            emphatical is thy silence. Yet tell me all; <lb/>
            though all thou couldest fay, of thyfelf, would <lb/>
            fall far fhort of what we now behold ; and <lb/>
            every circumstance, how shining foever, which <lb/>
            thou mighteft relate, would be faint in com­ <lb/>
            parifon of thy felf. At laR Callirrhoe thus <lb/>
            began, but with great reluctance, her story.— <lb/>
            I am daughter to Hermocrates, Prætor of Sy­ <lb/>
            racufe. A fudden fall, on the ground, hav­ <lb/>
            ing left me speechlefs ; my parents buried me <lb/>
            at a vast expence, and with great funeral <lb/>
            pomp. Certain pyrates, being afterwards <note type="footnote"> G 3 </note> <lb/>
            allured <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            allured by the treasures deported in the sepul­ <lb/>
            chre, broke into it; and there found me; <lb/>
            who, by that time, had recovered my breath, <lb/>
            They then brought me hither ; and Theron <lb/>
            delivered me to Leonas, in this folitude. <lb/>
            She then told him every thing (except what <lb/>
            related -to Chæreas) and went on thus: <lb/>
            I befeech thee (0 Dionyfius) as thou art a <lb/>
            Greek; as thou art the inhabitant of a city <lb/>
            where humanity flourishes; and art enlighten­ <lb/>
            ed by a liberal education, not to imitate thofe <lb/>
            sepulchral robbers, by depriving me of my <lb/>
            country and of my relations. Rich as thou <lb/>
            art, in flaves, the difmiffing of one would <lb/>
            be a trifle to thee. Thou wilt not be a lofer <lb/>
            by restoring me to my father : for Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates is no ways ungrateful. All men praife <lb/>
            and love Alcinous, because he font back the <lb/>
            fuppliant Ulysses to his native country. I <lb/>
            alfo implore thee, to save a loft woman, who <lb/>
            is <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Is made a captive, and in the hands of ene­ <lb/>
            mies. If I may not live in a manner Suitable <lb/>
            to my birth, let me die free. Dionyfius, <lb/>
            at hearing thefe words, teemed to weep for <lb/>
            Callirrhoe's misfortunes; but in reality he <lb/>
            bewailed his own ; as be now perceived, that <lb/>
            be fhould not obtain what he fo ardently <lb/>
            wished.—Do not defpond (faid he) 0 Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe! but arm thy felf with courage, for <lb/>
            every desire of thine shall be gratified; and <lb/>
            may Venus, in whofe pretence we now stand, <lb/>
            bear witnefs to this declaration ! In the mean <lb/>
            time, thou shalt be treated here like a mi­ <lb/>
            stress, rather than as a slave.—— Callirrhoe <lb/>
            left the temple, with a firm perfuafion, that <lb/>
            she should not be made to fuffer any thing re­ <lb/>
            pugnant to her inclinations.</p>
          <p>VI, Dionyfius returned home in great af­ <lb/>
            fliction ; when calling Leonas to him in pri- <note type="footnote"> G 4 </note> <lb/>
            vate, <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            vate, be fpake thus: I am unfortunate in <lb/>
            all things ! The God of Love is my inveterate <lb/>
            foe. I have buried my wife; and the woman <lb/>
            lately purchased despises me; though I had <lb/>
            hoped, that fhe was a gift bellowed upon <lb/>
            me by Venus; and thence figured to my self <lb/>
            a life far happier than that led by Menelaus, <lb/>
            husband to the Spartan Dame ; for surely He­ <lb/>
            len was not so beautiful as Callirrhoe. The <lb/>
            goddefs of perfuafion fits upon her lips. My <lb/>
            life is at an end. The day that Callirrhoe <lb/>
            departs from hence, will be my laft. Here <lb/>
            Leonas cried aloud :—No (my good Lord) <lb/>
            do not commit violence on thy felf. I am <lb/>
            her master; to that thou mayeft ufe thy plea­ <lb/>
            fure with Callirrhoe, be this agreeable to her <lb/>
            or not; I having paid a talent for her.— <lb/>
            How, wretch ! (cried Dionyfius) haft thou <lb/>
            purchased a woman of noble birth, and pof­ <lb/>
            fessed of the fineft accomplishments ? Haft <lb/>
            thou <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            thou not heard of Hermocrates, Prætor of the <lb/>
            greater part of Sicily; efteemed and beloved <lb/>
            by the king of Perfia ; that monarch ranking <lb/>
            him among thofe who deferve well of the em­ <lb/>
            pire ; and fending him prefents annually; for <lb/>
            his having difcomfitted, in a naval engage­ <lb/>
            ment, the Athenians, enemies to the Per­ <lb/>
            sians? And fhall I, (tyrant-like) cruelly in­ <lb/>
            jure a free-born maid? Shall Dionyfius, famed <lb/>
            for his continence, be fo infolently wicked as <lb/>
            to violate a woman, whom even Theron the <lb/>
            pyrate did not presume to touch ?It was <lb/>
            thus Dionyfius fpake to Leonas; and yet he <lb/>
            did not defpair of winning Callirrhoe's affec­ <lb/>
            tion by in treaties; love naturally Inspiring <lb/>
            hope; and Dionyfius not doubting, but that <lb/>
            he should obtain his withes by kindnefs and <lb/>
            affiduity. Then fending for Plangon : <lb/>
            Thou haft hitherto (faid he) given me proofs <lb/>
            sufficient of thy care. I now recommend, <lb/>
            I now deliver up to thee, in charge, the most <lb/>
            pre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            precious, the most dear part of my riches; <lb/>
            the lovely Granger. I command that fhe want <lb/>
            for nothing; but, on the contrary, that she <lb/>
            be entertained even to luxury. Look upon <lb/>
            her as thy mistress; wait on her ; reverence <lb/>
            her; deck her splendidly; and do all thou <lb/>
            canft to win me her affection. Praise me fre­ <lb/>
            quently before Callirrhoe; and represent me, <lb/>
            to her, fuch as thou knowest Dionyfius to be; <lb/>
            but beware of calling me her master. <lb/>
            Plangon immediately underwood this com­ <lb/>
            mand ;the being an artful, shrewd woman, <lb/>
            who, without faying much, comprehended an <lb/>
            affair in an Infant; and thereupon made it <lb/>
            her whole study to perfect it. Going then to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, the did not declare that any di­ <lb/>
            rections had been given her on this occafion : <lb/>
            but behaved with the ut most complacency and <lb/>
            Kindnefs ; in order that Callirrhoe might re­ <lb/>
            pose all possible confidence in her, whenever <lb/>
            fhe <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            she should be defirous of insinuating her felf <lb/>
            into her good graces, and of offering ad. <lb/>
            vice.</p>
          <p>VII. In the mean time the following incl­ <lb/>
            dent happened. Dionyfius did not leave his <lb/>
            Villa; he now feigning one excufe, then <lb/>
            another; but the true and only rear on was, <lb/>
            he could not tear himself, from Callirrhoe; <lb/>
            nor yet would he take her with him to the, <lb/>
            city. He was sensible that (he, if once feen <lb/>
            there, would foon be celebrated ; that her <lb/>
            wonderful beauty muft enslave all Ionia ; and <lb/>
            that the fame of it could not but reach the <lb/>
            ear of the great king. Now it happened that <lb/>
            Dionyfius, having examined very accurately <lb/>
            into the general state of his rural affairs ; found <lb/>
            caufe to cenfure Phocas, his under steward, <lb/>
            on account of a certain article. The reproof, <lb/>
            however, went no farther than words: but <lb/>
            Plangon, feizing this opportunity. flew all <lb/>
            trembling <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            trembling to Callirrhoe; when tearing her <lb/>
            hair, and clafping her knees; ;-Good Lady <lb/>
            (faid she) fave us, I befeech you ! Dionyfius <lb/>
            is highly exafperated at my hufband. My <lb/>
            Lord is naturally very paffionate; and yet is <lb/>
            distinguished for his humanity. Thou only <lb/>
            canst rescue us from this impending danger. <lb/>
            Dionyfius, if thou but afk him, will willing­ <lb/>
            ly grant thee this thy firft requeft.Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe was afraid of waiting upon Dionyfius ; <lb/>
            and yet she would not venture to refute Plan­ <lb/>
            gon's urgent intreaties and earned prayer; as <lb/>
            she was bound to her by so many fignal obli­ <lb/>
            gations. That she therefore might not ap­ <lb/>
            pear ungrateful, the faid thus :I albo am <lb/>
            a servant, and have not the confidence to <lb/>
            fpeak; but if thou Imagined, that I may have <lb/>
            any influence, I am ready to add my suppli­ <lb/>
            cations to thine; and may the gods give a <lb/>
            happy issue to our endeavours! Being come <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            to Dionyfius's apartment, Plangon bid the <lb/>
            door-keeper inform his Lord, that Callirrhoc <lb/>
            attended.—Dionysius was then lying down; <lb/>
            pale, funk in grief, and half dead. Hearing <lb/>
            that Callirrhoe was at the door, he was struck <lb/>
            dumb; and a cloud seemed to overspread his <lb/>
            mind at this unexpected event, fo that he <lb/>
            could Scarce draw his breath ; but recovering <lb/>
            it at last, he cried :Let her come in !— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe advancing near him with downcast <lb/>
            eyes ; her cheeks were instantly covered with <lb/>
            blufhes, when fhe, with confuted accents, <lb/>
            afterwards spake in manner following: <lb/>
            I owe this favour to Plangon ; for she loves <lb/>
            me as though I were her child. I therefore <lb/>
            befeech thee (my Lord) not to be angry with <lb/>
            her hufband; but to pardon him, at my <lb/>
            humble intercession. She would have said <lb/>
            more, but her voice forfook her. Dionyfius, <lb/>
            who immediately faw through Plangon's ftra­ <lb/>
            tagem, <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            tagem, said :I am extremely offended y <lb/>
            and no perfon living fhould have faved Phocas <lb/>
            and Plangon, from the most rigorous punifh­ <lb/>
            ment, after the crimes they have dared to <lb/>
            commit. I yet will pardon them willingly at <lb/>
            thy requeft. Then turning to Plangon : <lb/>
            Do thou ( faid he) remember, that ye were <lb/>
            forgiven at Callirrhoe's defire.Plangon <lb/>
            foiling at her Lord's feet:—Rather prostrate <lb/>
            your self (said he) before Callirrhoe, for it <lb/>
            was she who saved you. Plangon obferv­ <lb/>
            ing joy to Sparkle in Callirrhoe's eyes ; and the <lb/>
            vast pleafure she felt, now she had obtained <lb/>
            her suit : Do thou (faid she) return our <lb/>
            most dutiful, and most grateful thanks to <lb/>
            Dionyfius; at which words, (he pushed her <lb/>
            forward. Callirrhoe happening to flip, fell <lb/>
            on Dionyfius's arm; who, at the fame time <lb/>
            that he teemed to scorn to lend her his hand <lb/>
            to rife, drew her towards himself ; when he <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
            gave <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            gave her a kifs; but immediately let her go ; <lb/>
            in order that the artifice, employed by him, <lb/>
            might not create fufpicion.</p>
          <p>VIII. The women then went away; but <lb/>
            the kifs, which Dionysius had feized, glided <lb/>
            like poifon through his veins, so that he could <lb/>
            neither fee nor hear. The god of Love as­ <lb/>
            failed and triumphed over him on every side ; <lb/>
            and he was unable to find a cure to his paf­ <lb/>
            fion. Dionysius, when he restected on the <lb/>
            greatnefs of Callirrhae's foul, was perfuaded <lb/>
            that gifts could never win her: and, on the <lb/>
            other hand, that threats muft be equally in­ <lb/>
            effectual; he knowing, that she would die <lb/>
            rather than fubmit to violence. Imagining <lb/>
            now that his hopes lay in Plangon only, lie <lb/>
            fent for her, and fpake thus :Thou did it <lb/>
            hit upon the firft delightful stratagem ; and I <lb/>
            thank thee for the kifs, which has either <lb/>
            formed <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            formed my felicity, or will deftroy me. Do <lb/>
            thou then, who art a woman, try how far <lb/>
            thou (assisted by me in the contest) can a over­ <lb/>
            reach, and defeat, one of thine own sex. <lb/>
            Know that liberty will be thy recompence ; <lb/>
            and, what I am certain is still dearer to thee <lb/>
            than liberty, the life of Dionyfius.Plangon <lb/>
            having received there commands, had recourse <lb/>
            to every experiment and every artifice; but all <lb/>
            in vain ; Callirrhoe being invincible, and true <lb/>
            to Chæreas only. Yet was she conquered by <lb/>
            the infidious wiles of fortune, which baffle <lb/>
            all the exertions of human rcafon : for For­ <lb/>
            tune is a very contentious goddess, from <lb/>
            whom every thing, how unaccountable soever, <lb/>
            may be exposed. It is therefore not to be <lb/>
            wondered at, that she then brought to matu­ <lb/>
            rity an affair, that was wholly unthought of, <lb/>
            and Seemingly impoffible. The manner in <lb/>
            which this was compassed is highly worthy <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            of out notice. Fortune spread a snare to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe's chaRity. Chæreas and .the, on <lb/>
            the night of their nuptials, had given each <lb/>
            other fuch ardent proofs -of their reciprocal <lb/>
            love, that it was not without fruit. She con­ <lb/>
            ceived, a little before the fatal blow was given <lb/>
            her by Chæreas; but was prevented from <lb/>
            observing it, by the many dangers to which <lb/>
            fhe had been exposed, and the fad.misfortunes <lb/>
            fubfequent to them. It! the beginning of the <lb/>
            third month, Callirrhoe gave fymptoms that <lb/>
            the was pregnant; a circumstance which <lb/>
            Plangon (who was well skilled in there mat­ <lb/>
            ters) difcovered in the bath. However, fle <lb/>
            took no notice of it then, as many female at­ <lb/>
            tendants were present; but, towards the <lb/>
            evening, Plangon being at leisure, and find­ <lb/>
            ing a convenient opportunity, she feated her­ <lb/>
            felf by the bed-fide, and fpake thus:- <lb/>

            leg —Callirrhoe, at thefe words, groaned <lb/>
            and wept; then tearing her hair, she cried as <lb/>
            follows :Thou (0 Fortune !) to my other <lb/>
            fad sufferings, doft add that of my bringing <lb/>

          <p>IX. Thefe two. women, Separating after­ <lb/>
            wards, made their feveral reflexions. Plan­ <lb/>
            gon imagining, as she knew Callirrhoe was <lb/>
            preg­ <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            pregnant, that then was a fit time for giving <lb/>
            succefs to her mailer's paffion: I now <lb/>
            (faid Plangon, in her own mind) have hit <lb/>
            upon an argument which furely muff weigh <lb/>
            with Callirrhoe: viz. that maternal piety <lb/>
            ought to triumph over conjugal continence.— <lb/>
            Plangon applauded herfelf for this lucky <lb/>
            thought (for fuch she considered it*:) but <lb/>
            Callirrhoe refolved within herfelf, at first, to <lb/>
            destroy her fruit ; the reasoning thus:— <lb/>
            Shall I bring forth, to one whore slave I am, <lb/>
            the grand-fon of Hermocrates ? Shall I give <lb/>
            birth to an infant whore father no perfon can <note type="footnote"> * The meaning of this is, that Plangon fuppofed <lb/>
            file fhould prevail with Callirrhoe to preserve her <lb/>
            fruit, from this reflection ; viz. that the saving of <lb/>
            it would be a more meritorious action, (in propor­ <lb/>
            tion ;) than the violating her conjugal fidelity (by <lb/>
            her complying with Dionysius's passion) would be a <lb/>
            criminal one. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>

            tauntingly fay, that Callirrhoe conceived while <lb/>
            among' pyrates. Suffice it that I only be <lb/>

            Thou feemeft even more inhuman than that <lb/>

            But fuppofe thou shouldest be delivered of a <lb/>

            Wife! (cried he) I commit my fon (sweet <lb/>
            pledge!) in trust to thee:—When he, going to <lb/>
            fay more, Callirrhoe Parted from her slum­ <lb/>
            bers, and flew to embrace him. She now <lb/>
            was firmly resolved to preferve and bring up <lb/>
            her infant; as imagining that fuch was her <lb/>
            husband's counsel.</p>
          <p>X. The next day Plangon coming to Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe, the latter acquainted her with her <lb/>
            refolution, which Plangon did not think fea­ <lb/>
            fonable, fo would not approve of it.—Wo­ <lb/>
            man (faid she) it will be impoffible for thee <lb/>
            to bring up thy fon in this houfe. My Lord <lb/>
            has a fincere love for thee ; and is too hu­ <lb/>
            mane, too modest, to employ forcible me­ <lb/>
            thods, in order to bring thee to his will: <lb/>
            but, on the other hand, he is too jealous to <lb/>
            let thee nurfe thy child here. He would look <lb/>
            upon this as injurious to himself; as though <lb/>
            thou <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            thou thoughteft very affectionately and ho­ <lb/>
            nourably of him when abfent, but contempt­ <lb/>
            ibly when present. I therefore think that <lb/>
            thou hadft better destroy the infant before its <lb/>
            birth, than when born ; fince thou, by this <lb/>
            means, wilt efcape the inconveniencies at­ <lb/>
            tending on pregnancy, and the pains of child- <lb/>
            birth. It is my affection for thee, that <lb/>
            prompts me to give this falutary advice.—— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe was not pleated at what she now <lb/>
            heard; when throwing herfelf at Plangent <lb/>
            feet; I conjure thee (faid Callirrhoe) to <lb/>
            join with me, in contriving fome method by <lb/>
            which I may be enabled to preferve and bring <lb/>
            up the child.— But Plangon, after many <lb/>
            denials, faid she would give her an answer <lb/>
            in two or three days. Callirrhoe growing <lb/>
            still more carneA in her intreaties, which in­ <lb/>
            creafed Plangon's confidence and authority; <lb/>
            the latter began by making Callirrhoe swear, <note type="footnote"> H 4 </note> <lb/>
            not <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            not to mention one tingle word, to any per­ <lb/>
            fon, of an artifice she meditated. Then <lb/>
            knitting her brows, and wringing her hands, <lb/>
            like to persons in the deeper affliction : <lb/>
            My dear woman (cried she) great things can­ <lb/>
            not be atchieved without attempting greatly ; <lb/>
            and I, from the love I bear thee, will impose <lb/>
            upon ray Lord. Know then, that one of <lb/>
            there two things must come to pass ; either <lb/>
            the child muft be destroyed ; or be born <lb/>
            heir to the richer man, and of the most il­ <lb/>
            lustrious family, in all Ionia; and thus make <lb/>
            thee a perfectly happy mother. I now leave <lb/>
            thee to thy choice.——What woman (replied <lb/>
            Callirrhoe) could be fo mad, as to prefer <lb/>
            the murthering of her infant, to felicity ? <lb/>
            What thou now teller me feems incredible <lb/>
            and impossible; and therefore explain thy­ <lb/>
            felf more clearly. How long (faid Plan­ <lb/>
            gon) haft thou been pregnant ?Callirrhoe <lb/>
            re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            replied About two months. — That <lb/>
            time (faid the former) will be of very great <lb/>
            service to us; as it may be supposed, that <lb/>
            thou broughtest a child, to Dionyfius, at <lb/>
            feven months end. At thefe words Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe cried aloud : O rather let it pe­ <lb/>
            rish!—Plangon then employing dissimula­ <lb/>
            tion : Woman (faid she) thou judged <lb/>
            wifely, in chufing rather to destroy thy fruit. <lb/>
            Let this be done, as it will be less dangerous <lb/>
            than to impofe -upon my matter. Eraze then, <lb/>
            from thy memory, all thoughts of thy nobi­ <lb/>
            lity ; and entertain no farther hopes of ever <lb/>
            returning to thy native country. Suit thy self <lb/>
            to. thy present mean condition, and be truly <lb/>
            a Have. While Plangon was thus employ­ <lb/>
            ing all the powers of persuasion ; the young <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, being ingenuous and unacquaint­ <lb/>
            ed with the mean wiles of Servants, did not <lb/>
            entertain the least fufpicion. But the more <lb/>
            urgent <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            urgent Plangon was, for Callirrhoe to make <lb/>
            away with her infant, the more it raifed the <lb/>
            future mother's compassion.—Give me (faid <lb/>
            she) time to deliberate; as I must chufe be­ <lb/>
            tween two mighty things, viz. either my <lb/>
            chastity, or my child.—Plangon again corn­ <lb/>
            mended her, for not making her option <lb/>
            rashly ; as equal reasons might be given, in <lb/>
            favour, of either resolution; fince the one <lb/>
            pleaded for conjugal fidelity, and the other <lb/>
            for maternal love. However, (added she) <lb/>
            there is no time for delay; thou mull: abso­ <lb/>
            lutely determine, one way or other, by to- <lb/>
            morrow at farthest, and before thy preg­ <lb/>
            nancy shall be discovered. Having thus <lb/>
            settled matters, they parted.</p>
          <p>XI. Callirrhoe then retired to an upper <lb/>
            apartment, when Shutting the door, she laid <lb/>
            Chæreas's picture upon her bofom, and said— <lb/>
            We <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            We are now three; hufband, wife and child. <lb/>
            Let us deliberate on our common welfare. <lb/>
            In the mean time I will firft declare my opi­ <lb/>
            nion, and that is, to die the wife of Chæ­ <lb/>
            rcas only. The having no commerce with <lb/>
            any other man, will be dearer to me than my <lb/>
            parents, my country, or my child. And <lb/>
            now, (my fweet babe f) what is thy choice ? <lb/>
            To die by poifon, and not behold the fun; <lb/>
            to be caft out with thy mother; and, per­ <lb/>
            haps, not to be allowed even a grave: or, on <lb/>
            the other hand, to live, and be the child of <lb/>
            two fathers; the one prince of Sicily, the <lb/>
            other of Ionia ? Being afterwards arrived at <lb/>
            manhood, thou wilt eafily be known by thy <lb/>
            parents and kindred; for firmly perfuaded I <lb/>
            am, that thou, when born, wilt refemble <lb/>
            thy father. Thou wilt fail to thy native coun­ <lb/>
            try with fplendor, in a Milefian (hip. Her­ <lb/>
            mocrates will joyfully receive his grand-Ion; <lb/>
            by <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            by that time qualified to command on the <lb/>
            ocean. Thy determination (0 my child !) <lb/>
            is contrary to mine; and docs not permit me <lb/>
            to die. Let us now hear and consult also <lb/>
            thy father. But he has already given his <lb/>
            opinion ; for, standing before me in a dream, <lb/>
            he faid :I give (0 wife !) my boy in truft <lb/>
            to thee. I call thee (0 Chæreas !) to witnefs, <lb/>
            that it is thou who leaded me to wed Diony­ <lb/>
            fins. Callirrhoe passed that day and the <lb/>
            following night in fuch reflexions; and re­ <lb/>
            solved at last to live ; not for her own fake, <lb/>
            but for that of her Child. Plangon coming <lb/>
            to her next morning, fat down at firft with <lb/>
            an air of melancholy, and as one who would <lb/>
            condole her: when both remained silent for <lb/>
            a long time; but, at last, Plangon fpake <lb/>
            thus :What hast thou refolved upon ? <lb/>
            How are we to act ? We have no time to <lb/>
            lofe. Callirrhoe could not immediately re­ <lb/>
            turn <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            tUfa an answer; her tears, and her grief, <lb/>
            retraining her tongue ; but, at laft, the foL­ <lb/>
            lowing words burft from her. My child <lb/>
            betrays me againft my will. Do whatever <lb/>
            thou thinker may be befit But I fear, that <lb/>
            fhould I yield to Dionysius's defires he yet <lb/>
            would contemn my abject condition; and <lb/>
            looking upon me as his harlot, rather than <lb/>
            as his wife, will not therefore bring up an­ <lb/>
            other man's son. Thus might I facrifice my <lb/>
            continence without reaping the leaft bene­ <lb/>
            fit.Having faid there words, Plangon in­ <lb/>
            terrupted her:—I have reflected, (faid she) <lb/>
            on this affair long before thee, and taken <lb/>
            the proper meafures. I love thee more than <lb/>
            I do my Lord. Trust then to Dionyfius's <lb/>
            humanity. He is an excellent man: but <lb/>
            though he is my matter, I yet will extort <lb/>
            an oath from him. It is necessary that we <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            act with the utmoft caution; and do thou <lb/>
            (my child!) in the mean time, confide in <lb/>
            me. I will now go, and carry thy mef­ <lb/>
            fage.</p>

            IONYSIUS, now imagining that <lb/>
            he was repulfed by his darling Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe; and his patience being exhausted, <lb/>
            he refolved to starve himself. He then made <lb/>
            his will, in which he gave directions for his <lb/>
            funeral ; and conjured Callirrhoe to vifit him, <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>
            though <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            though he were dead. Now Plangon was <lb/>
            going into her Lord's apartment, when a fer­ <lb/>
            vant, who had received orders not to admit <lb/>
            any one, stopt her. Dionyfius heard a noife <lb/>
            and quarrelling at the door, when enquiring <lb/>
            about it; and the Servant telling him that <lb/>
            Plangon was there :She is come (faid the <lb/>
            master) at an unfeafonable time he not <lb/>
            caring to fee any object which might remind <lb/>
            him of his passion -However, call in Plan­ <lb/>
            gon, (faid Dionyfius :) upon which she open­ <lb/>
            ed the door, and fpake as follows. Why <lb/>
            doft thou (my Lord!) thus torture thy self, <lb/>
            and pine away with forrow, as though thou <lb/>
            wert disdained ; since Callirrhoe invites thee <lb/>
            to join with her in the bands of hymen. <lb/>
            Drefs thy felf then in splendid attire ; offer <lb/>
            up sacrifices and give feastings, and receive <lb/>
            thy much-loved bride.—Dionysius was all <lb/>
            amazement at this unexpected news; and his <lb/>
            eyes, <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            eyes, as well as mind, were veiled in darkness. <lb/>
            Being wafted through falling, he appeared <lb/>
            like one dead ; whe,n Plangon making bitter <lb/>
            moan, alarmed the whole family, who ran <lb/>
            up and down, and bewailed their matter as <lb/>
            though he had been dead. Callirrhoe her <lb/>
            felf could not refrain from tears on this me­ <lb/>
            lancholy occasion: and fo piercing was her <lb/>
            grief, that she could not forbear deploring <lb/>
            Dionyfius's lots, as though he had been her <lb/>
            hufband. A little time after, Dionyfius re­ <lb/>
            covering himfelf, though with great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty ; What deity (said he, in a feeble <lb/>

            piness. I do not impofe upon my master : ses <lb/>
            Callirrhoe has rent me to fpeak to thee con­ <lb/>
            cerning the nuptials.—Do thou then (faid <lb/>
            Dionysius) deliver the message. Repeat her <lb/>
            very words without the lead addition or di­ <lb/>
            minution ; consequently exactly as she fpake <lb/>
            them.-Hereupon Plangon went on thus:- <lb/>
            Callirrhoe faid ; the houfe I Sprung from is <lb/>
            the lirA in all Sicily. Though I have been <lb/>
            unhappy, I yet preserve the greatnefs of foul <lb/>
            which I inherited. Fortune forced me from <lb/>
            my native country, and my parents; but <lb/>
            could not rob me of the fplendor of my birth. <lb/>
            If Dionyfius intends me for his concubine, <lb/>
            merely to fatiate his luft; I will kill my self, <lb/>
            rather than Submit to fo flavifh, fo fhameful <lb/>
            a prostitution. If, on the other hand, he <lb/>
            intends to make me his lawful wife, I then <lb/>
            a <lb/>
            will gladly become a mother, in order to give <lb/>
            idue to the houfe of Hermocrates. Let Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            nyfius deliberate on this, not merely in his own <lb/>
            mind, nor hastily, but with his kindred and <lb/>
            friends; that no one may afterwards re­ <lb/>
            proach him, by faying: Thou didst nur­ <lb/>
            ture children whom thou hadst by a Gave, <lb/>
            and art a difgrace to thy family. If he will <lb/>
            not be a father, let him not be a husband.— <lb/>
            Thefe words inflamed Dionyfius Mill more ; <lb/>
            and gave him fome little glimmerings of hope, <lb/>
            that Callirrhoe might possibly return him <lb/>
            love for love. Then lifting up his hands to­ <lb/>
            wards the skies: Grant me (faid he) 0 <lb/>
            Jupiter ! 0 Phoebus ! a fon by Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            This being indulged, I shall think my felf <lb/>
            more happy than the great king. Let us now <lb/>
            go to her ; and do thou (Plangon !) whofe <lb/>
            affection for thy master is fo strong, be my <lb/>
            guide.</p>
          <p>II. They then went swistly to the upper <lb/>
            apartment, when Dionyfius going, at first, <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            to fall hastily at Callirrhoe's feet, restrained <lb/>
            himfelf; and fitting down with the gravity <lb/>
            becoming a man of high rank, he fpake <lb/>
            thus: -I am come (my fair one !) to return <lb/>
            thee thanks for having faved my life; for I <lb/>
            should never have employed force, hadst thou <lb/>
            opposed my wishes; but was refolved to die, <lb/>
            had I been disappointed in my hopes. Thou <lb/>
            haft restored me to existence; and though <lb/>
            I owe thee infinite obligations, I yet must <lb/>
            blame thee in one particular, viz. for not <lb/>
            thinking that I would make thee my bride <lb/>
            purfuant to the laws of Greece, in order for <lb/>
            us to have legitimate children. Did I not <lb/>
            love thee, I should never have wished for <lb/>
            fuch nuptials. But thou (methinks) must look <lb/>
            upon me as out of my senses, to imagine, that <lb/>
            I would treat a woman nobly born, as a <lb/>
            slave; or to conclude that it were derogatory <lb/>
            to me, to have a child who should be the <lb/>
            grand- <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            grand-Ion of Hermocrates. Thou defireft <lb/>
            me to deliberate upon this. I have done that <lb/>
            already. Thou art afraid of my friends; <lb/>
            thou, whom I prize above them all. Who <lb/>
            will presume to hint, that a fon of mine, <lb/>
            whore grandfire is more illustrious than his <lb/>
            father, is unworthy of me ? Saying there <lb/>
            words, which tears interrupted, he drew <lb/>
            nearer to Callirrhoe, who blushing, gave him <lb/>
            a gentle kifs, and faid : Dionysius ! I do, <lb/>
            indeed, truft to thee, but I cannot trust to <lb/>
            Fortune ; because the lately tore me from the <lb/>
            enjoyment of the chief terrestrial bIer. <lb/>
            sings: and I am afraid she will not be fincerely <lb/>
            reconciled to me for the future. Do thou <lb/>
            then, as a man of the strictest honour and <lb/>
            juftice, call the gods to witness ; not for thy­ <lb/>
            felf, but for thy citizens and kindred ; in or­ <lb/>
            der that no one may be induced to form any <lb/>
            malicious attempt againft me hereaster; when <note type="footnote"> I 3 </note> <lb/>
            they <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            they that! be told of the oath thou haft taken. <lb/>
            A woman without friends, and a foreigner, <lb/>
            is much exposed to contempt and ill usage.— <lb/>
            By what Deity (cried Dionysius) wouldest <lb/>
            thou have me fwear ? I am ready (were this <lb/>
            poffible) to soar to the fkies, and there, clafp­ <lb/>
            ing the knees of Jupiter, to fwear by him.— <lb/>
            Swear (faid Callirrhoe) by Neptune, because <lb/>
            he brought me hither; by Venus, who first <lb/>
            pointed me out to thee ; and by Cupid, who <lb/>
            leadeth me to thee as thy bride. This <lb/>
            pleated Dionyfius, and he immediately took <lb/>
            the oath. Cupid was now overjoyed to add <lb/>
            to the number of his triumphs. Dionyfius's <lb/>
            love increasing, he could not bear the thoughts <lb/>
            of delaying his marriage ; it being extremely <lb/>
            difficult for man to check the gratifying of his <lb/>
            defires. But Dionyfius, who had received <lb/>
            an excellent education, felt a temper in his <lb/>
            breast, and his foul was much funk. He yet <lb/>
            struggled <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            struggled with all his might, against the bit. <lb/>
            lows (as it were) of his paffion; to prevent <lb/>
            his being shipwrecked by its violence. He <lb/>
            then made the following reflections, by which <lb/>
            he endeavoured to fix his reliefs mind.- <lb/>
            Shall I wed, in a folitude, and without wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, a woman whom money purchased ? <lb/>
            It would argue the utmoft meannefs in me not <lb/>
            to celebrate my nuptials, with Callirrhoe, in <lb/>
            the most folemn manner. In the first place, <lb/>
            I ought to pay every honour to this woman, <lb/>
            as it will insure my future felicity. Fame is <lb/>
            the fleeteft and most prying of all messen­ <lb/>
            gers ; and wings the air with a rapid and un­ <lb/>
            checked progress. From her, things, if ever <lb/>
            fo orange, cannot be concealed. She already <lb/>
            flies to Sicily with the following news ; Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe is still living. Robbers, having broke <lb/>
            open the sepulchre, stole her from thence, <lb/>
            and fold her in Miletus. Hither will arrive <note type="footnote"> I 4 </note> <lb/>
            a fleet <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            a fleet of Syracufian gallies, under Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates, to demand his daughter. What (hall <lb/>
            I then fay ? Theron fold her to me. But <lb/>
            where is Theron to be found? Supposing <lb/>
            that my words were credited, it then would <lb/>
            appear that I had given shelter to a pyrate. <lb/>
            Reflect (0 Dionyfius !) on this affair; which <lb/>
            thou, perhaps, mayeft be obliged to debate <lb/>
            before the great king. It will therefore be <lb/>
            best for me to be able to fay thus :Being <lb/>
            informed that a woman of birth was, by I <lb/>
            know not what accident, brought to this <lb/>
            place; I afterwards efpoufed her, with her <lb/>
            own content pursuant to the laws. By this <lb/>
            conduct I shall persuade my father in law, <lb/>
            that I am not unworthy of his alliance. Be <lb/>
            stedfast (my foul!) fome little time more ; in <lb/>
            order that thou mayeft enjoy the longer, and <lb/>
            with greater fecurity, all thy pleasure. I <lb/>
            then shall have more influence at the trial, by <lb/>
            appear­ <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
             <lb/>
            appearing as a hufband, not as a master.— <lb/>
            Having thus determined, he called Leonas, <lb/>
            and faid to him :Go to the city, and pre­ <lb/>
            pare the nuptials with as much magnificence <lb/>
            as thou mayest think necessary. Let herds <lb/>
            and flocks be brought thither, as albo corn and <lb/>
            wine both by fea and land ; for I am refolved <lb/>
            to invite the whole city to feast at my wed­ <lb/>
            ding.—Having carefully given directions for <lb/>
            every thing, he himfelf fet out for the city, <lb/>
            next day, in a chariot; ordering Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            whom he would not show publickly yet, to <lb/>
            be conveyed, about the evening, in a barge, <lb/>
            to his houfe which flood near the harbour <lb/>
            called Docimos. Now the first thing done <lb/>
            by Callirrhoe (who was delivered to the care <lb/>
            of Plangon) before file left the country, was <lb/>
            to offer up prayers to Venus; when entering <lb/>
            her temple, and causing every one to depart <lb/>
            from it, she thus addressed that Deity:- <lb/>
            Ought <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            Ought I (0 Venus ! my goddefs) to be of­ <lb/>
            fended with, or to return thee thanks ? Thou <lb/>
            didst give me in marriage, when a virgin, to <lb/>
            Chæreas: and thou wilt now bestow me, in <lb/>
            wedlock, upon another man. However, I <lb/>
            Should not have been compelled to this, (I <lb/>
            swear by thee, and by thy son) had not my <lb/>
            infant betrayed me: Saying which she <lb/>
            pointed to her bofom. I fupplicate thee for <lb/>
            his fake, not for my own. Grant that my ar­ <lb/>
            tifices may impose upon Dionyfius : and since <lb/>
            my babe has no real father, grant that he <lb/>
            may be thought the child of Dionyfius; for, <lb/>
            when arrived at years of maturity, he will <lb/>
            find out his father. Callirrhoe being come <lb/>
            from the temple to the fea-shore, the mari­ <lb/>
            ners gazed with astonishment; and were no <lb/>
            less charmed than if Venus herself had been <lb/>
            going on board. Crouds flocked round, and <lb/>
            all were eager to worship her. The rowers <lb/>
            exerted <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            exerted uncommon vigour; fo that the barge <lb/>
            arrived, quick as thought, at the port. By <lb/>
            day-break next morning the whole city wore <lb/>
            chaplets; when every one offered up victims, <lb/>
            not only in the temples, but before their own <lb/>
            doors. Various were the conjectures who the <lb/>
            bride could be. The lower fort of people <lb/>
            struck with her exquifite beauty, and not <lb/>
            knowing who fle was, were perfuaded that <lb/>
            one of the nereids was rifen out of the ocean ; <lb/>
            or that the goddess herself was come from <lb/>
            Dionyfius's fylvan Scenes ; the mariners hav­ <lb/>
            ing fpread a report, that she revealed herfelf <lb/>
            in them. The whole city had but one wish, <lb/>
            which was, to fee Callirrhoe; and the mul­ <lb/>
            titdde crouded to the temple of Concord, <lb/>
            where, pursuant to the Milefian custom, the <lb/>
            bridegroom was to receive his bride. Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe now, for the firft time fince her bu­ <lb/>
            rial, appeared in fplendid veftments: for <lb/>
            having <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            having till then'formed a resolution never to <lb/>
            marry again, she imagined that her country, <lb/>
            and her high rank, would ferve her inftead <lb/>
            of beauty. Being then clad in a flowing Mi­ <lb/>
            lefian robe, and adorned with the bridal <lb/>
            crown, fhe turned towards the people, when <lb/>
            they all cried aloud :These are the ef­ <lb/>
            poufals of Venus! Purple carpets were <lb/>
            fpread upon the ground; rofes, and violets <lb/>
            were brewed ; and ointments poured forth, <lb/>
            all the way fhe part. No one ftaid at home. <lb/>
            Old people and children came from their <lb/>
            dwellings; the port was quite a defart; and <lb/>
            many, by reafon of the vail crouds, climbed <lb/>
            to the tops of houses. But fome envious <lb/>
            God beheld that day, with inauspicious eyes, <lb/>
            as I will foon relate; after giving an account <lb/>
            of what passed, about the fame time, in Sy- <lb/>
            Tacufe. <lb/>

          <p>III. The robbers of the sepulchre had do­ <lb/>
            fed it very carelesly, as it was night, and as <lb/>
            they were in great haste to get away: and <lb/>
            Chaereas, fo Coon as it was day-break, went <lb/>
            thither ; upon pretence of carrying crowns or <lb/>
            chaplets and libations * ; but, in reality, with <lb/>
            a resolution to kill himself. As he was unable <lb/>
            to bear his reparation from Callirrhoe, he <lb/>
            thought that death only could heal his an­ <lb/>
            guish. Being come to the Mausolæum, he <lb/>
            found the stones of it had been moved, and <lb/>
            that the entrance was open. Chæreas was <lb/>
            terrified at the fight; and infinitely perplexed, <lb/>
            as he did not know how to account for what <lb/>
            he raw. Fame, that fwift-winged messenger, <lb/>
            foon fpread through Syracufe the news of this <lb/>
            unexpected event; whereupon the whole city <lb/>
            ran to the sepulchre; though no one durft <lb/>
            enter it, without an order from Hermocrates. <note type="footnote"> * Sacrifices to the dead are here meant. </note> <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>
            At <lb/>

            At laft, a perfon going in, and making an <lb/>
            exact report of what he had feen; no one <lb/>
            would believe that the dead body was not <lb/>
            there. Upon this Chæreas himfelf was de­ <lb/>
            termined to enter, from an ardent desire he <lb/>
            had to fee again his dear Callirrhoe, though <lb/>
            dead; but searching every part of the tomb, <lb/>
            he could not find the leaft traces of her. <lb/>
            Many not believing that this could be possible, <lb/>
            they themselves refolved to go in; and doing <lb/>
            fo, all were confounded, as not knowing <lb/>
            what had happened. One of the spectators <lb/>
            then landing up, cried aloud: The su­ <lb/>
            nereal treasures depofited here are stolen, <lb/>
            which must have been the horrid work of <lb/>
            robbers. But where is the dead body ?-The <lb/>
            populace formed a great variety of conjectures <lb/>
            on this occasion ; when Chæreas, lifting up <lb/>
            his hands towards heaven:---What God <lb/>
            (cried he) now become my rival, has fnatch­ <lb/>
            ed <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            ed away Callirrhoe; and by the fuperiority <lb/>
            of his power, withholds my ftruggling bride? <lb/>
            She was carried off instantly, that she might <lb/>
            not feel the stroke of death. Thus did Bac­ <lb/>
            chus rob Thefeus of Ariadne; and thus Jove <lb/>
            Hole Semele. But I knew not that my wife <lb/>
            was a goddess; and worthy the bed of the <lb/>
            immortals only. However, it was not necef­ <lb/>
            fary for her to have left the world fo suddenly <lb/>
            as she did, nor for fuch a caufe. Thetis alfo <lb/>
            was a goddess, and yet she continued true <lb/>
            to Peleus, and even had a fon by him. But <lb/>
            I was abandoned in the very flower, the height <lb/>
            of my passion. What shall I do? What <lb/>
            will become of wretched me ? Shall I lay <lb/>
            violent hands on my self ? But with whom <lb/>
            shall I be buried? for, in the midft of my <lb/>
            calamities, this single hope consoled me, viz. <lb/>
            that though I did not long enjoy the hyme­ <lb/>
            neal delights with Callirrhoe, yet that one <lb/>
            sepulchre <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            sepulchre would have held us both. I here <lb/>
            account to thee, (sweet creature!) for my <lb/>
            spotless conduct; for it is thou who doft force <lb/>
            me to live. But feek thee I will, both by fea <lb/>
            and by land; and, were this poffible, even <lb/>
            in the skies. The only boon (my dear wife !) <lb/>
            I crave, is, that thou wouldeft not (hun me.— <lb/>
            At thefe words the whole assembly burft into <lb/>
            tears; and they now were as deeply afflicted, <lb/>
            as before for Callirrhoe. Immediately the <lb/>
            ships put to fea; and it was agreed that <lb/>
            they should take different courses. Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates undertook to fearch Sicily; Chæreas <lb/>
            went for Lybia ; while fome were difpatched <lb/>
            to Italy ; and others had orders to crofs the <lb/>
            Ionian sea. Yet all thefe human efforts were <lb/>
            vain; but Fortune, without whore aid nothing <lb/>
            can be perfected, brought the whole truth <lb/>
            to light; as will appear in the fequel of then: <lb/>
            events. The impious pyratcs having fold <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            the woman (a merchandize not easily difpofed <lb/>
            of,) they left Miletus, and failed towards <lb/>
            Crete, knowing that this was a large, rich <lb/>
            island ; whence they hoped, that they fhould <lb/>
            easily fell the rest of their cargo in it. But <lb/>
            a furious wind arifing, it drove them from <lb/>
            their intended courfe, into the Ionian fea, <lb/>
            (that unfrequented ocean,) whereon they, <lb/>
            fad and forlorn, were long tossed. There <lb/>
            dreadful ftorms of thunder, lightning, and a <lb/>
            long, long night, difmayed thofe wretches; <lb/>
            providence manifestly evincing, that it was <lb/>
            for Callirrhoe's fake only that they, till then, <lb/>
            had been favoured with fo prosperous a voyage. <lb/>
            Thefe pyrates teemed at the gates of death <lb/>
            every moment; but God prolonged the temper <lb/>
            in order that they might not be freed from their <lb/>
            terrors and come to a fatal end. The earth re­ <lb/>
            jected there miscreants : for after having been <lb/>
            long tofled about the ocean, they, at laft, <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
            were <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            were in want of every necessary, particularly <lb/>
            drink. Their wicked wealth was not then <lb/>
            of the lean: advantage to them; on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, they perifhed, fatiated with gold. But <lb/>
            now they repented, though late, of their <lb/>
            enormous crimes; reproaching each other to <lb/>
            no purpofe. The whole crew, (Theron ex­ <lb/>
            cepted) died of thirst : he, even in this ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of distress, not forgetting his wonted <lb/>
            detestable cunning; which prompted him to <lb/>
            steal, clandestinely, the liquor that his com­ <lb/>
            panions ought to have (hared ; an action he <lb/>
            gloried in, as in all others of that fort. Here <lb/>
            behold the anger and indignation of for­ <lb/>
            tune *, who referved this wretch for tortures, <lb/>
            and for the crofs. The fhip where Chæreas <lb/>
            was on board, failing at random, came up <lb/>
            with Theron's vessel; and at firft fheered off, <lb/>
            imagining that the was a pyrate : but obferv­ <note type="footnote"> * By this, Providence <unclear>seems</unclear> to be meant. </note> <lb/>
            ing <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            ing that she flew at the mercy of the waves, <lb/>
            and had no pilot; one from Chæreas's fhip <lb/>
            cried aloud :- There is not a foul on board ! <lb/>
            Let us not be afraid ; but going forward, let <lb/>
            us examine what portent lies concealed in <lb/>
            her. The pilot approved of the advice; <lb/>
            for Chæreas, having covered his head, had left <lb/>
            the deck, and was laid down. Being now <lb/>
            come up with the vessel, they hailed her, and <lb/>
            asked who was on board ?But no anfwer <lb/>
            being returned, one of the crew, jumping <lb/>
            from the ship into the vessel, found nothing <lb/>
            in her but dead bodies and gold. This being <lb/>
            made known to the failors, they rejoiced ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly ; and thought themselves extremely <lb/>
            fortunate, in having found a treafure in the <lb/>
            midst of the ocean. Chæreas hearing an up­ <lb/>
            roar, enquired the caufe of it; which being <lb/>
            told, he himself was very defirous of exa­ <lb/>
            mining into this novelty. But now knowing <note type="footnote"> K2 </note> <lb/>
            again, <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            again, immediately, the several sepulchral <lb/>
            (poils, he tore his clothes ; and in the louder <lb/>
            and the most piercing accents, cried thus :— <lb/>
            Alas! Callirrhoe: thefe things belong to <lb/>
            thee: This is the crown I placed upon thy <lb/>
            head : That thy father gave thee ; that thy <lb/>
            mother ; and there lies the nuptial robe. A <lb/>
            ship has been thy grave. I fee the things be­ <lb/>
            longing to thee, but where art thou ? Of the <lb/>
            Several articles lodged in the Mausolæum, the <lb/>
            deceased only is wanting. Theron, struck <lb/>
            at there unexpected words, was bloodless; <lb/>
            and lay extended like the dead bodies of his <lb/>
            companions. Although he, after much re­ <lb/>
            flection, had formed a refolution, not to <lb/>
            utter a single word, nor to move ever so <lb/>
            little (well knowing what would be his fate <lb/>
            fhould he be discovered ;) yet, as man is in­ <lb/>
            finitely fond of life; and does not despair, <lb/>
            even in the extremes of mifery, of a change <lb/>
            for <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            for the better; (God, the Creator of the <lb/>
            world, having inspired all human Beings with <lb/>
            there fage thoughts, in order that they might <lb/>
            not free themfelves from a wretched life :) <lb/>
            Theron, who was parched with thirst, burft <lb/>
            forth thefe words Give me drink !—— <lb/>
            After liquor had been brought, all imaginable <lb/>
            care was taken of him ; when Chæreas, sit­ <lb/>
            ting down by him, fpake thus :Who art <lb/>
            thou, and whither art thou bound ? Whence <lb/>
            hadft thou thefe things ? and what haft thou <lb/>
            done with the mistress of them ?——Theron <lb/>
            not forgetting his ufual guile, and having <lb/>
            recourse to wicked artifice, replied ; <lb/>
            Crete is my native country. I was failing <lb/>
            for Ionia, to feek after my brother, who is <lb/>
            a soldier in that island ; when I was suddenly <lb/>
            abandoned, in the harbour of Cephalonia, <lb/>
            by the passengers. I then went on board this <lb/>
            little vessel, which, very luckily for me, hap- <note type="footnote"> K3 </note> <lb/>
            pened <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            pened to fail that way. We next were drove <lb/>
            by furious winds into this sea ; and being <lb/>
            afterwards long becalmed, all the crew died <lb/>
            of thirty except myself, who was preferved <lb/>
            for my piety. ——Chæreas having heard this, <lb/>
            ordered the vessel to be towed by their fhip, <lb/>
            till they should arrive at fome of the ports of <lb/>
            Syracufe.</p>
          <p>IV. Fame, naturally swist, flew then with <lb/>
            unufual rapidity, to Spread many wonderful <lb/>
            tidings. Every one crouded to the sea fhore; <lb/>
            and all were agitated by different passions. <lb/>
            Some wept, while others wondered; fame <lb/>
            asked questions, and others were in doubt; <lb/>
            but all were struck with the strangeness of the <lb/>
            incident. Callirrhoe's mother, at the fight of <lb/>
            the various articles which had been lodged <lb/>
            in the sepulchre with her daughter, finding <lb/>
            them entire, as she counted them over ; she <lb/>
            vented <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            vented a flood of tears, and cried:—My child ! <lb/>
            Thou only art wanting ! What new kind of <lb/>
            robbery is this; to steal only my daughter, <lb/>
            and preserve the vestments and gold I fee ?— <lb/>
            The chores and harbours echoed with the <lb/>
            wailings of women; and both fea and land <lb/>
            were filled with lamentations. Hermocrates, <lb/>
            who had borne the higher offices in the flare, <lb/>
            -and was a man of consummate experience, <lb/>
            faid :-It were needlefs for us to make an en­ <lb/>
            quiry here, in a tumultuous manner. This <lb/>
            must be done regularly, and with legal so­ <lb/>
            lemnity. Who knows but that this affair <lb/>
            may require the pretence of the judges ?— <lb/>
            While he fpake, the theatre was crouded. <lb/>
            Great numbers of women came thither like­ <lb/>
            wise. And now all the people, big with <lb/>
            expectation, were heated : when Chæreas en­ <lb/>
            tered frA, clad in deep mourning, pale and <lb/>
            dismal in aspect; and fucb as he appeared, <note type="footnote"> K 4 </note> <lb/>
            when <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            when he followed his dear Callirrhoe to the <lb/>
            grave. He would not afcend the roftrum or <lb/>
            pulpit, but Handing on the ground, firft wept <lb/>
            bitterly a long time ; and then, strongly en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to fpeak, words could not find <lb/>
            utterance. At laft, the multitude bidding <lb/>
            him go up, and begin; Chæreas with great <lb/>
            difficulty lifted up his eyes, and said :—— <lb/>
            This is not a time to declaim, but to moan : <lb/>
            and yet I, compelled by dire necessity, do <lb/>
            fpeak; and will live till I find the wretch who <lb/>
            has robbed me of my Callirrhoe. For this <lb/>
            purpose I fet out from this place, in a <lb/>
            galley: but whether my voyage has been pro­ <lb/>
            pitious, or otherwise, I cannot fay. For I <lb/>
            spied a vend sailing beneath a cloudlefs sky, <lb/>
            and in a stark calm; but all temper within, <lb/>
            and near foundering, though the ocean was <lb/>
            quite fmooth. Surprized at this, we came <lb/>
            up with the vessel; when, methought <lb/>
            I be- <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            I beheld the sepulchre of my poor, haplefs <lb/>
            wife, and every thing that had been buried <lb/>
            with her; and fhe only miffing. There alfo <lb/>
            were many dead bodies (which is no ways <lb/>
            our concern) but, among them, a man al­ <lb/>
            most expiring was found ; and him I have <lb/>
            preserved, with the utmost care, for your ex­ <lb/>
            amination. Hereupon the lictors, or fer­ <lb/>
            jeants of the court, led Theron, (hackled as <lb/>
            a criminal, into the theatre, followed by a <lb/>
            Suitable retinue, viz. the wheel and catapult; <lb/>
            fire, and scourges: Providence now going to <lb/>
            reward him for his paft abominable exploits. <lb/>
            Being brought before the Archontes, or chief <lb/>
            magistrates, one of them interrogated him <lb/>
            thus :Who art thou ?——My name (re­ <lb/>
            plied he) is Demetrius. Of what coun­ <lb/>
            try ?——Of Crete. What canst thou fay <lb/>
            for thyfelf? Sailing cried (he,) to­ <lb/>
            wards Ionia, to vifit my brother; I was aban­ <lb/>
            doned <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            doned by the ship's company. I thereupon <lb/>
            was obliged to go on board a fmall vessel, <lb/>
            which was paffing that way ; the crews where­ <lb/>
            of I fuppofed to be merchants, but now find <lb/>
            they were robbers of sepulchres. Having <lb/>
            been long toil on the fea, and our provifions <lb/>
            sailing, the crew were starved to death ; and <lb/>
            I only have been preferved, as a reward for <lb/>
            my never having committed, to my knowlege, <lb/>
            a fingle crime. 0 Syracufians ! Ye who are <lb/>
            renowned for humanity, be not more cruel <lb/>
            to me than the ocean and thirft have been.- <lb/>
            He uttered thefe accents fo very dolefully, <lb/>
            that most of the assembly were moved to pity ; <lb/>
            and his words would, possibly, have foon made <lb/>
            so strong an impression on his auditors, as to <lb/>
            induce them to acquit, and bestow upon him <lb/>
            provisions; had not fome Deity, to revenge <lb/>
            the wrongs of Callirrhoe, intervened; justly <lb/>
            offended at Theron, for his having employed <lb/>
            fuch <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            fuch persuasive eloquence, in to abominable <lb/>
            a caufe: since, had his words prevailed, a <lb/>
            moPe shocking circumstance muft have hap­ <lb/>
            pened, viz. that the Syracufians would have <lb/>
            thought a wretch had been preserved, merely <lb/>
            as a reward for his piety, who was most for­ <lb/>
            tunately faved, on no other account, than that <lb/>
            he might be pumped with greater feverity <lb/>
            than any of his companions. A fisherman, who <lb/>
            was fitting among the croud, happened to <lb/>
            know him; and thus whifpered the people <lb/>
            near him: ——I lately faw this fellow loiter­ <lb/>
            log about our port.Thefe words were <lb/>
            foon Spread round, upon which one cried <lb/>
            aloud: The culprit tells a falshood.—— <lb/>
            And now the whole people took the alarm; <lb/>
            when the man, who first faid that he knew <lb/>
            the prisoner, was ordered to leave his seat, <lb/>
            and advance into the middle of the theatre. <lb/>
            Theron, Aill affirming that he was not the <lb/>
            person ; <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            perfon; the fisherman persisted, yet more <lb/>
            strongly, in his first asseveration. The chief <lb/>
            magistrates then calling in the executioners, <lb/>
            thefe fcourged the impious wretch ; who long <lb/>
            bore, with fuch undaunted refolution, the <lb/>
            tortures, both by fire and fword, that he al­ <lb/>
            most rofe fuperior to them all. But sharp <lb/>
            are the flings of conference in every man; <lb/>
            and truth conquers all things: for Theron <lb/>
            made, at last, a full confeffion, though with <lb/>
            great difficulty and by flow degrees; he <lb/>
            Speaking as follows: Happening to fpy <lb/>
            riches depofiting in a Mausolæum, I got toge­ <lb/>
            ther a band of robbers. We then broke open <lb/>
            the sepulchre, and therein found a living wo­ <lb/>
            man who was fuppofed to be dead. We after­ <lb/>
            wards took out every article from the tomb ; <lb/>
            and putting the whole on board a vessel, failed <lb/>
            for Miletus, where we fold the woman only ; <lb/>
            and were carrying the- reft of the cargo to <lb/>
            Crete; <lb/>

            Crete; but being driven by the winds, into <lb/>
            the Ionian fea, yourselves have been eye wit­ <lb/>
            nefles to our sufferings —— He then difclofed <lb/>
            every particular, except the name of the pur­ <lb/>
            chafer of Callirrhoe. After this declaration <lb/>
            joy and grief filled the breasts of all the spec­ <lb/>
            tators : joy, becaufe Callirrhoe was still liv­ <lb/>
            ing ; grief, because fhe had been fold. The­ <lb/>
            ron was then fentenced to die; but Chæreas <lb/>
            intreated that a reprieve might be granted <lb/>
            him, for a short time; in order (faid Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas) that he may inform me who has bought <lb/>
            Callirrhoe. Behold (added he) to what <lb/>
            a fad neceffity I am reduced ; thus forced to <lb/>

            mocrates, however, oppofcd this requeft, <lb/>
            faying: That it were better they should <lb/>
            be at more pains and trouble, in feeking his <lb/>
            daughter, than to violate the laws. ——I be­ <lb/>
            feech you, 0 Syracufians! (fubjoined he) to <lb/>
            call <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            call to mind my paft fervices on board your <lb/>

            to fend an embassy for her; and let us bring <lb/>
            her back a free woman. Thefe words were <lb/>
            fcarce uttered, when the people cried aloud- <lb/>
            We will, every one of us, go in fearch of <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, if necessary; and most of the <lb/>
            fenators readily offered the like. Hereupon <lb/>
            Hermocrates said:—Accept all of my warm­ <lb/>
            est thanks, for the honour you intend me : <lb/>
            but two of the fenators, and two from a- <lb/>
            , <lb/>
            mong the people, will be embassadors fuffi­ <lb/>
            cient ; and Chæreas may make the fifth. <lb/>
            This resolution pleated universally, and was <lb/>
            affected to, upon which the court broke up. <lb/>
            Theron was then led to execution, through <lb/>
            vast crouds of people ; when being fastened <lb/>
            to a crofs, before the entrance of Callirrhoe's <lb/>
            sepulchre ; he thence faw the fea, over which <lb/>
            he <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            he had carried, as a slave, the daughter of <lb/>
            Hermocrates, whom the Athenians could never <lb/>
            take prisoner.</p>
          <p>V. All the rest were of opinion, that it <lb/>
            would be prudent to wait till the sea fhould <lb/>
            be open, and not venture out till Spring ; <lb/>
            it being then the depth of winter, at which <lb/>
            season the Ionian ocean was judged impaf­ <lb/>
            sible But Chæreas, fired by love, was al­ <lb/>
            ready prepared ; and fitting out a ship with <lb/>
            -amazing expedition, was impatient to give <lb/>
            himself up to the winds, and waves; a dan­ <lb/>
            ger no one elfe dared to run. Hereupon the <lb/>
            embassadors, excited by the example of Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, and especially of Hermocrates, would <lb/>
            delay no longer, but immediately took mea­ <lb/>
            fures for their departure. The Syracufians, <lb/>
            to add fplendor to this embassy, sent it forth <lb/>
            in the name, and at the expence, of the pub- <note type="footnote">5 </note> <lb/>
            lie ; <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            lie ; and put to fea the admiral's ship, which <lb/>
            still bore the enfigns of victory. The day <lb/>
            fixed for their failing being come, the people <lb/>
            flocked to the sea -shore; not only men, but <lb/>
            alfo women and children. Then were blend­ <lb/>
            ed prayers, tears, groans, consolation, fear, <lb/>
            trust, hope and defpair. Arisen, father to <lb/>
            Chæreas, though in the extremes of decrepi­ <lb/>
            tude, and bowed down with forrow, would <lb/>
            yet be carried thither ; when clasping his son’s <lb/>
            .neck, and hanging upon it, he (weeping <lb/>
            bitterly) cried :To whom, my fon ! doft <lb/>
            thou abandon wretched me ; worn out with <lb/>
            age, and half dead ? for I shall never behold <lb/>
            thee more. Put off thy voyage for fome few <lb/>
            days, that I may die in thy arms. Bury me, <lb/>
            and then fet out.-His mother, clasping his <lb/>
            knees, cried — O my fon ! Leave me not <lb/>
            here, fad and inconsolable, I conjure thee; <lb/>
            but take me on board thy shipfor light is my <lb/>
            weight ; <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            weight ; but should I prove too heavy, then <lb/>
            throw me into the fea which thou art going <lb/>
            over. Saying thefe words, she beat her <lb/>
            breasts, and taking them forth, she cried ; <lb/>
            Cast thine eyes hither, and take pity on ne; <lb/>
            If e’er, to <unclear>op</unclear> thy tears, to foot he thy heart, <lb/>
            I gave thee suck, and lull’d thee soft to rest.</p>
          <p>Chæreas, overcome by the in treaties of his pa­ <lb/>
            rents, threw himfelf from the ship into the <lb/>
            fea; that he might not be prevented from <lb/>
            going in Search of Callirrhoe, nor torture <lb/>
            any longer his father and mother. The fai­ <lb/>
            lors leapt in immediately after Chæreas, and <lb/>
            drew him forth with much difficulty. Her­ <lb/>
            mocrates, feeing the multitude dispersed, or­ <lb/>
            dered the pilot to weigh anchor forthwith ; <lb/>
            when a new incident happened, which exhi­ <lb/>
            bited an act of the most generous friendship. <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>

            Polycharmus, a friend of 'haereas, had not <lb/>
            appeared abroad, while all thefe preparations <lb/>
            were making; but had faid to his parents- <lb/>
            Chæreas is indeed my friend; yet not to fuch <lb/>
            a degree, as to induce me to follow him in <lb/>
            the extremes of danger; I therefore will <lb/>
            conceal my felf, till he fhall fet fail.- Now <lb/>
            when the tide had carried the ship at a con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance from shore, Polycharmus, <lb/>
            showing himfelf from the stern, bid farewell <lb/>
            to his parents; as it would not then be in <lb/>
            their power to withhold him. Chæreas being <lb/>
            got out of the harbour, and gazing on the <lb/>
            fea, cried — Dothou (great ocean !) direct <lb/>
            me the fame course as thou didft Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            And grant, (0 Neptune!) either that I may <lb/>
            bring her back ; or my felf never, never re­ <lb/>
            turn ; for I had much rather be enflaved with <lb/>
            my wife, than not recover her. <lb/>

            ship ; which purfuing almost the fame track <lb/>
            with that of the pyrate-vessel ; arrived, in <lb/>
            the like number of days, in Ionia, on the <lb/>
            beach near to Dionyfius's estate. Now most <lb/>
            of the people on board, being greatly fa­ <lb/>
            tigued, went a-shore, in order to refresh and <lb/>
            recover themselves. Immediately they fet up <lb/>
            tents, and brought out provisions. But Chæ­ <lb/>

            amining every thing: the former faid: <lb/>
            How will it be possible for us to find Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe ? for I am above all things apprehensive <lb/>
            that Theron mull have amufed us with fal­ <lb/>
            sities ; and that the dear, ill-fated creature <lb/>
            is dead ere this time. And though she were <lb/>
            really fold ; who could inform us in what <lb/>
            country ? Asia is of a vaft extent.While <lb/>
            they were thus wandering, They came to the <lb/>
            temple of Venus; when thinking it their <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>

             <pb n="148"/>
            duty to pay adoration to that Deity; Chæreas <lb/>
            fell at her feet, and cried :- Thou (0 god­ <lb/>
            defs !) didft firft blefs me, on thy festival, <lb/>
            with the fight of Callirrhoe. Restore to me <lb/>
            the beauteous gift, which I before owed to <lb/>
            thy fpecial grace and favour. And now <lb/>
            having ended his prayer, lie rofe; when <lb/>
            lifting up his eyes, he faw, on one fide of the <lb/>
            goddess,.a golden statue of Callirrhoe ; the <lb/>
            offering of Dionyfius.</p>
          <p>Infant, a tremar seizd his heart, and knees.</p>
          <p>Chæreas now growing dizzy, he fainted away, <lb/>
            which the priestess or woman who had the <lb/>
            care of the temple perceiving, she brought <lb/>
            water. Chæreas being fprinkled therewith, <lb/>
            and recovering, she said: Be comforted <lb/>
            (my son !) the goddefs has struck many others <lb/>
            in like manner: for the is much renowned, <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>

             <pb n="149"/>
            and reveals herfelf in the most conspicuous <lb/>
            manner. But this is a very happy omen. <lb/>
            Doft thou fee that golden statue ? The wo­ <lb/>
            man whom it represents was once a Have ; but <lb/>
            Venus has made her mistress over us all.- <lb/>
            And who is she ? (resumed Chæreas.)— <lb/>
            She is (faid the priestess) the lady of all there <lb/>
            lands ; and wife to Dionyfius the firft man in <lb/>
            all Ionia. Chæreas was going on, when <lb/>
            he was interrupted by Polycharmus, who <lb/>
            being master of great coolness, prudence, and <lb/>
            forefight, would not permit him to utter a <lb/>
            word more; but taking him by the arm, <lb/>
            forced him’out of the temple ; he not being <lb/>
            willing to have it known, who they were, <lb/>
            till they fhould have fully weighed this mat­ <lb/>
            ter ; and taken every necessary precaution. <lb/>
            Chæreas, while he was with the priestess, had <lb/>
            retrained his tongue, though with infinite <lb/>
            difficulty; and yet he could not check fame <note type="footnote"> L 3 </note> <lb/>
            falling <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            falling tears; but when he, and Polycharmus, <lb/>
            were got far from the temple, and alone; <lb/>
            Chæreas, throwing himself on the ground, <lb/>
            thus cried aloud :—O too kind ocean ! why <lb/>
            didst thou preserve me ? Was it in order that <lb/>
            I, after having been indulged a profperous <lb/>
            voyage, might behold Callirrhoe in the em­ <lb/>
            braces of another hufband ? This I could <lb/>
            pever have expected, even after the haplefs <lb/>
            Chæreas should be no more. Ah ! wretched <lb/>
            me ! how shall I act ? I fondly hoped to <lb/>
            have brought thee from thy master: and did <lb/>
            not doubt but that thy purchaser, allured by <lb/>
            the large fum I should offer him, would glad­ <lb/>
            ly have restored thee to me ; but now I have <lb/>
            found thee rich ; and perhaps a queen. How <lb/>
            much happier should I have been, had I even <lb/>
            feen thee an adulterefs! Shall I now go to <lb/>
            Dionyfius, and fay to him; Restore me <lb/>
            my wife ?But I could not accoft thee, <lb/>
            though <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            though we were to meet in the streets : and <lb/>
            what is Hill more grievous, I should not be <lb/>
            permitted to falute thee as my country wo­ <lb/>
            man ; a pleafure that would be refufed to me <lb/>
            only. Perhaps too, I might run the hazard <lb/>
            of perishing by being fuppofed an adulterer, <lb/>
            with regard to my own wife. -While he <lb/>
            thus poured forth his lamentations, Polychar­ <lb/>
            mus ufed his utmoft endeavours to console <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>VII. In the mean time Phocas, under-ste­ <lb/>
            ward to Dionyfius, Spying a ship of force, <lb/>
            was not a little alarmed on that account; when <lb/>
            Showing much kindnefs to one of the bailors, <lb/>
            he learnt, from him, who the perfons on <lb/>
            board were, and the motive of their voyage. <lb/>
            He then reflected, that the arrival of this ship <lb/>
            must be of fatal consequence to his Lord; <lb/>
            imagining, that were Callirrhoe to be taken <note type="footnote"> L 4 </note> <lb/>
            from <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            from him, he could not poffibly furvive the <lb/>
            loss. Bearing a great love to his master, he <lb/>
            was extremely desirous of putting a flop to <lb/>
            the impending evil; and of preventing a war ; <lb/>
            not a mighty one, indeed, nor of a public <lb/>
            nature, but pearly affecting Dionyfius's fa­ <lb/>
            mily. For this purpofe, he rode, with the <lb/>
            swiftest fpeed, to a fortrefs, garrifoned by <lb/>
            fome Barbarians, and fpake thus to them <lb/>
            A ship of force has put in here, and lies hild <lb/>
            under the ramparts, which look on the sea ; <lb/>
            but whether fle be a fpy, or comes in hopes <lb/>
            of a booty, I cannot tell: but surely it will <lb/>
            be much for the king’s interest, that we take <lb/>
            and plunder her, to prevent her doing mif­ <lb/>
            chief. Phocas prevailed with the Barba­ <lb/>
            rians, by his fallacious arguments, to go; <lb/>
            and he himfelf led them in regular order. <lb/>
            The Barbarians then fell upon the fhip's <lb/>
            company, who were quite unprepared for such <lb/>
            an <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            an attack, in the dead of night; and throw­ <lb/>
            ing fire into the vessel, they burnt her ; after <lb/>
            which they bound in chains fuch of the peo­ <lb/>
            ple as they found alive, and imprifoned them <lb/>
            in the fortrefs. A partition being then made <lb/>
            of the naves; Chæreas and Polycharmus <lb/>
            moli earnestly befought the victors, that they <lb/>
            might be fold to one and the fame matter. <lb/>
            In compliance with this request, the purcha­ <lb/>
            fer of both fold them in Caria ; where drag­ <lb/>
            ging heavy fetters, there ill fated men tilled <lb/>
            the lands of Mithridates. Now it happened <lb/>
            that Callirrhoe had a dream, in which the <lb/>
            faw Chæreas in irons ; who would feign have <lb/>
            approached her, but could not. Immediately <lb/>
            she, venting a loud, fad figh in her sleep, <lb/>
            cried Comehither, 0 my Chæreas!— <lb/>
            This being the first time that Dionyfius had <lb/>
            heard his frighted wife pronounce the name <lb/>
            of Chæreas ; he afked her, who that person <lb/>
            was <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            was whom she called upon ? Her tears <lb/>
            betraying her, and being quite unable to con­ <lb/>
            ceal her distress, her anguifh burst into there <lb/>
            words: -Alas! I did addrefs my hufband, <lb/>
            he who possessed me a virgin-bride. 0 un­ <lb/>
            happy man! miserable even in dreams. I <lb/>
            faw him loaded with irons. But thou, (most <lb/>
            unfortunate of mortals !) didst lose thy life in <lb/>
            fearching after me ; for thefe chains fadly de­ <lb/>
            note that thou art dead; while I Rill furvive, <lb/>
            and riot in the moft luxurious delights. I <lb/>
            now repofe, with another hufband, in a bed <lb/>
            glittering with gold ; yet I, ere long, will <lb/>
            hasten to thee ; for fince we could not enjoy <lb/>
            each other, when living ; we will join toge­ <lb/>
            ther in death. Dionyfius on hearing thefe <lb/>
            words, made a variety of reflexions. He was <lb/>
            fired with jealousy, as Callirrhoe discovered <lb/>
            a love for Chæreas, although dead. He like­ <lb/>
            wise was afraid that (he would make away <lb/>
            with <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            with herfelf. On the other hand, he enter­ <lb/>
            tamed hopes, as she seemed to fuppofe her <lb/>
            first hufband was no more; that the therefore <lb/>
            would not forsake him who then enjoyed her. <lb/>
            In the mean time, Dionyfius strove to com­ <lb/>
            fort, by every means poffible, his afflicted <lb/>
            wife; and watched her narrowly, during <lb/>
            many days, for fear she should destroy her­ <lb/>
            felf. The hopes Callirrhoe entertained, that <lb/>
            Chæreas might, perhaps, be still living ; and <lb/>
            that her dream was mere illufion, foftened <lb/>
            her grief; but chiefly her pregnancy. She <lb/>
            feven months after their nuptials, being de­ <lb/>
            livered of a fon, who was fuppofed to be <lb/>
            the offspring of Dionyfius, though Choreas <lb/>
            was the real father. Vast rejoicings were <lb/>
            made, throughout the city, on this occasion. <lb/>
            Embassadors came from all parts, to Miletus, <lb/>
            to congratulate Dionyfius on the aufpicious <lb/>
            increase of his family : and fo great was his <lb/>
            delight, <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            delight, that he yielded to every thing which <lb/>
            might pleafe his wife. He declared her mo­ <lb/>
            ther of a family; crouded the temples with <lb/>
            offerings; and after a folemn facrifice, enter­ <lb/>
            tained the whole city at a magnificent ban­ <lb/>
            quet.</p>
          <p>- VIII. Callirrhoe, being afraid that Plangon <lb/>
            would one day discover the fecret, was there­ <lb/>
            fore very defirous that she might be made <lb/>
            free ; this woman being the only perfon who <lb/>
            knew that Callirrhoe was pregnant, the first <lb/>
            night the cohabited with Dionyfius. It was <lb/>
            not merely from a principle of gratitude, that <lb/>
            Callirrhoe requested this favour; but alfo be­ <lb/>
            caufe of the aufpicious change which had <lb/>
            been wrought in her fortune. I would <lb/>
            willingly (faid Dionyfius, on this occafion) <lb/>
            reward Plangon, for the ready assistance she <lb/>
            gave to our amour: but we were unjust, <lb/>
            should <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            should we honour a Have, and not offer up <lb/>
            due thanks to Venus ; in whofe temple we <lb/>
            first faw each other. I wish for this, (faid <lb/>
            Callirrhoe) more than thou doll, I having <lb/>
            still greater obligations to that goddefs; but <lb/>
            as I am yet in child-bed, let us continue here <lb/>
            a few days longer; and then we may retire <lb/>
            with lets hazard into the country. Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe foon recovered from the inconveniencies <lb/>
            and pains of child birth. Her beauty in­ <lb/>
            creased with her strength ; her virgin vigour <lb/>
            being now improved to that of a mother. <lb/>
            When they were arrived at the villa, they <lb/>
            found that Phocas had prepared fplendid <lb/>
            feasts; as a great number of people, from <lb/>
            the city, attended them. And now Dionyfius, <lb/>
            the libation being made, began to offer up <lb/>
            the Hecatomb, when he fpake thus:—O <lb/>
            Venus ! (my Deity!) To thee I owe all the <lb/>
            bleffings I enjoy: to thee I am indebted for <lb/>
            Callirrhoe : to thee for my fon: by thee P <lb/>
            am <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            am a husband ; by thee a father. I should <lb/>
            have been contented with Callirrhoe only, she <lb/>
            being dearer to me than my country, or my <lb/>
            parents : but yet I love my fon, as I thereby <lb/>
            Secure to my felf the affection of his mother ; <lb/>
            and possess the sweetest pledge of her fond­ <lb/>
            nefs for me. I therefore befeech thee, (O <lb/>
            goddefs!) to preserve Callirrhoe for my <lb/>
            fake; and the infant for her's The croud <lb/>
            round them accompanied this prayer with <lb/>
            good wifhes, and joyful acclamations; when <lb/>
            fome Scattered rofes over them; fome violefs ; <lb/>
            and others entire chaplets; insomuch that <lb/>
            the temple was firewed with flowers. Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius had offered up his prayers with a loud <lb/>
            voice, and fo was heard by all the people; <lb/>
            but Callirrhoe would address Venus in pri­ <lb/>
            vate. She thereupon first put her fon into <lb/>
            the arms of the goddefs ; when behold a <lb/>
            groop, more exquisitely beautiful then ever <lb/>
            painters <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            painters drew, fculptors carved, or poets <lb/>
            feigned : for none of thofe artists ever repre­ <lb/>
            sented Diana, or Minerva, holding an infant <lb/>
            in her arms. This spectacle drew tears of joy <lb/>
            from Dionyfius, while he was deprecating <lb/>
            Nemefis in filence. Having then ordered <lb/>
            Plangon only, to continue with her ; he Cent <lb/>
            back all the reft to the villa. After the <lb/>
            people had left the temple, Callirrhoe ad­ <lb/>
            vancing nearer to Venus, and holding forth <lb/>
            the child, faid :For this infant (0 god­ <lb/>
            dess !) I return thee thanks, but not for my­ <lb/>
            felf: which I yet should certainly have done, <lb/>
            hadst thou preferved me my Chæreas. Thou <lb/>
            indeed hast given me the image of that dearly <lb/>
            beloved hufband; and not deprived me to­ <lb/>
            tally of him. 0 grant that this babe may be <lb/>
            more happy than his parents, and resemble <lb/>
            his grand- sire ! May he shine in the navy; <lb/>
            and being victorious on the ocean, may the <lb/>
            public, <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            public, exulting, cry: The grand-fon of <lb/>
            Hermocrates fur panes him in valour, and is a <lb/>
            greater man. My father will be overjoyed, <lb/>
            in beholding a successor to his heroifm ; and <lb/>
            this will administer pleafure to his parents, <lb/>
            though no longer ranked among the living. <lb/>
            I conjure thee, (0 Venus!) to be propitious <lb/>
            to me, henceforward. My fufferings have <lb/>
            already been very great. I have been dead <lb/>
            to all appearance, and restored to life. I <lb/>
            have been in the vile hands of robbers; <lb/>
            have been lost to my country; been fold ; <lb/>
            and a Have ; and, what I look upon as still <lb/>
            more grievous than all the reft, am joined <lb/>
            to another hufband. But, to compensate <lb/>
            fully for all there evils, I intreat thee, and <lb/>
            all the other Deities through thy mediation, <lb/>
            to preserve me this haplefs orphan. She <lb/>
            would fain have added more, but was inter­ <lb/>
            rupted by her tears. <lb/>
            IX. Cal-</p><pb n="161"/>
            
          <p>IX. Callirrhoe, after a little paufe, called <lb/>
            the priestess, who entering faid: (O my <lb/>
            daughter!) why weepest thou in the midft <lb/>
            of fo much felicity, and when even strangers <lb/>
            worship thee as a goddefs ? Two beautiful <lb/>
            youths came hither, not long fince, from on <lb/>
            board a ship which was failing this way ; <lb/>
            when one of them, at the fight of thy image, <lb/>
            almost died away; to illustrious has Venus <lb/>
            made thee.—These words pierced Callirrhoe <lb/>
            to the heart; when fle, like one distracted ; <lb/>
            looking aghast and with her eyes fixed, cried <lb/>
            aloud :— Who were thofe strangers ? Whence <lb/>
            came they ? What did they fay to thee ? <lb/>
            The priestess was fo terribly frighted that the, <lb/>
            at first, remained fpeechlefs ; but at last (he, <lb/>
            with great difficulty, uttered there words :— <lb/>
            I only faw thofe youths, but did not hear <lb/>
            them fpeak. Of what country (faid Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe) dost thou fuppofe them, from their <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
            dress, <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            drefs, to be ? Call to mind their features and <lb/>
            their mien. The old woman then gave a <lb/>
            description of their perfons, though not a very <lb/>
            exact one. However, Callirrhoe guessed who <lb/>
            both were; as we easily believe what we <lb/>
            earnestly desire. And now turning to Plan­ <lb/>
            gon : ——Ah ! (faid she,) Should the wretched <lb/>
            Chæreas have wandered hither! Let us in­ <lb/>
            stantly feek for him, but with the utmoft fe­ <lb/>
            crecy.—Callirrhoe going back to Dionyfius; <lb/>
            she acquainted him with no more than what <lb/>
            had been told her by the priestess ; well <lb/>
            knowing that love is naturally over curious; <lb/>
            and that Dionyfius would, for his own sake, <lb/>
            enquire very minutely into this whole affair, <lb/>
            and fo it fell out: He being fired with jea­ <lb/>
            loufy, the moment he heard thefe particulars. <lb/>
            He indeed entertained no fufpicion with re­ <lb/>
            gard to Chæreas ; but was apprehenfive that <lb/>
            fome adulterer, in order to disturb his <lb/>
            peace, would fpread fnares in that solitude. <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>
            Cal- <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            Callrrihoe's exquifite beauty made him suspect <lb/>
            and fear every thing; insomuch that he not <lb/>
            only dreaded the artifices of men ; but even <lb/>
            fancied that some god would, perhaps, de­ <lb/>
            fcend from the skies, in order to be his rival. <lb/>
            Dionyfius thereupon sending for Phocas: Who <lb/>
            (said he very earnestly) are thofe young men, <lb/>
            and whence came they ? Are they rich ? <lb/>
            are they handsome ? Why did they worship <lb/>
            my Venus ? Who informed them of her <lb/>
            being here ? Who encouraged them to addrefs <lb/>
            her ?——But Phocas, standing in great awe <lb/>
            of Dionyfius ; and fearing that, fhould Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe be made acquainted with this affair, <lb/>
            the would certainly ruin him, and his whole <lb/>
            family; he, for that reafon, concealed the <lb/>
            real fact.—Having then Wrongly persisted, in <lb/>
            declaring that no foreigners had landed there : <lb/>
            Dionyfius began to suspect, that still deeper <lb/>
            plots were forcing against him. Being now <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
            inflamed. <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            inflamed with rage, he commanded the fcour­ <lb/>
            ges and the rack to be brought, in order to <lb/>
            put Phocas to the torture; and not only <lb/>
            him, but he likewife fent for all the peasants ; <lb/>
            being firmly persuaded, that fome adulterer <lb/>
            would be discovered by means of this en­ <lb/>
            quiry. Phocas finding that he fhould be in <lb/>
            danger, whether he revealed, or suppressed <lb/>
            the fecret, faid: (O my Lord!) to thee <lb/>
            only I will difclofe the truth.- Thereupon <lb/>
            Dionyfius, having commanded all the reft to <lb/>
            withdraw ; We now (faid he) are alone. <lb/>
            Take strict care that thou tell me no falfity ; <lb/>
            but declare the whole truth, though ever fo <lb/>
            inauspicious.——My Lord (replied the ste­ <lb/>
            ward) I bring no evil tidings, but great and <lb/>
            good news. However, Should the narrative, <lb/>
            in the opening of it, be found disagreeable; <lb/>
            yet let not that furprize or afflict thee, but <lb/>
            wait till thou haft heard it through ; for it <lb/>
            will <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            will end happily. Dionyfius, being all <lb/>
            attention at thefe words, cried :Do not <lb/>
            delay; but relate at once all thou haft to <lb/>
            fay. Phocas then began as follows :—— <lb/>
            A ship is just arrived here from Sicily, bring­ <lb/>
            ing Syracufian embassadors, in order to de­ <lb/>
            mand Callirrhoe of thee. Dionyfius was <lb/>
            ready to die at hearing there words, and a <lb/>
            dark cloud overspread his eyes; he imagin­ <lb/>
            ing, that Chæreas was then present, and <lb/>
            come to force Callirrhoe from him. Now pale <lb/>
            and livid, he lay extended like one dead ; <lb/>
            which threw Phocas into the utmoft conster­ <lb/>
            nation, he not knowing how to act ; and <lb/>
            therefore did not dare to call for assist­ <lb/>
            ance, left their fecret should be found out. <lb/>
            Dionyfius afterwards recovering, though with <lb/>
            the utmoft difficulty, his fainting fpirits; —— <lb/>
            Be comforted, my Lord, (faid Phocas ;) Cho­ <lb/>
            reas is no more ; the ship is destroyed ; and <note type="footnote"> M 3 </note> <lb/>
            all <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            an our fears are dispelled.—These words <lb/>
            gave new life to Dionyfius, when reviving, <lb/>
            he enquired very minutely into every circum­ <lb/>
            stance. Phocas then told him of the ma­ <lb/>
            riner, from whom he had learnt whence the <lb/>
            fhip came ; who the strangers on board were, <lb/>
            and the motive of their voyage. Likewise <lb/>
            the stratagem employed by him, in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with the Barbarians. He related the se­ <lb/>
            veral transactions of that night; fuch as their <lb/>
            burning the vessel ; the shipwreck ; with their <lb/>
            killing part of the people, and throwing the <lb/>
            rest in chains. This narrative difperfed the <lb/>
            clouds and darknefs which fecmed to hang <lb/>
            over Dionyfius's mind ; when embracing Pho­ <lb/>
            cas : —Thou (faid he) art my benefactor ; <lb/>
            thou the true, the most faithful guardian of <lb/>
            my fecrets, which ought never to be revealed. <lb/>
            To thee I owe Callirrhoe ; to thee I owe my <lb/>
            fon. I did not command thee to difpatch <lb/>
            Chæ- <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            Chæreas ; yet shouldest thou have given the <lb/>
            fatal stroke, I shall not condemn thee, since thou <lb/>
            muft have perpetrated that deed, purely out <lb/>
            of affection to thy Lord.-In one thing only <lb/>
            thou haft fhewn negligence; I mean, thy not <lb/>
            enquiring very strictly, whether Chæreas was <lb/>
            slain, or only caft in chains. If thou wert <lb/>
            certain (added Dionyfius) that he is dead; <lb/>
            then care must be taken of his body; then <lb/>
            Should it receive due funeral honours ; and <lb/>
            then should I recover my peace of mind ; <lb/>
            whereas I cannot now be perfectly happy ; <lb/>
            but shall suspect that he is among the prifo­ <lb/>
            ners, we not knowing to what countries <lb/>
            they were fold.</p>
          <p>X. Dionyfius having ordered Phocas to <lb/>
            publish thefe feveral particulars (his firata­ <lb/>
            gem, and that fome people on board the <lb/>
            ship were still living, excepted ;) he then went, <note type="footnote"> M 4 </note> <lb/>
            with <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            with a forrowful countenance, to Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            He afterwards assembled the peasants, whom <lb/>
            Phocas had already prepared; in order that <lb/>
            whenever Callirrhoe should examine them, <lb/>
            concerning this affair, their answers might <lb/>
            be fuch, as would make her defpair of ever <lb/>
            feeing Chæreas again. The country people <lb/>
            flocking to Callirrhoe, informed her of every <lb/>
            circumstance, as things already perfectly well <lb/>
            known, viz that a band of robbers (Barba­ <lb/>
            rians) but whence they knew not, had come <lb/>
            in the dead of night, and burnt the Sicilian <lb/>
            ship, which had put in there the day before; <lb/>
            and that they faw, on the morrow, the ocean <lb/>
            tinged with blood, and dead bodies floating <lb/>
            on it. Callirrhoe hearing this dismal talc, <lb/>
            tore her garments ; and striking her eyes and <lb/>
            checks, she i'an up to the inner apartment, <lb/>
            whither she had been carried when firft fold. <lb/>
            Dionyfius gave her an opportunity to vent <lb/>
            fully <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            fully her grief; he imagining that it would <lb/>
            augment it, Should he appear suddenly before <lb/>
            her. In the mean time he gave orders that <lb/>
            every one should withdraw, Plangon except­ <lb/>
            ed; he thinking her pretence necessary, to <lb/>
            prevent his wife's destroying herfelf. But <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, retiring to a corner, threw her­ <lb/>
            self on the floor; when Scattering ashes on <lb/>
            her head, and tearing her dishevelled hair, <lb/>
            the thus repeated her fad moan :——It was <lb/>
            my earned defire ( 0 Chæreas !) to die before <lb/>
            thee, or at least to have accompanied thee to <lb/>
            the sepulchre : but I, as thou art no longer <lb/>
            among the living, thai! be forced to follow <lb/>
            thee in death ; for what have I to hope, or <lb/>
            to live for ? I was wont to foothc my sorrows <lb/>
            with the following reflections : ——I shall one <lb/>
            day again behold my Chæreas ; and relate, to <lb/>
            him, the numberlefs woes I have suffered <lb/>
            his fake. These will endear me still more to <lb/>
            him. How will he leap for joy at the fight <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            of his fon ? But all there thoughts are now <lb/>
            vain ; and my dearer babe is a burthen to me. <lb/>
            Being an orphan, he but adds to my other <lb/>
            evils. Thou only (0 unjust Venus !) Thou <lb/>
            only didft fee my darling Chaereas; yet <lb/>
            wouldest not show him to me when prefent, <lb/>
            and -after his undertaking fo long a voyage. <lb/>
            Thou next didft deliver up my lovely Chæreas <lb/>
            into the hands of robbers. Thou hadst no <lb/>
            companion of the man, who, for thy fake, <lb/>
            braved the dangers of the ocean. What per­ <lb/>
            fon will henceforward addrefs in prayer a god­ <lb/>
            dess, who, herfelf, slew her humble fuppliant ? <lb/>
            Thou didst not fuccour, in that night of hor­ <lb/>
            ror, a moft beautiful youth, full of affection, <lb/>
            when murthering in thy fight. Thou haft <lb/>
            robbed me of my cotemporary; my fellow­ <lb/>
            citizen ; my lover, on whom I doated ; my <lb/>
            husband. Though he be dead, yet restore <lb/>
            his body to me! Suppofing that we were <lb/>

            ALLIRRHOE passed that night in <lb/>
            tears; fhe bewailing Chæreas as <lb/>
            dead, though he was still living. <lb/>

            herself <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            herfelf fuccouring her darling Chæreas. Now <lb/>
            Dionyfius felt the deeper anguish at behold­ <lb/>
            ing his wife's fad aspect; he being afraid, <lb/>
            that her profound melancholy would diminish <lb/>
            the lustre of her charms, and thereby pre­ <lb/>
            judice his affection. He yet thought it would <lb/>
            be of advantage to him, for Callirrhoe to ut­ <lb/>
            terly despair of ever feeing again her first <lb/>
            husband. Defiling, however, to give her <lb/>
            a proof of the violence of his paffion, and <lb/>
            his greatness of foul, he fpake thus : <lb/>
            Rise (my deareft Callirrhoe !) and prepare a <lb/>
            sepulchre for that ill-fated man. Why doft <lb/>

            neglect fuch as are necessary ? Imagine him to <lb/>

          <p>Though the corps of the haplefs Chæreas be <lb/>
            not found, it is the cuftom (from an antient <lb/>
            law of the Greeks) to honour, with a sepul­ <lb/>
            chre, thofe whofe bodies may He elsewhere.— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe was eafily perfuaded, as this coun­ <lb/>
            fel was pleasing in itfelf. Having now an oc­ <lb/>
            cupation, it soothed her sorrow; when rifing <lb/>
            from her bed, she looked about for a fpot <lb/>
            whereon to erect the Mausolæum; and would <lb/>
            have fixed it near the temple of Venus, in <lb/>
            order that fhe might raife a fecond monument <lb/>
            of her love. But Dionyfius envied Choreas <lb/>
            a- place fo near to the fane; he reserving it <lb/>
            for himfelf; and being desirous that she should <lb/>
            still continue this employment.—Let us (faid <lb/>
            he) my dearer Callirrhoe, return to the city; <lb/>
            and there raise, before the walls, an empty <lb/>
            sepulchre, fo lofty and confpicuous ; <lb/>
            That mariners, who view it from osar, <lb/>
            May, by its form attracted, st p and gaze. <lb/>

          <p>The ports of Miletus (added he) are very fafe <lb/>
            and commodious; whence thy country-men, <lb/>
            the Syracufians, frequently touch at them ; <lb/>
            and this ambition, to fet up a Splendid Mau­ <lb/>
            solæum, will increase thy fame among thy <lb/>
            fellow-Citizens. ——Callirrhoe, pleafed at what <lb/>
            the heard, fufpended, for the prefent, her de­ <lb/>
            sign of building the tomb. Being afterwards <lb/>
            returned to the city, she began to erect, upon <lb/>
            an eminence near the fea-coaft, the sepulchre, <lb/>
            refembling exactly her own in Syracuse, as to <lb/>
            . form, dimenfions, and magnificence; and <lb/>
            built, like the other, in honour of a person <lb/>
            who was still living. As no expence was <lb/>
            fpared, and a vail number of hands were <lb/>
            employed, the edifice was foon completed ; <lb/>
            and the funeral obsequies were to be like thofe <lb/>
            performed in Syracufe. The day for this <lb/>
            pious folemnity was publickly proclaimed. <lb/>
            Not only all the Milefians, but likewise moft <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            of the tonians, flocked in prodigious crouds <lb/>
            to the sepulchre. Two men of high rank <lb/>
            happened to refide, at that time, in Miletus; <lb/>
            Mithridates governor of Caria, and Pharnaces <lb/>
            governor of Lydia. The pretence of their <lb/>
            coming to Miletus, was to shew their respect <lb/>
            and veneration for Dionyfius; but their real <lb/>
            motive was, to get a fight of Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            Her name was renowned, not only throughout <lb/>
            all Afia Minor; but it had likewise reached <lb/>
            the ear of the great king; an honour which <lb/>
            neither Ariadne, nor Leda, had attained. It <lb/>
            was now Callirrhoe appeared more beautiful <lb/>
            than imagination had framed her. She came <lb/>
            forth, clad in mourning; her tresses flowing; <lb/>
            with lightning in her eyes : And her almost <lb/>
            naked arms feemed more lovely than thofe of <lb/>
            the goddesses, the fnowy lustre of whofe <lb/>
            hands, and the beauty of whofe feet, are fo <lb/>
            highly celebrated by Homer. No one pre- <note type="footnote"> VOL. Is </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>

             <pb n="178"/>
            fent could bear the splendors which darted <lb/>
            from her face. Some were forced to turn <lb/>
            afide their heads, as from a flashing fun-beam. <lb/>
            Many, falling prostrate, worshipped her ; <lb/>
            and even the little boys felt a kind of passion <lb/>
            for Callirrhoe. But Mithridates, governor of <lb/>
            Caria, fell speechless on the ground, <lb/>
            Like one, whom suddenly a stone assails, <lb/>
            Hurl'd, from asling, by an athletic arm.</p>
          <p>When his chief domestics, listing him up, carried <lb/>
            him off with great difficulty. The proceffion <lb/>
            opened with the image of Chæreas, copied <lb/>
            from the Intaglio in the ring; which figure, <lb/>
            though extremely beautiful, yet pall unheed­ <lb/>
            ed, as Callirrhoe was present: the only, by <lb/>
            a kind of fafcination, attracting the eye of <lb/>
            every spectator. Now who could paint, in <lb/>
            due colours, the clofe of this folemn procef­ <lb/>
            non ! Being come near to the Mausolæum, <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
            thofe <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            thofe who carried the funeral bed, fet it <lb/>
            down ; when Callirrhoe afcending it, threw <lb/>
            her felf along on Chæreas's image, and kiss­ <lb/>
            ing it a thousand times : Thou (faid she) <lb/>
            didft firft bury me in Syracufe; and I, in re­ <lb/>
            turn, now inter thee in Miletus. The woes <lb/>
            we have furred are not only very grievous, <lb/>
            but even astonishing and almost incredible. <lb/>
            We have entombed each other, and yet neither <lb/>
            of us is possessed even of the other's corps. <lb/>
            O envious Fortune! Thy extreme hatred <lb/>
            would not permit us, when deceased, to be co. <lb/>
            vered with the fame earth ; but ordained, that <lb/>
            our very bodies fhould be exiles. The <lb/>
            whole multitude burft into wailings, and every <lb/>
            one pitied Chæreas; not because he was fup­ <lb/>
            pofed dead, but because he had been robbed <lb/>
            of so inchanting a wife. <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>

          <p>II. While Callirrhoe was thus burying <lb/>
            Chæreas in Miletus, he, with irons on his <lb/>
            feet, was tilling the ground in Caria. There <lb/>
            his body was foon emaciated, owing to the <lb/>
            variety of his sufferings ; to his prodigious <lb/>
            toils ; to his neglect of himself; to his chains: <lb/>
            but much more than all there,. to his love. He <lb/>
            would gladly have died then, had not fome <lb/>
            glimmerings of hope, viz. that he might, <lb/>
            perhaps, fec Callirrhoe once again, kept up <lb/>
            his fainting fpirits. His friend Polycharmus, <lb/>
            who was his fellow slave, feeing that Chæreas, <lb/>
            by his not being able to labour, was therefore <lb/>
            moft (hamefully beat and abufed, fpake thus <lb/>
            to the overfeer —Assign us a piece of ground <lb/>
            apart, in order that we may not be blamed <lb/>
            for the idlenefs of all the rest of the Haves; <lb/>
            and we then will completely plough, by an <lb/>
            appointed day, the portion allotted us. <lb/>
            The overfeer granted his requeft, and marked <lb/>
            out <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            out a fpot accordingly. Now Polycharmus, <lb/>
            being very healthy and robuft, and no ways <lb/>
            a captive to that most cruel of all tyrants, <lb/>
            Love; cultivated, alma!! fingly, the ground <lb/>
            allotted to both; he, with the higher joy, <lb/>
            taking this toil upon himfelf, to fave the life <lb/>
            of his friend. While Chasreas and Polychar­ <lb/>
            mus were thus struggling with ill Fortune, it <lb/>
            was exceedingly difficult for them to forget <lb/>
            their once happy Hate of liberty. In the <lb/>
            mean time, Mithridates the governor return­ <lb/>
            ed to Caria ; not chearful and florid as when <lb/>
            be left it, in order to go to Miletus ; but pale <lb/>
            and thin, like one whose heart had received <lb/>
            a deep, though pleafing wound. His passion <lb/>
            for Callirrhoe thus consuming him; he would <lb/>
            certainly have died, had he not met with the <lb/>
            following consolation. Some of the slaves, <lb/>
            who were chained with Chæreas (there being <lb/>
            fifteen shut up in a dark dungeon) having <note type="footnote"> N 3 </note> <lb/>
            got <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            got off their irons, in the dead of night, and <lb/>
            murthered their keeper ; had attempted to <lb/>
            make their escape, but were prevented by the <lb/>
            barking of dogs, placed there to watch. <lb/>
            Being thus catched in the fact, they were all <lb/>
            loaded, that night, with heavier irons. In <lb/>
            the morning, the steward informed his lord <lb/>
            of there Several things; when he, without <lb/>
            either feeing them, or hearing their defence, <lb/>
            inftantly gave orders for the crucifixion of <lb/>
            all the Sixteen who were Imprisoned together, <lb/>
            and charged with the fame crime. They <lb/>
            then were brought forth, with chains about <lb/>
            their necks and feet; every one carrying his <lb/>
            crofs. The ministers of the torture heighten­ <lb/>
            ed the necessary punishment with all this ap­ <lb/>
            paratus of horror, to strike the stronger ter­ <lb/>
            ror into the reft of the naves. Chæreas being <lb/>
            now dragged to execution, was filent; but <lb/>
            Polycharmus, who bore his crofs, burn into <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            the following exclamation: —— To thee <lb/>
            (O Callirrhoe !) we owe all there fufferings. <lb/>
            Thou art the caufe of all our woe. The <lb/>
            fleward, hearing there words, imagined that <lb/>
            fome woman was an accomplice in their at­ <lb/>
            tempt. In order, therefore, that she might <lb/>
            be punished, and the contriver of there <lb/>
            plots difcovered; Polycharmus was imme­ <lb/>
            diately looted from the common chain, and <lb/>
            carried before Mithridates. He was then in <lb/>
            one of his pleasure-gardens ; reliefs in body ; <lb/>
            greatly disturbed in mind ; and recalling, to <lb/>
            his memory, Callirrhoe ; fuch as he faw her, <lb/>
            when overwhelmed with farrow. His foul <lb/>
            being now full of this idea, he was offended <lb/>
            at his Servant for coming in ; and thereupon <lb/>
            cried; Why doft thou disturb me ? <lb/>
            My Lord ! (replied the steward) necessity <lb/>
            forces me to it. I having found the author <lb/>
            of this horrid murther ; and the abominable <note type="footnote"> N 4 </note> <lb/>
            wretch, <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            wretch, now brought before thee, is acquaint­ <lb/>
            ed with the wicked woman, who was an <lb/>
            abettor of that execrable deed. Mithrida­ <lb/>
            tes, hearing this, knit his brows ; and, with <lb/>
            a dreadful frown, fpake thus: Inform us <lb/>
            of the woman, who is privy to, and partner <lb/>
            in thy guilt. Polycharmus denied, to the <lb/>
            Jast, his knowing any thing of that affair; <lb/>
            and solemnly protested, that he had no man­ <lb/>
            ner of concern in it. Scourges, fire, and <lb/>
            cords were then ordered to be brought in ; <lb/>
            when one of the executioners, laying hold <lb/>
            of Polycharmus: Tell us (faid he) the <lb/>
            name of the woman, whom thou didft here <lb/>
            confess to be the caufe of all thy woes, —— <lb/>
            To this Polycharmus replied :Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            This name struck Mithridates ; he imagining <lb/>
            it bore an aufpicious resemblance to that of <lb/>
            the Milefian fair-one. He yet did not think <lb/>
            it prudent to be over strict in his enquiry ; <lb/>
            left <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            lest he Should thereby bring difgrace on so <lb/>
            loved a name. But as his friends and ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance pressed him to fearch farther into <lb/>
            this affair: Let Callirrhoe (cried he) <lb/>
            be immediately produced.- The executioners <lb/>
            then torturing Polycharmus: ——Who is this <lb/>
            woman (said they:) where is she to be <lb/>
            found ? -The wretched Polycharmus, being <lb/>
            in fuch agonies that he did not know what <lb/>
            to fay, yet unwilling to accufe any woman <lb/>
            falsely Wherefore (cried he) do you thus <lb/>
            torment me to no purpose; fince you are en­ <lb/>
            quiring for one who is not here ? The per­ <lb/>
            son I fpake of is Callirrhoe the Syracusian ; <lb/>
            daughter to Hermocrates the Prætor. At <lb/>
            these words a blush covered the cheeks of <lb/>
            Mithridates, and he was all over in a sweat. <lb/>
            He even shed involuntary tears; which Po­ <lb/>
            lycharmus obferving, he faid no more; and <lb/>
            all the spectators continued filent, and in fuf­ <lb/>
            pence; <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            pence; they not knowing what to think on <lb/>
            this occasion. Mithridates recovering at last <lb/>
            his Spirits, though with extreme difficulty <lb/>
            What haft thou (said he) to do with that <lb/>
            Callirrhoe ? And why didst thou, when ready <lb/>
            to expire, mention her name ?—My Lord <lb/>
            (replied Polycharmus,) the story would be <lb/>
            long, and of no advantage to me. Besides, <lb/>
            I would not now trouble you with unfeafon­ <lb/>
            able, or superfluous words; and am afraid <lb/>
            that my friend, who is now fixed to the <lb/>
            crofs, will be dead before me; and I would <lb/>
            gladly accompany him to the shades be­ <lb/>
            low.—— The anger of the auditors vanished <lb/>
            in an instant; and their animofity melted into <lb/>
            companion. Mithridates, efpecially, being <lb/>
            greatly confuted, faid :——Fear not; thou <lb/>
            wilt not tire me by thy narrative ; for I am <lb/>
            naturally humane and benevolent. Thou <lb/>
            mayest fafely fet forth, to me, the whole <lb/>
            truth, <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            truth, without omitting a single circumstance. <lb/>
            Tell me then who thou art, and thy coun­ <lb/>
            try; how thou cameft to Caria; and by <lb/>
            what chance thou art here in chains, tilling <lb/>
            the ground. But, above all, inform me con­ <lb/>
            cerning Callirrhoe, and who thy friend is.</p>
          <p>III. Polycharmus began his story thus <lb/>
            Both of us, now in fetters, were born in <lb/>
            Syracuse. My companion is the firft youth, <lb/>
            in all Sicily, for rank and wealth; and once <lb/>
            remarkable for the beauty of his perfon. I <lb/>
            am of mean extraction, and yet his compa­ <lb/>
            nion and friend. We left our parents, and <lb/>
            our native country, and put to fea: I out of <lb/>
            regard to him; and he for the fake of his <lb/>
            wife, named Callirrhoe; whom Chæreas, <lb/>
            fuppofing her dead, had interred with great <lb/>
            funeral pomp. After this, fome facrilegious <lb/>
            wretches, breaking open the tomb, found her <lb/>
            alive; <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            alive ; and carrying her to Ionia, they there <lb/>
            fold her. Theron, who was the robber, <lb/>
            being put publickly to the torture, confessed <lb/>
            all there particulars. Hereupon the Syracu­ <lb/>
            sian commonwealth fent out a ship of war, <lb/>
            having embassadors on board, with orders <lb/>
            to feek Callirrhoe. This fhip, when lying <lb/>
            quietly at anchor near Miletus, fome barba­ <lb/>
            rians burnt in the night; and killed most of <lb/>
            the crew; after which, throwing myself, and <lb/>
            my friend, into irons, they brought us hither, <lb/>
            and fold us for Haves. We bore our mif­ <lb/>
            fortunes with fortitude and moderation ; when <lb/>
            fome of the captives imprisoned with us, (but <lb/>
            who we know not) having broke their chains; <lb/>
            they committed the murder, for which we, <lb/>
            by thy command, were all led to the crofs. <lb/>
            My companion, even when going to die, did not <lb/>
            accuse his wife ; but I, (alas !) overcome by <lb/>
            the intolerable pangs, named her ; and de­ <lb/>
            clared <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            dared her to have been the caufe of all our <lb/>
            evils; as it was for her fake, only, that we <lb/>
            had undertaken this voyage. He had not <lb/>
            done speaking, when Mithridates cried <lb/>
            aloud. :Thou meaner Chæreas !——Yes, <lb/>
            (replied Polycharmus ;) Chæreas my friend. <lb/>
            I now befcech thee (my Lord !) to order the <lb/>
            executioner not to Separate our crosses.—— <lb/>
            To this fad relation, tears and groans fucceed­ <lb/>
            ed ; when Mithridates instantly difpatched all <lb/>
            the people towards Chæreas, to countermand <lb/>
            his execution. They found him just going <lb/>
            to afcend his crofs; all the reft having been <lb/>
            put to death. Thofe who were running, <lb/>
            burft into different cries at a distance; they <lb/>
            roaring out, to the executioner: Hold! <lb/>
            Come down ! Strike not! Leave him !—— <lb/>
            And now the executioner stopt his hand ; <lb/>
            when Chæreas, who wifhed to be freed from <lb/>
            a wretched life, and an it! fated paffion, de­ <lb/>
            fended <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            tended reluctantly from the crofs. As the <lb/>
            croud were bringing him along, Mithridates <lb/>
            ran forward, and embracing him, said:— <lb/>
            My brother, and my friend ! Thy fullen and <lb/>
            unfeafonable filence had like to have proved <lb/>
            fatal to thee; by alluring me, as it were, <lb/>
            to the commission of an impious act. ——He <lb/>
            instantly commanded his Servants to conduit <lb/>
            the young men to the bath ; next to refreth, <lb/>
            and afterwards clothe each of them in a rich <lb/>
            Grecian robe. Mithridates then invited all <lb/>
            his friends to a banquet; and offered up a <lb/>
            facrifice, for Chæreas's escape from death. <lb/>
            The guests carouzed during many hours; <lb/>
            their reception was very friendly; and no­ <lb/>
            thing was wanting to compleat their festivity. <lb/>
            During the course of this mirthful enter­ <lb/>
            tainment, Mithridates, being heated by <lb/>
            love and wine, fpake thus: I do not <lb/>
            (0 Chæreas !) pity thee on account of thy <lb/>
            chains, <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            chains, or for thy being fentenced to the <lb/>
            cross; but because thou waft torn from fo <lb/>
            beautiful a wife. Chæreas, thunder-struck <lb/>
            at thefe words, cried :——Where didst thou <lb/>
            fee my Callirrhoe ?—She is no longer thine, <lb/>
            (replied Mithridates) but the lawful wife of <lb/>
            Dionyfius, of Miletus; and they have already <lb/>
            a fon. Chæreas, unable to contain himfelf, <lb/>
            fell at Mithridates's feet, and cried My <lb/>
            Lord !Return me to my crofs. The <lb/>
            forcing me to live, after fo dreadful a rela­ <lb/>
            tion, would be a still greater punishment. 0 <lb/>
            faithless Callirrhoe ! 0 most wicked of wo­ <lb/>
            men ! For thee I was fold ; for thee plough­ <lb/>
            ed the ground; for thee bore the crofs ; for <lb/>
            thee given up to the vile hands of the execu­ <lb/>
            tioner : and, while thou wert rioting luxuri- <lb/>
            QUay, and celebrating thy nuptials, the <lb/>
            wretched Chæreas was groaning in chains. <lb/>
            It <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            It was not enough that thou (houldeft marry <lb/>
            another man, during Chæreas's life-time, but <lb/>
            thou alfo must become a mother. The <lb/>
            whole assembly began to weep, and the festi­ <lb/>
            val was changed to a scene of borrow: but <lb/>
            Mithridates, only, was pleased at hearing <lb/>
            all there particulars: he fondly hoping, that <lb/>
            he should thereby have an opportunity of <lb/>
            fpeaking and acting freely, with regard to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, upon pretence of assisting his <lb/>
            friend. ——It is now (faid he) night. Let us <lb/>
            go. To-morrow we will talk over all thefe <lb/>
            matters, when our heads shall be clear; to <lb/>
            weighty an affair requiring more leisure. <lb/>
            Saying thefe words, Mithridates role from <lb/>
            table; when the company breaking up, he <lb/>
            went to his ufual place of reft; after having <lb/>
            allotted an apartment for the Syracufian <lb/>
            youths, and ordered servants to wait upon <lb/>
            them. <lb/>
            IV. There <pb n="193"/>
            </p>
          <p>IV. Thefe three passed the Succeeding <lb/>
            night in deep reflexions, and not one of them <lb/>
            could sleep. Chæreas was exafperated, and <lb/>
            Polycharmus soothed his anguifh ; but Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates was overjoyed, from the hopes that, <lb/>
            like as in the gymnaftic exercifes, after Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas and Dionyfius should have quite fpent <lb/>
            themselves in wrestling together; he, their <lb/>
            rival, might rush in between the two com­ <lb/>
            batants; and, without contending, make the <lb/>
            inchanting Callirrhoe his prize. On the mor­ <lb/>
            row, every one being ordered to give his opi­ <lb/>
            nion ; Chæreas declared,- That he was for <lb/>
            going directly to Miletus; and there demand <lb/>
            Callirrhoe : He fondly imagining that she, <lb/>
            the Infant she faw him, would no longer con­ <lb/>
            tinue with Dionyfius. Mithridates faid : <lb/>
            Go then (Chæreas !) I would not flop thee; <lb/>
            and only with that thou hadst not been se­ <lb/>
            parated, even a single day, from thy wife. <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
            Would <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            Would to the Gods that thou hadft never left <lb/>
            Sicily! but since Chance, or Fortune, who <lb/>
            ever delights in novelty, has doomed thee to <lb/>
            act so tragical a part; thou must weigh things <lb/>
            more maturely; and conduct thyfelf with <lb/>
            greater wifdom for the future. The hurry <lb/>
            thou art now in, arifes lefs from reafon than <lb/>
            from paffion; which blinds thee with regard <lb/>
            to things to come; and prevents thy acting <lb/>
            with due precaution. Thou art going alone, <lb/>
            and a Granger, to a great city; there to force <lb/>
            away, from a perfonage of immenfe wealth, <lb/>
            and the first in all Ionia, a wife united to <lb/>
            him, purfuant to the most facred laws, and by <lb/>
            the most folemn ties. What man, how rich, <lb/>
            how mighty foever he may be, can affift thee ? <lb/>
            Hermocrates and Mithridates, thy only two <lb/>
            powerful friends, are at a great distance from <lb/>
            thee; and fo circumstanced, as to be able <lb/>
            only to bewail thy misfortune, not to give <lb/>
            thee <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            thee fuccour. Befides, I am afraid that a <lb/>
            place, where thou hast undergone fuch a va­ <lb/>
            ricty of fufferings, could not but be still in­ <lb/>
            aufpicious; and that infinitely greater evils <lb/>
            would then await thee : for though thou waft <lb/>
            bound in chains in Miletus, yet thy life was <lb/>
            Spared ; and though fold for a slave, it was <lb/>
            I who became thy matter. But Should Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius hear, that thou art laying snares, in <lb/>
            order to take his wife from him, what Deity <lb/>
            could then fhield thee from his fury ? Thou <lb/>
            mightest be delivered up to the tyrant; on <lb/>
            which occafion no one would (perhaps) be­ <lb/>
            lieve thee to be Chaereas ; and even, fuppo­ <lb/>
            ling this poffible, thou wouldest be expofed <lb/>
            to yet greater danger, on that very account.' <lb/>
            Thou only art ignorant of the nature of <lb/>
            Love; that God delighting in artifice and <lb/>
            fraud. I therefore would adviCe thee, firft to <lb/>

            she has not banilhed thee from her memory, <lb/>
            and would quit Dionyfius ; or rather, <lb/>
            Increase the house of the illustrious man, <lb/>
            To whom she's join'd in Hymen'j rosy bands.</p>
          <p>Write (I fay,) to her. Let her grieve: let <lb/>
            her rejoice: Let her seek thee: Let her call <lb/>
            thee. I will take care that thy letter be Safely <lb/>
            delivered. Go then and write. ——Chæreas <lb/>
            being afterwards alone, he, in compliance <lb/>
            with Mithridates's advice, was going to pour <lb/>
            forth his grief; but was prevented by his <lb/>
            faft-flowing tears, and the tremor of his <lb/>
            hand. At laft, after bemoaning his fad fate, <lb/>
            he began his letter as follows : Chæreas <lb/>
            to Callirrhoe, greeting. ——I live, and owe <lb/>
            my life to Mithridates, my patron, my bene­ <lb/>
            factor ; and thine (I hope,) alfo. I was fold <lb/>
            in Caria, by Barbarians; who burnt the noble <lb/>
            ship <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            ship (the admiral's) which thy father com­ <lb/>
            manded. With regard to the reft of my fel­ <lb/>
            low citizens, I know not what is become of <lb/>
            them. Myself, and Polycharmus my friend, <lb/>
            were going to execution, when both were <lb/>
            snatched from the jaws of death, by the <lb/>
            mercy of our matter. Mithridates, who la­ <lb/>
            vished every kindnefs upon me, afterwards <lb/>
            struck a poniard into my heart, when he in­ <lb/>
            formed me of thy fecond nuptials. Being <lb/>
            born a mortal, I naturally expected to die; but <lb/>
            could never have imagined, that thou wouldeft <lb/>
            have given thyfelf to a fecond hufband. Re­ <lb/>
            pent, and change thy mind, I conjure thee <lb/>
            on my knees; I now bedewing this letter <lb/>
            with my tears, and killing it a thousand times. <lb/>
            I am thy Chaereas; he whom thou didst be­ <lb/>
            hold when a virgin, and going to the temple <lb/>
            of Venus ; the man for whore fake thou didft <lb/>
            pafs fo many sleepless nights. Call to mind <note type="footnote"> O 3 </note> <lb/>
            the <lb/>

            the bridal chamber ; and that mystical night <lb/>
            when we gave each other the strongest testimo- <lb/>
            Dies of chaste and inviolate love. I indeed have <lb/>
            been guilty of jealoufy. This is natural to <lb/>
            lovers; but then I have attoned for it by my <lb/>
            fufferings. I have been fold ; I have groaned <lb/>
            in captivity ; I have dragged the ignominious <lb/>
            chain. Do not then treafure up too tena­ <lb/>
            ciously in thy memory, the hafty and most <lb/>
            unfortunate blow I heedlesly gave thee ; fince <lb/>
            I have been exposed, for thy fake, to the hor­ <lb/>
            rors of the crofs, without once accusing thee. <lb/>
            If Chæreas is not yet blotted from thy me­ <lb/>
            mory, all my fufferings will be as nothing: <lb/>
            but Should I be forgot, this must prove, to <lb/>
            me, as a Sentence of death.</p>
          <p>V. Mithridates delivered this letter to Hy­ <lb/>
            ginus, his most faithful fervant, and the fuper­ <lb/>
            intendant over all his possessions in Caria ; and <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            to him he difclofed his fecret paffion for Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe. Mithridates himfelf wrote a letter to <lb/>
            her, fetting forth his regard for, and the at­ <lb/>
            tention he had shown her, in preserving Cho­ <lb/>
            reas for her fake. He advifed her not to <lb/>
            flight her sirft hufband; offering to march <lb/>
            an army to Miletus, in order that herfelf, <lb/>
            and Chaereas, might be happily revered to <lb/>
            each other, in cafe this met with her appro­ <lb/>
            bation. He difpatched three other fervants <lb/>
            with Hyginus ; they carrying precious gifts, <lb/>
            and a great fum of money. The three do­ <lb/>
            mestics were told, (to prevent their suspect­ <lb/>
            ing, or being suspected) that Mithridates had <lb/>
            rent thofe presents to Dionyfius. Hyginus, <lb/>
            on his arrival at Priene *, was commanded to <lb/>
            leave his companions there; when himfelf <lb/>
            was to go to Miletus, under the character <lb/>
            of an Ionian, as he was a perfect master of the <note type="footnote"> * A maritime town in Ionia. </note> <note type="footnote"> 04 </note> <lb/>

             <pb n="200"/>
            Greek language; and, after acting there as a <lb/>
            fpy, and getting all the information possible, <lb/>
            for his better conducing the affair; he then <lb/>
            was to fetch the other three, from Priene to <lb/>
            Miletus. Hyginus fet out, and acted pur­ <lb/>
            suant to his orders. However, Fortune would <lb/>
            not permit this fcheme to be executed, in the <lb/>
            manner it had been projected; but gave rife <lb/>
            to incidents, still more important. Hyginus, <lb/>
            being gone to Miletus, the servants whom he <lb/>
            had left in Priene, having now no director, <lb/>
            and gold at command, they began to live in <lb/>
            the most profufe manner. In a fmall city <lb/>
            (Priene) abounding with Grecian curiosity; <lb/>
            this Perfian-like luxury, of the servants, could <lb/>
            not but draw every eye upon them i and <lb/>
            strangers, who thus pampered themselves, <lb/>
            were naturally confidered as robbers, at leaft <lb/>
            as fugitive Haves. The governor coming to <lb/>
            their inn, found, after the most strict search, <lb/>
            a great <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            a great quantity of gold ; and abundance of <lb/>
            very precious trinkets, and other female orna­ <lb/>
            ments; when he, fuppofing them to be Hole, <lb/>
            asked the fervants ; who they were, and where <lb/>
            they had got all thofe things ?The <lb/>
            men, dreading the torture, declared that Mi­ <lb/>
            thridates, governor of Caria, had rent thofe <lb/>
            feveral articles as prefents to Dionyfius; and <lb/>
            then shewed him the letters. The governor <lb/>
            did not break them open, they being fealed ; <lb/>
            but delivering them to the ferjeants, with the <lb/>
            gifts and the Servants, he fent them all to <lb/>
            Dionyfius; thinking he should thereby give <lb/>
            him the strongest restimony of his friendship. <lb/>
            Dionyfius had then, at his table, the most <lb/>
            noble citizens ; and the banquet was vastly <lb/>
            splendid. Mufic, both vocal and instrumen­ <lb/>
            tal, was heard; when a Servant delivered to <lb/>
            him the letter, whofe purport was as fol­ <lb/>
            lows:— —Blas, governor of Priene, to Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            nysius his friend, greeting: The gifts and <lb/>
            letters feat thee from Mithridates, governor <lb/>
            of Caria, were going to be defiroyed, by <lb/>
            the wicked fervants intruded with them; for <lb/>
            which reason I Seized, and Cent them to <lb/>
            thee.——Dionysius read this letter aloud in <lb/>
            the midst of the company; he being delight­ <lb/>
            ed with the presents, which were worthy of <lb/>
            a king. He then ordered the other letters to <lb/>
            be broke open, and would have read them ; <lb/>
            when perceiving these words,—Chæreas to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe. I live: <lb/>
            Instant his knees were with a tremblingseiz'd: <lb/>
            Dimm'd were his eyes, and icy-cold his heart.</p>
          <p>And though ready to faint, he yet held faft <lb/>
            the letters, for fear fome other perfon should <lb/>
            read them. The fright which the family and <lb/>
            the guefts were in, occasioned by this melan­ <lb/>
            choly accident; and the noife they made in <lb/>
            hurry­ <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            hurrying up and down, brought Dionyfius <lb/>
            to himfelf; when being fenfible of his fad <lb/>
            perturbation of mind, he ordered his fer­ <lb/>
            vants to carry him to another room ; that he <lb/>
            might be alone and undiflurbed. Upon this, <lb/>
            the company broke up in the utmoft confu­ <lb/>
            sion &gt; they fuppofing that he had been Seized <lb/>
            with an apoplectic fit. Dionyfius being at <lb/>
            last recovered, read over the letters again and <lb/>
            again; during which his foul was agitated by <lb/>
            different passions; he raging one moment <lb/>
            and defponding the next: now oppressed with <lb/>
            fear; now not believing; for he could no <lb/>
            ways imagine that Chæreas was still living, <lb/>
            the bare supposition of which would have been <lb/>
            death to him : but he suspected, that the <lb/>
            whole was an adulterous artifice employed <lb/>
            by Mithridates, in order for him to seduce <lb/>
            Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            VI. Here- <pb n="204"/>
             </p>
          <p>VI. Hereupon Dionyfius caufed his wife to <lb/>
            be more strictly watched, in the day-time ; <lb/>
            to prevent any one from approaching, or <lb/>
            bringing her the lead tidings from Caria. <lb/>
            He now meditated the following revenge. <lb/>
            There happened very luckily to be then, in <lb/>
            Miletus, Pharnaces governor of Lydia and <lb/>
            of Ionia; who was considered as the chief <lb/>
            of thofe whom the king of Persia intrusted <lb/>
            with the fway of the provinces of Alia Minor. <lb/>
            Dionyfius went to Pharnaces, he being his <lb/>
            friend, and defired a Secret conference with <lb/>
            him. Being alone: ——My Lord, (faid he,) <lb/>
            I befeech thee to aid no lets thyself than me. <lb/>
            Mithridates the worft of men, and who en­ <lb/>
            vies thee, having lately been my guest; now <lb/>
            trampling on the laws of hospitality, is laying <lb/>
            fnares to disturb my conjugal felicity, by send­ <lb/>
            ing a letter, and a large fum of gold, to my <lb/>
            wife, with a view to corrupt her. ——Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            nyfius then drew forth the letter, and reading <lb/>
            it, informed him of the whole stratagem. <lb/>
            Pharnaces listened with pleafure to this dif­ <lb/>
            course; and, poffibly the more fo, on account <lb/>
            of Mithridates ; they being at variance, and <lb/>
            having frequently quarrelled, occasioned by <lb/>
            the vicinity of their provinces; but much <lb/>
            more, becaufe they were rivals in love : for <lb/>
            Pharnaces alfo was Wrongly enamoured with <lb/>
            Callirrhoe; and, for her fake, would go very <lb/>
            often to Miletus; and there entertain Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius and his wife in banquets. Pharnaces <lb/>
            promised to assist him with all his might; and <lb/>
            then wrote the following letter in cypher — <lb/>
            Pharnaces, governor of Lydia and of Ionia, <lb/>
            to Artaxerxes his fovereign Lord, greeting: <lb/>
            Dionyfius of Miletus, who, with his whole <lb/>
            family, have ever been thy faithful subjects, <lb/>
            and most zealoufly attached to thee and to thy <lb/>
            house; declared to me, with tears, that <note type="footnote">6 </note> <lb/>
            Mi- <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            Mithridates governor of Caria, whom Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius had hospitably entertained, now at­ <lb/>
            tempts to deduce Callirrhoe his wife. This <lb/>
            conduit reflects dishonour on, or rather is <lb/>
            highly prejudicial to thy interest, as every <lb/>
            injustice, in a governor, is blame-worthy; <lb/>
            but efpecially the deed here complained of. <lb/>
            Dionyfius is the most powerful man in all <lb/>
            Ionia ; and the beauty of his wife is fo exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly renowned, that it will be impossible for <lb/>
            such an outrage to be kept fecret. This <lb/>
            letter being brought, the king read it to his <lb/>
            friends; and commanded them to give their <lb/>
            several opinions upon it ; which being taken, <lb/>
            they were found to vary very much. Thofe <lb/>
            who bore ill-will to, and envied Mithridates, <lb/>
            or wanted his government, declared ; that a <lb/>
            man who endeavoured to draw away, by the <lb/>
            most insidious arts, the wife of a perfon of <lb/>
            the first rank, ought by no means to be <lb/>
            fpared. <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            spared. But others of a more humane dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, and who respected Mithridates (and <lb/>
            there were numerous and powersul) oppofed <lb/>
            the removal, by calumny, of a man of strict <lb/>
            honour. As therefore the opinions were di­ <lb/>
            rectly opposite, the king did not then deter­ <lb/>
            mine; but referred the matter to a future <lb/>
            day. Night being come, Artaxerxes reflected <lb/>
            with indignation, on the conduct of a man, <lb/>
            whofe duty it was to maintain the honour of <lb/>
            his fovereign. He alfo revolved, with pain, <lb/>
            an action, which, Should it pars unnoticed, <lb/>
            would fhow that Mithridates might difobey <lb/>
            the royal orders with impunity. The mo­ <lb/>
            narch was thereupon for fummoning Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates -to take his trial; but another passion <lb/>
            prompted him to command the appearance of <lb/>
            the beautiful woman at the fame time. Love, <lb/>
            and the Shades of night, were his only coun­ <lb/>
            sellors in thofe lonely hours: and brought <lb/>
            strongly <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            strongly to his remembrance, that part of the. <lb/>
            letter which expatiated on the wonderful <lb/>
            charms of the fair one. The report which <lb/>
            had long prevailed, at court, of there being, <lb/>
            in Ionia, an exquifitc beauty called Callirihoe, <lb/>
            inflamed the king Hill more; and he only <lb/>
            blamed Pharnaces for not having mentioned <lb/>
            her name in his letter. Yet being in doubt, <lb/>
            whether there might not be a female, Hill <lb/>
            more lovely than her who was so highly ex­ <lb/>
            tolled : he therefore judged proper to sum­ <lb/>
            mon her, at all events, likewise. The king <lb/>
            thereupon wrote thus to Pharnaces: Send <lb/>
            Dionyfius the Milefian, my fervant, to me.— <lb/>
            And in manner following to Mithridates:—— <lb/>
            Appear : and prove that thou haft not employ­ <lb/>
            ed ,artifices, to seduce the wife of Dionyfius.</p>
          <p>VII. Mithridates was thunder struck at the <lb/>
            order, and could not conceive what might <lb/>
            t <lb/>
            have <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            have given rife to this accusation; when Hy­ <lb/>
            ginus returning, told him all that had be. <lb/>
            fallen the Servants. Mithridates now finding <lb/>
            that he had been discovered by his letters, re­ <lb/>
            solved, after the moft ferious reflexions, not <lb/>
            to go to the king; whore anger, and the <lb/>
            virulence of calumny, he equally dreaded. <lb/>
            He therefore determined to feize upon Mile­ <lb/>
            tus ; to kill Dionyfius, who had caufed his <lb/>
            fummons ; to carry off Callirrhoe; and laflly, <lb/>
            to rebel against his fovereign. But where­ <lb/>
            fore (faid he) should I fly, to give up my <lb/>
            liberty into the hands of Artaxerxes &gt; Per­ <lb/>
            haps I may conquer all thefe difficulties, by <lb/>
            flaying at home: for the king is at a great <lb/>
            distance. But then he may fend out his ge­ <lb/>
            nerals, to oppose me. Befides, should he <lb/>
            bring any other charge against me, I could <lb/>
            not fuffer more than I now do. Be this as <lb/>
            it will, I muft not, in the mean time, give <note type="footnote"> Vol. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
            up <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            up two important articles; my love, and the <lb/>
            government of my province. The title of <lb/>
            prince, is pompous on a Mausolæum ; and it <lb/>
            were fweet to die with Callirrhoe.— While <lb/>
            he was thus debating within himself, and <lb/>
            preparing to rife up in arms againft Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            he received advice, that Dionyfius was gone <lb/>
            from Miletus, and had taken Callirrhoe with <lb/>
            him. Mithridates was more deeply afflicted <lb/>
            at this news, than at the fummons for him <lb/>
            to take his trial. Bewailing then his wretch­ <lb/>
            ed fate —With what hopes (cried he) do <lb/>
            I continue here ? Fortune is my enemy whi­ <lb/>
            therfoever I go. Perhaps Artaxerxes, as <lb/>
            am innocent, will have compaffion on me. <lb/>
            But should I be fentenced to die, I then shall <lb/>
            again behold Callirrhoe; and Chæreas, with <lb/>
            Polycharmus, will not only be my advocates, <lb/>
            but alfo my witnesses, at the trial. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing commanded his retinue to attend him, <lb/>
            he <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            he left Carla with the most pleating hopes; <lb/>
            from a consciousness of his not having injured <lb/>
            any one. And now the Carians accompanied <lb/>
            him, not with tears, but with victims and a <lb/>
            fplendid train. Such was the proceffion Cu­ <lb/>
            pid fent from Caria. But that which he dif­ <lb/>
            patched from Ionia, was still more auguft; <lb/>
            it being heightened by inchanting beauty. <lb/>
            Fame flew before, founding forth to the world <lb/>
            the approach of Callirrhoe; that univerfally <lb/>
            extolled name; that renowned mafter-piece <lb/>
            of nature <lb/>
            To golden Venus like, or bright Diana.</p>
          <p>The rumour of the trial rendered her still <lb/>
            more famous. Whole cities went forth to <lb/>
            meet her; the ftreets, wherever she passed, <lb/>
            were crouded with spectators ; and she ap­ <lb/>
            peared still more beautiful than imagination <lb/>
            or fame had painted her. Yet all there ap- <note type="footnote"> P a </note> <lb/>
            plauses, <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            plaufes, and invidious praifes, ferved only to <lb/>
            torture Dionyfius; and his Supreme felicity <lb/>
            Served but to fill him with still greater appro­ <lb/>
            hensions. Being a man of learning, he knew <lb/>
            the ficklenefs of the amorous God, who ever <lb/>
            delights in novelty; for which reason poets <lb/>
            and fculptors afcribe to him darts and flames <lb/>
            both there being the lightest things in nature, <lb/>
            and ever volatile. He alfo recalled every <lb/>
            ancient story ; with the fate, and the many <lb/>
            vicissitudes to which beauties have been fub­ <lb/>
            ject. There reflections terrified Dionyfius. <lb/>
            He looked upon all men as his rivals; not <lb/>
            only his adversary, but likewife his judge. <lb/>
            Hence he repented his having communicated <lb/>
            the accufation, fo precipitately, to Pharnaces; <lb/>
            as he otherwife might have lived undisturbed, <lb/>
            in the embraces of his darling wife: and have <lb/>
            kept her much more eafily to himfelf, in Mi­ <lb/>
            letus, than when roving up and down Alia. <lb/>
            He <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
            He yet did not discover, to the laft, this Se­ <lb/>
            cret to any perfon; nor inform, even his <lb/>
            wife, of the motive of their journey; but <lb/>
            pretended, that the king had rent for him, to <lb/>
            confult him upon the affairs of Ionia. In <lb/>
            the mean time Callirrhoe was grieved, to <lb/>
            travel at fo great a distance from the Grecian <lb/>
            fea ; for, while the harbour of Miletus con­ <lb/>
            tinued in fight, she imagined herself near to <lb/>
            Syracufe: not to mention, that the fight of <lb/>
            Chæreas's sepulchre was a great consolation <lb/>
            to her.</p>
