          <p>THE present volume comprises three connected dialogues, <lb/>
            written no doubt towards the close of Plato's life (about <lb/>
            350 B. C.), subsequently to his travels in Italy, Sicily, and <lb/>
            Egypt, and after his philosophic views had attained their <lb/>
            full maturity and developement. Two of them, indeed, <lb/>
            -the Republic and the Timæus,—are among the most im­ <lb/>
            portant and most carefully elaborated in the entire series <lb/>
            of the Platonic dialogues ;-the former being the summary of <lb/>
            Plato's whole ethical system, and combining the results of <lb/>
            most of the other dialogues,-the latter comprising the full <lb/>
            and almost sole developement of his speculations on the <lb/>
            formation of the Universe and the organization of Man. <lb/>
            The Critias can be considered only as an historical, or <lb/>
            rather, mythical supplement to the Timæus;—and it appears <lb/>
            to have been left unfinished at the author's death.</p>
          <p>The translation has been formed, with some few excep­ <lb/>
            tions, on the text of Stallbaum, now justly reputed as the <lb/>
            most correct in existence ;—and great pains have been taken <lb/>
            throughout, not only to make it a literally correct ex­ <lb/>
            ponent of the original, but also to transfuse into it that <lb/>
            easy flow of language which constitutes the peculiar charm <lb/>
            of Plato's writing. In both these respects, therefore, it will <lb/>
            be found strikingly to differ from the uncouth, obscure, un- <lb/>
            English, and often extremely erroneous version of Taylor, <lb/>
            - the only English dress in which this great philoso­ <note type="footnote">a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
            pher has till now appeared. Abundant use has been made <lb/>
            of the Latin interpretations dispersed through Stallbaum's <lb/>
            notes ;-and the translator has not scrupled to avail himself <lb/>
            of the valuable aid derivable from the French versions of <lb/>
            Leroy, Cousin, and Martin, and the German versions of <lb/>
            Schleiermacher and Schneider, the latter of which, only <lb/>
            recently published, deserves the highest praise for its extreme <lb/>
            correctness and perspicuity.</p>
          <p>Notes have been added, where the meaning seemed to require <lb/>
            explanation or illustration, as well as to indicate any varia­ <lb/>
            tion in the text ;—and when any of the other dialogues have <lb/>
            been referred to, the quotation is given from Serranus's edition, <lb/>
            printed by Henry Stephens, 1578, in three volumes folio,­ <lb/>
            the last of which comprises the dialogues here translated. <lb/>
            Separate introductions preface each dialogue ; — and the <lb/>
            volume opens with a brief account of the Platonic philosophy <lb/>
            generally,—carefully compiled from the writings of Hitter, <lb/>
            Van Heusde, Trendelenburg, and Bishop Hampden. On the <lb/>
            whole, therefore, it is hoped that this volume will be found <lb/>
            acceptable, not only to the classical student, but also to the <lb/>
            general reader, as a correct and pleasing exposition of pure <lb/>
            Platonism.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON THE PLATONIC PHILOSOPHY GENERALLY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ALMOST contemporaneously among the learned of Europe, there <lb/>
            has arisen a tendency to study the sublime, spiritual philosophy <lb/>
            of Plato, in preference to the cold materialism of Aristotle, <lb/>
            on which have been erected so many of the systems that have <lb/>
            risen and had their day in our literary world. That this has <lb/>
            not hitherto been the case, and that Platonism (which, in its <lb/>
            spiritualising and purifying tendency, may be deemed to ap­ <lb/>
            proach Christianity,) has not hitherto been exalted to its true <lb/>
            dignity and station in metaphysical history, is chiefly attributable <lb/>
            to the absurd mysticism and fanatical extravagances which the <lb/>
            New Platonists introduced in their interpretations, and which <lb/>
            have too frequently been regarded as true expositions of the <lb/>
            great philosopher, by modern writers either too lazy or too igno­ <lb/>
            rant to go and drink the clear waters at the fountain-head. Plato <lb/>
            himself wrote wonderfully little that cannot be comprehended <lb/>
            by a reflective mind;-and the more his works are studied in <lb/>
            themselves, and apart from false interpretation, the more will <lb/>
            his acute intelligence, practical good sense, and pure morality, <lb/>
            become apparent, and the higher will he rise in the respect and <lb/>
            admiration of the Christian philosopher.</p><pb n="ii"/>
            
          <p>Our present object is, to give a concise view of the philosophic <lb/>
            doctrines of Plato, as a sort of general key to his Dialogues <lb/>
            viewed as a whole ;-and we propose to give, by way of intro­ <lb/>
            duction, a short account of the life of this man of mighty mind, <lb/>
            this " Maximus philosophorum," of whom Eusebius so beautifully <lb/>
            observes, that “he alone, of all the Greeks, reached to the vesti­ <lb/>
            bule of truth, and stood upon its threshold."</p>
          <p>The true moral history of Plato is to be discovered wholly in <lb/>
            his writings. As for the details of his external life, the records <lb/>
            of antiquity furnish information so varying, contradictory, and <lb/>
            uncertain, as to render it difficult to distinguish the true from the <lb/>
            false-the authentic from the fabulous. The following statement, <lb/>
            however, may be relied on, as generally correct.</p>
          <p>Plato, the son of Ariston and Perictione or Potona, was born <lb/>
            (probably in the island of Ægina, then occupied by Athenians) in <lb/>
            the month Thargelion (May), anno 429 A. C., in the third year <lb/>
            of the eighty-seventh Olympiad, about the time of Pericles's <lb/>
            death. By his mother's side he was descended from Codrus and <lb/>
            Solon and he was connected with the most distinguished families <lb/>
            and most renowned political men of his day. His youth falls in <lb/>
            the time of the Peloponnesian war; and his whole life is closely <lb/>
            connected with that brilliant period when the literature of Attica, <lb/>
            historical, dramatic, and rhetorical, was at the zenith of its <lb/>
            glory,-at a time, however, (we must add,)when the seeds of Athe­ <lb/>
            nian decay were being rapidly brought to maturity by the sub­ <lb/>
            stitution of a base and brutalizing ochlocracy for the rational <lb/>
            government of good and patriotic men,—and by the elevation of <lb/>
            a troop of superficial, seductive, truth-perverting, applause-loving <lb/>
            sophists to the throne of true, noble, elevating, divine philosophy. <lb/>
            He received the best education that Athens could furnish ; being <lb/>
            taught reading, writing, and literary knowledge (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γράμματα</foreign>), by <lb/>
            Dionysius, gymnastics by Ariston an Argive wrestler, music <lb/>
            by Metellus of Agrigentum and Draco of Athens, and the <lb/>
            elements of the Heracleitean philosophy by Cratylus and Her­ <lb/>
            mogenes. He had but little inclination for political life; for, <lb/>
            besides being unfitted for it by a retiring habit and weak voice, <lb/>
            he was utterly disgusted by the endless changes that occurred in <lb/>
             <pb n="iii"/>
            the governments of Greece, by the corruptions of the Athenian <lb/>
            democracy, and by the depravity of Athenian manners. His <lb/>
            studies were happily promoted by an early cultivation of poetry, <lb/>
            in which many of his essays were far from unsuccessful; and his <lb/>
            works betray a very considerable acquaintance with mathemati­ <lb/>
            cal science. It was by Socrates, however, that his mind was <lb/>
            imbued with that true philosophic spirit, which gave a right <lb/>
            direction and exalted object to all his after-pursuits. His inter­ <lb/>
            course with this pure, simple-minded moralist began, when he <lb/>
            was twenty years old (B. C. 410), and lasted nearly eleven years; <lb/>
            during which time he carried on his studies and inquiries by <lb/>
            means of books or oral instruction from others, but in all cases <lb/>
            consulting his favourite master, as the interpreter, commentator, <lb/>
            and critic of the various philosophical studies in which he was <lb/>
            engaged. This, indeed, is the view which Plato has given us of <lb/>
            Socrates throughout the Dialogues ;—for the latter seldom or <lb/>
            never appears in them as a didactic expounder of truth, but <lb/>
            rather as the critic of opinions, doctrines, and systems,­ <lb/>
            the judge, in short, to whom everything is to be submitted for <lb/>
            approval, or rejection, or modification, as the case may be.</p>
          <p>After the persecution and death of his divine master (so beau­ <lb/>
            tifully and pathetically related in the Phædo), Plato went to <lb/>
            Megara, where he is said to have attended the Lectures of Euclid; <lb/>
            and he then spent several years in travel, far distant from the <lb/>
            past and the future scene of his philosophical labours ;-nor can <lb/>
            there be any question, but that they were years of great importance <lb/>
            to him for developing the peculiar character of his philosophy. <lb/>
            He visited Megara, Cyrene, the Greek cities in Magna Græcia <lb/>
            and Sicily, (where he became acquainted with Archytas, Phi­ <lb/>
            lolaus, and others of the Pythagorean school;) and he travelled <lb/>
            even as far as Egypt, where he stayed thirteen years in gaining <lb/>
            an insight into the mysterious doctrines and priest-lore of the <lb/>
            sacerdotal caste. At three different periods he visited the court <lb/>
            of Dionysius, tyrant of Sicily, and made several attempts to <lb/>
            subdue his haughty spirit. It was during the first of these resi­ <lb/>
            dences (B. C. 389), that he was employed in the instruction <lb/>
            of Dion, the king's brother-in-law; and in his efforts to rescue his <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            pupil from the general depravity of the court, he was not dis­ <lb/>
            appointed. Dion, inspired with the love of wisdom, was desirous <lb/>
            of introducing his preceptor to Dionysius the tyrant; but Plato's <lb/>
            discourse with him being levelled against the vices and cruelties of <lb/>
            his reign, the tyrant conceived a violent prejudice against him and <lb/>
            formed a design against his life, which, by the aid of Dion, Plato <lb/>
            happily managed to escape. His captivity in Ægina, which <lb/>
            was brought about by the agents of Dionysius the elder, happily <lb/>
            ended in his manumission, through the kindness of his friend <lb/>
            Anicerris; and he then returned to Athens, there to found his <lb/>
            celebrated School in the Academy. Here he lectured during <lb/>
            twenty-two years, and then undertook a second journey to Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse at the instigation of Dion, who hoped, by the philosophical <lb/>
            lessons of Plato, to inform and improve the ill-educated mind of <lb/>
            his nephew, the new ruler of Syracuse—Dionysius the younger. <lb/>
            This prince, it is said, had been brought up by his father wholly <lb/>
            destitute of an enlightened education; and Plato now attempted <lb/>
            the improvement of his mind by philosophy. This second <lb/>
            journey is placed B. C. 367 ; and he stayed four months in Sicily. <lb/>
            It seems to have been a part also of the plan laid down by Dion <lb/>
            and himself, to bring about a wholesome reform in the Sicilian <lb/>
            constitution, and to give it a more aristocratic character. What­ <lb/>
            ever may have been their intentions, however, they were all <lb/>
            frustrated by the weak and luxurious character of Dionysius, <lb/>
            who, however he might relish for a time the sage and virtuous <lb/>
            lessons of Plato, soon found it more conformable to his personal <lb/>
            interests to follow the counsels of Philiston, his father's friend <lb/>
            and adviser. Dion thereupon became the object of his nephew's <lb/>
            jealousy, and was banished on the ground of his ambitious designs. <lb/>
            In this juncture, Plato did not long stay in Syracuse, where his <lb/>
            position would have been, at best, only ambiguous. He returned <lb/>
            once more to Athens; but in consequence of some fresh disagree­ <lb/>
            ments between Dionysius and Dion with respect to the property <lb/>
            of the latter, he was induced (B. C. 361) to take a third journey <lb/>
            to Syracuse. So far, however, from effecting the expected recon­ <lb/>
            ciliation, he came himself to an open rupture with the tyrant, <lb/>
            and was in great personal danger, till relieved by his philosophic <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            friends at Tarentum. From this time he appears to have passed <lb/>
            his old age in tranquillity, engaged with the instruction of his <lb/>
            numerous disciples and the prosecution of his literary labours. <lb/>
            He died, while yet actively employed in teaching, Olymp. 108, <lb/>
            circ. anno 348 B. C.</p>
          <p>He was succeeded as Lecturer in the Academy, by his nephew <lb/>
            Speusippus; and among his principal followers may be men­ <lb/>
            tioned, Hippothales and Callippus of Athens, Xenocrates of <lb/>
            Chaleedon, Aristotle of Stageira, Dion of Syracuse, Demosthenes <lb/>
            the orator, and the philosopher Theophrastus.</p>
          <p>The works of Plato, it scarcely need be mentioned, consist of a <lb/>
            long series of Dialogues, in all of which, except the Laws, the <lb/>
            principal interlocutor is Socrates. The form of dialogue he was <lb/>
            certainly not the first to introduce into philosophy ; and it seems <lb/>
            probable, that his adoption of this form of composition flowed <lb/>
            rather out of the subject than from any desire of direct imitation. <lb/>
            The Eleatic dialectics, with which Platonism is strongly imbued, <lb/>
            could only be explained in the form of question and answer ; and <lb/>
            besides, that Plato should write in the form of dialogue seems to <lb/>
            be the natural consequence of his wish to investigate and analyse <lb/>
            dialectically, and after the manner of Socrates, the various ques­ <lb/>
            tions of philosophy then in vogue. And so Schleiermacher <lb/>
            remarks :-" In every way, not accidentally only or from prac­ <lb/>
            tice and tradition, but necessarily and naturally, Plato's was a <lb/>
            Socratic method, and, indeed, as regards the uninterrupted and <lb/>
            progressive reciprocation, and the deeper impression made upon <lb/>
            the mind of the hearer, to be certainly as much preferred to that <lb/>
            of his master, as the scholar excelled him, as well in constructive <lb/>
            dialectics as in richness and compass of subjective intuition." <lb/>
            And further,—“if we look only to the immediate purpose, that <lb/>
            writing, as regarded by himself and his followers, was only to be <lb/>
            a remembrance of thoughts already current among them (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγραφα <lb/>
            γράμματα</foreign>)—Plato considers all thought so much like spontaneous <lb/>
            activity, that, with him, a remembrance of this kind of what has <lb/>
            been already acquired, must necessarily be so of the first and <lb/>
            original mode of acquisition. Hence, on that account alone, the <lb/>
            dialogistic form, necessary as an imitation of that original and <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            reciprocal communication, would be as indispensable and natural <lb/>
            to his writings as to his oral instruction." But, however essen­ <lb/>
            tially different the form of the dialogues adopted by Plato from <lb/>
            that pursued by other writers, they were composed, as respects <lb/>
            their matter, with constant reference to the labours of his pre­ <lb/>
            decessors. In fact, his whole system is rather critical and eclectic <lb/>
            than dogmatical; and several of his dialogues assume the form <lb/>
            of criticisms on the notions of former philosophers, rather than <lb/>
            the formal developments of any doctrines of his own. He was <lb/>
            thoroughly conversant not only with the leading principles and <lb/>
            peculiar system of Socrates, but had no mean acquaintance, <lb/>
            besides, with the notions of Pythagoras, Heracleitus, Parmenides, <lb/>
            Empedocles, Zeno, Anaxagoras, and Protagoras,—extracts from <lb/>
            whose writings, with animadvertions on their opinions, are <lb/>
            abundantly scattered throughout his works. Yet, however <lb/>
            much Plato may have learnt from the philosophic works of <lb/>
            his predecessors, while he borrowed some of his leading ideas from <lb/>
            his great master Socrates, we should nevertheless be treating him <lb/>
            most unjustly, were we to regard him merely as a compiler and <lb/>
            systematiser of what had been before promulgated, and so deny <lb/>
            him all claim to the merit of being a great original thinker. His <lb/>
            entire system is based, in fact, on some grand and novel ideas, <lb/>
            perhaps faintly shadowed forth by others, but never clearly un­ <lb/>
            folded till the time of Plato. The opposition between the general <lb/>
            law and the particular facts, between the objects of reflection and <lb/>
            the objects of the senses, between the world of intelligence and <lb/>
            the visible world, was never clearly proclaimed till Plato an­ <lb/>
            nounced it. Socrates, indeed, awakened the germ of science, and <lb/>
            laid the foundation of dialectics; but it was Plato who gave <lb/>
            system and consistency to the whole. Socrates had not the men­ <lb/>
            tal capacity or education to arrange his thoughts on any definite <lb/>
            plan;—whereas the kindred genius of Plato was happily fostered <lb/>
            by every encouraging influence, and he stepped in to elaborate <lb/>
            completely the plan of which his master had merely sketched the <lb/>
            first rude outline.</p>
          <p>We proceed next to consider the chronological arrangement of <lb/>
            the Platonic Dialogues, and the natural division according to <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            which they should be classified.* The most obvious arrangemen <lb/>
            is according to their chronological order;—and viewing them in <lb/>
            this light, we may divide them into three classes. In the first <lb/>
            are those written by Plato before he set out on his travels,­ <lb/>
            namely, the Lysis, Phædrus, Laches, Hippias major, Protagoras, <lb/>
            Charmides, Ion, Menon, Alcibiades i., Euthydemus, Euthyphron, <lb/>
            Crito, and the Apology of Socrates ;—in the second are those <lb/>
            which he drew up on his return from his travels, and before his <lb/>
            second journey to Sicily,—namely, the Gorgias, Theætetus, <lb/>
            Sophistes, Politicus, Cratylus, Parmenides, the Symposium, <lb/>
            Menexenus, Philebus, and Phædo; and in the third we place <lb/>
            those written in more advanced life, when his views had become <lb/>
            matured, and his doctrines thoroughly digested into one har­ <lb/>
            monious system,-namely, that noble trilogy comprising the <lb/>
            Timæus, Critias, and Republic,-to which may be added the long <lb/>
            dialogue of the Laws, which, though perfectly genuine, is but <lb/>
            loosely connected with the general system of Plato's philosophy, <lb/>
            and seems to be quite an extraneous section of this part of his <lb/>
            writings. Schleiermacher, however, has presented us with a <lb/>
            classification of a different kind, based on their subject-matter, <lb/>
            and on an acute and careful examination of the connexion of <lb/>
            thought running through the Dialogues. He arranges them <lb/>
            under three heads :—l. Elementary Dialogues, containing the <lb/>
            germs of all that follows,—of Logic as the instrument of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, and of Ideas as its proper object,—viz., the Phædrus, <lb/>
            Protagoras, and Parmenides, the Lysis, Laches, Charmides, and <lb/>
            Euthyphron, to which he appends also, the Apology, Crito, Io, <lb/>
            and Hippias minor ;—2. Progressive Dialogues, which treat of <lb/>
            the distinction between scientific and common knowledge in their <lb/>
            united application to Moral and Physical science,viz., the <lb/>
            Gorgias, Theætetus, Menon, Euthydemus, Cratylus, Sophistes, <lb/>
            Politicus, the Symposium, Phædo, and Philebus, with an Ap­ <lb/>
            pendix containing the Erast, first Alcibiades, Menexenus, and <note type="footnote"> * We have particularised here only those Dialogues which are usually regarded <lb/>
            as genuine. The Hipparchus, Minos, Alcibiades ii, Clitophon, Theages, Eryxias, <lb/>
            Demodocus, Epinomis, and the Letters, are of disputable origin, and to be assigned, <lb/>
            probably, to some of Plato's followers. ' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            Hippias major ;—3. Constructive Dialogues, containing an object­ <lb/>
            ive scientific exposition, in which the practical and speculative <lb/>
            are completely united,—viz., the Timæus, the Critias, and the <lb/>
            Republic, with an Appendix comprising the Laws, Epistles, &amp;c. <lb/>
            It is clear also that the Dialogues will allow of yet another mode <lb/>
            of arrangement, according to their contents,-as being either <lb/>
            Dialectical, Ethical, or Physical :-this division, indeed, is clearly <lb/>
            discernible in his works, though several may not be assignable to <lb/>
            any one part in particular:—thus, the Theætetus and its two <lb/>
            connected dialogues,-the Gorgias and Protagoras, with the <lb/>
            Cratylus and the Sophistes, are clearly dialectical; the Phædrus, <lb/>
            Philebus, Republic, and Laws are ethical, and the Timæus is <lb/>
            exclusively physical. If, however, we would view the Dialogues <lb/>
            as a whole, with all its parts fully harmonising, we should inquire <lb/>
            what was the philosopher's great object visible throughout those <lb/>
            writings. Mr. Sewell answers this very satisfactorily;—we shall <lb/>
            give his own expressive, glowing words:—“ Plato's great object <lb/>
            was man. He lived with man, felt as a man, held intercourse <lb/>
            with kings, interested himself deeply in the political revolutions <lb/>
            of Sicily, was the pupil of one, whose boast it was to have brought <lb/>
            down philosophy from heaven to earth, that it might raise man <lb/>
            up from earth to heaven ; and, above all, he was a witness and an <lb/>
            actor in the midst of that ferment of humanity exhibited in the de­ <lb/>
            mocracy of Athens. The object constantly before the eyes of Plato <lb/>
            was the incorporated spirit, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγα θρέμμα</foreign> of human lawlessness; <lb/>
            he saw it, indeed, in an exhausted state, its power passed away, <lb/>
            its splendour torn off, and all the sores and ulcers which former <lb/>
            demagogues had pampered and concealed, now laid bare and <lb/>
            beyond cure." Indeed, as the same writer well observes;—“ the <lb/>
            state of the Athenian democracy is the real clue to the philosophy <lb/>
            of Plato. It would be proved, if by nothing else, by one little <lb/>
            touch in the Republic. The Republic is the summary of his whole <lb/>
            system, and the key-stones of all the other Dialogues are uniformly <lb/>
            let into it. But the object of the Republic is to exhibit the misery <lb/>
            of man let loose from law, and to throw out a general plan for <lb/>
            making him subject to law, and thus to perfect his nature. This <lb/>
            is exhibited on a large scale in the person of a State; and in the <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            masterly historical sketch which, in the eighth and ninth Books, <lb/>
            he draws of the changes of society, having painted in the minutest <lb/>
            detail the form of a licentious democracy, he fixes it by the <lb/>
            slightest allusion (it was perhaps all that he could hazard) on the <lb/>
            existing state of Athens; and then passes on to a frightful pro­ <lb/>
            phecy of that tyranny which would inevitably follow. All the <lb/>
            other dialogues bring us to the Republic, and the Republic brings <lb/>
            us to this as its end and aim."</p>
          <p>We may now proceed to take a general review of the Platonic <lb/>
            philosophy, and his theory of Ideas in particular, an intelligent <lb/>
            acquaintance with which is wholly indispensable to the student <lb/>
            of Plato.</p>
          <p>The Platonic philosophy, be it understood, begins and ends, <lb/>
            as do the lessons of Socrates, with an acknowledgment of human <lb/>
            ignorance,-the only true starting-place of sound scientific inves­ <lb/>
            tigation. Imitating his master's example, Plato did not so much <lb/>
            endeavour to teach, in the strict sense of the word, as to explore <lb/>
            men's minds, and ascertain how far they really comprehended the <lb/>
            doctrines and opinions which they professed. Taking for granted <lb/>
            that all current opinions are true, because they are current, was <lb/>
            the great fault of the Sophists, who taught entirely <foreign xml:lang="grc">προς δόξαν</foreign>, <lb/>
            relative to opinion ;—whereas, with Socrates and Plato, the pre­ <lb/>
            liminary investigation respecting their truth or falsehood was ALL <lb/>
            IN ALL,-any prior assumption of their truth being positively <lb/>
            inadmissible; because, without investigation, it was impossible <lb/>
            to know and be sure of the truth of opinions. The method of <lb/>
            Plato, accordingly, is the reverse of the didactic method em­ <lb/>
            ployed by the Sophists, who assumed principles as true, and on <lb/>
            these grounds proceeded to argue and persuade. The Socratic <lb/>
            method, on the other hand, consisted in putting questions with <lb/>
            the view of eliciting replies bearing on the point in debate,­ <lb/>
            in simply inquiring and pronouncing so far only as the answer <lb/>
            is approved or rejected,-in a word, educing the truth by simply <lb/>
            bringing the answerer to teach himself :—and hence it was, that <lb/>
            the popular opponents of this method decried it, as one pro­ <lb/>
            ducing doubt, and therefore of dangerous tendency. With Plato, <lb/>
            however, as with Socrates, the awakening of doubt was not <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            merely a vain display of logical skill and clever cavilling, but <lb/>
            had for its object the removal of the unstable ground on which <lb/>
            opinions may have been rested, and the formation of more settled <lb/>
            convictions :-indeed, it was exalted by him into a regular <lb/>
            discipline of the mind set in operation for the single purpose <lb/>
            of investigating the truth. The method and discipline by <lb/>
            which he accomplishes this object is, what he calls DIALECTIC, <lb/>
            which, as opposed to the plans of the Sophists, may be <lb/>
            termed the true art of Discussion; and, as contrasted with <lb/>
            the mere wisdom of opinion, (the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοξοσοφία</foreign> of the Sophists,) <lb/>
            it was philosophy-real science-the knowledge of the truth. <lb/>
            The ground of his whole proceeding was the Fallaciousness of <lb/>
            Opinion; and hence Plato had to seek some criterion of Truth, <lb/>
            apart from mere opinion. Denying the sufficiency of subjective <lb/>
            truth (i. e. the assumption that the mental perceptions are true <lb/>
            simply because they take place), he set himself to search after <lb/>
            objective truth-truth independent of the mind of man and not <lb/>
            affected by the variations of human judgment-as a foundation of <lb/>
            his system of knowledge. Involved with the notion of the Fallaci­ <lb/>
            ousness of Opinion, another is closely allied,—the Fallaciousness <lb/>
            of the Senses; and it is the joint application of these two funda­ <lb/>
            mental principles, which unites his method and his philosophy in <lb/>
            one master-science,-Dialectic. True knowledge, unlike that de­ <lb/>
            rived through the senses, is founded purely on the apprehensions <lb/>
            of the intellect, without any intervention whatever of the senses ; <lb/>
            -and so also Dialectic, as being philosophy, is occupied about <lb/>
            that which exists (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὄντως ὄν</foreign>), or has Being, in opposition to <lb/>
            the presentations made to the senses, which are conversant only <lb/>
            with those things that have the semblance of being (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ φαινομένα</foreign>) ; <lb/>
            -while, as a method, it investigates the reason or account of <lb/>
            the Being of everything,-of everything as it is, and not as it <lb/>
            APPEARS, not being satisfied with opinions, of which no account <lb/>
            can be given, but bringing all to the test of exact argument and <lb/>
            definition. Plato thought it his first business, therefore, to give <lb/>
            his method a firm basis by establishing at the outset a sound <lb/>
            Theory of Being, as a sure Criterion of Truth ;-and this is his <lb/>
            celebrated Theory of IDEAS.</p><pb n="xi"/>
            
          <p>Plato conceived, that Opinion, in contradistinction from Know­ <lb/>
            ledge, is grounded on sensation and becoming (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γιγνόμενον</foreign>). <lb/>
            To man, indeed, such sensation is absolutely necessary ; because <lb/>
            the soul resides in the body, which is itself a compound thing, <lb/>
            subject to continual decay and reproduction,-the connexion <lb/>
            between the two consisting in the reciprocal communication either <lb/>
            of action or passion by means of their respective faculties. Hence <lb/>
            sensation is clearly regarded as an effect produced by the union of <lb/>
            the soul with the body ; and Plato did not fail to observe that al­ <lb/>
            though sensation, strictly speaking, has cognisance only of corporeal <lb/>
            qualities, there are certain internal states of the soul which have <lb/>
            no immediate reference to the corporeal. The soul, in short, <lb/>
            receives sensations through the sensuous mechanism; but it has <lb/>
            moreover, (in addition to the power which it exercises through the <lb/>
            instrumentality of the bodily organs,) a distinct faculty of investi­ <lb/>
            gating by itself the abstract properties of all sensations; "appear­ <lb/>
            ing," as it is said in the Theætetus (p. 185. b.) "to have the power of <lb/>
            inspecting the common propertiesof all things." In accordance with <lb/>
            this view, Plato distinguishes what is apprehended by the senses <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αἰσθητόν</foreign>) from that of which we become cognisant by means <lb/>
            of reflection (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign>) through the understanding or rational con­ <lb/>
            templation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμός</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόησις</foreign>) ;-the former being in a continual <lb/>
            state of transition or becoming (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ γιγνόμενα</foreign>), whereas the latter <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ὄντα</foreign>) are constant and permanent, unproduced, imperishable, <lb/>
            and ever identical with themselves, belonging to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign> and capable <lb/>
            of becoming the objects of science or certain knowledge. Such <lb/>
            are the notions of genus and species, the laws and ends of nature, <lb/>
            as also the principles of cognition and moral action, and the <lb/>
            essences of individual, concrete, thinking souls;—respecting all <lb/>
            of which may be predicted an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, which closely corresponds <lb/>
            with what we now designate—<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign> general term. (Comp. Republ. <lb/>
            vii. p. 532. a., with Phileb. p. 15. a., and Tim. p. 51. c.) It is in <lb/>
            this sense, then, that he says of science in general (which seeks in <lb/>
            the ideas to seize the essence of things), that its object is to exhibit <lb/>
            everything as it is, by itself, absolutely, (TO avro <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ αύτὸ</foreign>, or TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτὸ ἕκαστον</foreign>, as in Republ. vi. p. 494, a.) and that the ideas <lb/>
            themselves invariably maintain their proper nature, character, <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            and identity. All things else, therefore, besides ideas, have only <lb/>
            so far a reality, as they participate therein ;-all being formed <lb/>
            out of ideas and numbers,*—sensible things merely resembling <lb/>
            ideas and being, as copies do originals,—just as Plato himself <lb/>
            observes in the tenth Book of the Republic,-speaking of a couch, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> TO of, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλά τι τοιου̃τον οἶον</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄν</foreign>. Inquiry, however, must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily lead men from one idea to others in connexion therewith ; <lb/>
            and on this account Plato regarded individual ideas as hypothetical <lb/>
            notions, for which a true foundation can only be given by an idea <lb/>
            not requiring explanation and confirmed also by some higher sup­ <lb/>
            position or idea. He wished, indeed, through the realisation of the <lb/>
            lower ideas to rise to a knowledge of the highest, which represents <lb/>
            the principle of all things,—in short, the idea of God,—God, the <lb/>
            measure of all things (not man, as Protagoras held),—God, the <lb/>
            beginning, the middle, and the end of all,-the Supreme Idea, con­ <lb/>
            taining in itself all others, and the unity which in itself comprises <lb/>
            the true essence of all things.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, as Ritter succinctly and well observes, " Plato <lb/>
            attempted to account for the existence of the sensible world, by <lb/>
            the ideas alone, without recourse to any other nature, alien and <lb/>
            foreign to them ; and in this attempt to make the transition from <lb/>
            the ideal to the sensible, there is much that is vague and indeter­ <lb/>
            minate. The source of this vagueness lies principally in the <lb/>
            insufficiency of the distinction which he makes between different <lb/>
            ideas, as indicating either a substantial and absolute entity, or a <lb/>
            mere relation or property. To this must be added the vague and <lb/>
            indeterminate sense of the Platonic idea of the essence which is <lb/>
            exhibited by the ideas severally. In this respect Aristotle does <lb/>
            not seem to be to blame, when he asks how ideas or lifeless num­ <lb/>
            bers can possibly have a desire, or longing, notwithstanding that <lb/>
            we are constrained to admit that, according to Plato, some ideas, <lb/>
            at least, that of the soul for instance,-must be supposed to be <lb/>
            endued with life. Again, the distinction which is made between <figure type="illustration">

              arose according to ideas and numbers.”—Tim. p. 53. b. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="xiii"/>
              ideas in their unity and totality, and ideas in their opposition to <lb/>
              each other, is extremely vague ; although it is the basis on which <lb/>
              the whole theory rests. If moreover, we admit that, according to <lb/>
              man's true and real nature, the world of ideas is his proper home, <lb/>
              and that he there contemplates the true essence of things, as is <lb/>
              implied in the doctrine of reminiscence, it becomes difficult to <lb/>
              account for his removal from so perfect a state of being, into the <lb/>
              present imperfect existence. Finally, Plato was forced to have <lb/>
              recourse to the notion, that there is an impelling necessity in <lb/>
              the secondary causes, the ground of which was the supposition, <lb/>
              that there must be a something opposite to good. In this there is <lb/>
              undoubtedly contained a very ancient cast of thought, still the very <lb/>
              indefinite nature of this necessity shows that, after all his attempts <lb/>
              to reconcile the supra-sensible with the sensible, Plato still found <lb/>
              in it something inexplicable. Thus much at least is certain, that on <lb/>
              the one hand, the tendency of his views was to refer all real entity <lb/>
              to the immutable ideas, and consequently to consider the sensible <lb/>
              more as an unsubstantial shadow than a reality; while, on the <lb/>
              other, he seems never to have forgotten that the only point of view <lb/>
              from which philosophical speculation is possible, lies on the sensi­ <lb/>
              ble, and so again the reality of the sensible appears to be a neces­ <lb/>
              sary supposition of his system. In these two tendencies, we may <lb/>
              recognise the well-balanced and measured character of his mind. <lb/>
              To discover their true connection however, was granted neither to <lb/>
              Plato nor his age; nor can we wonder, then, that he should have <lb/>
              had recourse to many vague and loose conceptions in order to ex­ <lb/>
              plain it, none of which, however, eventually satisfied his own mind.</p>
          <p>The dialectic of Plato, however great its defects may be <lb/>
            estimated, presents, nevertheless, a worthy image of the pure <lb/>
            philosophical feeling. This Plato assumed to be grounded in <lb/>
            love and in a longing after the eternal ideas, by the contemplation <lb/>
            of which the mortal soul sustains itself, and by perpetual renova­ <lb/>
            tion becomes participant in immortality. Stimulated by such a <lb/>
            desire, the philosophical mind or soul strives to attain, as far as <lb/>
            possible, to a perfect remembrance of ideas which are the eternal <lb/>
            essence of things, the memory of them being awakened by sensi­ <lb/>
            ble phenomena, which are resemblances of the ideas and real <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            entity, and thereby serve as means by which the cognition of real <lb/>
            being becomes attainable. But while the sensible, by bringing to <lb/>
            mind this resemblance to real entity, is subservient to the efforts <lb/>
            of the reasonable soul, it also impedes and limits it in its pursuits <lb/>
            of the true, since the sensuous representations contain as much of <lb/>
            irresemblance as of resemblance. But the greatest impediment to <lb/>
            philosophical investigation arises from the constant flux of sensation <lb/>
            which allows it no stability. Flowing on in a continual series of <lb/>
            production and decay, sensible things are constantly changing <lb/>
            their state and never exhibit the full perfection of the subsistent. <lb/>
            They comprise at once entity and non-entity, and it is not the true <lb/>
            standard and the all-sufficient which they represent, but only the <lb/>
            relative, which constantly varies by greater or less from the <lb/>
            measure of the true and substantive entity. It was to this that <lb/>
            Plato looked when he thought he had discovered in the ideas of the <lb/>
            other and the relatively great and little, the grounds of the sensi­ <lb/>
            ble matter of mutability. But contingent being is only for the <lb/>
            absolute, a mean merely by which the resemblance to ideas is <lb/>
            manifested in sensible things; and, viewed in this light, ideas must <lb/>
            appear as the ends of sensible existence, and as the standard by <lb/>
            which the true therein is to be measured. A multiplicity of ends <lb/>
            having been admitted, it followed that there must also be a last <lb/>
            end,-an ultimatum in the realm of ideas,-therefore a supreme <lb/>
            idea. This result follows from the consideration of the mutual <lb/>
            relation of ideas, for one idea must be explained by another, and <lb/>
            thus we proceed through a series of subordinate ideas up to higher <lb/>
            and higher, in order to reduce them by a legitimate synthesis into <lb/>
            unity, until at last we arrive at the highest idea, and then again, <lb/>
            by a converse method, to descend by analysis from the supreme <lb/>
            unity to the multiplicity of subordinate ideas. In this higher and <lb/>
            lower ordination, each subordinate idea requires merely as a <lb/>
            supposition until it is shown by the latter to be legitimate. But <lb/>
            from such hypotheses or suppositions the mind must at last arrive <lb/>
            at that which implies nothing else, and is in itself sufficient; of <lb/>
            this kind is the nature of good, which, exhausting all true <lb/>
            entity, is itself in want of nothing, but is desired by all. This <lb/>
            idea of good, or God, is consequently the key-stone of all <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            rational investigation. It embraces whatever subsists without <lb/>
            difference, in time or space,—all truth and science, all substances <lb/>
            and all reason, being neither reason nor essence, but being <lb/>
            superior to, unites both within itself. It is the source of motion <lb/>
            to all, for all has a desire towards it, and consequently it is the <lb/>
            mistress of all generation, in which nought is true beyond its <lb/>
            resemblance of the good. However, from some impelling neces­ <lb/>
            sity, evil, the opposite of good, is in generation mixed up with it <lb/>
            Man, therefore, as living in this scene of production and decay, <lb/>
            cannot attain to a complete knowledge of the unity of good; for <lb/>
            to him truth, and the science of truth, appear in opposition to <lb/>
            each other, and it is not permitted to mortal nature to contem­ <lb/>
            plate the eternal, in its absolute essence, but merely as shadowed <lb/>
            forth in the temporal. God, then, is the good itself, of which <lb/>
            this sensible world is only an image. But in the present world <lb/>
            it ought to be man's endeavour to enlarge and cultivate his science, <lb/>
            in order that, by attaining to as pure a knowledge as possible of <lb/>
            the multiplicity of ideas, he may be able to discern therein, how­ <lb/>
            ever imperfectly, the unity of truth and science which subsists in <lb/>
            the good.</p><pb n="xvi"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE notions entertained by Plato on Political Science will be <lb/>
            best understood by viewing them in connexion with his ethical <lb/>
            doctrines, from which, indeed, he considered them inseparable. <lb/>
            The two leading principles on which his moral system reposes, <lb/>
            are—first, that no one is willingly evil (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸς μὲν ὲκὼν οὺδεὶς</foreign>), <lb/>
            and, secondly, that every one is endued with the power of pro­ <lb/>
            ducing moral changes in his own moral character,—which, <lb/>
            indeed, are only the counterpart ethical changes in his moral <lb/>
            character;—and these are only the corresponding ethical ex­ <lb/>
            pressions of the theory of Immutable Being, on the one hand, <lb/>
            and, on the other, of the world of sensible things (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ γιγνόμενα</foreign>), <lb/>
            -everything that is born and perishes,-a principle which places <lb/>
            in the strongest possible contrast the mutability and false appear­ <lb/>
            ances of this world with the true and immutable of the Deity, <lb/>
            whom Plato conceived to be not only the measure of all things <lb/>
            and the pattern of his own perfections, having the supreme good <lb/>
            for the object of all his operations, but likewise as the only real <lb/>
            Idea of Good, in comparison with which the best strivings and <lb/>
            conceptions of man are but tendencies and approximations. So <lb/>
            truly is it said in the Phædo, that " all things desire to be of the <lb/>
            same quality as the summum bonum, but yet are ever inferior to it.' <lb/>
            Philosophy and morals, in fact, perfectly coincide in their object, <lb/>
            -the love of truth being the love of good, and the love of good <lb/>
            the love of truth;—and morality, viewed per se, is the one motive <lb/>
            of the love of truth and good predominating over, purifying, <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            and absorbing into itself every desire of human nature,-is, in <lb/>
            fact, the purifying of the soul, the perfecting of virtue, the <lb/>
            discipline of immortality, the resemblance and participation of <lb/>
            the Deity.*</p>
          <p>Of Plato's moral doctrines, the most important are the follow­ <lb/>
            ing :-that, independently of other ends, virtue is to be pursued <lb/>
            as the true good of the soul,t the proper perfection of man's <lb/>
            nature, the power by which the soul fitly accomplishes its exist­ <lb/>
            ence,! whereas vice is a disease of the mind (Republ. iv. 444. c.), <lb/>
            arising from delusion or imperfect apprehension of our proper <lb/>
            interests;—that the real freedom of a rational being consists in <lb/>
            an ability to regulate his conduct by reason, and that every one <lb/>
            not guided by his reason, encourages insubordination in the men­ <lb/>
            tal faculties, and becomes the slave of caprice or passion; (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλη̃ς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              d.)—that virtuous conduct, apart from its benefits to society, is <lb/>
              advantageous to the individual practising it, inasmuch as it ensures <lb/>
              that regularity of the imagination,-that tranquillity and internal <lb/>
              harmony, which constitutes the mind's proper happiness.|| He, <lb/>
              throughout, and with great power, contends for the earnestness <lb/>
              of a virtuous mind in the attainment of truth, and inculcates <lb/>
              the propriety of pursuing the ordinary pleasures of life, § only <note type="footnote"> * “ As the rational soul can only involuntarily be subject to ignorance, it is only <lb/>
              against its will that it can be evil. Every volition, by its essential nature, pursues <lb/>
              the good ; no one is willing to be subject to evil or to become bad, inasmuch as <lb/>
              the end of volition is not the immediate act, but the object for the sake of which <lb/>
              the act is undertaken; and no man enters on any act or undertaking, except for <lb/>
              the sake of ultimate good. Now a man, when engaging in any act apparently <lb/>
              good, may err, and choose the evil instead of the good; but in that case he labours <lb/>
              under an involuntary error, and does not what he really desires, but what, in <lb/>
              spite of his wishes, seems to him either as an immediate good or a mean to <lb/>
              ultimate good.”—Ritter’s History of Philos.

              pleasure belongs to the good things of life, but only seeks to determine its relative <lb/>
              value. Pleasures, too, are of two kinds,—some simple and pure, dependant on the <lb/>
              bodily or intellectual organisation,-others mixed or impure, as being always com­ <lb/>
              bined with more or less of pain. The latter are only relatively pleasures, inasmuch <lb/>
              as they are incapable of affording pleasure except by the gratification of some </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="xviii"/>
              so far as they are subservient to, or compatible with, man's <lb/>
              higher and nobler duties. In the fourth Book of the Laws, there <lb/>
              is a pretty complete summary of the salient features in Plato's <lb/>
              theory of morals,-a condensed view of which will be found in the <lb/>
              article " Plato" of tILe Encyclopaedia Metropolitana:—the remarks <lb/>
              with which it closes-on the coincidence of the precepts of mo­ <lb/>
              rality with the conclusions of prudence and enlightened self­ <lb/>
              love,-are both happily conceived and well expressed.</p>
          <p>Plato conceived that there were two great causes of human cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, viz., bad or ill-directed education, and the corrupt <lb/>
            influence of the body on the soul. His ethical discussions, there­ <lb/>
            fore, have for their object, the limiting of the desires, and the <lb/>
            cure of the diseases produced by them in the soul; while his <lb/>
            political discussions have for their immediate object, the laying <lb/>
            down of right principles of education, and enforcing them by the <lb/>
            constitution of the laws and the power of the State. His two <lb/>
            great works, in fact,-the Republic and the Laws,-may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as theories and plans of civic education, rather than <lb/>
            schemes of legislation and details of laws. The former, it is true, <lb/>
            inquires more particularly into the principles on which a right <lb/>
            government may be formed, and the latter presents a systematic <lb/>
            view of the principles of legislation :-but, comprising, as both <lb/>
            works do, so much matter of a purely intellectual and ethical <lb/>
            character, we are compelled to conclude that their primary object <lb/>
            is, the improvement of human nature by social institutions ex­ <lb/>
            pressly formed for that purpose. We are not to suppose, moreover, <lb/>
            that Plato, in his Republic, had in view the actual foundation of a <lb/>
            State, but that he presents rather an example of the most perfect <lb/>
            life—public as well as private-free from those impediments <lb/>
            which all existing governments and laws throw across the path <lb/>
            of the virtuous. Thus, in the Laws (lib. vii.), he says—“ Our <lb/>
            whole government consists in the imitation of a most excel­ <lb/>
            lent and virtuous life;" and again, " these excellent things <lb/>
            are rather as wishes stated in a fable than actual facts, though it <note type="footnote"> want; whereas true enjoyment consists in those pure delights which do not arise <lb/>
            after pain, but which the soul experiences, when filled with the contemplation of <lb/>
            true being. (Republ. ix. p. 585. d.)—Ritter's History of Philos ii. p. 390. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            would be best of all if they could exist in all States." He thought, <lb/>
            in fact, that as Philosophy is the guide of private life, elevating it <lb/>
            to the knowledge of the true and the good, so it was seated, like­ <lb/>
            wise, on the throne of government, and exhibited the eternal ideas <lb/>
            of social good and truth,-modifying society after their pattern ; <lb/>
            -and hence is it, that (as Aristotle observes in the second Book ot <lb/>
            his Politics, ch. 2,) Plato overlooks impossibilities in his arrange­ <lb/>
            ments, and sacrifices all to the one great object of sketching the <lb/>
            idea of good as a social principle, apart from the evil influences <lb/>
            of society.</p>
          <p>We shall now proceed to describe at some length the subject- <lb/>
            matter of the Republic ; and we shall just remark, that if the <lb/>
            work itself had been more studied, there would have been far <lb/>
            less difference of opinion respecting the nature and object of this <lb/>
            Dialogue. In fact, no exposition or theory can explain Plato, <lb/>
            who is, above all others, a writer to be studied in his own works ; <lb/>
            and his character as a writer and philosopher would have been <lb/>
            far higher in general estimation at the present day, if there had <lb/>
            been fewer to pronounce sentence on him without having read a <lb/>
            single syllable of his writings.</p>
          <p>The Republic of Plato is a development of the analogy between <lb/>
            the ideas of the perfect man and the perfect State,—the two <lb/>
            principles being elaborated throughout the Dialogue, in perfect <lb/>
            harmony and mutual dependance on each other. He exhibits, <lb/>
            indeed, the image of perfect and consummate virtue, such as <lb/>
            ought to be seen in the whole life of man, whether in his private <lb/>
            capacity simply, as a sentient and moral agent, or in his public <lb/>
            position as the member of a State. As man, moreover, has <lb/>
            certain special social relations and social functions, he considers <lb/>
            him also collectively, as part of a State, and is hence led to in­ <lb/>
            quire into the best or pattern form of a State,-a proceeding quite <lb/>
            in unison with the custom of the Greeks, who treated Politics <lb/>
            rather as a branch of Ethics than a separate science. This Dia­ <lb/>
            logue, therefore,-one of that splendid group of which the <lb/>
            Timæus, the Critias, and the Laws are the other members,­ <lb/>
            comprises two subjects constantly connected and cohering,-the <lb/>
            contemplation of the perfectly good man, composed of body and <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            soul on the one hand, and on the other the perfectly good State, <lb/>
            composed of many members in different classes, performing their <lb/>
            respective functions. Justice, then,-the principle, cause, and <lb/>
            uniting bond of all the other virtues,-one, too, that is essentially <lb/>
            of a political character-forms a very suitable discussion by way <lb/>
            of introduction to this Dialogue. The refutation of incorrect or <lb/>
            inadequate definitions of this virtue, occupies a large portion of <lb/>
            the first Book ;-and Socrates (the hero of this, as of most other <lb/>
            of the Platonic Dialogues), then proceeds, with the view of educing <lb/>

            fect State, as one in which all ranks of its members accurately <lb/>
            fulfil their respective functions, dwelling together in harmony.</p>
          <p>Commencing with the consideration of Virtue, (which consists <lb/>
            in the harmonious cultivation of the different intellectual and <lb/>
            moral faculties,) he opens the inquiry with a kind of analysis ot <lb/>
            the human mind, which he divides into three parts,—first, the <lb/>
            rational or reasoning principle, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ λογιστικὸν</foreign>),—secondly, the <lb/>
            spirit or will, (ro <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑυμικὸν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑυμοειδὲς</foreign>),—and thirdly, the appetite <lb/>
            or passion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπιθυμητικὸν</foreign>),*—which last, however, indicates <lb/>
            nothing beyond that vital impulse which leads from one sensation <lb/>
            to another. Of these faculties the most excellent is Reason, <lb/>
            whose proper province is to direct and controul the other facul­ <lb/>
            ties; and of the operations of this faculty Plato forms several <lb/>
            divisions (at the close of the sixth Book), according as the ideas <lb/>
            are abstract, mixed, or material,-the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόησις</foreign> constituting the <lb/>
            knowledge of pure ideas, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign> that of mixed ideas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign> <lb/>
            that of actually existing materials and their affections, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκασία</foreign> <lb/>
            the knowledge of the images or shadows of bodies,†—these divi­ <lb/>

            to have constructed his theory as a mean between the Heraclitean doctrine of a <lb/>

            legitimately under the controul of the Reason and the Will.* <lb/>
            Furthermore,-from the exercise and combination of these three <lb/>
            faculties there are generated four principal or cardinal virtues:- <lb/>
            1. Prudence or Wisdom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρονήσις</foreign>);—2. Courage or Fortitude <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρεία</foreign>), by which Plato means the maintenance of right opinion <lb/>
            as to what is and is not to be feared, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τω̃ν δεγνω̃ν</foreign>,) i. e. as to <lb/>
            good and evil;†—3. Temperance or Self-controul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>);‡— <lb/>
            and 4. Justice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>), which, with Plato, does not simply <lb/>
            mean the virtue of rendering to all their flue, but stands for that <lb/>
            harmonious and proportional development of the inner man, by <lb/>

              defines to be "a certain health and beauty and good habit of the <lb/>

          <p>The man, then, who studies to produce this harmony in the <lb/>
            mental faculties, is truly consistent with himself,-truly entitled to <lb/>
            the appellation—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μουσικὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικὸς</foreign>,—by which he means far <lb/>
            more than is conveyed by the modern terms, musician and poli­ <lb/>
            tician. So great, indeed, is the power and influence of virtue <lb/>
            that, without it, there can be neither true happiness nor mental <lb/>
            tranquillity,-all else of the nature of pleasure being mere shadow <lb/>
            and inanity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσκιαγραφημένη τίς</foreign>.)* Now, with respect to Pleasure, <lb/>
            each mental faculty has its own peculiar species,-the highest as <lb/>
            well as purest of all being exclusively enjoyed by the philosopher, <lb/>
            through the exercise of wisdom it and those who cultivate wisdom <lb/>
            and virtue are to be deemed happy, even in the midst of misfor­ <lb/>
            tune, and when it has no probability of proper reward. It is to be <lb/>
            cultivated, indeed, on its own intrinsic merits, without any regard <lb/>
            for expediency-any hope of reward. At the same time, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it is quite apparent that good men are praised, loved, and <lb/>
            honoured, while the unjust are eventually exposed and punished ; <lb/>
            —nay, even by the Deity, good and just men are not neglected, <lb/>
            for God loves and rewards those who practise virtue and seek to <lb/>
            resemble Him. Independently of this, too, Plato derives another <lb/>
            motive to virtue from the immortality of the soul,—viz., that, if <lb/>
            we be not justly and adequately compensated in this life, we shall <lb/>
            meet with perfect and unswerving justice, when arraigned before <lb/>
            the judgment-seat of God.</p>
          <p>Having thus far explained Plato's notions respecting Man's <lb/>
            character individually, and respecting the dignity and excellence <lb/>
            of Virtue-and of Justice in particular—that union and consum­ <lb/>
            mation of all the other virtues,—we now proceed to shew, how he <lb/>
            applied these principles to the formation of his ideal and perfect <lb/>
            Commonwealth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>), which he thought to be analogous to, <note type="footnote"> * Republ. ix. 583. b. </note><note type="footnote"> t The relation which, according to Plato, subsists between knowledge and pure <lb/>
            pleasure, seems to be in general of the following nature.-In the gradual growth <lb/>
            of the human consciousness, pleasure is necessarily combined with cognition,—so <lb/>
            however, as that, at one time pleasure, at another cognition, is the dominant and <lb/>
            determining element. In the former case, the pleasure is impure and immoderate <lb/>
            while in the latter a pure pleasure arises, measured by the truth of Ideas. To avoid <lb/>
            the former and pursue the latter, ought, therefore, to be the object of a truly intel­ <lb/>

            and a sort of exhibition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παραδειγμα</foreign>) of, a good and virtuous man. <lb/>
            Some few incidental remarks occur on the formation of society <lb/>
            for mutual aid and support; and he then proceeds to classify <lb/>
            the members or parts of his ideal Republics..</p>
          <p>These he classes under three heads or divisions, corresponding <lb/>
            with the faculties of the soul,—viz., 1. the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευτικὸν</foreign>, (counsellors) <lb/>
            those who employ reason in the contemplation of what best suits <lb/>
            the State,-,-?. the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικουρικὸν</foreign>,—those who aid the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευταί</foreign> with a <lb/>
            ready will,—3. the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστικὸν</foreign>, who are bent on gain and selfish <lb/>
            gratification.* Reason alone is, according to Plato, entitled to <lb/>
            and capacitated for the supreme government (just as reason is <lb/>
            the monarch of the properly energising mind), to the total exclu­ <lb/>
            sion of the commonalty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματισταί</foreign>), who are totally unacquainted <lb/>
            with wisdom or philosophy. The military class or executive, <lb/>
            however, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπικουρικόν</foreign>), who are to be the active guardians <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>) of the State, he requires to be properly taught and dis­ <lb/>
            ciplined, so that, while obeying the counsellors, they may protect <lb/>
            the State from both internal and external danger. As these <lb/>
            guardians, therefore, are necessarily to be chosen from the better <lb/>
            class of the citizens, they should be of a philosophic turn, of an <lb/>
            active will, and of a stern determination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλόσοφοι καὶ θυμοειδε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              ).†</p>
          <p>As respects the training of the military class, that must be <lb/>
            effected by a thorough discipline,—first, in Gymnastics, which <lb/>
            includes every exercise and training of the body, whether patience <lb/>
            under hardships, or endurance of hunger and thirst.-cold or heat; <lb/>
            and likewise dancing, all being practised not only to invigorate <lb/>
            the body, but to strengthen the spirit and maintain -the entire <note type="footnote"> * In other words,—“ There should be one part to correspond with the reason, to <lb/>
            whom the sovereignty is to be entrusted,—a second, answering to spirit, is to <lb/>
            assist the sovereign,—and lastly, a third part is made parallel to the appetite, and <lb/>
            intended to supply the bodily wants of the community. These are the three social <lb/>
            classes—the ruler, the warrior, and the craftsman. Each contributes a peculiar vir­ <lb/>
            tue to the general body: by its ruling class it becomes sagacious, bold by its warriors, <lb/>
            and temperate by the obedience of the artizan to the orders of his ruler. From <lb/>
            the due combination of these virtues in the whole community, results civil justice." <lb/>
            This explanation, so happily expressed by Ritter, is fully authorised by the pass­ <lb/>
            ages, lib. ii. 427. c.; 433. d. </note><note type="footnote"> t Republ. ii. 376. c. </note> <lb/>

            man—the passions, in particular—in subjection to reason ;—and <lb/>
            secondly, in Music,* which Plato held to comprise all imaginative <lb/>
            art, the ordinary instruction in grammar, and also science itself, all <lb/>
            of which contribute to elevate and enlarge the mind, protecting <lb/>
            it, at the same time, from all that militates against virtue. More <lb/>
            particularly, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign> must be kept free from all ambition <lb/>
            and avarice, which are unquestionable obstacles to the proper <lb/>
            performance of their civic functions. From these <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύχακες</foreign> the <lb/>
            chief rulers and counsellors of the State (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευταί</foreign>) are to be <lb/>
            chosen; to be chosen, too, for their general fitness and estima­ <lb/>
            tion :-and those only should be placed in charge, who are <lb/>
            endowed with high talent, and have all along maintained a life of <lb/>
            virtue, superior to that of the other citizens. Furthermore, in the <lb/>
            same way as human life can only attain to its highest happiness, <lb/>
            under the guidance of reason conducting it to the highest good,­ <lb/>
            so also, a State can only attain to consummate virtue and pros­ <lb/>
            perity, when its rulers apply themselves to the investigation of <lb/>
            eternal truth and the contemplation of the highest good. Hence <lb/>
            it is, that Plato says (v. 473. c.), the rulers must be philosophers, <lb/>
            -not, indeed, necessarily occupied in subtle disputations on gen­ <lb/>
            eral subjects of investigation, but rather engaged in contemplating <lb/>
            the eternal ideas of things-truth itself; and they must not only <lb/>
            admire the beauty of virtue, but earnestly seek the individual cul­ <lb/>
            tivation of it, and teach it to others also t by the exhibition of its <lb/>
            development in their own persons.</p>

            influence on the moral habits;—and he almost wishes the expulsion of poets from <lb/>

            than mere illusion and childishness (x. 602. b. c.);—useful, perhaps, for education, <lb/>

            munities, is one and the same,* comprising, however, four parts: <lb/>
            —first, Wisdom, the essential qualification of rulers;—secondly, <lb/>
            Courage, the property of the military class who defend the State; <lb/>
            -thirdly, Temperance, the distinctive quality of a well-ordered <lb/>
            and obedient commonalty; and, fourthly, Justice, by virtue of <lb/>
            which each particular class or individual energises in his own <lb/>
            sphere, without encroaching on that of his neighbours. The pure <lb/>
            exercise of virtue, however, is exceedingly rare, either in States <lb/>
            or individuals; while, on the other hand, errors and defects are <lb/>
            constantly observable and ever likely to interfere with correct <lb/>
            action. Hence, applying this remark to Politics, our pattern <lb/>
            State (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριστοκράτια</foreign>) will insensibly become vitiated ; sinking first <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμαρχἰα</foreign>, and thence into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχἰα, δημοκρατία</foreign>, and lastly <lb/>
            downright <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυραννίς</foreign>, the worst possible mode of social union. <lb/>
            No wonder, for if we compare them with the state of the human <lb/>
            soul when reason is on her throne, and also when she is dethroned <lb/>
            by the passions, we discover between them a close analogy. From <lb/>
            the dominance of the will over reason we realise the idea of Am­ <lb/>
            bition; and this seems nearly allied to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμαρχἰα</foreign> of the Cretans <lb/>
            and Spartans (which Plato greatly preferred to the democracy of <lb/>
            Athens);—again, when rein is given to the appetite, still other <lb/>
            and greater evils arise, and among others, Avarice, which bears <lb/>
            a close analogy to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχἰα</foreign>;—thirdly, when the passions are <lb/>
            freely indulged, and in a base manner, without regard to order or <lb/>
            decency, we have before us <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημοκρατία</foreign> or mob-rule;—and lastly, <lb/>
            when any one passion or violent emotion exercises sway to the <note type="footnote"> * The question, whether virtue is one or many (often raised without receiving <lb/>
            any decisive solution), is connected with the more general one, whether the one <lb/>
            (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>) can be manifold or the manifold one. From the Dialectic, it must be clear, <lb/>
            that on this point Plato came to the conclusion that virtue must both be regarded <lb/>
            as one, and in another respect also as many. In a moral point of view, however, <lb/>
            this question of the unity of virtue must be taken in quite another sense ; for as <lb/>
            all good is considered as a due measure and proportion, no single virtue, by itself <lb/>
            and apart from the rest, can be truly virtuous. Hence Plato often describes some <lb/>
            single virtue as comprising in itself the sum of all virtues. Thus, Justice is often <lb/>
            used for virtue in general, because no action, which is not also just, can be <lb/>
            virtuous;—and similarly with wisdom, temperance, and valour. In the Protagoras. <lb/>
            too, Plato adds a fifth virtue—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁσιότης</foreign>, or piety, and in the Republic (iii. 402, b.) he <lb/>
            mentions liberality and magnanimity. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            exclusion of all the more generous feelings of our nature, we have <lb/>
            an exact picture of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυραννίς</foreign>, which is the worst species of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and furthest of all removed from political perfection.</p>
          <p>To return to our pattern State: it must have the principle of <lb/>
            permanence in healthy operation; and this is best effected by <lb/>
            harmony, or, as it were, unity of action in all the members, just <lb/>
            as individual virtue results from the harmonious exercise of the <lb/>
            collective mental faculties. The various establishments in a State, <lb/>
            therefore, must so cohere and harmonise, as mutually to aid each <lb/>
            other; and the most anxious pains must be taken to protect the <lb/>
            State from all influences likely to deteriorate good morals and <lb/>
            impair the authority of the government. To this end, then, care <lb/>
            must be observed, that no innovations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὴ νεωτερίζειν</foreign>, Republ. <lb/>
            iv. 424. c.) be introduced in the training of youth in Gymnastics <lb/>
            and Music;—for such innovations, says this ancient Conservative, <lb/>
            have an insidious and destructive tendency. The affairs of do­ <lb/>
            mestic life, also, must be so regulated, that no base desires shall <lb/>
            invade and disturb the State ; and to promote this object, as well <lb/>
            as to show that the defenders of the State should consider not so <lb/>
            much their own individual existence, or their own gratifications, <lb/>
            as their inseparable connection and membership with the whole <lb/>
            State, to the welfare of which the individual man is ever subordi­ <lb/>
            nate ;-on this principle must be explained those strange views of <lb/>
            the community of wives and children, that have always excited the <lb/>
            astonishment of those not fully acquainted with the moral ends of <lb/>
            the Republic. Individuals are, according to this philosopher, mem. <lb/>
            bers of, and to be merged in, the State ;-and hence he suggests <lb/>
            also, that even the women should undergo the same kind of training <lb/>
            with the young men, as they have their respective aptitudes. <lb/>
            Thus is a State to be maintained in permanent health, free from <lb/>
            the incursions of civil discord. With whatever ability, how­ <lb/>
            ever, a State may be formed, it cannot be permanently prosperous <lb/>
            without the constant and active exercise of virtue;-and just in <lb/>
            proportion as sin entails misery and virtue happiness, so, likewise, <lb/>
            Tyranny produces disorder and wretchedness; while Aristocracy, <lb/>
            i. &lt;?., Plato's best form of government, will not fail to exalt the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            State and its several members to the pinnacle of civil happiness <lb/>
            and prosperity.</p>
          <p>We have thus briefly sketched the general and ethical system <lb/>
            of Plato's Philosophy, as well as given a general survey of the <lb/>
            subject-matter of the Republic; and it is presumed that the stu­ <lb/>
            dent will now be enabled to take up the writings of Plato with <lb/>
            improved facilities, and a far greater probability of getting tho­ <lb/>
            roughly acquainted with the notions of that great philosopher.</p>

          <p>THE first Book opens with a pleasant and highly dramatic dialogue, in the <lb/>
            course of which the happy old Cephalus (a kind of Mæcenas on a small <lb/>
            scale) sings the praises of an independent old age, free from anxiety and <lb/>
            debt; and this leads Socrates to introduce the discussion of justice, <lb/>
            which, by way of provoking inquiry, he first generally defines, as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἀληθη̃ τε λέγειν καὶ</foreign>, a. av <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάοι</foreign> ric, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδιδόναι</foreign>. The more com­ <lb/>
            plete definition, however, he first attempts by the negative process, <lb/>
            purposely selecting two species of (false or inadequate) justice to be <lb/>
            refuted,-thus to make way for the basis of a full and true definition. <lb/>
            He then proceeds to consider the constituents of a state-magistrates <lb/>
            and subjects ; the former of whom he cautions against tyranny-the <lb/>
            latter against indecent insubordination; insomuch as neither the one <lb/>
            party should have reference to his own private advantage only, nor <lb/>
            should the others live without care for the general advantage of the <lb/>
            state, nor without a due regard for honest, upright principle.</p>
          <p>SOCRATES, <lb/>
            CEPHALUS, <lb/>
            GLAUCON,</p>
          <p>ADIMANTUS, <lb/>
            POLEMARCHUS, <lb/>
            THRASYMACHUS.</p>
          <p>[The whole is in the form of a narrative related by Socrates in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Timœus, Critias, Hermocrates, and another ofunknown name.* <lb/>
            —The scene is in the house of Cephalus at the Pirœus.]</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—I went down yesterday to the Piratis, with <lb/>
            Glaucon,t son of Ariston, to pay my devotion to the goddess, <lb/>
            -and wishing, at the same time, to observe in what manner <lb/>
            they would celebrate the festival, as they were now to do so for <lb/>
            the first time. ‡ The procession of the natives themselves, in­ <note type="footnote"> * See the opening of the Timæus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Glaucon and Adimantus were the brothers of Plato. Comp. Xen. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [ B. I. C. 1. </note> <lb/>
            deed, seemed beautiful; yet that which the Thracians conducted <lb/>
            appeared not less elegant. After we had paid our devotions, <lb/>
            and seen the solemnity, we were going back to the city, when <lb/>
            Polemarchus, son of Cephalus, observing us from a distance, <lb/>
            hurrying home, bid his boy run and tell us to wait for him; <lb/>
            and the boy, taking hold of my robe behind, said :-Pole­ <lb/>
            marchus desires you to wait. I turned then and asked, where <lb/>
            he was. He is coining after you, answered be : but pray wait <lb/>
            for him. Yes, we will wait, said Glaucon ; and just afterwards <lb/>
            came Polemarchus and Adimantus, the brother of Glaucon, <lb/>
            and Niceratus, SOIl of Nicias*, and some others, as from the <lb/>
            procession. Then said Polemarchus, Socrates, you seem to <lb/>
            me to be hurrying to the city, as on your return. Aye, you do <lb/>
            not make a bad guess, said I. See you, then, said he, how <lb/>
            many we are? Yes, of course. Well, then, said he, you <lb/>
            must either prove yourselves stronger than these, or else <lb/>
            remain here. One expedient, said I, is still left; namely, <lb/>
            to persuade you that you should let us go. How can you <lb/>
            possibly persuade such as will not hear ? By no means, said <lb/>
            Glaucon. Make up your mind then, that we will not hear. <lb/>
            But know you not, said Adimantus, that in the evening there <lb/>
            is to be a torch-race on horseback to the goddess ?† On <lb/>
            horseback, said I; surely, this is a novelty. Are they to have <lb/>
            torches, and to hand them to one another, contending together <lb/>
            on horseback;—or how do you mean? Just so, replied <lb/>
            Polemarchus. And besides, they will perform a nocturnal <lb/>
            solemnity well worth seeing ;-for we shall rise after supper <lb/>
            and see it [the night festival,]‡ and shall be there with many <note type="footnote"> * Nicias was one of the leading Athenian generals in the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            war. </note><note type="footnote"> t In the Panathenæan, Hephæstian, and Promethean festivals, it was <lb/>
            customary for young men to run with torches or lamps lighted from the <lb/>
            sacrificial altar; and in this contest that person only was victorious, <lb/>
            whose lamp remained unextinguished in the race. We are here forcibly <lb/>
            reminded of the figure used by Plato in the Laws, vi. p. 776 b, and also <lb/>
            of Lucretius, ii. verse 78 :— <lb/>

            Et quasi cursores vitaï lampada tradunt. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡By this nocturnal solemnity are meant the lesser Panathenæa, which, <lb/>

            and do the same. It is right, I think, said Glaucon, that we <lb/>
            should stay. Well,—f you please, said I, we will so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—We went home therefore to Polemarchus's <lb/>
            [house,] and there we found, both Lysias and Euthydemus, <lb/>
            brothers of Polemarchus,—likewise Thrasymachus the Chalce­ <lb/>
            donian, Charmantides the Pæoneian, and Clitiphon the son <lb/>
            of Aristonymus. Cephalus, the father of Polemarchus, was <lb/>
            likewise in the house; and he seemed to me to have be­ <lb/>
            come a good deal aged, for I had not seen him for a long <lb/>
            time. He was sitting crowned on a cushioned seat; for he <lb/>
            had been offering sacrifice in the inner court. So we sat <lb/>
            down by him ; for some seats stood there in a circle. Im­ <lb/>
            mediately, therefore, on seeing me, Cephalus saluted me, and <lb/>
            said: Socrates, you do not often come down to us to the <lb/>
            Piræus, though you ought; for, could I still easily go up <lb/>
            to the city, there would have been no need for you to come <lb/>
            hither, but we should have gone up to you. As it is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, you should come hither more frequently; for be assured <lb/>
            that with me, the more bodily pleasures decay, the more also do <lb/>
            the desires and pleasures of conversation increase. Do not then <lb/>
            fail us, but accompany these youths, and resort hither, as to <lb/>
            friends, and very dear friends too. As for me, Cephalus, said <lb/>
            I, I am delighted to converse with persons well advanced in <lb/>
            years; for it appears to me a duty to learn from them, as from <lb/>
            persons who have gone before us, on a road which we too must <lb/>
            necessarily travel, what kind of road it is,-whether rough <lb/>
            and difficult, or level and easy. Moreover, I would gladly learn <lb/>
            from you (as you are now at that time of life which the poets <lb/>
            call the threshold of old age), what your opinion of it is, <lb/>
            whether it be a burdensome part of life, or how you describe it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—By Zeus !* said he, I will tell you, Socrates, <lb/>
            what I, for my part, think of it; for several of us, who are <lb/>
            of the same age, frequently meet together in the same place, <note type="footnote"> næa another veil was exhibited, in which the Athenians, who were the <lb/>
            pupils of Athena, were represented victorious in the battle against the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the Atlantic island. </note><note type="footnote"> * The translator wishes it to be understood, that in compliance with a <lb/>
            now pretty general custom, he has preserved the Greek mythological names; <lb/>
            Zeus for Jupiter, Athena for Minerva, Poseidon for Neptune, Artemis <lb/>
            for Diana, and so on. </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. c. 4. </note> <lb/>
            observing the old proverb.* Most of us, therefore, when we <lb/>
            are together, complain of missing the pleasures of youth, <lb/>
            calling to remembrance the pleasures of love, those of drink­ <lb/>
            ing and feasting, and such like: and they are mightily in <lb/>
            dudgeon, as being bereaved of some great things,-having <lb/>
            once lived happily, but now scarce living at all. Some of <lb/>
            them, too, bemoan the contempt which old age meets with <lb/>
            from intimate friends: and, on this account, they whine <lb/>
            about old age, as being the cause of so many of their ills. <lb/>
            To me, however, Socrates, these men seem not to blame the <lb/>
            [real] cause; for, if this were the cause, I myself likewise <lb/>
            should have suffered these very same things through old age, <lb/>
            -and all others, likewise, who have come to these years. <lb/>
            Now I have met with several not thus affected; and parti­ <lb/>
            cularly I was once in company with Sophocles the poet, when <lb/>
            be was asked by some one : How, said he, do you feel, Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles, as to the pleasures of love; are you still able to enjoy <lb/>
            them? Softly, friend, replied he;—most gladly, indeed, <lb/>
            have I escaped from these pleasures, as from some furious <lb/>
            and savage master.t To me, then, he, at that time, seemed <lb/>
            to speak well, and now not less so: for, on the whole, as <lb/>
            respects such things there is in old age great peace and free­ <lb/>
            dom ; because, when the appetites cease to be vehement and <lb/>
            have let go their hold, what Sophocles said, most certainly <lb/>
            happens; we are delivered from very many, and those too, <lb/>
            furious masters. With relation to these things, however, and <lb/>
            what concerns our intimates, there is one and the same <lb/>
            cause ; which is, not old age, Socrates, but the disposition or <lb/>
            [different] men for, if they be discreet and moderate, even <lb/>
            old age is but moderately burdensome: but if not, Socrates, <lb/>
            —to such an one, both old age and youth are grievous.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Delighted to hear him say these things, and <lb/>
            wishing him to discourse further, I urged him, and said : <lb/>
            I fancy, Cephalus, the generality will not agree with you in <note type="footnote"> * This alludes to the well-known Greek adage—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλιξ ἥλικα τέρπει</foreign>. <lb/>
            Nearly the whole of this and the following chapter is quoted by Cicero, <lb/>
            de Senect. ch. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> t This passage was evidently in the view of Cicero, when he wrote as <lb/>
            follows :—Quum ex eo quidam jam affecto ætate quæreret, uteretume <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. I. C. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            these opinions ; but will imagine that you bear old age easily, <lb/>
            not owing to your natural bias, but from possessing much <lb/>
            wealth; for the rich, say they, have many consolations.* <lb/>
            True, replied he; they do not agree with me; and there is <lb/>
            something in what they say, yet not so much as they <lb/>
            imagine. The saying of Themistocles, however, is just; <lb/>
            who, when the Seriphiant reviled him, and said, that he was <lb/>
            honoured, not on his own account, but on account of his coun­ <lb/>
            try, replied, that neither would himself have been renowned, <lb/>
            had he been a Seriphian, nor would he, the [Seriphian,] had <lb/>
            he been an Athenian. To those likewise, who are not rich <lb/>
            and bear old age with impatience, the same saying fairly <lb/>
            applies; — that neither would the worthy man bear old <lb/>
            age with poverty quite easily, nor would he who is unworthy, <lb/>
            though enriched, ever be agreeable to himself. But, [tell <lb/>
            me,J Cephalus, said I; was the greater part of what you <lb/>
            possess, left you, or did you acquire it [yourself?] Some­ <lb/>
            what, Socrates, replied be, I have acquired: as to money- <lb/>
            getting I am in a medium between my grandfather and my <lb/>
            father : for my grandfather of the same name with myself, who <lb/>
            was left almost as much property as I possess at present, <lb/>
            increased it manifold; while my father Lysanias made it <lb/>
            yet less than it is now: I, on the other hand, am content, <lb/>
            if I can leave my sons here not less, but some little more than <lb/>
            I received. I asked you, said I, for this reason,-because <lb/>
            you seem to me to have no excessive love for riches; and <lb/>
            this is generally the case with those who have not acquired <lb/>
            them; while those who have acquired them [themselves,] are <lb/>
            doubly fond of them : ‡ for, as poets love their own poems, <lb/>
            and as parents love their own children,-in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner, too, those who have enriched themselves, value their <lb/>
            wealth, as their own production, as well as for its utility,­ <lb/>
            on which ground it is valued by others. True, replied he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.Aye, entirely so, said I. But further, tell me <lb/>
            this ;—whatdo you conceive to be the greatest good realized <lb/>
            through the possession of extensive property? That, pro­ <note type="footnote"> *This seems to allude to the very common Greek adage—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι̃ς πλου­ <lb/>

            bably, said he, of which I shall not persuade the generality, were <lb/>
            I even to mention it. For, be assured, Socrates, continued he, <lb/>
            that, after a man begins to think he is soon to die, he becomes <lb/>
            inspired with a fear and concern about things, that had not <lb/>
            entered his head before : for those stories concerning a future <lb/>
            state, which tell us, that the man who has been unjust here <lb/>
            must be punished hereafter, have a tendency, much as he <lb/>
            formerly ridiculed them, to trouble his soul at such a time <lb/>
            with apprehensions, that they may be true; and the man, <lb/>
            either through the infirmity of old age, or being now, as it <lb/>
            were, in closer proximity to them, views them more atten­ <lb/>
            tively, and consequently becomes full of suspicion and dread, <lb/>
            and reflects and considers whether he has in any thing done <lb/>
            any one a wrong. That man, then, who discovers in his <lb/>
            own life much of iniquity, and, like children, constantly <lb/>
            starting in his sleep, is full of terrors, and lives on with scarce <lb/>
            a hope of the future. But with the man who is not conscious <lb/>
            of any such iniquity, <lb/>
            Hope, the solace of old age, <lb/>
            Is ever present, <lb/>
            As Pindar says : for this, Socrates, he has beautifully ex­ <lb/>
            pressed, that whoever lives a life of justice and holiness, <lb/>
            With him to cheer his heart, the nurse of age, <lb/>
            Sweet hope abides, companion blest, that sways <lb/>
            With power supreme the changeful mind of man.* <lb/>
            In this he speaks well, and with great elegance. In con­ <lb/>
            formity with this thought, therefore, I deem the possession of <lb/>
            riches to be chiefly valuable, not to every man indeed, but to <lb/>
            the man of worth: for as respects liberating us from the <lb/>
            temptation of cheating or deceiving against our will,-or <lb/>
            again from departing thither in fear, because we owe either <lb/>
            sacrifices to God, or money to man,—for this, indeed, the <lb/>
            possession of money has great advantages. It has many <lb/>
            other also;—but for my part, Socrates, that seems not the <lb/>
            least, among all others, which proves its high advantage <lb/>
            to a man of understanding.</p>
          <p>You speak admirably, Cephalus, replied I:—but this very <lb/>
            thing, Justice,—shall we call it Truth, simply, and the re­ <note type="footnote"> * This passage will be found in Boeckh's Fragm. Find. 243, vol. ii. <lb/>

            storing what one has received from another,-or shall we say, <lb/>
            that it is possible to do the very same things at one time <lb/>
            justly and at another unjustly? My meaning is somewhat <lb/>
            as follows : Every one would probably be of opinion, that if <lb/>
            a man received arms from a friend in sound mind, and that <lb/>
            person should demand them back when mad, it would not <lb/>
            be proper to restore such articles, nor would the restorer be <lb/>
            just ;* nor again, [would he] who, to a man so situated, <lb/>
            should willingly tell the whole truth. Right, replied he. <lb/>
            This, then, is not the definition of justice, [namely,] to speak <lb/>
            the truth, and restore what one has received. Of course it is, <lb/>
            Socrates, replied Polemarchus taking up the subject, if at <lb/>
            least we are to believe Simonides. However that be, said <lb/>
            Cephalus, I leave this conversation to you; for I must now <lb/>
            go to attend to the sacred rites.t Well then, is not Polemar­ <lb/>
            chus, said I, the heir of your [argument ?] Certainly, re­ <lb/>
            plied he, smiling, and went off to the sacred rites.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Tell me, then, said I, you who are heir in the <lb/>
            conversation, what is it, that you affirm Simonides to have cor­ <lb/>
            rectly alleged about justice? That to restore to each his due, <lb/>
            is just, replied he: in saying this, he seems, to me at least, to <lb/>
            speak correctly. Aye, indeed, said I, we cannot easily discredit <lb/>
            Simonides; for he is a wise and divine man :-but as to his <lb/>
            meaning in this passage, you, Polemarchus, are probably <lb/>
            acquainted with it, but I am not; for it is plain he does <lb/>
            not mean what we were saying just now,-that, when one <lb/>
            has deposited any thing with us, we should return it to him, <lb/>
            even if he demand it in his insanity: and yet the thing depo­ <lb/>
            sited is in some sense due, is it not ? It is. At least, <lb/>
            then, [you will grant] it must on no account whatever be <lb/>
            restored, when a man asks for it in his insanity ? True, <lb/>
            replied he. Simonides then, it would seem, has some other <lb/>
            meaning than this, in saying that to deliver up what is due, <lb/>
            is just? Yes,—one quite different, replied he: for he is of <lb/>
            opinion, that friends ought to do their friends good-not ill. 1 <lb/>
            understand, said I ;—that man does not give back what is <lb/>
            due, who restores money deposited with him, if the repayment <lb/>
            and receipt be really hurtful, and the receiver and restorer be <note type="footnote"> * Comp. Cicero de Off. iii. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> † Cicero very elegantly refers to this passage in his Epistles to Atticus, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. C. 7. </note> <lb/>
            friends: —is not this what you allege Simonides to say? <lb/>
            Surely. What then ?-are we to give our enemies, also, what <lb/>
            may chance to be their due ? By all means, said he, what is <lb/>
            really due to them; and from an enemy to an enemy, there <lb/>
            is due, I imagine, what is fitting too,-namely some evil.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Simonides, then, it would seem, replied I, <lb/>
            defined the nature of justice somewhat enigmatically, and after <lb/>
            the manner of the poets; for it seems he had a notion, <lb/>
            that justice consists in giving every one what was expe­ <lb/>
            dient for him; and this he called his flue. But what is <lb/>
            your opinion ? said he. By Zeus, replied I, if any one then <lb/>
            should ask him thus,—Simonides, what is the art, which, dis­ <lb/>
            pensing to certain persons something fitting and due, is called <lb/>
            medicine, what, think you, would he answer us ? That art, <lb/>
            surely, replied he, which dispenses drugs to the body, and <lb/>
            also meats and drinks. And what is the art, which, dispensing <lb/>
            to certain things something fitting and due, is called cookery? <lb/>
            The art which gives seasonings to victuals. Granted. What <lb/>
            then, is that art, which may be called justice, as dispensing <lb/>
            to certain persons something fitting and due ? If we ought <lb/>
            to be at all directed, Socrates, by what has been said above, <lb/>
            [it is] the art which dispenses good offices to friends, and <lb/>
            injuries to enemies. To do good, then, to friends, and ill to <lb/>
            enemies, he calls justice? It seems so. Who then can best <lb/>
            serve his friends, when they are sick, and most ill to his <lb/>
            enemies, as either in sickness or health ? A physician. <lb/>
            And who to those at sea, as respects danger on the sea ? <lb/>
            A pilot. But what as to the just man ? In what business, <lb/>
            and with respect to what action, can he most serve his <lb/>
            friends and harm his foes ? In fighting in alliance with the <lb/>
            one, and against the other,-so far as I think. Just so; but <lb/>
            at any rate, to those who are not sick, Polemarchus, the <lb/>
            physician is useless ? Aye. And the pilot, to those who do <lb/>
            not sail ? He is. And is the just man, in like manner, use­ <lb/>
            less to those not engaged in war ? This, at any rate, is not <lb/>
            at all my opinion. Is justice, then, useful also in time of <lb/>
            peace? Yes, useful, too. And so is agriculture, is it not? <lb/>
            Yes. Towards the getting in of crops? Yes. And is not <lb/>
            shoemaking useful too? Yes. Towards the possession of <lb/>
            shoes, methinks you will say ? Certainly. But what then ? <lb/>
            For the use or possession of what is it, that would you say <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="margin"> it. i. c. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            justice were useful in time of peace? For contracts, Socrates! <lb/>
            By these contracts do you mean copartnerships, or what <lb/>
            else ? Copartnerships, certainly. Well then ; is the just man <lb/>
            or the dice-player, a good and useful copartner for play­ <lb/>
            ing at dice ? The dice-player. But, in the laying of tiles <lb/>
            or stones, is the just man a more useful and a better part­ <lb/>
            ner than the builder ? By no means. In what copartnership <lb/>
            then, is the just man a better copartner than the harper, as <lb/>
            the harper is better than the just man for touching the strings <lb/>
            of a harp ? In one about money, as I imagine. And yet <lb/>
            perhaps, with regard to the use of money, Polemarchus, <lb/>
            when it is necessary jointly to buy or sell a horse, then, I <lb/>
            should think, the jockey is the better copartner, is he <lb/>
            not ? He would appear so. And with respect to a ship, <lb/>
            the shipwright or pilot? It seems so. When is it, then, <lb/>
            with respect to the joint application of money, that the just <lb/>
            man is more useful than others ? When it is to be deposited <lb/>
            and be safe, Socrates! Do you not mean when there is no need <lb/>
            to use it, but to leave it in deposit ? Certainly. When money <lb/>
            then, is useless, justice is still useful with regard to it ? It <lb/>
            seems likely. When, therefore, one wants to put by a pru­ <lb/>
            ning-hook, justice is useful, both for a community and for a <lb/>
            particular person : but when one wants to use it, then the art <lb/>
            of vine-dressing [is useful.] It seems so. You will say, <lb/>
            likewise, that when a shield or a lyre is to be kept and not <lb/>
            used, then justice is useful ; but when they are to be used, <lb/>
            then the arts of warfare and music ? Of course. And with <lb/>
            reference to all other things, when they are to be used, justice <lb/>
            is useless; but when they are not to be used, it is useful ? It <lb/>
            seems so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Justice, then, my friend, can be no very <lb/>
            important matter, if it is useful only in respect of things not <lb/>
            to be used. But let us consider this matter :-is not he who <lb/>
            is the cleverest at striking in a fight, whether with the fists <lb/>
            or some other way, the cleverest likewise, in self-defence ? <lb/>
            Certainly. And as to the person who is clever in warding <lb/>
            off and escaping from a distemper, is he not very clever also <lb/>
            in bringing it on ? So I suppose. And he too the best <lb/>
            guardian of a camp, who can steal the counsels, and the other <lb/>
            operations of the enemy ? Certainly. Of whatever, then, <lb/>
            any one is a good guardian, of that likewise he is a clever <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. c. 8. </note> <lb/>
            thief. It seems so. If, therefore, the just man be clever in <lb/>
            guarding money, he is clever likewise in stealing. So it <lb/>
            would seem, said he, from this reasoning. The just man, <lb/>
            then, has been shewn to be a sort of thief; and it is likely <lb/>
            you have learned this from Homer; for he not only admires <lb/>
            Autofycus, the maternal grandfather of Ulysses, but says, <lb/>
            that he was distinguished beyond all men for thievishness and <lb/>
            swearing.* Justice, then, seems in your opinion as well as in <lb/>
            that of Homer and Simonides, to be a sort of thieving carried <lb/>
            on for the benefit of our friends on the one hand, and for the <lb/>
            injury of our enemies on the other :-did not you say so ? No, <lb/>
            by Zeus, I did not; nor, indeed, do I any longer know what I <lb/>
            was saying :-yet it is still my opinion, that justice benefits <lb/>
            friends, but injures foes. But [tell me,] whether you pro­ <lb/>
            nounce such to be friends, as seem to be honest; or such <lb/>
            merely as are so, though not seeming so ;-and in the same <lb/>
            way as to enemies? It is reasonable, said he, to love <lb/>
            those whom one deems honest, and to hate those [one deems] <lb/>
            wicked. But do not men fall into error on this point, so <lb/>
            that many appear to them honest who are not so, and <lb/>
            many the contrary ? Yes, they do. To such as these, then, <lb/>
            the good are enemies, and the bad friends? Certainly. <lb/>
            But still is it, in that case, just for them to benefit the <lb/>
            wicked, and hurt the good ? So it seems. The good, more­ <lb/>
            over, are just, and incapable of doing any ill. True. Ac­ <lb/>
            cording to your argument, then, is it just to do those harm, who <lb/>
            do no harm [themselves ?] By no means [think that,] Socrates, <lb/>
            replied he; for that opinion seems to be vicious. With <lb/>
            respect to the unjust, then, said I, is it right to injure <lb/>
            these, but to do good to the just ? This opinion seems fairer <lb/>
            than the other. To many, then, it will occur [to think,] Pole­ <lb/>
            marchus,—that is, to as many as have formed wrong opinions <lb/>
            of men,—that they may justly hurt their friends (for they are <lb/>
            wicked to them), and, on the other hand, benefit their <lb/>
            enemies, inasmuch as they are good :-and thus we shall state <lb/>
            the very reverse of what we alleged Simonides to say. That is <lb/>
            precisely the case, said he :-but, let us change our definition; <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig5.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> His mother's noble sire, who all mankind <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> n. i. C. 9.] </note> <lb/>
              for we seem not to have rightly defined a friend and a fop. <lb/>
              How were they defined, Polemarchus? That he who seems <lb/>
              honest, is a friend. How then are we now to alter our defini­ <lb/>
              tion, said I ? That the person, replied he, who seems, and <lb/>
              also is honest, is a friend; but that he who is apparently <lb/>
              honest, but not really so, seems to be, yet is not [really] a <lb/>
              friend: the definition, too, respecting an enemy, exactly <lb/>
              corresponds. The good man, according to this reasoning, <lb/>
              will, it seems, be a friend ; and the wicked man a foe ? Yes. <lb/>
              Do you bid us then make an addition to our former definition <lb/>
              of justice, by saying that it is just to serve a friend and <lb/>
              harm a foe:—and are we now to say, in addition to this, that <lb/>
              it is just to serve a friend who is good, but to hurt an enemy <lb/>
              who is bad ? This last, said he, seems to me perfectly <lb/>
              well expressed.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—Is it the just man's part, then, said I, to hurt <lb/>
            any one mortal whatever ? By all means, said be ; the wicked <lb/>
            at least, and his enemies, he ought certainly to injure. And <lb/>
            horses, when hurt, do they become better or worse ? Worse. <lb/>
            Do they so, as regards the virtue of dogs or horses ? That of <lb/>
            horses. And, do not dogs, when hurt, become worse as regards <lb/>
            the virtue of dogs, but not of horses ? Necessarily so. As to <lb/>
            men, then, friend, may we not likewise say, that when hurt, <lb/>
            they become worse with reference to man's virtue ? Certainly. <lb/>
            But is not justice a human virtue ? This too we must [allow.] <lb/>
            It follows, then, friend, that those men who are hurt become <lb/>
            more unjust? It seems so. Can musicians, then, by music, <lb/>
            make men unmusical ? Impossible.-Or horsemen, by horse­ <lb/>
            manship, make men unskilled in horsemanship? They cannot. <lb/>
            Is it possible, either, that by justice the just [can make men] <lb/>
            unjust; or in general that by virtue, the good can make men <lb/>
            wicked? It is impossible. [Yes,] for it is not, methinks, <lb/>
            the effect of heat to make cold, but [the effect] of its con­ <lb/>
            trary? Yes. Nor of drought to make moist, but that of its <lb/>
            contrary ? Certainly. Neither is it the part of a good man <lb/>
            to hurt, but that of his contrary ? It appears so. But, at <lb/>
            any rate, the just is good? Certainly. Neither, then, is it <lb/>
            the part of a just man, Polemarchus, to hurt either friend or <lb/>
            any other, but [that] of his contrary, the unjust man. In <lb/>
            all respects, Socrates, said he, you seem to reason truly. If, <lb/>
            then, any one affirms it just to give every one his due, and <lb/>
            consequently thinks this within himself, that injury is duo <pb n="12"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. C. 10. </note> <lb/>
            from a just man to enemies, but service to friends,—he was <lb/>
            not wise who said so, for he spoke not the truth forin no <lb/>
            case has the justice been proved of injuring any one at <lb/>
            I agree, said lie. You and I then will jointly dispute the <lb/>
            point, said I, if any one allege, that Simonides, or Bias, or <lb/>
            Pittacus, or any other of those wise and happy men said so. <lb/>
            I am ready, for my part, said he, to take part in this dis­ <lb/>
            cussion. But know you, said I, whose saying I conceive it <lb/>
            to be,—that it is just to serve friends, and hurt enemies ? <lb/>
            Whose, said be ? I conceive it to be Periander's, or Per­ <lb/>
            diccas's, or Xerxes's, or Ismenius's, the Theban, or of some <lb/>
            other rich man, who thought himself mightily important. <lb/>
            You say most truly, said he. Be it so, said I :—but as this <lb/>
            has not been shewn to be justice nor the just, what else may <lb/>
            one say it is ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Now Thrasymachus had frequently during our <lb/>
            discourse been on the point of breaking in upon the discussion <lb/>
            with some objection,* but was hindered by the sitters-by, who <lb/>
            wanted to hear out the conversation. When, however, we came <lb/>
            to a pause, and after my making these last remarks, he could <lb/>
            no longer keep quiet; but, taking his spring like a wild beast, <lb/>
            attacked us, as if he would tear us in pieces. Both myself <lb/>
            and Polemarchus were frightened and terror-struck. But <lb/>
            he, raising his voice in the midst, cried outWhat is this, <lb/>
            Socrates, which has so long possessed you; and why do you <lb/>
            thus play the fool together, conceding mutually to one an­ <lb/>
            other But if in particular you really want to know the <lb/>
            nature of justice, do not only ask questions, and value your­ <lb/>
            self in refuting the answers you may get, well knowing that <lb/>
            it is easier to ask than to answer; but answer yourself, and <lb/>
            state your own view of the nature of justice. And [take <lb/>
            care] that you do not tell me that it is what is fit, or what <lb/>
            is due, or what is profitable, or what is gainful, or what is <lb/>
            expedient; but, whatever you mean, express it plainly and <lb/>
            accurately; for I will not allow you to utter such trifles as <lb/>
            these. I was astounded on hearing this ; and when I looked <lb/>
            at him, I was frightened; and, methinks, had I not per­ <lb/>
            ceived him before he perceived me, I should have become <lb/>

            our discussion, I observed him first, so that I was now able <lb/>
            to answer him, and said, somewhat in a flutter:—Be not <lb/>
            hard on us, Thrasymachus; if I and he [PolemarchusJ <lb/>
            err in the working out of our arguments, be well assured we <lb/>
            err unwittingly: for, think not, that if we were searching for <lb/>
            gold, we would ever wittingly yield to one another in the <lb/>
            search, thus frustrating all chance of discovering it, and yet <lb/>
            searching for justice,-a matter far more valuable than gold, <lb/>
            foolishly make concessions to each other, and not labour with <lb/>
            the utmost ardour for its discovery:-think you so, friend? <lb/>
            Nay, methinks, we could not. That we should be sympathized <lb/>
            with by your clever * persons is far more to be expected then, <lb/>
            than that we should be treated with contempt.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—On hearing this he [Thrasymachus] gave a dis­ <lb/>
            dainful sort of laugh, and said:-By Heracles, this is Socrates's <lb/>
            wonted irony; and this I both knew, and foretold to these <lb/>
            here,-that you never incline to answer, but use your irony, <lb/>
            and do any thing rather than answer, if any one asks you <lb/>
            any thing. Aye; you are a wise man, Thrasymachus, said I; <lb/>
            for you knew well, that if you asked any one, how many <lb/>
            make twelve; and, if asking, you should tell him, you must not <lb/>
            tell me, man, that twelve are twice six,-or three times four,­ <lb/>
            or four times three; because I will not admit it, if you are such <lb/>
            a trifler; it was plain to you, methinks, that no man would <lb/>
            answer one so inquiring. But if he should say to you, What <lb/>
            mean you, Thrasymachus, may I not answer in any of these <lb/>
            ways you have told me,—not even though the real answer <lb/>
            happen to be one of them ; but am I rather to say something <lb/>
            else than the truth ? Or, how is it you mean ? What would <lb/>
            you say to him in reply to these things ? If they were alike, <lb/>
            I should give an answer; for the one, forsooth, is like the <lb/>
            other. That is no real objection, said It; but even if it be not <lb/>
            like, but only appears so to him who has been asked, do you <lb/>
            think he would the less readily express his opinion, whether <lb/>
            we should forbid him or not ? And, will you do so now ? <lb/>
            said he. Will you state, in reply, some of those things which <lb/>
            I forbade you to. say ? I should not wonder, if I did, said I, <note type="footnote"> by the fixed look of a wolf; but this, they thought, was not the case, if <lb/>

            if it appeared so to me on inquiry. What, then, said he, if <lb/>
            I should shew you another answer, besides all these about <lb/>
            justice, and better, too, than these,-what will you deserve to <lb/>
            suffer ? What else, said I, but what the ignorant ought to <lb/>
            suffer ?-and it is proper, perhaps, to learn from a wise man, <lb/>
            I consequently deserve to suffer this. You are merry now, <lb/>
            said he; but besides learning, you must pay money too.. <lb/>
            Aye, when I have it, said I. We have got some, said <lb/>
            Glaucon; but, as for the money, Thrasymachus, say on, for <lb/>
            all of us will club for Socrates. By all means, I think, said <lb/>
            he, in order that Socrates may go on in his usual manner,­ <lb/>
            not answer himself, but when another answers, take up the <lb/>
            discourse and confute. How, then, in the first place, my <lb/>
            good fellow, said I, can a man answer, when he neither knows, <lb/>
            nor pretends to know; and when, supposing him to have <lb/>
            any opinion at all about these matters, he is forbidden to say <lb/>
            what he thinks by no ordinary person ? But it is more <lb/>
            reasonable, then, that you speak, as you say you know, and <lb/>
            can tell us. Do not refuse, then, but oblige me by answering, <lb/>
            and do not begrudge instructing Glaucon here, and the rest <lb/>
            of the company.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—On my saying this, both Glaucon and the <lb/>
            rest of the company entreated him not to decline it:—and <lb/>
            Thrasymachus in particular, was evidently most anxious to <lb/>
            speak, in order to gain applause, reckoning he had a mighty <lb/>
            clever answer to make, and pretending to be earnest that I <lb/>
            should be the answerer; but at last he agreed. Now, this, <lb/>
            forsooth, said he, is the wisdom of Socrates, that he himself is <lb/>
            unwilling to teach, but goes about learning from others, and <lb/>
            gives no thanks for it. That I learn from others, Thrasy­ <lb/>
            machus, is quite true, said I; but in saying, that I do not <lb/>
            thank persons for it, you are wrong. I pay as much as I am <lb/>
            able, and I can only give them praise, for money I have none ; <lb/>
            but how readily I do this, when any one appears to me to <lb/>
            speak well, you shall perfectly know directly, whenever you <lb/>
            make your answer ; for metliinks you will speak well. Hear, <lb/>
            then, said he, for I say that the just is nothing else but what <lb/>
            is expedient for the strongest.* But why do not you com­ <note type="footnote"> * The Sophists were used to recommend that the laws of a state should <lb/>

            was quite right that they should consult their own advantage, there being </note> <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I. c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            mend ?—Ah! you do not like that. Let me learn first, said I, <lb/>
            what it is you are talking about; for as yet I know not. <lb/>
            That which is expedient for the strongest you say, is the <lb/>
            just. And what, at all, is it that you are talking of now, <lb/>
            Thrasymachus? for you certainly do not mean any thing <lb/>
            like this. If Polydamas, the wrestler,* be stronger than we, <lb/>
            and if beef be better for his body, this food is likewise both <lb/>
            just and beneficial to us, who are weaker than himself. <lb/>
            You are a saucy fellow, Socrates, and lay hold of my argu­ <lb/>
            ment just on that side where you may damage it most. By <lb/>
            no means, my good fellow, said I; but say more plainly what <lb/>
            is your meaning. Know you not, then, said he, that with <lb/>
            reference to States, some are tyrannical, others democratical, <lb/>
            and others aristocratical ? Of course. And is not the govern­ <lb/>
            in-- part of each State the more powerful ? Certainly : and <lb/>
            every government makes laws precisely to suit itself,a <lb/>
            democracy, democratic laws; a tyranny, tyrannic ; and the <lb/>
            rest in like manner :-and when they have made them, they <lb/>
            declare that to be just for the governed, which is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous for themselves, and any one who transgresses it, they <lb/>
            punish as one acting contrary both to law and justice. This, <lb/>
            then, most excellent Socrates, is what I say, that in all States <lb/>
            the same thing constitutes justice, viz., what is expedient for <lb/>
            the established government. This, then, is the fact with <lb/>
            him who reasons rightly, that in all cases whatever that same <lb/>
            is just which is expedient for the more powerful. Now, <lb/>
            said I, I understand what you mean. But as to its truth or <lb/>
            otherwise, I will try to find out. As for the expedient, then, <lb/>
            even you yourself, Thrasymachus, have affirmed it to be the <lb/>
            just; and yet, though you forbade me to give the answer, <lb/>
            still you are adding the expression of the more powerful. Quite <lb/>
            a trifling addition, perhaps, said he. It is not clear yet, whether <lb/>
            it is small or great; but it is clear that we must inquire whe­ <lb/>
            ther you speak the truth, since I, too, acknowledge that the <lb/>
            just is something that is expedient; but you say, in addi­ <lb/>
            tion, that it is that also which belongs to the most powerful. <note type="footnote"> no fixed standard for virtue and justice, but only that of expediency. <lb/>

            This I am not sure of; but that is what we have to inquire. <lb/>
            Inquire then, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—We will do so, said I:—and, tell me,— <lb/>
            do you not say, that it is just to obey governors ? Yes, I do. <lb/>
            Are the governors in the several states infallible, or are they <lb/>
            capable of erring ? Certainly, said he, they are liable to err. <lb/>
            When they set about making laws, then, do they not make <lb/>
            some of them right, and some of them wrong ? I think so. <lb/>
            To make them right, then, is to make them expedient for <lb/>
            themselves, and to make them not right, [is that] inexpe­ <lb/>
            dient ;-or how mean you ? Just so. And what they enact is <lb/>
            to be observed by the governed; and this is what is just ? Of <lb/>
            course. According to your reasoning, then, it is just, to <lb/>
            do what is expedient to the stronger, while the contrary is <lb/>
            what is not expedient :-what say you, replied be ? I am <lb/>
            of the same opinion as yourself. But let us Inquire better. <lb/>
            Is it not granted, that governors in bidding the governed do <lb/>
            certain things, may sometimes be in error as to what is best <lb/>
            for themselves; and that what the governors enjoin, is just <lb/>
            for the governed to do ? Have not these [truths] been granted? <lb/>
            I think so, said he. Consider also, therefore, said ], that you <lb/>
            have allowed it to be just to do what is inexpedient for <lb/>
            governors and the more powerful, whenever governors unwil­ <lb/>
            lingly enjoin what is ill for themselves ; and yet you say, that it <lb/>
            is just for the others to do what these enjoin. Must it not ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily happen, then, most sage Thrasymachus, that, in this <lb/>
            case, it may be just to do the contrary of what you say; for <lb/>
            that which is the disadvantage of the more powerful, is some­ <lb/>
            times enjoined on the inferiors ? Yes, by Zeus, said Pole­ <lb/>
            marchus, these things are quite clear, Socrates. Yes, if <lb/>
            you bear him witness, said Clitiphon in rejoinder. What <lb/>
            need, said I, of a witness ?-for Thrasymachus himself acknow­ <lb/>
            ledges that governors sometimes order what is ill for them­ <lb/>
            selves, and that it is just for the governed to do these things. <lb/>
            Aye,Polemarchus; for he laid it down, that it is just to do what <lb/>
            is bidden by the governors, and he has also defined that as <lb/>
            just, Clitiphon, which is expedient for the more powerful; <lb/>
            and, having laid down both these propositions, he has granted <lb/>
            that the more powerful sometimes bid the inferiors and <lb/>
            governed to do what is inexpedient for themselves ; and, from <lb/>
            these concessions, what is expedient for the more powerful can <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I. C. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            no more be just than what is not expedient. But he alleged, <lb/>
            said Clitiphon, that what was expedient for the strongest was <lb/>
            what the strongest judged expedient for himself; this, too, <lb/>
            was to be done by the inferior, and this he defined as the <lb/>
            just. Aye,—but that was not stated, said Polemarchus. There <lb/>
            is no difference, Polemarchus, said I; but, if Thrasymachus <lb/>
            says so now, so let us understand him.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIY.—Now tell me, Thrasymaehus ; was this what <lb/>
            you meant by justice,-namely, the advantage of the more <lb/>
            powerful, such as appeared so to the more powerful, whether <lb/>
            it really were so, or not :-shall we say that you mean this ? <lb/>
            Not at all, said he :-for, think you, I call him who errs, the <lb/>
            more powerful, at the time he errs ? For my part, said I, <lb/>
            I thought you meant this, when you acknowledged that go­ <lb/>
            vernors were not infallible, but that in some things even they <lb/>
            erred. You are a sycophant, said he, in reasoning, Socrates !* <lb/>
            For, for instance do you call him a physician, who errs <lb/>
            about the treatment of the sick, in respect of that very <lb/>
            thing in which he errs; or him a reasoner, who errs in <lb/>
            reasoning, at the very time he errs, and with reference to <lb/>
            that very error ? But, we say, in common language, I <lb/>
            fancy, that the physician erred, the reasoner erred, and the <lb/>
            grammarian likewise; but in fact I think, each of these, <lb/>
            so far as he is what we designate him, never errs; so that, <lb/>
            strictly speaking (especially as you are a strict reasoner), no <lb/>
            artist errs ;-for he who errs, errs through defect of science, <lb/>
            in what he is not an artist; and hence no artist, or wise <lb/>
            man, or governor, errs, in so far as he is a governor. Yet every <lb/>
            one would say the physician erred; and the governor erred.' <lb/>
            You must understand, then, that it was in this way I just now <lb/>
            answered you. But the most accurate answer is this :-that <lb/>
            the governor, in as far as he is governor, errs not; and as he <lb/>
            does not err, he enacts that which is best for himself, and this <lb/>
            must be observed by the governed. So that as I said at <lb/>
            the beginning, I call justice the doing that which is for the <lb/>
            advantage of the strongest [i. e. the best]. <note type="footnote"> * There was a prevalent corruption in the law-courts of Athens, which <lb/>

            seem to you to act the sycophant ? Aye, surely, said he. Do <lb/>
            you think that I insidiously mislead you in the argument, <lb/>
            to put the question to you as I did ? I know it well, said he, <lb/>

            lead me unawares, nor can you unawares get the better of <lb/>
            me in argument. I shall not attempt it, said I, my excellent <lb/>
            friend, but, that nothing of this kind may happen to us again,­ <lb/>
            define in which way you speak of a ruler, and superior, accord <lb/>
            ing only to common talk, or in the strict sense of the word, as <lb/>
            you just now said, he, whose advantage, in that he is the more <lb/>
            powerful, it is just for the inferior to observe. [I speak of him,] <lb/>
            who is a ruler in the strictest sense of the word. For this now <lb/>
            abuse and calumniate me, as you like. I do not deprecate <lb/>
            your doing so ; but you are quite unable. Do you think me <lb/>
            so mad, said I, as to attempt to shave a lion,* and traduce <lb/>
            Thrasymachus? You have just attempted it, said he, but <lb/>
            with no effect. Enough of such matters, said I; but tell me <lb/>
            he who is, strictly speaking, a physician, whom you just <lb/>
            now mentioned, is he a gainer of money, or a tender of the <lb/>
            sick ?-and mind-tell us of him who is really a physician. <lb/>
            A tender of the sick, said he. But what of the pilot ? is <lb/>
            lie who is really a pilot, a master of sailors, or a sailor ? A <lb/>
            master of sailors. It matters not, I fancy, that he sails in a <lb/>
            ship, and is not to be called a sailor; for he it is not called a <lb/>
            pilot from his sailing, but from his art, and his mastery of the <lb/>
            sailors. True, said he. Has not each of these, then, some­ <lb/>
            thing that is advantageous for him ? Certainly. Was as not <lb/>
            the art then acquired for this very purpose, said I, to seek <lb/>
            out and supply to each what is advantageous for him ? For <lb/>
            that purpose, said he. To each of the arts, then, is any other <lb/>
            advantage wanting, than to be as perfect as possible ?-How <lb/>
            mean you by this question ? If you were to ask me, said I, <lb/>
            whether it is sufficient for the body to be a body, or whether <lb/>
            it needs something else, I should say, that it certainly does <lb/>
            stand in need of something else. For this reason, indeed, has <lb/>
            the medicinal art been already invented, because the body is <lb/>
            infirm, and it is not sufficient for it to be such as it is :-in <lb/>

            right, or not, in thus speaking? Right, said he. But what <lb/>
            then ? Is this very art of medicine, or any other whatever, <lb/>
            imperfect, as being deficient in a certain virtue; just as <lb/>
            the eyes, when deficient as to sight, and the ears as to hear­ <lb/>
            ing ; and for these reasons need they a certain additional art <lb/>
            to seek out and furnish what is expedient for these very <lb/>
            organs ? Is there then in art itself some imperfection, and <lb/>
            does every art need another art, to consider what is expedient <lb/>
            for it, and does that which considers again need another, and <lb/>
            so on to infinity; or will each art consider what is expedient <lb/>
            for itself; or will each need neither itself, nor any other, to coil­ <lb/>
            sider what is expedient for it with reference to its own imper­ <lb/>
            fection ?-For there is no imperfection nor error in any art <lb/>
            whatever; nor is it the business of art to seek what is expe­ <lb/>
            dient for anything else, but that of which it is the art ;—but <lb/>
            as for itself, it is infallible and pure, because it is right, so long <lb/>
            as each, whatever it is, be an accurate whole :-and consider <lb/>
            now, in that same strict sense of the words, whether it be thus <lb/>
            or otherwise. It seems so, said he. The art of medicine, then, <lb/>
            said I, does not consider what is expedient for the art of <lb/>
            medicine, but for the body? Yes, said he. Nor the art of <lb/>
            managing horses, what is expedient for that art, but for <lb/>
            horses. Nor any other art for itself (for that is needless), <lb/>
            but only for that of which it is the art ? So it appears, he <lb/>
            said. However, Thrasymachus, the arts rule and govern <lb/>
            that of which they are arts ? lie assented to this, <lb/>
            though with great difficulty. No science whatever, then, <lb/>
            either considers or dictates what is expedient for the su­ <lb/>
            perior, but only what is so for the inferior,—that, namely, <lb/>
            which is governed by it? To this also he at length assented, <lb/>
            though he attempted to contend about it. But when he had <lb/>
            assented, What else is this, said I, but saying that no phy­ <lb/>
            sician, so far as he is a physician, either considers or <lb/>
            dictates what is expedient for the physician, but only <lb/>
            what is expedient for the sick ?-For the physician, strictly so <lb/>
            called, has been acknowledged to be one who has charge of the <lb/>
            body, and is not an amasser of wealth.—Has it not been <lb/>
            acknowledged ? lIe assented. And likewise that the pilot, so <lb/>
            called, is the master of the sailors, and not a sailor ? It has been <lb/>
            acknowledged. Such a pilot and master then, will not consider <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. c. 16. </note> <lb/>
            and dictate what is expedient for the pilot, but what is so to <lb/>
            the sailor and the governed ? He acquiesced, but unwillingly. <lb/>
            Nor yet, Thrasymachus, said I, does any other in any govern­ <lb/>
            ment whatever, so far as he is a governor, consider or dictate <lb/>
            what is expedient for himself, but only for the governed and <lb/>
            those to whom he acts as steward ; and, with an eye to this, <lb/>
            and to what is expedient and suitable for this, he both says <lb/>
            what he says, and does what he does.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X VI.—When we were at this part of the discussion, <lb/>
            and it was evident to all, that the definition of justice stood <lb/>
            now quite contrary [to that of Thrasymachus,] Thrasyma­ <lb/>
            elms, instead of replying, said : Tell me, Socrates, have you <lb/>
            a nurse? What now, said I ;-ought you not rather to an­ <lb/>
            swer, than put such questions? Because, forsooth, said he, <lb/>
            she neglects you when your nose is stuffed,* and does not wipe <lb/>
            it when it needs it, you, who as well as she, understand neither <lb/>
            about sheep nor shepherd. What is the meaning of all this ? <lb/>
            said 1. Because you think that shepherds and herdsmen <lb/>
            consider the good of the sheep or oxen, to fatten and tend <lb/>
            them, having their eye on something else than their mas­ <lb/>
            ter's good and their own ; moreover, that those who rule <lb/>
            in cities, those, who rule truly, are somehow differently <lb/>
            disposed towards the governed, than [a shepherd] would <lb/>
            be towards sheep, and that they attend day and night to <lb/>
            somewhat else than the question, how they shall be gainers <lb/>
            themselves; and so far are you from the notion of the just <lb/>
            and justice, and the unjust and injustice, that you seem igno­ <lb/>
            rant that both justice and the just are, in reality, a foreign <lb/>
            good, expedient for the stronger and ruling party, but posi­ <lb/>
            tively injurious to the subject and servant,-while injustice, on <lb/>
            the contrary, takes the rule of such as are truly simple and just, <lb/>
            and the governed do what is expedient for him, since he <lb/>
            possesses the most power, and promote his happiness, by <lb/>
            serving him, but themselves not at all.-In this case, most <lb/>
            simple Socrates, we should consider, that a just man gets <lb/>
            less on all occasions than an unjust.-First, in mutual contracts <lb/>
            with one another, where a, certain party joins with another, <lb/>
            you will never find on the dissolution of the partnership, that <lb/>
            the just man gets more than the unjust, but less :-then, <lb/>
            again, in civil affairs, when public imposts are to be paid, <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορυζω̃ντα</foreign>, having a cold or rheum in the nose. </note> <pb n="21"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I. C. 17.] </note> <lb/>
            the just man, from equal means, pays more, the other less; <lb/>
            and when anything is to be gained, the one gains nothing, <lb/>
            the other much; and when each of these holds any public <lb/>
            office, if no other loss befals the just man, at any rate his <lb/>
            domestic affairs become deteriorated through neglect, and <lb/>
            from the public he derives no benefit, because he is just;­ <lb/>
            besides which, he becomes hated by his domestics and ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance, since he will never serve them, beyond what is <lb/>
            just.-But with the unjust man, all the contrary of this oc­ <lb/>
            curs; for I maintain, what I lately said, that such an one has <lb/>
            a great power of becoming unfairly rich.-Consider the case of <lb/>
            this man, therefore, if you would discern how much more it <lb/>
            conduces to his private interest to be unjust, rather than just. <lb/>
            This you will most easily of all understand if you come to the <lb/>
            most finished injustice, such as renders the unjust man most <lb/>
            happy, but the injured and those who are unwilling to do in­ <lb/>
            justice, most wretched.-This, now, is tyranny, which takes <lb/>
            away the goods of others, as well by secret fraud as open vio­ <lb/>
            lence, both things sacred and holy, private and public, and <lb/>
            these in no small portions, but all at once.—In all particular <lb/>
            cases of such crimes, when a man undisguisedly commits in­ <lb/>
            justice, he is both punished and treated with the greatest igno­ <lb/>
            miny : and as a proof of this, they are called sacrilegious, <lb/>
            kidnappers, housebreakers, pilferers, and thieves, according to <lb/>
            the several kinds of the wickedness committed. But when <lb/>
            a man, in addition to the property of the citizens, takes pri­ <lb/>
            soners and enslaves the citizens themselves, instead of these <lb/>
            ugly names, he is called happy and blest, not only by the citi­ <lb/>
            zens, but likewise by all the rest, whoever may get informed <lb/>
            that he has committed [such] enormous injustice;—for those <lb/>
            who revile wickedness, revile it — not because they are <lb/>
            afraid of doing, but because they are afraid of suffering what is <lb/>
            unjust.-Thus, Socrates, is it, that injustice, when it attains <lb/>
            a certain point, is both more powerful, more free, and more <lb/>
            absolutely despotic than justice: and (as I said at the begin­ <lb/>
            ning) the advantage of the stronger happens to be just, <lb/>
            while that is unjust which profits and benefits one's self.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.— Saying this, Thrasymachus purposed <lb/>
            going off, after pouring on our ears, as a bath-keeper, this <lb/>
            impetuous and lengthened discourse.* Those present, how­ <note type="footnote"> * Lucian must have had this passage in view, when writing Encom. </note> <pb n="22"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. C. 17. </note> <lb/>
            ever, would not suffer him, but forced him to stay and give <lb/>
            account of what he had advanced; and I myself, also, <lb/>
            strongly urged him, and said: Oh ! wonderful Thrasymachus ; <lb/>
            do you purpose, after throwing on us such strange talk, to go <lb/>
            away without rightly instructing us, or informing yourself <lb/>
            whether the case be as you say, or otherwise ? Do you think <lb/>
            that you are trying to determine some small matter, and not <lb/>
            the guide of life, by which each of us being conducted may <lb/>
            pass his life most profitably ? Can I think that the case is <lb/>
            otherwise? said Thrasymachus. You seem, at any rate, said I, <lb/>
            to care nothing at all about us, nor to be any way concerned <lb/>
            whether we shall live well or ill, through our ignorance of <lb/>
            what you say you know;- but, my good friend, be so <lb/>
            obliging as to show it to us also; nor will the favour be ill­ <lb/>
            placed,* whatever you may bestow on so many of us as <lb/>
            are here present. And I, for my part, can say that I am <lb/>
            not persuaded, nor do I think, that injustice is more gainful <lb/>
            than justice,-not even should we allow it play, and not pre­ <lb/>
            vent it doing what it likes. But, my good friend, even sup­ <lb/>
            posing him to be unjust and able to do unjustly, either se­ <lb/>
            cretly or by open force, yet I at least am not persuaded that <lb/>
            injustice is more gainful than justice; and on this point pro­ <lb/>
            bably some of us here are of the same mind, and not I alone. <lb/>
            Persuade us, therefore, sufficiently, my admirable friend, that <lb/>
            we are wrong in deeming justice of more value than in­ <lb/>
            justice. But how, said he, am I to persuade you ? for if you <lb/>
            are not persuaded by what I have said already, what fur­ <lb/>
            ther can I do for you? Shall I take and implant my <lb/>
            arguments in your very soul? By Zeus, no, said I;—but, <lb/>
            first of all, whatever you have said, abide by it: or, if you <lb/>
            do change, change openly, and do not deceive us. Now, you <lb/>
            see, Thrasymachus—(for we will reconsider what has been <lb/>
            above said),—that in first defining the true physician, you did <lb/>
            not think it needful afterwards, that the true shepherd should <lb/>
            strictly keep his flock, but fancy, that so far as he is a shep­ <lb/>
            herd, he may feed his flock without regarding the best interests <figure type="illustration">

              of the sheep, but rather as some glutton going to feast on <lb/>
              them at some entertainment, or to dispose of them as a mer­ <lb/>
              chant, and not [ care for them] as a shepherd. The shepherd <lb/>
              art, however, has certainly no other care but that for which it <lb/>
              is appointed, namely, to afford it what is best, since its own <lb/>
              affairs are already so sufficiently provided for, as to be in the <lb/>
              very best state without needing any of the shepherd art. So <lb/>
              likewise, I, for my part, conceived that there you must necessa­ <lb/>
              rily agree with us in this, that every government, in as far as <lb/>
              it is government, considers what is best for nothing else but for <lb/>
              that which is governed and tended, whether in political or <lb/>
              private government. But with respect to rulers in cities, think <lb/>
              you that such as are really rulers govern willingly ? No, by <lb/>
              Zeus, said he, [1 do not think so;] but I am quite certain.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XYIII.—Why now, Thrasymachus, said I, do you <lb/>
            not perceive, as regards all other governments, that no one <lb/>
            undertakes them willingly, but men ask for recompense, since <lb/>
            the benefits likely to accrue from governing are not to come <lb/>
            to themselves, but to the governed ? Tell me this, then ;-do <lb/>
            we not always say that each several art is distinct in this, <lb/>
            in having a distinct function ? And my admirable friend, <lb/>
            do not answer contrary to your opinion, that we may <lb/>
            make some real progress. In this respect, at any rate, said <lb/>
            he, it is distinct. And does not each of them afford us some <lb/>
            certain peculiar advantage, and not a common one;—as, <lb/>
            for instance, the medicinal, health; the pilot art, safety in <lb/>
            sailing,-and the rest in like manner ? Certainly. And has <lb/>
            not the mercenary art mercenary reward ? for this is its <lb/>
            function. Do you call both the medicinal art and the pilot <lb/>
            art one and the same ? Or, if you mean to define them strictly, <lb/>
            as you proposed, though one in piloting recover his health, on <lb/>
            account of the expedience of his going to sea, you will not <lb/>
            at all the more on this account call it the medicinal art? <lb/>
            Not at all, said he. Nor [will you call] the mercenary art <lb/>
            the medicinal, I fancy, though in earning a reward one may <lb/>
            recover his health? No, indeed. What then? Will you <lb/>
            call the medicinal the mercenary art, if, in performing a cure, <lb/>
            one earn a reward ? No, said he. Have we not acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged, then, that each art has its peculiar advantage? Granted, <lb/>
            said he. Whatever, then, be that advantage, with which <lb/>
            all artists in common are advantaged, it must plainly be by <pb n="24"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. T. C. 19. </note> <lb/>
            using some same thing in common to all, that they are ad­ <lb/>
            vantaged by it. It seems so, said he. Still, we say that <lb/>
            the advantage accruing to artists from receiving a reward <lb/>
            comes to them from the adoption of a mercenary art. He ac­ <lb/>
            quiesced unwillingly. This, then, is not the advantage which <lb/>
            each receives from his own art, [namely,] the receiving a <lb/>
            reward ?-But if we strictly consider it, the art of medicine <lb/>
            produces health, that of money-getting a reward, masonry a <lb/>
            house, and the mercenary art accompanying it, a reward ; and <lb/>
            all the others in like manner.-every one performs its own <lb/>
            work, and confers advantage on that for which it was <lb/>
            designed ; but if it meet not with a reward, is the artist <lb/>
            benefited at all by his art ? It appears not, said he. But <lb/>
            confers he no service when he works gratuitously ? I think <lb/>
            he does. This, then, is now evident, Thrasymachus, that <lb/>
            no art or government provides what is advantageous for it­ <lb/>
            self; but, as we said long ago, it both provides and pre­ <lb/>
            scribes for the governed what is advantageous to him, having <lb/>
            in view the interest of the inferior and not that of the more <lb/>
            powerful. For these reasons, then, friend Thrasymachus, I <lb/>
            even just now said, that no one is willing to govern and <lb/>
            undertake the setting right of others' troubles without asking <lb/>
            a reward ; because, whoever intends to practise his art well, <lb/>
            never himself does nor enjoins [on others] what is best for <lb/>
            himself, if he enjoins according to his art, but rather what <lb/>
            is best for the governed; for which reason, therefore, as it <lb/>
            seems, a recompense must be given to those who are likely to <lb/>
            be willing governors,-either money, or honour,-or punish­ <lb/>
            ment, on the other hand, if a man will not govern.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—How say you this, Socrates ? said Glaucon :— <lb/>
            the two rewards, indeed, I understand; but the punishment, <lb/>
            that you mention, and how you can speak of it under the <lb/>
            head of reward, I know not. As for the reward, then, of <lb/>
            the best of men, said I, do you not understand why the <lb/>
            most worthy govern, when they are willing to govern : <lb/>
            or, do you not know, that to be ambitious and covetous, is <lb/>
            both deemed a reproach, and is so ? I do, said he. For <lb/>
            these reasons, then, said I, good men are not willing to <lb/>
            govern, either for money or for honour; inasmuch as they <lb/>
            neither wish to be called mercenary, for openly making <lb/>
            gain by governing,-nor thieves, for taking clandestinely <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I. C. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            from what belongs to their office :-nor again jare they <lb/>
            willing to govern] for honour, since they are not ambitious. <lb/>
            Hence if they are to be induced to govern willingly, there <lb/>
            must be laid on them both compulsion and punishment; and <lb/>
            hence it seems likely, that a willing undertaking of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, without waiting for compulsion, has been reckoned dis­ <lb/>
            honourable. The greatest part of the punishment, however, <lb/>
            in case he is not willing to govern himself, is the being <lb/>
            governed by one who is inferior. It is chiefly through <lb/>
            fear of this, methinks, that the good govern, when they do <lb/>
            govern : and in that case they enter on the government, <lb/>
            not as on anything good, or as about to derive any ad­ <lb/>
            vantage therefrom, but as on a necessary task, and finding <lb/>
            none better than, or even like, themselves, to intrust with <lb/>
            the government. It seems likely, indeed, that if there were <lb/>
            a state of good men, the contest would be, not to govern, as <lb/>
            now it is to govern; and, hence, it would be manifest, <lb/>
            that the really true governor does not naturally aim at his <lb/>
            own advantage, but at that of the governed; so that any <lb/>
            one who has sense would rather choose to be benefited by <lb/>
            another, than have trouble in benefiting another. This, there­ <lb/>
            fore, I, for my part, by no means grant to Thrasymachus; <lb/>
            that justice is what is expedient for the stronger :-but this, <lb/>
            indeed, we shall consider again hereafter.—What Thrasy­ <lb/>
            machus says now, however, seems to me of much more im­ <lb/>
            portance,—when he says, that the life of the unjust man is <lb/>
            better than that of the just. You, then, Glaucon, said I, <lb/>
            which opinion do you choose; and which of the two seems to <lb/>
            you most consistent with truth ? The life of the just, said <lb/>
            he, is in my opinion the more profitable. Have you heard, <lb/>
            said I, how many good things Thrasymachus just now enu­ <lb/>
            merated in the life of the unjust? I heard, said he; but <lb/>
            I am not persuaded. Do you wish, then, that we should <lb/>
            persuade him (if we can find any means of doing so), that <lb/>
            there is no truth in what he says? How should I not wish it? <lb/>
            said he. If then, by way of opposition, said I, we advance, as <lb/>
            argument against argument, how many good things are in­ <lb/>
            volved in being just,-and again, he on the other side, and <lb/>
            we again rejoin, it will be requisite to compute and estimate <lb/>
            what either of us says on either side ; and we shall want also <lb/>
            some judges to decide thereon. But if, as just now, we inves. <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. c. 20. </note> <lb/>
            tigate these matters, by agreeing with each other, we shall <lb/>
            ourselves be both judges and counsel? Certainly, said he. <lb/>
            Which of these plans, then, said I, do you choose ? The <lb/>
            latter, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—Come then, said I, Thrasymachus ;-answer <lb/>
            us from the beginning. Say you, that complete injustice is <lb/>
            more profitable than complete justice? Assuredly, I do say so, <lb/>
            replied he ;-and why, too, I have already told you. Come, <lb/>
            now, how can you affirm anything like the following con­ <lb/>
            cerning them ?-Do you call one of them virtue; and the <lb/>
            other vice ? How not ? Is not justice, then, a virtue,-and <lb/>
            injustice a vice ? Likely, indeed, that I should say so, face­ <lb/>
            tious man ; since I say that injustice is profitable, but justice <lb/>
            not so ! What then? Quite the contrary, said he. Do you <lb/>
            call justice a vice ? No; but a very generous folly. Do <lb/>
            you, then, call injustice a want of principle? No, said he, <lb/>
            but sagacity. Do the unjust, Thrasymachus, seem to you <lb/>
            both wise and good? Such, at least, said he, as are able <lb/>
            to do injustice in perfection, and can subject states and na­ <lb/>
            tions to themselves; but you think, perhaps, that I speak <lb/>
            of cut-purses. Even such employment as this, said he, is <lb/>
            profitably, if concealed; but yet is of no value in coin­ <lb/>
            parison with what I just mentioned. I am not ignorant, <lb/>
            said I, of what you mean to say: but at this I am sur­ <lb/>
            prised,-that you should reckon injustice as a part of virtue <lb/>
            and wisdom, and justice among their contraries. But, I <lb/>
            certainly do reckon it so. This, my good friend, said I, is <lb/>
            somewhat too hard, and it is no longer easy to know what <lb/>
            one can say : for if you had alleged that injustice is profit­ <lb/>
            able, and had still allowed it to be a vice, or base, as some <lb/>
            others do,—we should have had something to say, speaking <lb/>
            according to received opinions. But now it is evident that <lb/>
            you will say it is beautiful and strong, and will attribute to it <lb/>
            all other properties which we ascribe to the just man, be­ <lb/>
            cause, forsooth, you have ventured to class it with virtue <lb/>
            and wisdom. You augur very truly, said he. I must not <lb/>
            grudge, however, said I, to pursue our inquiry, so long as I <lb/>
            conceive you speak what you really think; for you ap­ <lb/>
            pear to me, Thrasymachus, without doubt, not to be jest­ <lb/>
            ing, but only to speak what you conceive to be the truth. <lb/>
            What difference is it to you, said he, whether I think <pb n="27"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I. c. 21.] </note> <lb/>
            so, or not ;—and why do you not refute my reasoning ? No <lb/>
            difference at all, said I :-but try further to reply to this <lb/>
            likewise : does one just man appear to you to wish to have <lb/>
            more than another just man? By no means, said he ; for other­ <lb/>
            wise he would not have been accommodating and silly, as we <lb/>
            just conceived him. What; not even in a just action ? No,­ <lb/>
            not even in one that is just, said he. But, would he deem it <lb/>
            right to overreach the unjust man, and reckon it just; or <lb/>
            would he not think it just ? He would both count it just, said <lb/>
            he, and deem it right; but yet he would not be able [to do <lb/>
            it]. That, said I, I do not ask,—but, whether the just man <lb/>
            would neither deem it right, nor feel a wish to overreach a just <lb/>
            man, but yet would do so to the unjust? Such is the case, <lb/>
            said he. What, then, would the unjust man [do?]—Would <lb/>
            he deem it right to overreach the just man, even in a just <lb/>
            action ? How not, said he, since he deems it right to over­ <lb/>
            reach all men ? With respect, then, to the unjust man and <lb/>
            unjust action, will not the unjust man desire to overreach <lb/>
            both ; and eagerly strive himself to receive most of all ? Such <lb/>
            is the fact.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—This, then, is what we mean, said I:—the <lb/>
            just man does not try to overreach one like himself, but one <lb/>
            that is unlike, while the unjust man does so both to one like, <lb/>
            and one unlike himself. You have expressed yourself admir­ <lb/>
            ably, said he. Well, then, said I, the unjust man is both <lb/>
            wise and good; but the just man is neither. Well, again, <lb/>
            said he. In that case, said I, is not the unjust man like the <lb/>
            wise and the good, and the just man unlike. Of course, said <lb/>
            he, a person of a certain character is likely to resemble one of <lb/>
            like character; and he who is otherwise, not. Well said :— <lb/>
            such an one then, of course, is either of those whom he <lb/>
            resembles ? Why doubt it ? said he. Granted, Thrasy­ <lb/>
            machus ;-now do you call one man musical, and another <lb/>
            unmusical ? I do. Which of the two do you call <lb/>
            wise, and which unwise ? The musical, surely, wise, and the <lb/>
            unmusical unwise. As being wise, then, is he not good; but <lb/>
            as unwise, bad? Yes. And what as to the physician, is it <lb/>
            not the same ? The same. Do you think, then, my excellent <lb/>
            friend, that any musician, when he is tuning a harp, wants to <lb/>
            overreach, or deems it right to have more skill than a man <lb/>
            who is a musician, in straining and slackening the strings ? <pb n="28"/>
            <note type="margin"> [n. I. c. 22. </note> <lb/>
            Not I. But what with respect to one unmusical? He <lb/>
            could not help it, said he. And what as to the physician ? <lb/>
            In prescribing meats or drinks, would he try to overreach <lb/>
            either another physician, or the art he professes ? No, indeed. <lb/>
            But one who is no physician [would ?] Yes. Just con­ <lb/>
            sider then, as respects all science and ignorance, whether any <lb/>
            skilful man, be he who he may, appears to you to have a <lb/>
            desire to grasp at, or do, or say more than another skilful <lb/>
            man,—and not rather to do the same things, in the same busi­ <lb/>
            ness as one equally skilful with himself? Aye, it seems, it <lb/>
            must be so, said he. But what, as to him who is unskilled, <lb/>
            will not he like to overreach both alike the skilful and the <lb/>
            unskilled? Probably. But the skilful man [is] wise? I admit <lb/>
            it.—And the wise, good ?—I admit it. Both the good and the <lb/>
            wise, then, will not want to overreach his like, but rather one <lb/>
            unlike, and contrary to himself? It seems so, said he. But <lb/>
            the bad and the ignorant man [will want to overreach] <lb/>
            both his like and his contrary? It appears so. In that <lb/>
            case, Thrasymachus, said I;—the unjust man desires to <lb/>
            overreach both one unlike and one like himself :-did not <lb/>
            you say so? I did, said he. The just man, however, on <lb/>
            his side, will not overreach his like, but one unlike ? Yes. <lb/>
            The just man then, said I, resembles the wise and the <lb/>
            good, but the unjust, the evil and the Ignorant ? It seems <lb/>
            so. But we agreed, that each of them was such as what <lb/>
            he resembled? We did agree so. The just man, then, <lb/>
            has been clearly shown to be good and wise, but the unjust, <lb/>
            ignorant and evil.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.—Thrasymachus at last agreed to all these <lb/>
            things,-not easily, as I now narrate them, but dragged to it, <lb/>
            and with difficulty, and with a wondrous deal of sweating, <lb/>
            just as if it was summer. Then, indeed, did I behold—Inever <lb/>
            did before—Thrasymachus blushing. And after we had <lb/>
            agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice, <lb/>
            vice and ignorance,—well, said I, let this be so settled;— <lb/>
            but we said also, that injustice is powerful;—do not <lb/>
            you remember, Thrasymachus ? I do remember, said he ;­ <lb/>
            but, to me at least, what you now say is not pleasing, <lb/>
            and I have somewhat to say about it; but should I men­ <lb/>
            tion it, I well know you would say I am declaiming.* <note type="footnote"> * A sly hit at the Sophists, of which dogmatic set Thrasymachus is <lb/>
            throughout a very apt representative. </note> <pb n="29"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. i. c. 22.] </note> <lb/>
            Either, then, let me say what I please, or, if you wish to <lb/>
            question me, do so, and I will say to you, as to gossiping old <lb/>
            women,* " Be it so," and will assent and dissent. Not by <lb/>
            any means, said I, if against your own opinion. Just to <lb/>
            please you, said he, since you will not let me speak: <lb/>
            though what else do you wish ? Nothing, by Zeus, said I: <lb/>
            but if you will do this, do it, and I will ask questions. <lb/>
            Ask, then. This, then, I ask, as just now (that we may <lb/>
            regularly examine our argument), of what quality is jus­ <lb/>
            tice, compared with injustice? for I think it has been said <lb/>
            that injustice was more powerful and stronger than justice. <lb/>
            -But now, at any rate, said I, if justice be both virtue and <lb/>
            wisdom, it will easily, methinks, be seen to be more powerful <lb/>
            also than injustice, since injustice is ignorance; no one can <lb/>
            any longer be ignorant of this.-For my part, however, <lb/>
            Thrasymachus, I am not desirous of getting rid of the ques­ <lb/>
            tion at once, but to consider it somehow thus. — Would you <lb/>
            say that a state may be unjust, and attempt to enslave other <lb/>
            states unjustly, and have enslaved them, and besides that <lb/>
            actually hold many in slavery under herself? How not ? <lb/>
            said he: and this for the most part the best state will do, <lb/>
            and one that is most completely unjust. I am aware, said <lb/>
            I, that this was your assertion :-but this is what I wish to <lb/>
            inquire; whether the state, which becomes more powerful <lb/>
            than another state, is to hold this power without justice, or <lb/>
            must necessarily do so with justice? If indeed, as you now <lb/>
            alleged, said he, justice is wisdom-with justice ; but if, as I <lb/>
            said,-with injustice. I am quite delighted, Thrasymachus, <lb/>
            said I, that you not merely assent and dissent; but also <lb/>
            that you answer quite capitally. For I oblige you, he <lb/>
            said. Therein doing well: oblige me, then, in this too, and <lb/>
            tell me, — think you that a city, or camp, or robbers, or <lb/>
            thieves, or any other company of men, such as jointly under­ <lb/>
            take anything unjustly, can meet with any success, if they <lb/>
            injure one another? No, indeed, said he. But what, if they* <lb/>
            do no wrong ?-will they not [get on] better ? Certainly. <lb/>
            For, somehow or other, Thrasymachus, injustice induces sedi­ <lb/>
            tions, and hatreds, and contentions among men, — while justice <note type="footnote"> * The term ypawv <foreign xml:lang="grc">υθλος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυ̃θος</foreign> was quite proverbial among the <lb/>
            Greeks. Comp. Gorg. p. 527 a. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τάχα</foreign> c' ovv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̃τα μυ̃θος σοι δοκει̃ <lb/>

            [brings] harmony and friendship. Does it not ? Granted, <lb/>
            said lie, that I may not differ from you.</p>
          <p>CIIAP. XXIII.—You are very kind, my excellent friend, <lb/>
            then tell me this too;—if this be the work of injustice <lb/>
            to engender hatred wherever it exists, will it not, when exer­ <lb/>
            cised both among freemen and slaves, make them hate one <lb/>
            another, and become seditious, and incapable of doing any­ <lb/>
            thing in concert for the common advantage? Certainly. But <lb/>
            what if it happen in the case of two only; will they not <lb/>
            differ, and hate, and become enemies both to one another <lb/>
            and to the just also? They will, said he. If then, my <lb/>
            admirable friend, injustice reside in a person,—will it lose its <lb/>
            power, or still retain it ? It will still retain it, he replied. <lb/>
            Seems it not, then, to have some such power as this ;-that, <lb/>
            in whatever it exists, whether in a city, or race, or camp, or <lb/>
            anywhere else, it first of all renders it unable to act of <lb/>
            itself, owing to seditions and differences; besides which, it <lb/>
            becomes an enemy not only to itself, but to every opponent, <lb/>
            especially to the just—is it not so ? Certainly. And, ine­ <lb/>
            thinks, when injustice residing in one man will have all these <lb/>
            effects, which it is natural for it to produce, it will, in the <lb/>
            first place, render him unable to act, while at variance <lb/>
            and discord with himself ;-and, secondly, as being an enemy <lb/>
            both to himself and the just:—is it not so ? Yes. But, at <lb/>
            any rate, friend, the gods are just? Granted, said he. As <lb/>
            respects the gods, then, Thrasymachus, the unjust man will <lb/>
            be a foe, but the just man a friend ? Feast yourself boldly <lb/>
            on this reasoning, said he ; for I will not oppose you, that I <lb/>
            may not render myself odious to those who think so.* Come <lb/>
            then, said I, and satiate me with the rest of the feast, <lb/>
            by answering as you were doing just now: for as respects <lb/>
            the just appearing wiser and better and more able to act, <lb/>
            but the unjust being capable of doing nothing in concert; and <lb/>
            besides that, as to what we said with reference to the unjust, <lb/>
            that they are ever at any time able strenuously to act in mu­ <lb/>
            tual concert,-this we advanced not quite correctly, for being <lb/>
            thoroughly unjust, they would not spare one another : but yet <lb/>
            it was evident that there was a justice in them, which made <note type="footnote"> * A clever way of extricating himself from the dilemma in which <lb/>
            his general scepticism has involved him ! </note> <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. 1. C. 24.1 </note> <lb/>
            them refrain at any rate from injuring one another and <lb/>
            those of their party,-owing to which they performed what <lb/>
            they did; and they rushed into unjust actions, through injus­ <lb/>
            tice, in a kind of half-wicked feeling; for the completely <lb/>
            wicked are both perfectly unjust, and also quite incapable of <lb/>
            action :—that this is really so, I understand, but not in the <lb/>
            way that you first defined it. Besides, whether the just live <lb/>
            better than the unjust, and are more happy (which we pro­ <lb/>
            posed to consider afterwards), is now to be considered :-and, <lb/>
            methinks, they appear to do so even at present, from what <lb/>
            we have said :-but let us consider the matter still better; <lb/>
            for the discussion is not about a casual matter, but about <lb/>
            the manner in which we ought to live.</p>
          <p>Consider, then, said he. I am considering, said I;—and tell <lb/>
            me, does there seem to you to be any work peculiar to a <lb/>
            horse ? Yes. Would you not call that the [peculiar]work <lb/>
            both of a horse, and indeed of any being whatever, which he <lb/>
            can do, or best do, with him alone? I do not understand, said <lb/>
            he. But thus ;-see you with anything else than the eyes ? <lb/>
            Surely not. What then ? Could you hear with anything else <lb/>
            than the ears? By no means. Should we not, then, justly call <lb/>
            these the works peculiar to them ? Certainly. And what­ <lb/>
            could you not with a sword, a knife, and many other things, <lb/>
            lop off a vine-branch ? How not ? But with nothing, at <lb/>
            any rate, methinks, so well as with a pruning-knife made <lb/>
            for that purpose. True. Shall we not then define this to be <lb/>
            its [peculiar] work? We will so define it then.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIV.—Now, methinks, you may understand <lb/>
            better what I was asking, when I inquired whether the work <lb/>
            of each be not that which, of all others, one performs either <lb/>
            alone or in the best manner. I understand you, said he ; and <lb/>
            this seems to me to be each one's peculiar work. Granted, said <lb/>
            I:—and does there not likewise appear to yon to be a virtue <lb/>
            belonging to everything, to which a certain work is assigned? <lb/>
            But let us run over the same ground once more :—We say that <lb/>
            the eyes have a certain work ? Yes. Is there not then a vir­ <lb/>
            tue belonging to the eyes ? A virtue also. Well, then, have <lb/>
            the ears a certain work ? Yes. And of course a virtue <lb/>
            also? A virtue also. And, about all the rest;—is it not thus ? <lb/>
            It is. But, hold :-could the eyes ever cleverly perform <lb/>
            their work, when not possessed of their own proper virtue, but <pb n="32"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.I. c. 24. </note> <lb/>
            vice instead of virtue ? How could they ? said lie; for <lb/>
            perhaps you mean blindness instead of sight. Whatever, said <lb/>
            I, be their virtue, that I mean,-for I do not yet enter on this <lb/>
            question ; but, whether by their own proper virtue they <lb/>
            will perform their own proper work well, whatever they <lb/>
            undertake; and by vice, badly ? In this, at least, said <lb/>
            he, you speak the truth. And will not the ears also, <lb/>
            when deprived of their virtue, perform their work ill ? Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. And, are we to settle all other things by the same <lb/>
            reasoning? So I suppose. Come then, after this, consider <lb/>
            what follows : has the soul a certain work, which you can <lb/>
            perform by no other living thing,-such as this, to take <lb/>
            care, to govern, to consult, and all such [acts ?]Is there <lb/>
            any other than the soul, to which we can justly ascribe them, <lb/>
            and say they are its proper functions? No other. But what <lb/>
            of this ?-To live ; shall we say it is the work of the soul ? <lb/>
            Most assuredly, said he. Do not we say, then, that there is <lb/>
            some virtue, also, peculiar to the soul? We do. And can the <lb/>
            soul, then, Thrasymachus, ever perform its own works cle­ <lb/>
            verly, whilst deprived of its proper virtue ;-or, is this im­ <lb/>
            possible ? Impossible. Of necessity, then, a bad soul must <lb/>
            govern and take care of things badly, and a good soul perform <lb/>
            all these things well ? Necessarily so. Did we not then agree, <lb/>
            that justice was the virtue of the soul, and injustice its vice? <lb/>
            We did so agree. The just soul, then, and the just man, <lb/>
            will live well, and the unjust ill ? It appears so, said he, <lb/>
            according to your reasoning. Surely, then, he who lives well <lb/>
            is both blessed and happy; and he who does not, the opposite? <lb/>
            How not? The just, then, is happy, and the unjust miserable? <lb/>
            Granted, said he. But at any rate, it is not advantageous to <lb/>
            be miserable, but happy ? How not ? In that case, excel­ <lb/>
            lent Thrasymachus, injustice is never more profitable than <lb/>
            justice. Well, now, Socrates, said he, you have been capitally <lb/>
            well feasted at these Bendideia. Aye, by you, Thrasymachus, <lb/>
            I certainly have; for you are grown quite mild, and have <lb/>
            ceased to be troublesome:—and if I have not feasted hand­ <lb/>
            somely, it is owing to myself, not you.—But just as greedy <lb/>
            guests, ever gloating on what is fresh brought before them, taste <lb/>
            thereof, without having properly enjoyed what went before,­ <lb/>
            so I, methinks, without having first ascertained what we were <lb/>
            before investigating,—namely the nature of justice, have omit- <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. i. c. 24. ] </note> <lb/>
            ted this, and rushed eagerly forward to inquire concerning it, <lb/>
            whether it be vice and ignorance, or wisdom and virtue ;-and <lb/>
            when an assertion was afterwards introduced, that injustice is <lb/>
            more profitable than justice, I could not refrain from coming to <lb/>
            this, from the other; so that now, from this conversation, I <lb/>
            have learnt nothing at all;—for since I do not know what <lb/>
            justice is, I can scarcely know whether it be a virtue or not, <lb/>
            -and whether he who possesses it be unhappy or happy.</p>

          <p>In the second book he illustrates justice by a pretty long discourse about <lb/>
            injustice, its contrary, and the social evils thence arising. From such <lb/>
            a comprehensive view of society itself he is not unnaturally led into his <lb/>
            main argument, the subject of civil government; carefully distinguishing <lb/>
            between the head and the members-the governors and the governed; <lb/>
            but also bearing in mind that society is the stage on which alone the <lb/>
            virtues of the just man can be seen in perfection. The governors, says <lb/>
            he, should be spirited and shrewd, so as to be able both to repel the <lb/>
            violence of the state's enemies, and severely to punish wicked citizens, <lb/>
            as well as peaceably to maintain their own subjects or dependants <lb/>
            under the law's protection, and to appoint proper rewards for virtuous <lb/>
            and deserving actions. The principal study then should, as respects a <lb/>
            state, be devoted jointly to music and gymnastics—the former referring <lb/>
            to mental, the other to bodily training ; but above all these he places <lb/>
            religion, which though he does not statedly define it, yet he proves to <lb/>
            be wholly distinct from the superstition of his own time.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—Having said these things, I thought to have been <lb/>
            relieved from the debate ; but this it seems was only the intro­ <lb/>
            duction ; for Glaucon is on all occasions most courageous, and <lb/>
            then especially did not approve of Thrasymachus's withdrawal <lb/>
            from the debate, but said;—Socrates, have you any desire of <lb/>
            seeming to have persuaded us, or to succeed in really persuading <lb/>
            us that it is in every respect better to be just than un­ <lb/>
            just ? I, for my part, said I, would prefer to do so in reality, <lb/>
            if it depended on me. You are not doing then, said he, <lb/>
            what you desire : for, tell me, does there appear to you any <lb/>
            good of this kind, such as we would accept as a possession, <lb/>
            without regard to its results, but embracing it [simply] for its <lb/>
            own sake; such as joy and all kinds of harmless pleasures,* <lb/>
            though for the future no other advantage springs from them <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλαβει̃ς</foreign> means not only harmless pleasures, but those which are <lb/>
            pure and unalloyed with pain. We may remark here, that he divides <lb/>
            goods (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἀγαθά</foreign>) into three classes,-one, to be pursued for its own sake <lb/>
            only, without reference to advantage.-another, which is to be loved both </note> <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="margin">is. II. c. 2.] <lb/>
            </note>than the delight arising from their possession. To me, indeed, <lb/>
            said I, there does seem to be something of this kind. But <lb/>
            what;—is there not some species of good which we both love <lb/>
            for its own sake, and also for what springs from it,-as <lb/>
            wisdom, sight, and health ?-for such goods we surely embrace <lb/>
            on both accounts. Yes, said I. But do you see, said he, <lb/>
            a third species of good,-among which are bodily exercise, <lb/>
            being healed when sick, the practice of medicine, or any other <lb/>
            lucrative employment ?-for these things, we should say, are <lb/>
            laborious, yet beneficial to us, and we should not choose them <lb/>
            for their own sake, but on account of the rewards and other <lb/>
            advantages that spring from them. There is, indeed, said I, <lb/>
            this third species also : but what then ? In which of these <lb/>
            species, said he, do you place justice ? I think, indeed, said <lb/>
            I, in the most beautiful,-as being a good, which, both on its <lb/>
            own account and for what springs from it, is desired by a man <lb/>
            bent on being happy. It does not seem so, however, said he, <lb/>
            to the multitude, but rather to be of that laborious kind <lb/>
            which is pursued on account of rewards and honours [gained] <lb/>
            through high repute, but on its own account to be shunned, <lb/>
            as fraught with trouble.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—I am aware, said I, that it seems so; and it was <lb/>
            in this view, that it was some time since condemned by Thra­ <lb/>
            symachus, but injustice praised :—it seems, however, that I <lb/>
            am one of those who are dull in learning. Come now, <lb/>
            said he, listen to me too, if you please; for Thrasymachus <lb/>
            seems to me to have been charmed by you just like a snake,* <lb/>
            more quickly than he ought; while, with respect to my­ <lb/>
            self, the proof has not yet been made to my satisfaction in <lb/>
            either case, for I desire to hear what each is, and what in­ <lb/>
            trinsic power it has by itself, when residing in the soul,­ <lb/>
            letting alone the rewards and what springs from them. <note type="footnote"> for its own sake, and for the advantages thence accruing,-and a third, <lb/>
            which of itself perhaps is not worthy to be pursued, but only on account <lb/>
            of the advantages thence accruing. In the second or mixed class Socrates <lb/>
            places justice. </note><note type="footnote"> * Thrasymachus is here, on account of his passionate violence and <lb/>
            uncouth manners, aptly compared to a snake, which, as the ancients <lb/>
            believed, could be softened and subdued by music :-and we note par­ <lb/>
            ticularly the elegant use of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηλει̃ν</foreign>, which primarily signifies to <lb/>
            charm, sooth, subdue, and then generally, to soften by persuasion or <lb/>
            argument. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            I will proceed, in this manner, therefore, if it be your <lb/>
            pleasure. I will take up Thrasymachus's argument in ano­ <lb/>
            ther shape; and, first of all, I will tell you what they <lb/>
            say justice is, and whence it arises,-and, secondly, that all <lb/>
            who cultivate it, cultivate it unwillingly, as necessary, but <lb/>
            not as good,-and thirdly, that they do this with reason, inas­ <lb/>
            much as, according to their notion, the life of an unjust man <lb/>
            is much better than that of one that is just. Though, for my <lb/>
            own part, Socrates, it by no means appears so to me, still I <lb/>
            am thrown into a state of doubt, from having my ears stunned <lb/>
            by hearing Thrasymachus and innumerable others.-But as for <lb/>
            the statement respecting justice, that it is better than injustice, <lb/>
            I have never yet heard it explained as I wish. I wish, <lb/>
            therefore, to hear it eulogized on its own account, and am <lb/>
            quite of opinion that I shall hear it from you: wherefore, <lb/>
            by way of opposition,* I shall speak in praise of an unjust <lb/>
            life, and in so speaking will show you in what manner I want <lb/>
            to hear you in turn condemn injustice and commend justice. <lb/>
            But see if my proposal be agreeable to you. Quite so, said <lb/>
            I; for about what would any man of intellect delight more <lb/>
            frequently to speak and hear ? You speak excellently well, <lb/>
            said he :-and now, as to what I said I would first speak <lb/>
            about, listen, both what justice is and whence it springs.</p>
          <p>They say, forsooth, that to do injustice is naturally good, <lb/>
            and to suffer injustice bad,-but thatsuffering injustice <lb/>
            is attended with greater evil than doing injustice with good; <lb/>
            so that, when men do each other injustice, and likewise suffer <lb/>
            it, and have a taste of both, it seems advantageous for <lb/>
            those, who are not able to avoid the one and choose the <lb/>
            other, to agree among themselves neither to act unjustly <lb/>
            nor yet to be treated so; and also, that hence they began <lb/>
            to form for themselves laws and compacts, and to call what <lb/>
            is enjoined by law lawful and just.-This, then, is the origin <lb/>
            and essence of justice,-a medium between what is best, namely, <lb/>
            when a man acts unjustly with impunity, and what is worst, <lb/>
            that is, when one injured is unable to obtain redress — andthis <lb/>
            justice being half-way between both these, is desired, not as <note type="footnote">* Respecting this use of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατατείνειν</foreign>, comp. ch. ix. p. 36/ b. <lb/>

            good, but as being held in honour, owing to an incapacity <lb/>
            for doing injustice; because the man who had ability to do <lb/>
            so would never, if really a man, agree with any one neither <lb/>
            to injure nor be injured; for he would be mad to do so. This, <lb/>
            then, Socrates, and such like, is the nature of justice; and <lb/>
            such, as they say, is the source whence it arises.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III. — Again, — that those who cultivate it through <lb/>
            an incapability of doing injustice, cultivate it unwillingly, we <lb/>
            shall best be made aware, if we should mentally conceive <lb/>
            such a case as follows Let us give full liberty to each of <lb/>
            them, both the just and the unjust, to do whatever they please, <lb/>
            -and then follow them, observing whither inclination will <lb/>
            lead each. We should then detect * the just man going the <lb/>
            same way with the unjust, through a desire of having more <lb/>
            than others,which every nature naturally pursues as good, <lb/>
            but by law and compulsion is led to respect equality. + <lb/>
            And the liberty of which I speak may be chiefly of such <lb/>
            a kind, as if they possessed such a power, as they say once <lb/>
            belonged to Gyges (the progenitor of the Lydian king ‡); <lb/>
            and of him, forsooth, they say, that he was a hired shep­ <lb/>

              ground was torn up by a prodigious rain and earthquake, and <lb/>
              an opening made in the place where he was grazing [his flocks,] <lb/>
              -that, in astonishment at the sight, he descended and saw other <lb/>
              wonders besides, which men hand down in fables, especially a <lb/>
              brazen horse, hollow, provided with doors, leaning against <lb/>
              which, he beheld inside a dead body, apparently larger than <lb/>
              that of a man, and that it had nothing else except that it wore <lb/>
              a gold ring on its hand, which he took off and came out. And <lb/>
              when there was a meeting of the shepherds, as usual, for making <lb/>
              their monthly report to the king about their flocks, he also <lb/>
              came with the ring; and while sitting with the rest, he hap­ <lb/>
              pened to turn the stone of the ring towards himself into the <lb/>
              inner part of his hand ; and when this was done, he became <lb/>
              invisible to those who sat beside him, and they talked of him as <lb/>
              absent: and astonished at this, he again handled his ring, turned <lb/>
              the stone outward, and on turning it became visible. On ob­ <lb/>
              serving this, then, he made trial of the ring, whether it had this <lb/>
              power ; and it always happened so, that, when he turned the <lb/>
              stone inward, he became invisible,—when outward, visible. <lb/>
              Perceiving this, he instantly contrived to be made one of the <lb/>
              embassy to the king; and on his arrival he debauched his <lb/>
              wife, and, with her, assaulted and killed the king,* and took <lb/>
              possession of the kingdom. If now, there were two such rings, <lb/>
              and the just man had one, and the unjust the other, no one, we <lb/>
              should think, would be so case-hardened as to persevere in jus­ <lb/>
              tice, and dare to refrain from others' property and not touch it, <lb/>
              when it was in his power both to take fearlessly, even from the <lb/>
              market-place, whatever he pleased, and to enter houses, and <lb/>
              embrace any one he pleased,-both to kill and loose from chains <lb/>
              whomever he pleased,-and to do anything else likewise, as a <lb/>
              god among men :-acting in this manner, he would in no <lb/>
              respect differ from the other, but both would go the same road. <lb/>
              This, in truth, one may say, is a strong proof, that no one is <lb/>
              willingly just, but only by constraint, as if it were not an intrin­ <lb/>
              sic good, because every one, where he thinks he can, does in­ <lb/>
              justice. Every man, then, thinks that injustice is intrinsically <lb/>
              much more profitable than justice, thinking truly, as he says, <lb/>

              yet would they praise him in each others' presence, mutually <lb/>

            be able to come to a right judgment,-but not otherwise; <lb/>
            and what, then, is this distinction ? It is this;—let us, from <lb/>
            the unjust man, take nothing of injustice, nor from the just <lb/>
            man, of justice; but let us make each of them perfect in his own <lb/>
            pursuit. First, then, let the unjust man act as clever artists <lb/>
            [do]. For instance, a skilful pilot or physician comprehends <lb/>
            both the possible and impossible in his art, the former <lb/>
            of which he attempts, but relinquishes the latter ;-and again, <lb/>
            if he meet with any failure, he is able to rectify it:-so, <lb/>
            in like manner, let the unjust man when he attempts clever <lb/>
            acts of injustice, remain concealed, if he intends to be exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly unjust; but, as for him that is caught, he must be deemed <lb/>
            worthless : for the most complete injustice is—to seem just, <lb/>
            when not so.* To the completely unjust, then, we must ascribe <lb/>
            the most complete injustice, and not take it from him, but <lb/>
            allow him, while doing the greatest injustice, to win the highest <lb/>
            reputation for justice; and, if he should fail at all, he should <lb/>
            be able to rectify it, and be capable of speaking persuasively, <lb/>
            if any report of his unjust deeds get abroad, and be able also to <lb/>
            effect by force what requires force, owing to his courage and <lb/>
            strength, and through the instrumentality of his friends and <lb/>
            his wealth ; supposing him, then, to be such as this, let us for <lb/>
            argument place in contrast with him a just, simple-minded, <lb/>
            and generous-hearted man, who, according to Æschylus, de­ <lb/>
            sires less the seeming than the reality of goodness:t let us <note type="footnote"> * Comp. here Cicero de Off. i. c. 13. Totius autem injustitise nulla <lb/>

              take from him, then, the mere seeming of goodness; for, <lb/>
              should he seem just, honours and rewards will be his lot, <lb/>
              because he merely seems so :-and thus [it may be] uncer­ <lb/>
              tain whether he be such for the sake of justice, or rewards <lb/>
              and honours. Let him be stripped, then, of everything but <lb/>
              justice, and be placed in direct contrast to the other;­ <lb/>
              without doing injustice too, let him have the reputation of <lb/>
              doing the greatest,—in order that he may be put to the test <lb/>
              for justice, and not be moved to reproach and its conse­ <lb/>
              quences, but rather be unchangeable till death, seeming, <lb/>
              indeed, to be unjust through life, though really just; and <lb/>
              that thus both arriving at the extreme,-one of justice, <lb/>
              the other of injustice, we may judge which of the two <lb/>
              is the happier.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Bah, bah, said I, dear Glaucon, how exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly anxious you are to cleanse each of these men for trial, <lb/>
            just as [you would] a statue ! As much, -aid he, as I can : <lb/>
            but, as they are such, there will be no difficulty, I suppose, <lb/>
            in ascertaining what life will be the lot of either. It shall <lb/>
            be told, then :-and, even if it should be told with more <lb/>
            than usual bluntness, think not, that it is I who tell it, <lb/>
            Socrates, but those who praise injustice before justice.-This <lb/>
            then will they say, that the just man, thus situated, will be <lb/>
            scourged, tortured, fettered, have his eyes burnt out, and <lb/>
            lastly, suffer all manner of evils, and be crucified;* and he <lb/>
            will know too, that a man should desire not to be, but <lb/>
            to appear just. As for that saying of Æschylus, too, it <lb/>
            applied far better against the unjust man : for in reality <lb/>
            men will say, that the unjust man, as being in pursuit of an <lb/>
            object connected with truth, and not living according to opi­ <lb/>
            nion, has no desire to appear, but to be unjust,- <lb/>
            Reaping the hollow furrow of his mind, <lb/>
            Whence all his cherished councils blossom forth. <lb/>
            In the first place, he holds the magistracy in the state, be­ <lb/>
            cause lie is thought just,-next, he marries out of whatever <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> * A similar passage occurs in Cicero de Republ. iii. 17 :—Proque <lb/>

            family he pleases, and gives his children in marriage to whom <lb/>
            he pleases, forms agreements and joins in partnership with <lb/>
            whom he likes,-and, besides all this, succeeds in all his pro­ <lb/>
            jects for gain, because he scruples not to commit injustice. <lb/>
            When he engages, therefore, in competitions, he both in private <lb/>
            and public surpasses and overreaches his adversaries; and by <lb/>
            this overreaching gets rich, serves his friends, hurts his foes ; <lb/>
            and to the gods, as respects sacrifices and offerings, he not <lb/>
            only sufficiently but even magnificently both sacrifices and <lb/>
            makes offerings, serving far better than the just man, not <lb/>
            only the gods, but of men also whomsoever he pleases; so <lb/>
            that it is very likely that he should be a greater favourite of <lb/>
            the gods than the just man. Thus, they say, Socrates, that <lb/>
            with gods and men a better life awaits the unjust than the <lb/>
            just.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Glaucon having said this, I was thinking of <lb/>
            saying something in reply ; but his brother Adimantus said- <lb/>
            Do you not think, Socrates, that enough has been already <lb/>
            said on the matter ? What then ? said I. The very <lb/>
            point has not. been mooted, said he, which ought most <lb/>
            especially to have been discussed. Why then, said I, as the <lb/>
            saying is, let a brother help a brother,-so that, if he fails <lb/>
            at all, do you help him out :-yet, as far as I am con­ <lb/>
            cerned, what he has alleged is quite sufficient to defeat me, <lb/>
            and disable me from defending justice.</p>
          <p>And he in reply said : Oh, it is a mere nothing you <lb/>
            allege ;-but still hear this in addition ;-for we must go <lb/>
            through all the arguments in opposition to what he has said, <lb/>
            [those, namely,] which praise justice and condemn injustice,— <lb/>
            in order that it may be more clearly seen, what, I think, <lb/>
            Glaucon means : and perhaps parents tell and exhort their <lb/>
            sons, as all those do who care for them, that they ought to be <lb/>
            just,-not commending justice for itself, but for the repu­ <lb/>
            tation arising therefrom ;-and hence to a man reputed to <lb/>
            be just, there may accrue from that very repute both state- <lb/>
            offices and marriage-connections, and whatever Glaucon just <lb/>
            now enumerated as the consequences of being reputed just: <lb/>
            these, however, carry this notion of repute too far;— <lb/>
            for, throwing in the approbation of the gods, they can speak <lb/>
            of abundant blessings, which, they say, the gods bestow on <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. C, 7 </note> <lb/>
            the holy. Just as noble Hesiod and Homer say;—the <lb/>
            former, that the gods make oaks produce for just men <lb/>
            Acorns at top, and in the middle bees ; <lb/>
            Their woolly sheep are laden thick with fleece ;* <lb/>
            and a great many other good things of the same nature:— <lb/>
            similarly, also, the latter :— <lb/>
            [Unrivalled, like the praise] of some great king, <lb/>
            Who o'er a numerous people and renown'd <lb/>
            Presiding like a deity, maintains <lb/>
            Justice and truth. The earth under his sway <lb/>
            Her produce yields abundantly; the trees <lb/>
            Fruit-laden bend ; the lusty flocks bring forth; <lb/>
            The ocean teems with finny swarms beneath <lb/>
            His joint control, and all the land is blest. † <lb/>
            Musæus, too, and his son [Eumolpus] tell us, that the <lb/>
            gods give just men far more splendid blessings than these; ‡ <lb/>
            for carrying them in his poem into Hades, and placing them <lb/>
            at table in company with holy men, at a feast prepared for <lb/>
            them, they crown them, and make them pass the whole of <lb/>
            their time drunken,-deeming eternal inebriation to be the best <lb/>
            reward of virtue.-Some, however, extend down still further <lb/>
            than these the rewards from the gods; for they say, that <lb/>
            children's children, and a future generation of the holy and <lb/>
            faithful, are left on earth. These, then, and such as these, <lb/>
            are their eulogies of justice. As for the unholy and un­ <lb/>
            just, however, they bury them in Hades, in mud, and compel <lb/>
            them to carry water in a sieve;—and as for those that are yet <lb/>
            living, if they lead them into wrong notions, as Glaucon did <lb/>
            in enumerating the punishments of just persons, but reputed <lb/>
            unjust,-this they can allege about the unjust, but nothing <lb/>
            else. The praise then or blame belongs to either party [as <lb/>

            Socrates, another species of argument about justice and in­ <lb/>
            justice, referred to both privately and by poets; for all with <lb/>
            one mouth celebrate temperance and justice* as beautiful, <lb/>
            but still difficult and laborious, but intemperance and injustice <lb/>
            as sweet and easy of attainment, though by repute only and <lb/>
            law disgraceful: and they mostly say, that unjust are more <lb/>
            profitable than just actions; and wicked rich men, and such <lb/>
            as have power of any kind, either public or private, they are <lb/>
            quite willing to pronounce happy and to honour both publicly <lb/>
            and privately, but to despise and overlook those who may be <lb/>
            at all weak and poor, even though they acknowledge them to <lb/>
            be better than the others.-But of all these arguments, the <lb/>
            most marvellous are those concerning the gods and virtue,­ <lb/>
            as if it were a matter of course, that the gods allot misfortunes <lb/>
            and an evil life to many good men, and to the opposite, an <lb/>
            opposite fate. Pedlar-priests t also, and prophets, frequenting <lb/>
            the gates of the rich, persuade them, that they possess a power <lb/>
            granted them by the gods, of expiating by sacrifices and <lb/>
            incantationsin the midst of pleasures and feastings, <lb/>
            whatever injustice has been committed by any one, or his <lb/>
            forefathers: and if he wishes to blast a foe, he can at <lb/>
            small expense injure the just, as well as the unjust, by cer­ <lb/>
            tain blandishments and magic ties, persuading the gods, as <lb/>
            they say, to succour them: and to all these discourses they <lb/>
            bring the poets as witnesses; who, mentioning man's predis­ <lb/>
            position to vice, say,- <lb/>
            How vice at once and easily we choose; <lb/>
            The way so smooth, its dwelling too so nigh; <lb/>

            Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayers <lb/>
            In meekness offer'd turn their wrath away.* <lb/>
            They bring forward, too, a crowd of books of Musæus and <lb/>
            Orpheus, the offspring of the Moon and the Muses, as they <lb/>
            say, in accordance with which they perform their sacred rites, <lb/>
            persuading not only private individuals, but states likewise, <lb/>
            that both absolutions and purgations from iniquities are effected <lb/>
            by sacrifices, and sportive pleasures,-and this, too, for the <lb/>
            benefit of the living as well as the dead;—which purga­ <lb/>
            tions they call mysteries, † which absolve us from the evils <lb/>

            perform no sacrifice.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—As respects all such and so much as has been <lb/>
            said, dear Socrates, about virtue and vice, and what reward <lb/>
            both men and gods attach thereto,—what do we suppose the <lb/>
            souls of our youth do when they hear them, such at least as <lb/>
            are of good natural parts, and able to rush, as it were, to all <lb/>
            that is said, and thence infer in what sort of character, and by <lb/>
            what procedure one may best pass through life ? He might <lb/>
            probably say to himself, according to Pindar,— <lb/>
            Shall I yon rampart, loftier far <lb/>
            Than justice, dare ascend,-or crooked fraud <lb/>
            Invite, to cheat the world, and thus <lb/>
            Myself live cased in guilt's base panoply, ‡ <lb/>
            For what is said happens to me, if I am just, though I <lb/>
            am not reputed so, they say it is no profit, but clearly, mere <lb/>
            trouble and punishment,-whereas the unjust man, who has <lb/>
            procured for himself the reputation of justice, is said to <lb/>
            have a divine life. Since then, as the sages tell me,§ <lb/>

            of happiness, I ought surely to turn wholly thereto, drawing <lb/>
            round myself, as a covering and picture, an image of virtue, <lb/>
            but still dragging after me the cunning and versatile fox of that <lb/>
            very clever Archilochus.* Perhaps, however, some one will say, <lb/>
            -it is not easy for a bad man always to practise his wicked­ <lb/>
            ness in secret.-Neither is anything else easy (will we say) <lb/>
            of important matters : but still, would we be happy, thither we <lb/>
            must go where the tracks of reasoning lead us: for, with a view <lb/>
            to concealment, we shall form conspiracies and associations; <lb/>
            and there are masters of persuasion, who teach a popular and <lb/>
            forensic wisdom,-by which, partly though persuasion and <lb/>
            partly by force, we may escape punishment after all our over­ <lb/>
            reaching. However, it is not possible either to escape the <lb/>
            notice of the gods, or to overpower them.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, if they have no existence, and have no care about <lb/>
            human affairs, neither need we care about concealment; <lb/>
            and as respects their existence and care for us, we neither <lb/>
            know nor have heard of them otherwise than from traditions, <lb/>
            and from the poets who write their genealogies; t and these very <lb/>
            persons tell us, that they are to be moved and persuaded by <lb/>
            sacrifices and propitiatory vows, and offerings,—both of which <lb/>
            we are to believe, or neither. If, however, we are to believe <lb/>
            both, we may do injustice, and offer sacrifice from the fruits of <lb/>
            unjust deeds. For if we be just, we shall escape punishment from <lb/>
            the gods, and then deprive ourselves of the gains of injustice : <lb/>
            but if, on the other hand, we be unjust, we shall make gain, <lb/>
            and after transgressing and offending, shall appease them <lb/>
            by prayers, and so escape punishment. Nevertheless, we <lb/>
            shall suffer in Hades the punishment of our misdeeds here, <lb/>
            either ourselves, or our children's children. But the reasoner <note type="footnote"> * That is, apparently, virtue; but, in reality, mere cunning. Archilochus <lb/>

              gods who expiate,-as say the mightiest states, and those chil­ <lb/>
              dren of the gods,-the poets and prophets, who declare that <lb/>
              these things are so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—For what reason, then, should we prefer justice <lb/>
            before the greatest injustice?—Should we acquire it by any <lb/>
            unfair pretences, we shall, both with reference to gods and <lb/>
            men, fare according to our wishes both in life and death, <lb/>
            as we are told by the sayings both of the multitude and the <lb/>
            learned too.-From all that has been said, then, Socrates, how <lb/>
            shall a man contrive to acquire a will for honouring justice, who <lb/>
            has any power of mind, or wealth, or body, or birth, and not <lb/>
            rather laugh at hearing its praises ? Although, therefore, a <lb/>
            man be able even to show what we have said to be false, and <lb/>
            fully knows that justice is best, he will, perhaps, greatly <lb/>
            excuse and not be angry with the unjust, because he knows, <lb/>
            that unless a man through a divine instinct abhor injustice, or <lb/>
            from knowledge abstain from it,-of all the rest not one is <lb/>
            willingly just, but either through cowardice, old age, or some <lb/>
            other weakness, condemns injustice, when unable to do it. <lb/>
            That it is so, is plain ;-for the first of such persons, who <lb/>
            arrives at the power, is the first to commit injustice, as far as <lb/>
            he is able.</p>
          <p>The reason of all this, again, is no other than that, from <lb/>
            whence all this discussion set out between my brother and me <lb/>
            and you, Socrates, because, among all of you, my wonderful <lb/>
            man, who call yourselves the eulogists of justice, from these <lb/>
            ancient heroes downwards, of all whose arguments are left to <lb/>
            the men of the present time, no one has ever yet condemned <lb/>
            injustice, nor praised justice, otherwise than as respects the <lb/>
            repute, honours, and emoluments arising therefrom; while, as <lb/>
            respects either of them in itself, and subsisting by its own power <lb/>
            in the soul of the possessor, and concealed both from gods and <lb/>
            men, no one has yet sufficiently investigated, either in poetry or <lb/>
            prose-writing,-how, namely, that the one is the greatest of <lb/>
            all the evils that the soul has within it, and justice the greatest <lb/>
            good: for had it from the beginning been thus stated by <lb/>
            you all, and you had so persuaded us from our youth, we <lb/>
            should not need to guard against injustice from our fellows, <lb/>
            but every man would be the best guardian over himself, <lb/>
            through fear, lest by doing injustice he should dwell with the <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. C. 10.] </note> <lb/>
            greatest evil. These things, Socrates, and, perhaps also, <lb/>
            yet more than these, Thrasymachus, and others too, might <lb/>
            say respecting justice and injustice, perverting their power, <lb/>
            disagreeably as I couceive:*—but, I, for I wish to conceal <lb/>
            nothing from you, am very anxious to hear your refutation, <lb/>
            and so say the most I can by way of opposition.-Do not, <lb/>
            therefore, merely show us in your reasoning, that justice is <lb/>
            better than injustice, but in what way each by itself affects <lb/>
            the mind, the one as in itself evil, and the other as good ; and <lb/>
            put out of the question mere opinion, as Glaucon recommended; <lb/>
            for if you do not set aside the true opinions on both sides, <lb/>
            and add those that are false, we will say you do not praise <lb/>
            justice, but its appearance, and do not condemn injustice, but <lb/>
            its appearance,—advising the unjust man to hide himself, and <lb/>
            agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is a foreign good <lb/>
            expedient for the more powerful, while injustice is what is <lb/>
            expedient and profitable for one's self, but inexpedient for <lb/>
            the inferior. Since, then, you have granted that justice <lb/>
            is one of those greatest goods, which on account of their <lb/>
            results are worthy to be possessed, but yet far more <lb/>
            in themselves for their own sake,—such as sight, hearing, <lb/>
            wisdom, health, and all other genuine goods, such as are so <lb/>
            in their own nature, and not merely in opinion; for this very <lb/>
            reason we may praise justice, as intrinsically, in itself, <lb/>
            profitable to its owner, and injustice harmful; but as <lb/>
            for rewards and repute, let others sing their praises.—I could <lb/>
            endure, perhaps, that the rest of the world should thus <lb/>
            praise justice and condemn injustice, complimenting and <lb/>
            reviling the opinions and rewards that concern them; <lb/>
            but certainly [I could not endure] it in you (except you <lb/>
            absolutely require it), because you have passed the whole <lb/>
            of life, engaged in no other inquiry but this.-Show us, then, <lb/>
            in course of the discussion, not only that justice is better <lb/>
            than injustice, but also what either intrinsically by itself <lb/>
            makes its owner, whether concealed or not from gods and men, <lb/>
            the one being good, and the other evil.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—On hearing this, pleased, as I always am, with <lb/>
            the disposition of Glaucon and Adimantus, I was then, in <lb/>
            particular, perfectly delighted, and replied: 0 sons of <figure type="illustration">

              that worthy sire [the Sophist,*] with good reason does the lover <lb/>
              of Glaucon . thus begin his elegies [which he made] on you, <lb/>
              when you distinguished yourselves in the battle of Megara. † <lb/>
              Ariston's sons ! of sire renown'd afar, <lb/>
              That race divine ......</p>
          <p>This, friends, seems well observed; for you must be under <lb/>
            some influence quite divine, if you are not persuaded that in­ <lb/>
            justice is better than justice, when you can thus speak in its <lb/>
            defence. Still metliinks, you are not really persuaded ; and I <lb/>
            reason from the rest of your behaviour; because, according to <lb/>
            your mode of talking, I should certainly have disbelieved you: <lb/>
            — but the more I trust you, the more I am at a loss, as to the <lb/>
            kind of argument I should use. I know not, indeed, how I am <lb/>
            to defend it,-as I seem unable :— and the proof of it is, that, <lb/>
            as respects what I thought I had clearly shown in arguing with <lb/>
            Thrasymachus, that justice is better than injustice, you did <lb/>
            not admit my proofs ;-nor, on the other hand, have I any <lb/>
            excuse for not defending it; because I fear it may be impious to <lb/>
            abandon justice, and see it accused when I am present, without <lb/>
            defending it, so long as I have breath and am able to speak. <lb/>
            It is best then to assist it in such a manner as I can. Here­ <lb/>
            upon Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means to <lb/>
            defend it, and not relinquish the discussion, but rather <lb/>
            investigate thoroughly the nature of each, and what the <lb/>
            truth is, as to their respective advantages. I then stated what <lb/>
            I thought,-that the inquiry we were attempting was no trifling <lb/>
            one, but one, as appears to me, suited for sharp-sighted persons. <lb/>
            Since then, said I, we are not very expert, it seems proper to <lb/>
            make such an investigation of it, as if a person should order <lb/>
            persons not very sharp-sighted to read small letters at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, and then find out that the same letters are rather larger <lb/>
            elsewhere, and in a larger field ;— it would then appear de­ <lb/>
            sirable, methinks, first to read these, and then examine the <lb/>
            lesser, whether they happen to be the same. By all means, <note type="footnote"> * The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκείνου του̃ ἀνδρός</foreign> does not refer to their father Cephalus, <lb/>

            said Adimantus. But what analogy do you perceive, Socrates, <lb/>
            in the inquiry about justice ? I will tell you, said I:— do <lb/>
            we not say that justice affects an individual man and an <lb/>
            entire state also? Certainly, replied he. Is not a state a <lb/>
            greater object than an individual ? Greater, said he. Perhaps, <lb/>
            then, justice will be more fully developed in what is greater, <lb/>
            and also more easily intelligible :— we will first, then, if you <lb/>
            please, inquire what it is in states; and then, we will in <lb/>
            like manner examine it in the individual, searching for the <lb/>
            similitude of the greater in the idea of the less. Yes,you <lb/>
            seem to me, said he, to speak rightly. If then, said I, we con­ <lb/>
            template in argument the rise of a state, shall we not also <lb/>
            perceive the rise of justice and injustice ? Perhaps so, said <lb/>
            he. Well then, if this be the case, is there no ground for <lb/>
            hoping that we shall more easily find the object of our <lb/>
            inquiry ? Just so. Does it not seem, then, that we ought to <lb/>
            try after success ? for I imagine this is a work of no small <lb/>
            importance. Consider then. We have considered, said <lb/>
            Adimantus. and do you the same.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI. — A state then, said I, takes its rise, methinks, <lb/>
            -because none of us individually happens to be self-sum­ <lb/>
            cient, but stands in need of many things; do you think that <lb/>
            there is any other origin of the settlement of a state ?* None, <lb/>
            said he. Thus, then, one assisting one person for the want of <lb/>
            one thing, and another another for the want of another, as we <lb/>
            stand in need of many things, we collect into one dwelling <lb/>
            many companions and assistants, and to this joint dwelling we <lb/>
            give the name of city ; do we not ? Certainly. One then im­ <lb/>
            parts to another, if he does impart anything, or receives in ex­ <lb/>
            change, thinking it will be for his advantage ? Certainly. <lb/>
            Come then, said I, let us, for argument's sake, form a <lb/>
            city from the beginning; — our necessity, as it seems, will <lb/>
            form it? Of course. But the first and the greatest of <lb/>
            wants is the provision of food, in order that we may subsist <lb/>
            and live ? Assuredly. The second is of lodging, the third <lb/>
            of clothing, and the like ? Just so. But come, said I, how <lb/>
            will the city be able to make so great a provision ?— Shall not <lb/>
            one be a husbandman, another a builder, a third a weaver;— <note type="footnote"> * Aristotle has made some unnecessarily severe strictures on this notion <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [E. II. c. 1 1 </note> <lb/>
            and must we not add to them a shoemaker, or some one else <lb/>
            of those that minister to our bodily wants ? Certainly. The <lb/>
            state then, that is most in need, will consist of only four or five <lb/>
            men ?* It appears so. What then ? must each of these con­ <lb/>
            tribute his work for the whole in common ?-as, for instance, <lb/>
            must the husbandman, though only one, provide food for <lb/>
            four, and spend fourfold time and labour in providing food <lb/>
            and sharing it with others ; or is he, without any care for <lb/>
            them, to prepare for himself alone the fourth part of this <lb/>
            food in the fourth part of the time, while of the other three <lb/>
            parts of his time, he employs one in the providing a <lb/>
            house; another clothing, the other shoe,-,-and not trouble <lb/>
            himself to share with others, but give his whole atten­ <lb/>
            tion to his own affairs ? And Adimantus said — Aye, but <lb/>
            perhaps the former way, Socrates, is easier than the latter. <lb/>
            By Zeus, that is not amiss, said I : — for, while you are <lb/>
            speaking, I am thinking that first of all we are born not each <lb/>
            perfectly alike to each, but differing in disposition,-one fitted <lb/>
            for doing one thing, and another for another ;-does it not <lb/>
            seem so to you ? It does. What then ?-Will a man do <lb/>
            better, when, as a single individual, he works in many arts, <lb/>
            or only in one ? When one works in one, said he. This, <lb/>
            moreover, is also plain, methinks; — that if one miss the <lb/>
            seasonable time for any work, it is ruined ? Clearly. Aye, <lb/>
            -for the work, methinks, will not wait on the leisure of <lb/>
            the workman, but the workman must necessarily attend <lb/>
            closely on his work, not in the way of a by-job ? He <lb/>
            must. And hence more will be done, and better, and <lb/>
            with greater ease, when every one does but one thing, <lb/>
            according to his genius, at the proper time, and when at <lb/>
            leisure from all other pursuits. Quite so, said he. Surely, <lb/>
            Adimantus, we need more citizens than four for the pro­ <lb/>
            visions that we mentioned: for the husbandman, it seems, <lb/>
            will not himself make his own plough, if it is to be good, <lb/>
            nor yet a spade or any other instruments of agriculture :— <lb/>
            neither, again, will the builder,-for he, likewise, needs many <lb/>
            things; and in the same way, the weaver also and the <lb/>
            shoemaker: — is it not so ? True. Carpenters, then, and <lb/>
            smiths, and many other such workmen, by becoming mem­ <lb/>
            bers of our little city, make it throng ? Certainly. Yet <note type="footnote"> * Comp. here the strictures in Aristotle's Polit. iv. 3 and 4. </note> <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            it would be no very great matter, either, if we added to them <lb/>
            herdsmen also, and shepherds, and all other sorts of graziers, <lb/>
            — in order that both the husbandmen may have oxen for <lb/>
            ploughing, and the builders by aid of the husbandmen may <lb/>
            have cattle for their carriages, and the weavers also, and <lb/>
            shoemakers, hides and wool. Yet it would be no very small <lb/>
            city, said he, that had all these. Moreover, said I, it is all <lb/>
            but impossible to settle the city itself in such a place that it <lb/>
            will not require imported goods. Impossible. Surely, then, <lb/>
            it will require others in addition, to bring to it what it needs <lb/>
            from other cities. It will require them. And, moreover, if <lb/>
            the servant were to go empty, taking with him nothing that <lb/>
            they need from whom what they themselves require is im­ <lb/>
            ported, he will return empty ; will he not ? I think so. It <lb/>
            is necessary for them, then, not only to produce what is sum­ <lb/>
            cient for themselves, but such and as many things also, as <lb/>
            are required by those whose services they require. It ought. <lb/>
            Our city, then, certainly wants many more husbandmen and <lb/>
            other kinds of workmen. Aye, many more. And all other <lb/>
            servants besides, to import and export the several articles; <lb/>
            and these are merchants, are they not ? Yes. We shall <lb/>
            want merchants then, as well ? Certainly. And if the <lb/>
            traffic is carried on by sea, it will want many others besides, <lb/>
            skilled in navigation. Many others, truly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII. — What then ;-in the city itself, how will <lb/>
            they exchange with one another what each has produced <lb/>
            for the sake of which, we have formed a city and esta­ <lb/>
            blished a community ? It is plain, said he, that by selling and <lb/>
            buying [they will do so]. A market-place, therefore, and <lb/>
            an established coinage, as a symbol for the purposes of ex­ <lb/>
            change, must spring up from hence. Certainly. If then the <lb/>
            husbandman, or any other workman, bring any of his work <lb/>
            to the market, but does not come at the same time as those <lb/>
            who want to make exchanges with him, will he not, while <lb/>
            sitting in the market, be unoccupied at his trade ? By no <lb/>
            means, said he ; for there are some, who, observing this, devote <lb/>
            themselves to this service; and, in well-regulated cities, they <lb/>
            are chiefly such, as are weakest in body and unfit for any <lb/>
            other work; — these then should attend about the market, to <lb/>
            give money in exchange for what people wish to sell, and <lb/>
            goods in exchange for money to such as want to buy. It <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            is this want, said I, that provides our city with a race of <lb/>
            shopkeepers; for do we not call those shopkeepers, who sit <lb/>
            in the market, and serve both in selling and buying; whereas <lb/>
            such as travel to other cities we call merchants ? Certainly. <lb/>
            There are certain other servants still, I conceive, who, though <lb/>
            as regards intellectual power unworthy to be taken into <lb/>
            society, yet possess bodily strength adequate for labour ;and <lb/>
            these selling the use of their strength, and calling the reward <lb/>
            of it hire, are called, I think, hired labourers ;-are they not ? <lb/>
            Just so. Hired labourers then, as it seems, form the com­ <lb/>
            plement of a city. Aye, it seems so. Has our city then, <lb/>
            Adimantus, so increased on us already, as to be complete ? <lb/>
            Perhaps. Where, then, will justice and injustice be placed in <lb/>
            it;and, in which of the matters that we have considered is it <lb/>
            engendered? I do not know, said he, Socrates, unless it be <lb/>
            somehow in a certain use of these very things with one <lb/>
            another. Perhaps, said I, you are right :-but yet we must <lb/>
            consider the point, and not avoid it. First, then, let us con­ <lb/>
            sider how the persons thus procured are to be supported. — In <lb/>
            making bread and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and building <lb/>
            houses, will they not work in summer, chiefly without clothes <lb/>
            and shoes, but in winter, sufficiently clad and shod ? and will <lb/>
            they be supported partly on barley made into meal, and <lb/>
            partly on wheat made into loaves, partly boiled and partly <lb/>
            toasted, with fine loaves and cakes placed over a fire of stubble <lb/>
            or dried leaves, and will they feast, they and their children, <lb/>
            resting on couches strewed with smilax and myrtle-leaves, <lb/>
            -drinking wine, crowned, and singing to the gods, plea­ <lb/>
            santly living together, begetting children not beyond their <lb/>
            means, and cautiously guarding against poverty or war ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII. — Glaucon then, in answer, said : You <lb/>
            make the men feast, it seems, without esculents.*You say <lb/>
            true, said I: I forgot that they were to have esculents too; <lb/>
            — and they will clearly have salt, and olives, and cheese, <lb/>
            and will boil bulbous roots, and potherbs, such as are cooked <lb/>
            in the fields: and we will set before them desserts of figs, <lb/>
            peas, and beans; and they will toast at the fire myrtle­ <lb/>
            berries and beech-nuts, drinking in moderation; and thus <note type="footnote"> * The Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂψον</foreign> is not to be translated, except by a periphrasis. It <lb/>

            passing their life in peace healthily, they will die in old age, <lb/>
            probably, and leave a similar mode of life to their children. <lb/>
            Socrates, said he, if you had been making a city of hogs, on <lb/>
            what else but these would you have fed them ? But what <lb/>
            ought we to do then, Glaucon ? said I. What is usual, said <lb/>
            he : let them lie down on beds, I think, unless they are to <lb/>
            live miserably, and take their meals from tables, and have <lb/>
            esculents, as the present men have, and desserts. Be it so, <lb/>
            said I:—I understand. We are considering, it seems, not <lb/>
            only how a city, but how a luxurious city may exist; and <lb/>
            perhaps it is not amiss: for, in considering one of this <lb/>
            character, we may probably see how justice and injustice <lb/>
            arise in cities. But the true city, which we have lately <lb/>
            described, seems to me just like a person that is in health; <lb/>
            but if you are desirous that we should inspect, also, a city <lb/>
            that is inflated, there can be no objection to it: for these <lb/>
            things [that concern a merely simple mode of life] will not <lb/>
            of course suffice for some, nor will this sort of life satisfy <lb/>
            them ; but there must be beds, tables, and all other articles <lb/>
            of furniture,-seasonings, unguents, and perfumes, mistresses, <lb/>
            confections, and many miscellaneous articles of this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion. And especially as to what we before mentioned, we <lb/>
            must no longer consider these as alone necessary,-namely, <lb/>
            houses, and clothes, and shoes; but we must set in operation <lb/>
            painting too, and all the refined arts, and must possess gold, <lb/>
            and ivory, and all things of that kind; must we not? Yes, <lb/>
            said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV. — Must we not, then, increase the size of our <lb/>
            city ?-For that healthy one is no longer sufficient, but <lb/>
            already full of repletion and abundance of such things as <lb/>
            are in nowise requisite for cities,-such as all kinds of <lb/>
            sportsmen, and imitative artists, many of whom imitate in <lb/>
            figures and colours, and many in music: poets too, and <lb/>
            their assistants, rhapsodists, actors, dancers, contractors,* and <lb/>
            manufacturers of all sorts of trinkets, especially of those <lb/>
            belonging to female attire; and in that case, too, we shall <lb/>
            require many more servants; and think you not they will <lb/>
            require teachers, nurses, tutors, hair-dressers, barbers, con­ <lb/>
            fectioners, too, and cooks ? Aye, and further still, we shall <lb/>
            want swine-herds. Of these, indeed, there were none <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργολάοι</foreign>, i. e. persons undertaking for a certain sum to com­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. II. C. 14. </note> <lb/>
            in the other state (for there needed none); but in this we <lb/>
            shall need these also ; and shall require, too, many other sorts <lb/>
            of cattle, if any one eats them ; shall we not ? Of course. <lb/>
            Shall we not, then, in this mode of life, require physicians far <lb/>
            more than in the former one ? Much more.</p>
          <p>And the land, perhaps, which at first sufficed to support <lb/>
            the inhabitants, will, instead of being sufficient, become too <lb/>
            little ;'or how shall we say ? Just so, said he. Must we not <lb/>
            then cut off a part from the neighbouring country, if we <lb/>
            would have enough for arable and pasture, and they in turn <lb/>
            from ours, if they on their part devote themselves to the ac­ <lb/>
            cumulation of boundless wealth, going beyond the limits of <lb/>
            mere necessity ?</p>
          <p>We must, Socrates, said he. Shall we go to war after­ <lb/>
            wards, Glaucon, or how shall we do ? Certainly, said he. <lb/>
            But let us not yet, said I, consider the question, whether war <lb/>
            produces harm or good,-but thus much only, that we have <lb/>
            found the origin of war, and whence especially arise mischiefs <lb/>
            to cities, both privately and publicly. Aye, indeed. We <lb/>
            shall require, then, friend, a still larger city,-not for a small, <lb/>
            but for a large army, which may go out and fight with those <lb/>
            who assail it, for their whole substance and everything that <lb/>
            we have now mentioned. What, said he, are not these sum­ <lb/>
            cient to fight ? No, said I ; — not if you and all of us were <lb/>
            rightly agreed, when we formed our state: and we agreed, if <lb/>
            you remember, that it was impossible for a single person <lb/>
            to practise many arts well. True, said he. What then, <lb/>
            said I, do not struggles in war seem to require art ? Very <lb/>
            much so, said he. Ought we then to take more care of the <lb/>
            shoemaking art than of that of warfare ? By no means. <lb/>
            But we charged the shoemaker not to attempt to be at the <lb/>
            same time a husbandman, or a weaver, or a builder, in order <lb/>
            that the work of shoemaking might be well done; and in <lb/>
            like manner we allotted to each of the others a single calling, <lb/>
            to which each was adapted by nature, and at which, each by­ <lb/>
            abstaining from the rest, and applying to it the whole of his <lb/>
            life, and not neglecting the proper opportunities, he would <lb/>
            be likely to work well; but is it not of the greatest import­ <lb/>
            ance that what concerns war should be well performed ? or <lb/>
            is it so easy that one who is a husbandman may also be a <lb/>
            soldier, and a shoemaker, and one who practises any other <lb/>
            art, — while no one could become a skilful chess or dice <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. C. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            player, who does not study it from childhood, but makes it a <lb/>
            mere by-work ? and can a person who takes a spear or <lb/>
            other warlike arms and instruments, instantly become an <lb/>
            expert combatant in an armed encounter or aught else re­ <lb/>
            lating to war; while, as respects the tools of any other art <lb/>
            whatever, one cannot become a good artist, or even a <lb/>
            wrestler to any useful extent, without having correct know­ <lb/>
            ledge and bestowing sufficient attention ? In that case, such <lb/>
            tools, said he, would truly be very valuable.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—Therefore, said I, by how much more im­ <lb/>
            portant is the work of the state-guardians, by so much will <lb/>
            it require the greatest leisure from other pursuits, and likewise <lb/>
            the greatest art and study! I really think so, replied he. And <lb/>
            will it not also require natural talents suited to this particular <lb/>
            profession ? Of course. I think, then, we should make it our <lb/>
            special business, if possible, to choose what men and what <lb/>
            talents are suited for the guardianship of a state. Aye, our <lb/>
            special business. By Zeus, said I, in that case we have <lb/>
            undertaken no trifling business; but, still we must not <lb/>
            despair, as long, at least, as we have any ability. Of course <lb/>
            not, said he. Think you, then, said I, that the genius of a <lb/>
            high-bred whelp at all differs as respects guardianship, from <lb/>
            that of a high-bred youth ? What do you mean ? For in­ <lb/>
            stance, must not each of them be acute in perception, swift <lb/>
            in pursuing what he perceives, and strong likewise, if he wants, <lb/>
            when he has taken, to overcome it ? Of all these there is great <lb/>
            need, said he. And surely he must be brave also, if he is to <lb/>
            fight well. Of course. But is he likely to be brave, who <lb/>
            has not a high spirit;* whether horse, or dog, or any other <lb/>
            animal ? Have you not observed, how irresistible and invinci. <lb/>
            ble is anger, and, when it is present, that every soul is fear­ <lb/>
            less of everything and indomitable ? I have. It is plain, then, <lb/>
            what species of guardian we ought to have, as respects the <lb/>
            body? Yes. And with reference to his soul moreover, that <lb/>
            he should be spirited. That is clear, also. How then, said I, <lb/>
            Glaucon, can they be otherwise than savage towards each <lb/>
            other and the other citizens, when of such a temper? By <lb/>
            Zeus, said he, not easily. Still it is necessary, that towards <lb/>
            their friends they should be mild, but towards their enemies <lb/>
            fierce :-for otherwise they would not wait for others to de­ <lb/>
            stroy them, but rather be beforehand with them in doing it. <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελήσει</foreign>, in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλει</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναται</foreign>. </note> <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. c. 16. </note> <lb/>
            True, said he. What shall we do, then, said I;—whence <lb/>
            shall we find a disposition at the same time mild and mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous ?-for the mild nature is surely opposed to the high- <lb/>
            spirited? It appears so. Nevertheless, if he be deprived of <lb/>
            either of these, he cannot be a good guardian ; but this seems <lb/>
            to be impossible ;-and thus it turns out that it is impossible <lb/>
            there should be a good guardian. It seems so, said he. Then <lb/>
            I, being at a loss, and considering what had passed, said :— <lb/>
            We very justly hesitate, my friend, for we have departed <lb/>
            from the image that we first established. How say you ? <lb/>
            Did we not observe that there are such kinds of tempers <lb/>
            as we imagined did not exist, having these opposite qualities ? <lb/>
            Where ? One may see it also in other animals, and not a <lb/>
            little in that, to which we compared our guardian ; for you <lb/>
            know it is the natural temper of generous dogs to be as gentle <lb/>
            as possible towards their intimates and their acquaintances, <lb/>
            but the reverse to those whom they know not. Ave,—I <lb/>
            know it. This then, said I, is quite possible ; and we do not <lb/>
            unnaturally require our guardian to be so. It seems not.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI. — Are you, further, of opinion, that he who <lb/>
            is to be our guardian should, besides being spirited, have <lb/>
            a philosophic nature also ? How ? said lie : — for I do <lb/>
            not understand. This too, said I, you will observe in dogs, <lb/>
            what is also well worthy of admiration in the brute. <lb/>
            What ? He is angry at every unknown person that he sees, <lb/>
            though he has never suffered ill from him before; but one <lb/>
            that is known he fawns upon, even though he may never <lb/>
            have received any good from him. Did you never wonder <lb/>
            at this ? I never, said he, thought of it before; but he does <lb/>
            so, it is clear. Moreover, this affection of his nature appears <lb/>
            elegant at least, and truly philosophic. In what respect? <lb/>
            Because, said I, it distinguishes a friendly and unfriendly <lb/>
            aspect by nothing else but this,-that it knows the one, but <lb/>
            not the other :-and how can we refuse to consider that as <lb/>
            the love of learning, which defines the friendly and the <lb/>
            foreign by intelligence and ignorance ? By no means, said he : <lb/>
            -it cannot be otherwise. Nevertheless, said I, to be a lover of <lb/>
            learning and a philosopher, are the same. The same, said he. <lb/>
            May we not then boldly lay down [ the principle,] that in man <lb/>
            too, if any one be mild towards his intimates and acquaint­ <lb/>
            ances, he must by nature be a philosopher and a lover of <lb/>
            learning ? Let us so lay it down, said he.</p><pb n="57"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> B. II. C. 17.] </note> He, then, who intends to be a good and worthy state- <lb/>
            guardian, should be by nature a philosopher, spirited, swift, <lb/>
            and strong. By all means, said he. Let him, then, be just <lb/>
            such as this, said I. In what manner, then, shall they be <lb/>
            trained and instructed ? and will the consideration of this at <lb/>
            all aid us in perceiving the object, for the sake of which we <lb/>
            are considering all these things; that is to say, how justice <lb/>
            and injustice arise in a state ? that we may not omit any <lb/>
            necessary part of our argument, or wade through what is <lb/>
            superfluous ? Then, said Glaucon's brother : I, for my part, <lb/>
            quite expect, that this inquiry will conduce to this end. <lb/>
            By Zeus, said I, friend Adimantus, we must not dismiss it; <lb/>
            even though it be somewhat too long. No, truly. Come then, <lb/>
            let us, as if we were talking in the way of fable, and at our <lb/>
            leisure, give some ideal training to these men.* It is right <lb/>
            to do so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—What then is the education ?-Is it diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to discover a better than has been discovered for a long <lb/>
            time ? that is, surely, gymnastics for the body, and music <lb/>
            for the mind ? It is. Must we not first, then, begin <lb/>
            by teaching music, rather than gymnastics ? Of course. <lb/>
            When you say music, you mean arguments, do you not ? <lb/>
            I do. But of arguments there are two kinds,-the one <lb/>
            true, the other false. Yes. And they must be instructed <lb/>
            in both,-but first in the false. I do not understand, said <lb/>
            he, what you mean. Know you not, said I, that first of <lb/>
            all we tell children fables;—and this, [surely,] to speak <lb/>
            generally, is falsehood; though there is some truth in <lb/>
            it; but we employ fables with children before gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises. We do. This was what I meant, then, by saying <lb/>
            that we must begin music before gymnastics. Right, said he. <lb/>
            And know you not, that the beginning of every work is <lb/>
            most important, especially to any one young and tender;­ <lb/>
            because then that particular impression is most easily in­ <lb/>
            stilled and formed, which any one may wish to imprint <lb/>
            on each individual. Entirely so. Shall we then let chil­ <lb/>
            dren hear any kind of fables composed by any kind of <lb/>
            persons, and receive into their minds opinions in a great <lb/>
            measure contrary to those which we think they should have <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγῳ παιδεύωμεν</foreign>. Comp. ch. iv. 361 b, and De Leg,-,. iv. <lb/>

            when they are grown up? We should by no means allow <lb/>
            it. First of all, then, as it seems, we must exercise control <lb/>
            over the fable-makers; and whatever beautiful fable they <lb/>
            may invent, we should select, and what is not so, we should <lb/>
            reject :-and we are to prevail on nurses and mothers to <lb/>
            repeat to the children such fables as are selected, and <lb/>
            fashion their minds by fables, much more than their bodies <lb/>
            by their hands. But very many of those that they now tell <lb/>
            them must be cast aside. What, for instance ? said he. In <lb/>
            the more important fables, said I, we shall see the lesser <lb/>
            likewise :-for the fashion of them must be the same; and <lb/>
            both the greater and the less must have the same kind of <lb/>
            influence :-do not you think so ? I do, said he : but I do not <lb/>
            at all understand, which of them you call the greater. Those, <lb/>
            said I, which both Hesiod and Homer told us, and the other <lb/>
            poets also :-for they composed and related false fables for <lb/>
            mankind, and do still relate them. What class, said he, do <lb/>
            you mean ;-and what do you blame in them ? That, said I, <lb/>
            which ought first and most of all to be blamed,-especially <lb/>
            when one does not falsify well. What is that? When a poet, <lb/>
            in his composition, exhibits bad representations of the nature <lb/>
            of gods and heroes,—-just as a painter draws a picture not at <lb/>
            all resembling what he was intending to paint. Yes, it is <lb/>
            quite right, said he, that such as these should be blamed :— <lb/>
            but how do we say, and in what respect ? First of all, said <lb/>
            I, with reference to that greatest falsehood, in matters of <lb/>
            grave importance too, in saying which he did not falsify well, <lb/>
            that Uranus made what Hesiod says he did; and then again how <lb/>
            Kronos punished him, and what Kronos did, and suffered from <lb/>
            his son :* for though these things were true, yet I think they <lb/>
            should not be so readily told to the unwise and the young, <lb/>
            but rather concealed from them;-and were there need to tell <lb/>
            them, they should be heard in secrecy, by as few as possible, <lb/>
            after sacrificing not a [valueless] hog,t but some great and <lb/>
            wonderful sacrifice, in order that it may fall to the lot of the <lb/>
            fewest possible to hear them. These fables, said he, are indeed <note type="footnote"> * Comp. Hesiod. Theogon. v. 154—6, and 178—80. </note><note type="footnote"> t Allusion is here made to the mysteries of Eleusis, in which all about <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. II. C. 18.] </note> <lb/>
            injurious. Neither are they to be told, Adimantus, said I, <lb/>
            in our state :-nor should it be said in the hearing of a youth, <lb/>
            that he who commits the most extreme injustice, or that <lb/>
            he who punishes in every possible way a father who commits <lb/>
            injustice, does nothing strange, but only does the same as the <lb/>
            first and the greatest of the gods. No truly, said he, nor do <lb/>
            such things as these seem to me proper to be said. Neither, <lb/>
            generally, said I, must it be told, how gods war with gods, <lb/>
            and plot and fight against one another (for such assertions <lb/>
            are not true),if, at least, it be the duty of those who are <lb/>
            to guard the state to esteem it most shameful to hate each <lb/>
            other on slight grounds. As little ought we to describe in <lb/>
            fables, and with ornamental aids, the battles of the giants, <lb/>
            and other many and various feuds, both of gods and heroes, with <lb/>
            their own kindred and relations butif we would persuade <lb/>
            them that never at all should one citizen hate another, and <lb/>
            that it is not holy, such things as these are rather to be told <lb/>
            them in early childhood, by the old men and women and those <lb/>
            well advanced in life ; and the poets should be obliged to com­ <lb/>
            pose consistently with these views. And [the fables of] Hera <lb/>
            fettered by her son,* and Hephæstus hurled from heaven by <lb/>
            his father for going to assist his mother when beaten, t and <lb/>
            all those battles of the gods which Homer has composed, we <lb/>
            must not admit into our state; — either in allegory or <lb/>
            without allegory; for young persons are not able to judge <lb/>
            what is allegory and what is not, but whatever opinions they <lb/>
            receive at such an age are wont to be obliterated with <lb/>
            difficulty, and immovable. Hence, one would think, we <lb/>
            should of all things endeavour, that what they first hear be <lb/>
            composed in the best manner for exciting them to virtue.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—There is reason for it, said he :-but, if <lb/>
            any one should ask us about these, what they are, and what <lb/>
            kind of fables, which should we name? Adimantus, I <lb/>
            replied, you and I are not poets at present, but founders <lb/>
            of a city, and it is the founder's business to know the <lb/>
            models on which the poets are to compose their fables, <lb/>
            contrary to which they are not to be tolerated; but it is not <note type="footnote"> * Suidas tells us, under the word "Hpa, that the myth here alluded to <lb/>
            was mentioned in a passage of Pindar, and that it was to be found also in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. II. C. 19. </note> <lb/>
            our province to make fables for them. Right, said he. But <lb/>
            as to this very thing,-namely, the models to be taken in <lb/>
            speaking about the gods, what must they be ? Some such as <lb/>
            these, said I:—God is always to be represented such as he is, <lb/>
            whether we represent him in epic, in song, or in tragedy. <lb/>
            Necessarily so. Is not God essentially good, and is he not to <lb/>
            be described as such ? Without doubt. But nothing that <lb/>
            is good is hurtful, is it ? I do not think so. Does then <lb/>
            what is not hurtful ever hurt ? By no means. Does that, <lb/>
            which hurts not, do any evil ? Nor this either. And what <lb/>
            does no evil cannot be the cause of any evil ? Of course not. <lb/>
            But what ?-good is beneficial. Yes. It is, therefore, the <lb/>
            cause of prosperity ? Yes. Good, therefore, is not the cause <lb/>
            of all things, but the cause of those things only which are <lb/>
            in a right state,-not the cause of those things which are <lb/>
            in a wrong state. Entirely so, said he. Neither, then, can <lb/>
            God, said I, since he is good, be the cause of all things, as <lb/>
            the many say, but only the cause of a few things to men, but <lb/>
            of many things not .the cause; for our blessings are much <lb/>
            fewer than our troubles: and no other must be assigned as <lb/>
            the cause of our blessings; whereas of our troubles we must <lb/>
            seek some other causes, and not God. You seem to me, said <lb/>
            lie, to speak most truly. We must not admit, then, said I, <lb/>
            that error of Homer or any other poet who foolishly errs with <lb/>
            respect to the gods, and says how- <lb/>
            Fast by the threshold of Jove's courts are placed <lb/>
            Two casks; one stored with evil, one with good, <lb/>
            From which the God dispenses as he wills. <lb/>
            For whom the glorious Thund'rer mingles both, <lb/>
            He leads a life chequer'd with good and ill <lb/>
            Alternate; but to whom he gives unmix'd <lb/>
            The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse, <lb/>
            His name becomes a by-word of reproach, <lb/>
            His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks <lb/>
            The blessed earth unblest, go where he may,—* <lb/>
            Nor, that Zeus— <lb/>
            Grants mortal man both happiness and woe.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—As regards the violation of oaths and <lb/>
            treaties which Pandarus effected, if any should say it <lb/>
            was done by the agency of Athena and Zeus, we cannot <lb/>
            approve ;-neither [if he were to relate] the dissension <note type="footnote"> * Horn. II. xxiv. v. 527—31. </note> <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. C. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            among the gods, and the judgment by Themis and Zeus; nor <lb/>
            yet must we suffer the youth to hear what Æschylus says; how, <lb/>
            Forthwith to mortals God invents a cause, <lb/>
            Whene'er he wills their dwellings to destroy ;— <lb/>
            and, besides, if any one is making poetical compositions, in <lb/>
            which are these iambics, the sufferings of Niobe, of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            pides, or the Trojans, or others of a like nature, we must either <lb/>
            not suffer him to say, that they are the works of God,—or, if of <lb/>
            God, we must discover that principle of action which we now <lb/>
            require, and say, that God did what was just and good, and <lb/>
            that they were benefited by being chastised: and we must <lb/>
            not let a poet say, that those are miserable who are punished, <lb/>
            and that it is God who does these things. If they say, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the wicked, as being miserable, need correction, <lb/>
            and that, in being punished, they are benefited by God, we <lb/>
            may suffer the assertion.-To say, however, that God, who is <lb/>
            good, is the cause of ill to any one, this we must by all <lb/>
            means oppose, and suffer no one to say so in our <lb/>
            state; if at any rate we wish it well governed ;-neither <lb/>
            must we allow any one, young or old, to hear such things <lb/>
            told in fable, either in verse or prose,-as their relation is <lb/>
            neither consistent with holiness, nor profitable to us, nor <lb/>
            consistent with themselves.</p>
          <p>I vote along with you, said he, as respects this law,—for <lb/>
            it quite pleases me. This, then, said I, is probably one of <lb/>
            the laws and models as respects the gods, by which it will <lb/>
            be necessary for those who speak to speak and for those who <lb/>
            compose to compose, that God is not the cause of all things, <lb/>
            but of good. Yes, said he, of course. But what as to this <lb/>
            second law ?-Think you that God is a sorcerer, and appears <lb/>
            designedly, at different times, in different shapes,-sometimes <lb/>
            like himself,-and, at other times, changing his form into many <lb/>
            shapes,-sometimes deceiving us and making us conceive false <lb/>
            opinions of him;—or, that he is simple, and that he by no <lb/>
            means quits his proper form ? I cannot, now, at least, say so, <lb/>
            replied he. But what as to this ;-if anything be changed <lb/>
            from its proper form, must it not be necessarily changed by <lb/>
            itself, or by another? Undoubtedly. Are not those things <lb/>
            which are in the best state, changed and moved least of all <lb/>
            other by another ;-as the body, by meats and drinks, and <lb/>
            labours, and all kinds of plants by droughts and winds, and <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. If. c. 20. </note> <lb/>
            such like accidents? Is not the most healthy and vigorous <lb/>
            least of all changed ? Surely. And as to the soul itself, <lb/>
            will not external accidents least of all disorder and change <lb/>
            the bravest and wisest ? Yes. And surely all manufactured <lb/>
            vessels, and buildings, and vestments, such as are properly <lb/>
            made and in a right state, are according to the same reasoning <lb/>
            least of all changed by time, or other accidents ? Such is the <lb/>
            case. Everything then, which is in a good state, either by na­ <lb/>
            ture or art, or both, receives the smallest change from another. <lb/>
            It seems so. But God, and all that belongs to divinity, are in <lb/>
            the best state ? Of course. In this way, then, God should <lb/>
            least of all have many shapes ? Least of all, truly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—Again.—should he change and alter him­ <lb/>
            self? Clearly so, said he, if he be changed at all. Does <lb/>
            he then change himself to what is better, and fairer, or to <lb/>
            the worse, and more deformed ? To the worse, surely, replied <lb/>
            he,—if he be changed at all; for we can never say, that <lb/>
            God is at all deficient in beauty or excellence. You speak <lb/>
            most correctly, said I. And this being so, think you, Adi­ <lb/>
            mantus, that any one, either of gods or men, would willingly <lb/>
            make himself any way worse? Impossible, said he.It is <lb/>
            impossible, then, said I, for a god to desire to change himself; <lb/>
            but, as it seems, each being most beautiful and excellent, con-. <lb/>
            tinues always to the utmost of his power invariably in his <lb/>
            own form. This seems a necessary conclusion, said he. Well <lb/>
            then, said I, most excellent Adimantus, let not any of the <lb/>
            poets tell us, how <lb/>
            ..... in similitude of strangers oft <lb/>
            The gods, who can with ease all shapes assume, <lb/>
            Repair to populous cities ......* <lb/>
            Neither let any one belie Proteus and Thetis, nor introduce <lb/>
            Hera in tragedies or other poems, as having transformed <lb/>
            herself into a priestess, collecting for <lb/>
            Those life-sustaining sons <lb/>
            Of Inachus, the Argive streams ;­ <lb/>
            nor let them tell us many other such falsehoods :-nor again, <lb/>
            let mothers, persuaded by them, terrify their children, telling <lb/>
            the stories wrong,-as, that certain gods wander by night, <lb/>
            Resembling various guests, in various forms,­ <note type="footnote"> * Odyss. xvii. v. 485, 6. </note> <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. c.21.] </note> <lb/>
            lest they should, at one and the same time, blaspheme <lb/>
            against the gods, and make their children cowards. Surely <lb/>
            not, said lie. But do the gods, said I, who in themselves <lb/>
            never change, still make us imagine that they appear in vari­ <lb/>
            ous forms, deceiving us, and playing the sorcerer ? Perhaps <lb/>
            they do, said he. What, said I;—can a god wish to deceive, <lb/>
            -holding up a mere phantom, either in word or deed ? <lb/>
            I know not, said he. Know you not, said I, that a real <lb/>
            falsehood (if we be allowed to say so), both all the gods and <lb/>
            men abhor ? How mean you ? replied he. Thus, said I : that <lb/>
            to be deceived in the most excellent part of oneself, and that <lb/>
            about one's highest interests, is what no one wishes of his <lb/>
            own accord ; but, of all things, every one is most afraid of this <lb/>
            happening to him. Even yet, said he, I do not understand you. <lb/>
            Because, said I, you think I am saying something awful :­ <lb/>
            but I am saying, that for the soul to be deceived with respect <lb/>
            to realities, and to be so deceived and ignorant, and in that to <lb/>
            have obtained and to maintain a falsehood, is what every one <lb/>
            would least of all choose; and would most hate it in the soul. <lb/>
            Most especially, said he. But this, as I was now saying, <lb/>
            might very correctly be termed a real falsehood-ignorance <lb/>
            in the soul of the deceived person; for imitation in words is <lb/>
            a kind of image of the affection the soul feels, and springs <lb/>
            up afterwards, and is not altogether a pure falsehood :-is it <lb/>
            not so ? Assuredly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—But a real falsehood is not only hated by <lb/>
            the gods, but also by men. It appears so to me. But what <lb/>
            as to a falsehood in words ? when is it of such service, so as <lb/>
            not to deserve hatred ?-Is it not when employed towards <lb/>
            enemies, and some even of those called friends,-when during <lb/>
            madness, or other folly, they attempt to do some mischief; <lb/>
            —in that case, is it not useful for dissuasion as a drug;—and <lb/>
            in the fables we just mentioned, because we know not how <lb/>
            the truth stands about ancient things, do we not forge a <lb/>
            falsehood resembling the truth as much as possible, and so <lb/>
            make it useful ? It certainly is so, said he. In which of <lb/>
            these cases, then, is a falsehood useful to God ?-Does he <lb/>
            invent a falsehood resembling the truth, because he is ignorant <lb/>
            of ancient things ? That were ridiculous, said he. In God, <lb/>
            then, there is not a lying poet ? I think not. But would he <lb/>
            invent a falsehood through fear of his enemies ? Far from it <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IT. C. 21. </note> <lb/>
            Or on account of the folly or madness of his friends ? No, <lb/>
            said he, none of the foolish and mad are beloved of God. <lb/>
            There is no occasion at all, then, for a god to invent a false­ <lb/>
            hood ? None. The divine and godlike nature, then, is alto­ <lb/>
            gether free from falsehood ? Entirely so, said he. God, then, <lb/>
            is quite simple and true, both in word and deed ; neither is he <lb/>
            changed himself, nor does he deceive others,—neither by <lb/>
            visions, nor discourse, nor the pomp of signs, neither when we <lb/>
            are awake nor when we sleep? So it appears to me, <lb/>
            said he, just as you say. You agree then, said I, that this <lb/>
            shall be the second principle which we are to lay down both <lb/>
            in speaking and composing concerning the gods,*—namely, <lb/>
            that they are neither sorcerers and change themselves, nor <lb/>
            mislead us by falsehoods, either in word or deed ? I agree. <lb/>
            While, then, we commend many other things- in Homer, this <lb/>
            we shall not commend,-namely, the dream sent by Jupiter <lb/>
            to Agamemnon; nor that in Æschylus, when he makes <lb/>
            Thetis say that Apollo had sung at her marriage, that <lb/>
            her happy lot should be <lb/>
            To bear an offspring fair, from ailment free, <lb/>
            And blest with lengthen’d days ; and then the God, <lb/>
            Unfolding all, with pæans high proclaim'd <lb/>
            Thy heaven-blest fortunes, welcome to my soul <lb/>
            I hoped that all was true that Phoebus sang 1 <lb/>
            So sweetly tuned with high prophetic art <lb/>
            But he who at my nuptials joy foretold, <lb/>
            The same is he, who now hath slain my child. <lb/>
            When any one alleges such things as these about the gods, we <lb/>
            must show disapproval, and not grant them the privilege <lb/>
            of a chorus ;neither should we suffer teachers to employ them <lb/>
            in the training of youth,-if at least our guardians are to be <lb/>
            pious and divine men, as far as man can be. As to all these <lb/>
            models, I entirely agree with you, said he, and I should adopt <lb/>
            them as laws. <figure type="illustration">

            as these are, it seems, to be both heard, and not heard, from <lb/>
            childhood upwards, by those who will honour the gods and <lb/>
            parents, and not lightly esteem mutual friendship. Aye,— <lb/>
            and methinks, said he, these things are rightly so under­ <lb/>
            stood. But what then ?-If men are to be brave, must <lb/>
            not these things be told them, and such others likewise, <lb/>
            as may make them least of all afraid of death; or, think <lb/>
            you, that any one can ever be brave, who has this fear within <lb/>
            him ? Not I, truly, said he. But what ? think you any one <lb/>
            can be free from the fear of death, while he conceives that <lb/>
            there is Hades-and a dreadful place, too,-and that in battles <lb/>
            he will choose death in preference to defeat and slavery ? <lb/>
            Surely not.</p>
          <p>We ought then, it seems, to take the command, also, of <lb/>
            those who undertake to discourse about these fables, and <lb/>
            entreat them not so sweepingly to abuse what is in Hades, <lb/>
            but rather to praise it;—since they neither speak what is true, <lb/>
            nor what is expedient for those who mean to be soldiers. We <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. c. 1. </note> <lb/>
            ought indeed, said lie. Beginning then, said I, at this verse, <lb/>
            we will omit all such as these :— <lb/>
            I had rather live <lb/>
            The servile hind for hire, and eat the bread <lb/>
            Of some man scantily, himself sustained, <lb/>
            Than sovereign empire hold o'er all the shades ;*— <lb/>
            And this- <lb/>
            Lest Neptune o'er his head <lb/>
            Shattering the vaulted earth, should wide disclose <lb/>
            To mortal and immortal eyes his realm <lb/>
            Terrible, squalid, to the gods themselves <lb/>
            A dreaded spectacle;- <lb/>
            And- <lb/>
            Oh, then, ye gods ! there doubtless are below, <lb/>
            The soul and semblance both, but empty forms ;†— <lb/>
            And- <lb/>
            He's wise alone, the rest are flutt'ring shades— <lb/>
            And- <lb/>
            Down into Hades from his limbs dismiss'd <lb/>
            His spirit fled sorrowful, of youth's prime <lb/>
            And vigorous manhood suddenly bereft ;§— <lb/>
            And- <lb/>
            His soul, like smoke, down to the shades <lb/>
            Fled howling|| <lb/>
            And- <lb/>
            As when the bats within some hallow'd cave <lb/>
            Flit screaming all around ; for if but one <lb/>
            Fall from the rock, the rest all follow him ; <lb/>
            In such connexion mutual they adhere ; <lb/>
            Sothe ghosts <lb/>
            Troop'd downward, gibbering all the dreary way.¶</p>
          <p>As to these and all such like passages, we must request <lb/>
            Homer and the other poets not to be offended at our erasing <lb/>
            them,-not as unpoetical and displeasing to the ears of the <lb/>
            multitude ;-for the more poetical they are, the less should they <lb/>
            be listened to by children, or men either, who would be free, <lb/>
            and fear slavery more than death. Aye, by all means. <note type="footnote"> * Odyss. xi. v. 488—91. </note><note type="footnote"> t II. xxiii. v. 103. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ II. xxii. v. 265. </note> <note type="footnote"> § II. xvi. v. 856. </note><note type="footnote"> |l II. xxii. v. 100. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Odyss. xxiv. v. 6. </note></p><pb n="67"/>

            also, about these things, to be rejected ;—Cocytus and Styx, the <lb/>
            Internals, the life-lorn, and many other appellations of this cha­ <lb/>
            racter, such as make all hearers shudder ?-and perhaps they <lb/>
            may well serve some other purpose ; but we fear for our guard­ <lb/>
            ians, lest by such terror they be made more effeminate and soft <lb/>
            than is fitting. We are in the right too, to be afraid of that, <lb/>
            said he. Are these then to be suppressed ? Yes. And must <lb/>
            they speak, then, and compose on a contrary model to these ? <lb/>
            Plainly so. And are we likewise to suppress the wailings and <lb/>
            lamentations of illustrious men ? We must, said he, if we do <lb/>
            the former. Consider then, said I, whether we shall suppress <lb/>
            them rightly or not ,-and do we say, that the virtuous man <lb/>
            to another virtuous man—whose friend he is-deems death <lb/>
            dreadful? We do. He would not then, at any rate, lament <lb/>
            over him, as if he had suffered something dreadful ? No, in­ <lb/>
            deed. And we say this likewise, that such an one is most of <lb/>
            all self-sustained as regards living happily, and distinctively <lb/>
            above all others, least in need of foreign aid. True, said <lb/>
            he. To him, then, it is least dreadful to be deprived of a son, <lb/>
            a brother, or property, or other like things? Aye, least of all <lb/>
            so. Least of all then will he lament, but rather endure with <lb/>
            the utmost meekness whatever trouble may befal him ? Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. We should be right then in suppressing the lamen­ <lb/>
            tations of famous men, and should assign them to women, <lb/>
            (and among these even not to the better sort), and to such <lb/>
            men as are cowards; in order that, as regards those whom we <lb/>
            propose to educate for the guardianship of the country, they <lb/>
            may disdain to act thus. Right, said he. Again, then, we <lb/>
            will entreat Homer and the rest of the poets not to say in their <lb/>
            compositions about Achilles, the son of a goddess, that <lb/>
            Now on his side he lay, now lay supine, <lb/>
            Now prone ; then starting from his couch he roam'd <lb/>
            Forlorn the beach..........* <lb/>
            Nor how­ <lb/>
            ........ grasping with both hands the ashes, <lb/>
            Down he pour'd them burning on his head.... t <lb/>
            Nor the rest of his lamentation and wailing,-of whatever <note type="footnote"> * II. xxiv. v. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> f II. xviii. v. 23, 24. </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <pb n="68"/>

            kind and quantity he made them ;-nor Priam, near as he <lb/>
            was to the gods, who-­ <lb/>
            to all—kneel’d <lb/>
            In turn, then roll'd himself in dust, and each <lb/>
            By name solicited to give him way.*</p>
          <p>Still much more must we entreat them not to represent the <lb/>
            gods as bewailing, and saying, <lb/>
            Ah me, forlorn ! ah me, parent in vain <lb/>
            Of an illustrious birth.t</p>
          <p>And if they are not thus to introduce the gods, far less <lb/>
            should they dare thus unbecomingly to represent the greatest <lb/>
            of those gods : <lb/>
            Ah ! I behold a warrior dear to me, <lb/>
            Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve <lb/>
            For Hector ,- <lb/>
            And again,— <lb/>
            Alas, he falls ! my most beloved of men, <lb/>
            Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls : <lb/>
            So will the Fates! ‡</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Supposing then, friend Adimantus, our youths <lb/>
            should seriously hear such things as these, and not ridicule <lb/>
            them as spoken unworthily,—hardly any one would think it <lb/>
            unworthy of himself as a man, or reprove himself [for it,] <lb/>
            if he should chance either to say or do anything of the <lb/>
            kind,-but would rather, without shame or endurance, sing <lb/>
            many lamentations and moanings over trifling sufferings. You <lb/>
            speak most truly, replied he. But they must not,-as our <lb/>
            argument has just evinced; which we must believe, till <lb/>
            some one persuades us by some better. They must not, of <lb/>
            course. Neither ought we, moreover, to be over fond of <lb/>
            laughing :-for commonly where a man gives himself to vio­ <lb/>
            lent laughter, such a disposition requires a violent change. I <lb/>
            think so, said he. Neither, if any one should represent worthy <lb/>
            men as overcome by laughter, should we allow it, much less <lb/>
            if [he thus represent] the gods. Much, indeed, said he. <lb/>
            Neither, then, ought we to receive such statements as these <lb/>
            of Homer concerning the gods:- <lb/>
            Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable-— <lb/>
            Peal after peal, such pleasure all conceived <lb/>
            At sight of Vulcan in his new employ.§ <note type="footnote"> * 11. xxii. v. 414. </note><note type="footnote">t II. xviii. v. 54. </note><note type="footnote">‡ II. xxii. v. 163. </note><note type="footnote"> § Namely as cupbearer to the gods.—II. i. v. 599. </note> <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. C. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            This cannot be admitted, according to your reasoning. If you <lb/>
            please to call it my reasoning, said he,-this, indeed, cannot <lb/>
            be admitted. Besides this, however, the truth must be held <lb/>
            ofgreat importance :-for if we just now argued rightly,* and <lb/>
            falsehood be really of no service to the gods, but useful to men, <lb/>
            in the form of a drug, it is plain that such a thing should be <lb/>
            trusted only to physicians, but not meddled with by private <lb/>
            persons. Quite plain, said he. To the governors of the state, <lb/>
            then, if to any, it especially belongs to speak falsely either about <lb/>
            enemies or citizens, for the good of the state; whereas, for all <lb/>
            the rest, they must venture on no such a thing. For a private <lb/>
            person moreover, to speak falsely against such governors, we <lb/>
            shall deem the same and 'even a greater offence, than for a <lb/>
            patient not to speak the truth to his physician, or for one who <lb/>
            is learning his exercises to his gymnastic master about the ail­ <lb/>
            ments of his body,-or for one not to tell the pilot the real state <lb/>
            of what concerns the ship and sailors, how himself and the <lb/>
            other sailors are performing their duty. Most true, said he. <lb/>
            If, however, he should detect any other citizen in a falsehood­ <lb/>
            ........ of those, who by profession serve <lb/>
            The public, prophet, healer of disease, <lb/>
            Or him who makes the shafts of spears,t <lb/>
            he will punish him, as introducing a practice subversive <lb/>
            and destructive of the city, as well as of a ship. If, at <lb/>
            least, it is on speech that actions are completed.‡ But <lb/>
            what willour youths have no need of temperance ? Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. And are not such as these in general the principal <lb/>
            parts of temperance; namely, obedience to governors,-and <lb/>
            also, that the governors themselves be temperate in drinking, <lb/>
            feasting, and pleasures of love? I am quite of that opinion. <lb/>
            And we shall say, I believe, that such views are just,—just as <lb/>
            in Homer Diomedes says : <lb/>
            Sit thou in silence, and obey my speech, <lb/>
            and what is in connexion therewith,-thus : <lb/>
            So moved the Greeks successive, ev'ry chief <lb/>
            His loud command proclaiming, while the rest, <lb/>
            As voice in all those thousands none had been, <lb/>

              and so on. Well spoken. But what of such as these ?— <lb/>
              Oh ! charged with wine, in steadfastness of face <lb/>
              Dog unabash'd, and yet at heart a deer,*— <lb/>
              and as respects what follows, and whatever other childish effu­ <lb/>
              sions are uttered in prose or verse by private individuals, are <lb/>
              they well [pronounced] ? No, not well:—for, methinks, even <lb/>
              as respects temperance, such [discourses] are not fit for the <lb/>
              young to hear; and supposing they do afford some other sort <lb/>
              of pleasure, it is no wonder:—but what is your notion of the <lb/>
              matter ? The same as your own, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—What ?-To make the wisest man say, that <lb/>
            it appears to him supremely beautiful, when <lb/>
            the steaming table's spread <lb/>
            With plenteous viands, while the cups, with wine <lb/>
            From brimming beakers fill’d, pass brisk around,t- <lb/>
            does it seem proper to you that a youth should hear, in order <lb/>
            to obtain a command over himself ;-or yet this :— <lb/>
            ........most miserable it is, <lb/>
            To die of famine and have adverse fate — <lb/>
            or that Zeus, through desire for the pleasures of love, could <lb/>
            easily forget all that in solitary watching he had revolved <lb/>
            in his mind, while other gods and men were asleep, and could <lb/>
            be so struck on seeing Hera, as not even to care to enter his <lb/>
            chamber, but to desire connexion with her on the very spot, to <lb/>
            embrace her on the ground, and at the same time to declare <lb/>
            that he was possessed with a desire, exceeding even what he <lb/>
            felt on their first acquaintance, <lb/>
            ............ Hidden from their parents dear ;§— <lb/>
            nor yet how Ares and Aphrodite were bound by Hephæstus,|| <lb/>
            and other such things ? No, by Zeus, said he ; these seem quite <lb/>
            unfit. But if, said I, any instances of self-denial in all <lb/>
            matters are both to be spoken of and practised by men of <lb/>
            eminence, these should be held up for a spectacle and cele­ <lb/>
            brated in verse,-such as this :¶— <lb/>
            ........ Smiting on his breast, thus he reproved <lb/>
            The mutinous inhabitant within.** <note type="footnote"> * II. i. v. 225. </note><note type="footnote">t Od. ix. v. 8. </note><note type="footnote">‡Od. xi. v. 342. </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> S II. xiv. v. 291. </note><note type="footnote">|| Od. viii. v. 266. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεατέον τε καὶ άκουστέον</foreign>, which we have somewhat paraphrastically <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. III. c. 4 J </note> <lb/>
            Just so, by all means, said he. Of course, then, we cannot by <lb/>
            any means allow men to receive bribes, or be covetous. By <lb/>
            no means. Neither must we sing to them, that <lb/>
            Gifts gain the gods and venerable kings <lb/>
            neither can we commend Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, as <lb/>
            if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of pre­ <lb/>
            sents and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to <lb/>
            desist from his wrath: †—nor again, should we commend <lb/>
            Achilles himself, or approve of his being so covetous as to <lb/>
            receive presents from Agamemnon, and, likewise for giving up <lb/>
            the dead body of Hector, on receiving a ransom, when other­ <lb/>
            wise he would not do so. Of course it is not right, said he, <lb/>
            to commend such conduct as this. I am loath, said I, for <lb/>
            Homer's sake, to say, that it is not allowable to allege these <lb/>
            things against Achilles, or to believe them, when said by <lb/>
            others; nor, again, that he spoke thus to Apollo :— <lb/>
            Oh ! of all the powers above, <lb/>
            To me most adverse, archer of the skies ! <lb/>
            Thou hast beguiled me, leading me away... <lb/>
            And hast defrauded me of great renown. <lb/>
            Ah ! had I power, I would requite thee well,‡— <lb/>
            and how he disobeyed the river [Xanthus,] though a <lb/>
            divinity, and was ready to fight; and again, how he says <lb/>
            to that other river, Spercheius, with his sacred locks, <lb/>
            Thy lock to great Patroclus I could give, <lb/>
            Who now is dead.. § <lb/>
            Now, that he actually did this, we cannot believe. And <lb/>
            again, the dragging of Hector round the tomb of Patroclus, <lb/>
            and the murder of the captives at his funeral pile,—we shall <lb/>
            deny that all this is spoken truly; nor shall we suffer our <lb/>
            people to believe, that Achilles, the son of a goddess, and of <lb/>
            Peleus, the most wise of men, and the third from Jupiter, edu­ <lb/>
            cated also by that sage Chiron, could be of so disordered a con­ <lb/>

            as we said before, these [statements] are neither holy nor true ; <lb/>
            inasmuch as we have somewhere or other shown, that evils <lb/>
            cannot possibly proceed from the gods. Of course not. But, <lb/>
            besides this, they are hurtful to the hearers also; for every <lb/>
            one will pardon his own depravity, through the persuasion that <lb/>
            even the near relatives of the gods, near to Zeus himself, do, <lb/>
            and have done, things of a similar nature, of whom it has <lb/>
            been written,- <lb/>
            They, on the top of Ida, have uprear'd <lb/>
            To parent Jupiter an altar;- <lb/>
            And, <lb/>
            Whose blood derived from gods is not extinct. <lb/>
            Wherefore, we should suppress all such fables, lest they <lb/>
            create in our youth a great readiness for committing wick­ <lb/>
            edness. We should so, of course, replied he. What other <lb/>
            species of argument, then, said I,—since we are .speaking <lb/>
            about arguments,-have we still remaining, which ought, or <lb/>
            ought not, to be maintained?—For in what manner we ought <lb/>
            to speak of the gods we have already mentioned, and likewise <lb/>
            of demons and heroes, and those too in Hades. Certainly. Does <lb/>
            it not remain, then, to speak concerning men ? Clearly so. Still <lb/>
            it is impossible for us, my friend, to regulate this at present. <lb/>
            How ? Because we shall say, I think, that the poets and <lb/>
            orators speak amiss in most important respects concerning <lb/>
            mankind, as [for instance,] that many are unjust, and yet <lb/>
            happy, while the just are miserable ; and that injustice is profit­ <lb/>
            able, if it escape observation, while justice is another's gain <lb/>
            indeed, but injury to one's self; such things, as these, we must <lb/>
            forbid them to say, but yet bid them sing and compose in fable <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. in. C. 6. ] </note> <lb/>
            the very contrary. Do you not think so ? I know it well, said <lb/>
            he. If then you acknowledge that I am right, shall I conclude <lb/>
            that you have admitted what all along we were seeking for ? <lb/>
            You judge right, said he. Shall we not allow, then, that such <lb/>
            arguments may be stated about men, whenever we shall have <lb/>
            discovered the nature of justice,-and how it is naturally <lb/>
            profitable for the just man to be such, whether he seem so or <lb/>
            not ? Most true, replied he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Concerning the arguments, then, let what <lb/>
            we have said suffice, and now we should consider, me­ <lb/>
            thinks, the manner of stating them ; and then we shall have <lb/>
            completely considered, both what is to be spoken, and the <lb/>
            manner how. Adimantus here said ;- What you now say, I do <lb/>
            not understand. Nevertheless, replied I, it needs you should. <lb/>
            -Perhaps then you will understand it better in this way :-is <lb/>
            not everything told by the mythologists or poets, a narrative <lb/>
            of the past, present, or future ?* Of course, replied he. <lb/>
            And do not they execute it, either in simple narrative, or <lb/>
            through the medium of imitation, or both ? This too, re­ <lb/>
            plied he, I yet require to understand more plainly. I appear, <lb/>
            said I, to be a ridiculous and dull instructor :-like those, <lb/>
            then, who are unable to speak, I will endeavour to explain <lb/>
            my meaning,-not the whole generally, but by a particular <lb/>
            case. And tell me,—are you acquainted with the opening of <lb/>
            the Iliad, where the poet says, Chryses entreated Agamemnon <lb/>
            to ransom his daughter; but that he was angry, whereupon <lb/>
            the former, since he did not obtain his request, besought the <lb/>
            god, against the Greeks ? I know it. You know, then, that <lb/>
            down to these verses,- <lb/>
            His supplication was at large to all <lb/>
            The host of Greece; but most of all to two, <lb/>
            The sons of Atreus, highest in command,­ <lb/>
            the poet himself speaks, and does not attempt to divert ouratten­ <lb/>
            tion elsewhere, as if any other person were speaking except <lb/>
            himself; but as to what he says after this, he speaks as though <lb/>
            he himself were Chryses, and tries all he can to make us think <lb/>
            that the speaker is not Homer, but the priest, an old man:—and <lb/>
            thus he has composed nearly all the rest of the narrative of <lb/>
            what happened at Troy, and in Ithaca, and the adventures <note type="footnote"> * This threefold distinction of poetry is mentioned likewise by Aristotle; <lb/>
            Poet. ch. iii. § 2. </note> <pb n="74"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. c. 6. </note> <lb/>
            throughout the Odyssey. Yes, certainly, replied he. Is it <lb/>
            not narrative, then, when he recites the several speeches, and <lb/>
            also when [he recites] what intervenes between the speeches ? <lb/>
            Of course. But when he speaks in the person of another, do <lb/>
            we not say, that then he assimilates his speech as much as <lb/>
            possible to each person whom he introduces as speaking ? <lb/>
            We will grant it ;-why not ? And is not [a poet's] assi­ <lb/>
            milation of himself to another, either in voice or figure, an <lb/>
            imitation of that person to whom he assimilates himself ? Of <lb/>
            course. In such a case as this, then, it seems, both he and the <lb/>
            other poets execute their narrative by means of imitation ? <lb/>
            Certainly. But if the poet were not to conceal himself <lb/>
            at all, his whole action and narrative would be without imita­ <lb/>
            tion.—That you may not say, however, that you do not again <lb/>
            understand how this can be, I will tell you.—If, for instance, <lb/>
            in relating how Chryses came with his daughter's ransom, be­ <lb/>
            seeching the Greeks, but chiefly the kings, Homer had subse­ <lb/>
            quently spoken, not in the character of Chryses, but still as <lb/>
            Homer, you know it would not be imitation, but only simple <lb/>
            narrative :-and it would have been somehow thus (I shall <lb/>
            speak without metre, for I am no poet) :—" The priest came <lb/>
            and prayed, that the gods would allow them to take Troy, <lb/>
            and return in safety; and begged them also to restore him his <lb/>
            daughter, and accept the presents, out of respect to the god. <lb/>
            When he had said this, all the rest showed respect, and con­ <lb/>
            sented ; but Agamemnon became enraged, and charged him <lb/>
            to depart instantly, and not return, lest his sceptre and the <lb/>
            garlands of the god should not avail him, and added also, <lb/>
            that, before his daughter should be ransomed she should grow <lb/>
            old with him in Argos; and he ordered him to be gone, and <lb/>
            not irritate him, if he would get home in safety. The old man <lb/>
            on hearing this was terrified and went away in silence. And <lb/>
            after his retiring from the camp he offered numerous prayers <lb/>
            to Apollo, calling on the god by his various names, and re­ <lb/>
            minding as well as imploring him, that, if ever, either in the <lb/>
            building of temples, or the offering of sacrifices, he had made <lb/>
            any acceptable presents,-for the sake of these then, he be­ <lb/>
            sought him, to avenge with his shafts on the Greeks the tears <lb/>
            [that had been shed] by himself.”*—Thus far, said I, friend, tho <lb/>
            narrative is simple, without imitation. I understand, said he. <note type="footnote"> * The Greek form—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάκρυα</foreign> is unquestionably archaic; but. </note></p><pb n="75"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> B. III. C. 7.] </note> CHAP. VII.—Understand, then, said I, that the oppo­ <lb/>
            site of this happens, when one takes out the poet's words be­ <lb/>
            tween the speeches, and leaves only the dialogue. This too, <lb/>
            said he, I understand, that something like this takes place with <lb/>
            tragedies. You have apprehended my meaning quite correctly, <lb/>
            said I. And methinks, I can now make plain to you what <lb/>
            before I could not,-that in poetry, and all fabulous writing, <lb/>
            one species of it is wholly imitative, as, for instance (just as <lb/>
            you say), tragedy and comedy; another species employs the <lb/>
            narration of the poet himself, (you will find this chiefly in dithy­ <lb/>
            rambics;) and another again by both, as in epic poetry, and <lb/>
            many other kinds besides :—if you understand me. Aye,—I <lb/>
            now understand, replied he, what you meant before. Remem­ <lb/>
            ber, too, that we were before saying, that it had already <lb/>
            been settled what were to be the subjects of speech, but it yet <lb/>
            remained to be considered how they should be spoken. <lb/>
            I do remember. This then, is the very thing that I was <lb/>
            saying,-namely, that we ought to have agreed, whether we <lb/>
            will allow the poets to make us narratives wholly through the <lb/>
            medium of imitation, or partly through imitation, partly not <lb/>
            so,-and, of what kind in each,-or lastly whether they are not <lb/>
            to employ imitation at all. I guess, said he, you are inquiring, <lb/>
            whether we are to receive tragedy and comedy into our state, <lb/>
            or not. Perhaps so, said I, and something more too,-for I as <lb/>
            yet know not; but wherever our reason, wind-like, carries us, <lb/>
            there must we go. You say well, said he. Let us then consider, <lb/>
            Adimantus, whether our guardians ought to be practised imi­ <lb/>
            tators or not:—does not this follow, from what has been above <lb/>
            stated, that each may exercise one business well, but many, <lb/>
            not,-and should he attempt it, that, in grasping at many things, <lb/>
            he will fail in all, and excel, perhaps, in none ?* Of course he <lb/>
            will. Well then, does not the same reasoning apply to imitation, <lb/>
            that the same man cannot so well imitate many things as one ? <lb/>
            Of course he cannot. In that case he can perform scarcely <lb/>
            any of the more eminent employments, and at the same time <lb/>
            imitate many things, and be an apt imitator,—since the same <lb/>
            persons cannot well execute two different sorts of imitations, <lb/>
            apparently similar to each other; as, for instance, comedy <note type="footnote"> as Stallbaum well observes, was still extant among the Athenians in col­ <lb/>
            loquial language. </note><note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥστ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναι ἐλλόγιμος</foreign>. </note> <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. c. 8. </note> <lb/>
            and tragedy :-and as for that, did you not, just now, rail both <lb/>
            of these imitations ? I did ; and you are right in saying, that <lb/>
            the same persons cannot succeed [in both]. Nor can they, at the <lb/>
            same time, be rhapsodists and actors ? True. Nor can the same <lb/>
            persons be actors in comedies and in tragedies :-and all <lb/>
            these are imitations, are they not ? Aye,—surely. The <lb/>
            genius of man, Adimantus, seems to have been cut up even <lb/>
            into a still greater number of minute particles,-so much so, <lb/>
            indeed,* that it cannot properly imitate many things, or per­ <lb/>
            form [in earnest] those very things, of which even the <lb/>
            imitations are the resemblances. Most true, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—If we are to hold to our first reasoning, <lb/>
            therefore, that our guardians, though unoccupied in any pro­ <lb/>
            ductive art whatever, ought to be the most skilful labourers <lb/>
            for the liberty of the state, and to mind nothing but what <lb/>
            refers thereto, it were surely proper that they should neither <lb/>
            perform nor imitate anything else,-but, should they imitate <lb/>
            at all, to imitate from their childhood upwards just what <lb/>
            correspond with these,-brave, temperate, pious, generous- <lb/>
            hearted men, and the like;—but neither to perform, nor de­ <lb/>
            sire to imitate what is illiberal or base, lest from the very <lb/>
            imitation they come to experience the positive reality.t Have <lb/>
            you net also observed, that imitations, if from earliest <lb/>
            youth onwards they be long continued, become established in <lb/>
            the manners and natural temper, both as to body and voice, <lb/>
            and intellect too ? Very much so, replied he. Surely we <lb/>
            are not to allow those, said I, for whom we profess to be <lb/>
            anxious, and who ought to be good men, to imitate a woman <lb/>
            either young or old, whether reviling her husband, or con­ <lb/>
            tending against the gods, and speaking boastingly from the <lb/>
            idea of her own happiness;—neither should we imitate her in <lb/>
            her misfortunes, sorrows, and lamentations, when sick, or in <lb/>
            love, or in the throes of child-birth; we shall be far from <lb/>
            allowing this. By all means, replied he. Nor to imitate <lb/>
            male or female servants in doing servante' duties? Nor this <lb/>
            either. Nor yet, it seems, depraved men, dastards, and those <lb/>
            who do the contrary of what has been just mentioned, who <lb/>
            revile and rail at one another; and speak abominable things, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig14.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="77"/>
              <note type="margin"> B. III. C. 9.] </note> <lb/>
              whether drunk or sober, or [do] any other misdeeds, such as <lb/>
              this class of persons are guilty of, either in words or actions, <lb/>
              either as respects themselves or others ?—I think too, that <lb/>
              they should not even accustom themselves to resemble mad­ <lb/>
              men, in words or actions, for one may know both the mad <lb/>
              and wicked, whether men or women ;—yet we must not either <lb/>
              do or imitate any one of their actions. Most true, said he. <lb/>
              But what, said I ;—are braziers or other craftsmen, or such as <lb/>
              row vessels, or pilot the sailors, or any others connected <lb/>
              therewith to be imitated ? How can it be so, said he, by those <lb/>
              at least who are not allowed to give their mind up to those <lb/>
              pursuits ? But what,-are they to imitate horses neighing, <lb/>
              or bulls lowing, or rivers murmuring, or the sea roaring, or <lb/>
              thunder, and all such like things ? No surely, said he :—we <lb/>
              have forbidden them either to get mad, or resemble madmen. <lb/>
              If then I understand what you mean, replied I, there is a sort of <lb/>
              speech and narrative in which the truly good and worthy man <lb/>
              expresses himself, when required to say anything,-and ano­ <lb/>
              ther again quite dissimilar, to which a person quite oppositely <lb/>
              born and bred always adheres, and in which [he always] ex­ <lb/>
              presses himself. But what sorts are they ? asked he. That <lb/>
              man, said I, seems a worthy man, who on coming in his <lb/>
              narrative to any speech or action of a good man, will willingly <lb/>
              tell it, as if he were himself the man, and not be ashamed of <lb/>
              such an imitation,-the more especially, if he be imitating a <lb/>
              good man acting cautiously and sensibly, one who is seldom <lb/>
              and but little led astray through ailments, or love, or drink, or <lb/>
              any other mishap. But when there arises [in his narra­ <lb/>
              tive] anything unworthy of himself, he will not be in any <lb/>
              hurry to assimilate himself to one that is worse, except it be <lb/>
              for a short time when he is doing some good; and be­ <lb/>
              sides, he will be ashamed of it, both as being unpractised in <lb/>
              the imitation of such characters, and also, as unwilling to <lb/>
              mould himself, and stand among the models of baser men, <lb/>
              whom all the while he despises in his heart, [bearing with <lb/>
              them] only for mere amusement. Probably, said lie.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—Will he employ a narrative such as that we not <lb/>
            long since described in the case of Homer's poems; and will his <lb/>
            language partake both of imitation and simple narrative, but <lb/>
            have only a small portion of imitation inserted in a great quan­ <lb/>
            tity [of plain narrative ?]—Do you think I speak to the pur- <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. c. 9. </note> <lb/>
            pose or not? Yes, certainly, replied he; that must needs be the <lb/>
            type of such an orator. In that case, said I, will not such a <lb/>
            man, the more he is depraved, the more readily narrate any <lb/>
            matter whatever, thinking nothing unworthy of him,—so much <lb/>
            so, indeed, that he will undertake to imitate everything zealously <lb/>
            and in public, and such especially as we just mentioned, <lb/>
            thunderings and noises of winds and tempests, and of axles <lb/>
            and wheels, and of trumpets, pipes, whistles, and sounds of <lb/>
            all kinds of instruments, and the cries of dogs likewise, and <lb/>
            sheep, and birds ?-and of course the whole expression of this <lb/>
            is to be by imitation, both in voice and gestures, partaking <lb/>
            but slightly of narrative. This too, said he, is a matter of <lb/>
            course. These, said I, are what I termed the two kinds of <lb/>
            diction. Yes, they are, replied he. Has not one of the two, <lb/>
            then, very trifling variations; and to give the diction a be­ <lb/>
            coming harmony and rhythm, he who would speak correctly <lb/>
            must always speak in the same style, in one harmony,-for the <lb/>
            variations are but trifling,—and of course in a rhythm closely <lb/>
            corresponding ?* It is so, clearly, replied he. But as to the <lb/>
            other kind, does it not require the contrary,-all kinds of liar­ <lb/>
            monies, and all kinds of rhythms, if, indeed, it is to be natu­ <lb/>
            rally expressed, on account of its having all sorts and shades <lb/>
            of variation ? That is precisely the case. Do not, then, all the <lb/>
            poets, and writers of narrative generally, † use one or other of <lb/>
            these models of diction, or a blending of the other two ? They <lb/>
            must, replied he. What are we to do then, said I :—shall we <lb/>
            admit into our state all of these [models,] or only one of the <lb/>
            unmixed, or the one compounded ? If my opinion, replied <lb/>
            he, is to prevail, [you should employ] that uncompounded <lb/>
            one, which imitates only what is worthy. But surely, Adi­ <lb/>
            mantus, the mixed is at least pleasant:—the most pleasant <lb/>
            of all, both to children and pedagogues, is the opposite or <lb/>
            what you choose, and it is so to the crowd likewise. Yes, it <lb/>
            is the most pleasant. But probably, said I, you will not <lb/>
            deem it suited to our civil establishment, because with us <lb/>
            no man can be engaged in two or more occupations, but <lb/>
            each individual is employed in one only ? Of course, it is not <lb/>
            fit. Shall we not find then, that in such a state alone, a shoe­ <lb/>
            maker is only a shoemaker, and not a pilot as well as a shoe- <figure type="illustration">

              not a judge as well as a husbandman ; and that the soldier is a <lb/>
              soldier, and not a money-maker as well; and so with the rest? <lb/>
              True, replied he. With respect to the man then, who is <lb/>
              enabled by his talents to become everything and imitate <lb/>
              everything, if that person were to come into our state and <lb/>
              wish to show us his poems, we should respect him as a pious, <lb/>
              wonderful, and pleasant person, but would say that we have <lb/>
              no such person in our state, nor could such be allowed; <lb/>
              and then we should send him to some other state, pouring <lb/>
              oil on his head, and crowning him with a woollen chaplet,* <lb/>
              while we ourselves would call in, to our advantage, a <lb/>
              more austere and less pleasing poet and mythologist, to <lb/>
              imitate for us the diction of what is becoming, and say what­ <lb/>
              ever he says, in accordance with those models which we <lb/>
              regularly set forth on first undertaking the education of our <lb/>
              soldiers. So we should do, replied he, if it depended on us. <lb/>
              Now then, friend, it seems that we have thoroughly discussed <lb/>
              that part of music which concerns oratory and fable ; for what <lb/>
              is to be spoken, and how spoken, we have already considered. <lb/>
              I think so too, observed he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Are we not next to speak, said I, about the style <lb/>
            of song and melody?t Clearly so. Cannot one already find <lb/>
            out, then, what we ought to say about these things, and of <lb/>
            what kind they should be, if we would be consistent with <lb/>
            what we have above said ? Here Glaucon, smiling, said,- <lb/>
            I seem, indeed, Socrates, to be a stranger to the whole busi­ <lb/>

              though I have some inkling. You can, surely, said I, at any <lb/>
              rate, fully state this much,-that melody has three constituents, <lb/>
              -sentiment, harmony, and rhythm ?* Yes, replied he, this <lb/>
              much, at any rate. And as concerns the sentiment,-that <lb/>
              differs in nothing from the sentiment which is not sung, inas­ <lb/>
              much as it ought to be performed on the same models, as we <lb/>
              just said, and after the same fashion. True, said he. Surely, <lb/>
              then, the harmony and rhythm should correspond with the <lb/>
              sentiment ? Of course. But yet we said there was no need <lb/>
              for wailings and lamentations in written compositions ? None, <lb/>
              certainly. Which then are the querulous harmonies ?† Tell <lb/>
              me,—for you are a musician. The mixed Lydian,‡ replied he, <lb/>
              and the sharp Lydian, and some others of this kind. Are <lb/>
              not these, then, said I, to be rejected, as being useless even <lb/>
              to well-conducted women, not to speak of men ? Certainly. <lb/>
              Drunkenness, moreover, is highly unbecoming in our guar­ <lb/>
              dians, as well as effeminacy and idleness ? Of course. Which <lb/>
              then are the effeminate and convivial harmonies ? The Ionic, <lb/>
              replied he, and the Lydian, which are called relaxing. Can <lb/>
              you use these, my friend, for military men ? By no means, <lb/>
              replied he; but it seems you have yet the Doric remaining, <lb/>
              and the Phrygian. I am not learned, said I, in harmonies; <lb/>
              but let us put out of the question that harmony, which would <lb/>
              fitly imitate the voice and accents of a brave man, engaged <lb/>
              in military action, and every sort of rough adventure, and, <lb/>
              should he fail of success, rushing on wounds or death, or <lb/>
              any other distress, all the while regularly and resolutely <lb/>
              battling with fortune:—let us put out of the question, <lb/>
              also, that kind of harmony which suits what is peace­ <lb/>
              able, where there is no violence, but everything is <lb/>

              moderately, gladly embracing whatever may happen :-put out <lb/>
              of the question, too, these two harmonies, the vehement and <lb/>
              the voluntary,* which so capitally imitate the voice both of <lb/>
              the unfortunate and fortunate,-the moderate and brave. <lb/>
              Aye, you are anxious, replied he, to leave no others but those <lb/>
              I now mentioned. We shall have no need, then, said I, in our <lb/>
              songs and melodies, for many strings or instruments expressive <lb/>
              of all the harmonies. We shall not, it seems, replied he. We <lb/>
              are not to maintain, then, such craftsmen, as make harps and <lb/>
              spinets, and instruments of many strings that produce a variety <lb/>
              of harmony. We are not, it seems. But what,-will you <lb/>
              admit into your city flute-makers or flute-players ? for, are <lb/>
              not those instruments which consist of the greatest number <lb/>
              of strings, t and those that produce all kinds of harmony, <lb/>
              imitations of the flute ? Plainly so, replied he. There <lb/>
              are still left you, then, said I, the lyre and the harp, as <lb/>
              useful for your city; and, as respects the fields again, a <lb/>
              reed or so for the shepherds? This is quite reasonable, <lb/>
              said he. We are doing nothing new then, replied I, in <lb/>
              preferring Apollo and Apollo's instruments, to Marsyast and <lb/>
              his instruments. Truly not, it seems, replied he. By the <lb/>
              do,,, too, said I, we have been once more unconsciously cleans­ <lb/>
              ing our city, which, we just now said, had become luxurious. <lb/>

            remainder; for what concerns rhythm will follow after bar­ <lb/>
            monies,-namely, that our citizens pursue not ever-varying <lb/>
            rhythms having a variety of cadences, but observe what are <lb/>
            the rhythms of an orderly and manly life ; and observing <lb/>
            these, should compel the time and the melody to subserve the <lb/>
            sentiment, and not the sentiment to subserve the time and <lb/>
            melody.—Now, what these rhythms are, it is your busi­ <lb/>
            ness to tell, as you did with the harmonies. Nay, by <lb/>
            Zeus, replied he, I cannot tell :-so far, indeed, as that <lb/>
            there are three forms from which all measures are com­ <lb/>
            posed, just as there are four primitive sounds, from which <lb/>
            all harmony is derived, this I can say from observation; <lb/>
            but what kind of imitations they are, and of what kind of <lb/>
            life, I am not able to tell. These things, however, said I, with <lb/>
            Damon's* aid we will consider,—what measures suit illiberality <lb/>
            and insolence, or madness and any other ill disposition,and <lb/>
            what rhythms also must be left for their opposites. And I <lb/>
            have a confused recollection of having heard him call a certain <lb/>
            [measure] enoplion, which was compound, another a dactyl, <lb/>
            and a third an heroic measure,—embellishing them I know <lb/>
            not how,-making them equal above and below, in breadth and <lb/>
            length : and methinks he called one an iambus, and another <lb/>
            a trochee, and regulated also the long and short measures. <lb/>
            In some of these, too, I fancy, he both blamed and praised <lb/>
            the measure of the foot, no less than the numbers themselves, <lb/>
            or something compounded of both. As for these matters, <lb/>
            however, as I said, let them be thrown on Damon: for to <lb/>
            define them distinctly, indeed, would require no small dis­ <lb/>
            course : do not you think so ? No small one, truly. But <lb/>
            as for this point,- whether the propriety or impropriety is <lb/>
            dependent on the good or ill rhythm,—can you at all discern <lb/>
            that? Of course. Moreover, with respect to good or ill <lb/>
            rhythm, the one depends on elegant expression, and conforms <lb/>
            to it, while the other is the reverse; and, in the same way, <lb/>
            as to the harmonious and discordant, the rhythm and harmony <lb/>
            being subservient to the sentiment, as we just said, and not <lb/>
            the sentiment to the former. These, indeed, said he, should <lb/>
            subserve the sentiment. And what, said I, as to the manner <note type="footnote"> * A celebrated musician who instructed Pericles in that art. Camp. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. III. c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            of expression, and as to the sentiment itself, must it not be <lb/>
            suited to the temper of the soul ? Of course. And all the <lb/>
            rest to the expression ? Yes. Well then, fine expression, <lb/>
            fine harmony, perfect propriety, and perfect rhythm, are de­ <lb/>
            pendent on good disposition,-not that dulness which in <lb/>
            flattering language we call good temper, but the intellect <lb/>
            itself, adorned with excellent and amiable moral feelings ? <lb/>
            Surely, altogether so, replied he. Must not all these then be <lb/>
            always pursued by the youth, if they would perform their <lb/>
            duties ? They should, iudeed, be so pursued. Painting, <lb/>
            indeed, is, somehow, full of these things, and so is every other <lb/>
            such kind of craftsmanship ; and weaving, too, is full thereof, <lb/>
            and embroidery and architecture, and all craftship of all kinds <lb/>
            of implements; and yet further, the nature of animal bodies <lb/>
            and of all plants,-for in all these is found either pro­ <lb/>
            priety or impropriety: and moreover, impropriety, want of <lb/>
            rhythm, and want of harmony, are close akin to bad language <lb/>
            and depraved manners,-their opposites being likewise related, <lb/>
            and imitations of discretion and good morals. Entirely so, <lb/>
            replied he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Must we, then, merely superintend the poets, <lb/>
            and oblige them to present in their poems the idea of good <lb/>
            morals, or else not write at all with us ;-or should we super­ <lb/>
            intend all other craftsmen also, and restrain this immoral, un­ <lb/>
            disciplined, illiberal, indecent style, so as not to exhibit it <lb/>
            either in the representation of animals, or in buildings, or in any <lb/>
            other craftsmanship,-so that he who cannot do this may not <lb/>
            be suffered to work with us ?-[This we must do,] for fear <lb/>
            that our guardians, being trained by images of evil, as in <lb/>
            bad pasture-land, by every day plucking and eating many <lb/>
            different things, should establish imperceptibly, by little and <lb/>
            little, some mighty evil in their soul ;-but rather should we <lb/>
            seek for such craftsmen, as, by the help of a good natural <lb/>
            genius, can investigate the nature of the beautiful and be­ <lb/>
            coming,-in order that our youths, dwelling, as it were, in a <lb/>
            healthful place, may receive advantage on all sides, and <lb/>
            so receive some service, either by sight or hearing, from <lb/>
            fine productions, just as a breeze brings health from <lb/>
            healthy places, and imperceptibly lead them from child­ <lb/>
            hood onwards to resemblance, friendship, and harmony with <lb/>
            right reason. Thus indeed, said he, they would be brought up <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B III. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
            in the best possible manner. In this case, then, Glaucon, said <lb/>
            I;—is not musical training of the utmost importance, inasmuch <lb/>
            as rhythm and harmony enter largely into the inward part of <lb/>
            the soul, and most powerfully affect it, at the same time <lb/>
            introducing decorum, and rendering every one becoming, if <lb/>
            properly trained, and, if not so, the reverse ?-Moreover, <lb/>
            the man, who has thus been brought up as he ought, very soon <lb/>
            perceives whatever workmanship is defective and badly exe­ <lb/>
            cuted, or what productions are of such description,-and <lb/>
            through a right feeling of disgust will praise and rejoice in the <lb/>
            beautiful, and receiving it in his soul will be fostered thereby, <lb/>
            and thus become a worthy, good man,—while, as to all that is <lb/>
            base, he will rightly despise and hate it, even from early <lb/>
            youth, and before he can partake of reason; and again, when <lb/>
            reason comes, having been thus trained, he will heartily em­ <lb/>
            brace it, because he clearly recognises it from its intimate fa­ <lb/>
            miliarity with himself. This appears to me, replied he, the <lb/>
            very reason, why there should be musical training. Just as <lb/>
            in learning our letters, said I, we are only then sufficiently in­ <lb/>
            structed, when we are acquainted, on meeting them, with the <lb/>
            few elementary letters through their various combinations, and <lb/>
            do not more or less despise them as unnecessary to be learnt, <lb/>
            but take all pains to understand them thoroughly,-as we <lb/>
            cannot be good grammarians till we do so. True. And supposing <lb/>
            the images of letters were seen anywhere, either in water or in <lb/>
            mirrors, should we not recognise them before the letters them­ <lb/>
            selves ?-or is this a part of the same art and study? Surely. <lb/>
            Is it then true, what I say, by the gods, that in this case we <lb/>
            shall never become musicians, neither ourselves nor the guar­ <lb/>
            dians we talk of training, unless we understand the ideas of <lb/>
            temperance, fortitude, liberality, and magnificence, and what­ <lb/>
            ever are akin to these, are acquainted also with their con­ <lb/>
            traries, so familiar to all, and unless, wheresoever they are, we <lb/>
            observe both the virtues themselves and the images thereof, <lb/>
            and despise them neither in small nor great instances, but <lb/>
            conceive them to be rather a part of the same art and study. <lb/>
            It must be so, said he. Must not that person, then, said I, <lb/>
            whose lot it is to have virtuous habits in his soul, and what is <lb/>
            proportioned and corresponding thereto in his appearance, par­ <lb/>
            take of the same impression and be a fine spectacle to any one <lb/>
            who is able to behold him ? Quite so. Yet, what is most beau <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            tiful is most lovely ? Of course. He, then, who is most musical <lb/>
            should surely love those men, who are most eminent in this <lb/>
            way; but if a man be unmusical, he will not love them? He will <lb/>
            not, replied he, if he be at all defective in his soul: still, if <lb/>
            it were in his body, he would bear with it, and be willing to <lb/>
            associate with him. I understand, said I, that your favourites <lb/>
            are or have been of this kind: and I too agree to that; but <lb/>
            tell me this,-is there any communion between temperance and <lb/>
            excessive pleasure ? How can there ? said he, for such plea­ <lb/>
            sure causes a privation of intellect, not less than grief. But <lb/>
            has it communion with any other virtue ? Not at all. What <lb/>
            then,-has it communion with insolence and Intemperance ? <lb/>
            Most certainly. Can you mention a greater and more acute <lb/>
            pleasure than what respects the matters of love ? I cannot, <lb/>
            said he, nor yet one that is more insane. But right love <lb/>
            is of a nature to love the beautiful and the good temperately <lb/>
            and harmoniously? Certainly. Nothing, then, which is mad, <lb/>
            or allied to intemperance, may approach real and right love. <lb/>
            It may not approach it. Nor may pleasure approach it; nei­ <lb/>
            ther may the lover and the person he loves have communion <lb/>
            with it, if they are rightly to love and be beloved ? No, truly, <lb/>
            said he; they may not, Socrates. Thus, then, it seems, you will <lb/>
            lay down a law in the city you are establishing, that the lover <lb/>
            shall love, converse, and associate with the objects of his love, <lb/>
            as with a son,—from a virtuous motive and with his consent; <lb/>
            and as to everything else, every one will so converse with <lb/>
            him whose love he solicits, as never to wish to associate for <lb/>
            any other purpose but what we have said ;-for otherwise he <lb/>
            would undergo the reproach of being unmusical and unac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the beautiful. It must be so, replied he. <lb/>
            Do not you think then, said I, that our discourse concerning <lb/>
            music is now concluded ?-For it has now terminated where <lb/>
            it ought,-as what is concerned with the art of music somehow <lb/>
            ought to terminate in the love of the beautiful. I agree, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.-After music, then, our youths must be <lb/>
            trained in gymnastics. What then ? In this likewise they <lb/>
            must needs be accurately trained, from infancy upwards <lb/>
            through their whole life :-For the matter, methinks, stands <lb/>
            somehow thus ;-and do you also consider.-I do not think <lb/>
            that any sound body can, by its own virtue, render the soul <lb/>
            good; and contrariwise, that a good soul can, by its own <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [n. II. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            virtue, render the body the best possible : what think you ? <lb/>
            I think so too, replied he. If then, after having sufficiently <lb/>
            trained the intellect, we commit to it the careful management <lb/>
            of what concerns the body, shall we not, as we are only <lb/>
            laying down patterns, (that we may not be tedious,) act in <lb/>
            a right manner? Entirely so. We say then, that they <lb/>
            must abstain from drunkenness ; for any one, rather than a <lb/>
            guardian, might be allowed to get drunk, and not know <lb/>
            where he is. It were ridiculous, said he, for a guardian to <lb/>
            need a guardian himself. But what as respects meats ;-for <lb/>
            these men are wrestlers in most important combats ;-are they <lb/>
            not? Yes. Would not then the bodily state of the wrest­ <lb/>
            lers suit such as these ? Perhaps so. But, said I, they are <lb/>
            a sluggish set, and of dubious health :-do you not observe, <lb/>
            that they sleep out their life; and, that if they only ever so <lb/>
            little depart from their regular diet, such wrestlers become <lb/>
            extensively and deeply diseased ? I do observe it. But a more <lb/>
            elegant kind of exercise, said I, is required for our military <lb/>
            wrestlers,-who, as dogs, ought to be wakeful, and see and <lb/>
            hear most acutely, and endure, in their expeditions, many <lb/>
            changes of water and food, of heat and cold, that so they <lb/>
            may not fail in their health ? I think so. Is not then the <lb/>
            best kind of gymnastic exercise very like the simple music <lb/>
            which we just before described ? How mean you ? That the <lb/>
            gymnastics should be simple and moderate, and of that kind <lb/>
            most especially which concern war. Of what kind ? Even <lb/>
            from Homer, said I, one may learn such things as these : for <lb/>
            you know, that in their military expeditions, at their heroes' <lb/>
            banquets, he never feasts them with fish, not even while <lb/>
            they were by the sea at the Hellespont, nor yet with boiled <lb/>
            flesh, but only with roast meat, as what soldiers can most <lb/>
            easily procure: for, in short, one can everywhere more <lb/>
            easily use fire, than carry vessels about? Yes. Neither <lb/>
            does Homer, I think, make any mention of seasonings : and <lb/>
            this is what every wrestler knows,-that the body, to be <lb/>
            in good condition, must abstain from these. They are right, <lb/>
            said he, and do abstain. You do not then approve, friend, it <lb/>
            would seem, of the Syracusan table, and the various Sicilian <lb/>
            made-dishes, since you think the other right ? It seems I <lb/>
            do not. You will disapprove also of a Corinthian girl, as a <lb/>
            mistress, for such as would be in good bodily condition? By <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. C. 14,] </note> <lb/>
            all means. And likewise of those celebrated delicacies of <lb/>
            Attic confections ? Surely. As respects all such feeding and <lb/>
            dieting, if we compare it to the melody and song produced <lb/>
            in full harmony and universal rhythm, will not the com­ <lb/>
            parison hold good ? Of course. And does not that diversity <lb/>
            cause insubordination in this case-disease in the other ? But <lb/>
            simplicity in music, engenders temperance in the soul,-and <lb/>
            in gymnastics, bodily health. True, said he. And when in­ <lb/>
            subordination and diseases multiply in a, city, must not many <lb/>
            law-courts and medicine-halls be opened; and will not the <lb/>
            forensic and medicinal arts be in request, when many, even of <lb/>
            the free, will earnestly apply to them ? Of course.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.-Can you then adduce any greater proof of <lb/>
            bad and shameful training in a city, than the fact of their <lb/>
            needing physicians and supreme magistrates, and these too, not <lb/>
            only for base and low craftsmen, but for those also, who boast <lb/>
            of having been liberally educated ;-and again, does it not seem <lb/>
            base, and a great proof of defective education, to be obliged to <lb/>
            see justice pronounced on us by others, as our masters and <lb/>
            iudges, and yet to have no sense of it in ourselves? This, <lb/>
            replied lie, is of all things the most base. And deem you not this <lb/>
            far more base, said I; when a person not only spends a great <lb/>
            part of his life in courts of justice, as defendant or plaintiff,­ <lb/>
            but, from ignorance of the beautiful, thinks he is renowned for <lb/>
            his very dexterity in doing injustice, and his cleverness at <lb/>
            turning through all sorts of windings, and using every kind of <lb/>
            subterfuge, with the idea of evading justice,-and all this for <lb/>
            the sake of small and contemptible things,-ignorant how <lb/>
            much better and more noble it were so to regulate life as not <lb/>
            to need a sleepy judge ? This, replied he, is still baser than <lb/>
            the other. And to need the medicinal art, said I, not on <lb/>
            account of wounds, or some incidental epidemic complaint, <lb/>
            but through sloth, and such diet as we mentioned, being <lb/>
            filled with rheums and wind, like lakes, and obliging the <lb/>
            skilful sons of Ӕsculapius to invent new names for diseases,­ <lb/>
            such as dropsies and catarrhs :-do not you think this abomin­ <lb/>
            able ? Truly, replied he, those are very new and strange names <lb/>
            of diseases. Such, said I, as I think, existed not in the days of <lb/>
            ,Esculapius : and I guess so from this, that when Eurypylus <lb/>
            was wounded at Troy, and was getting Pramnian wine to drink <lb/>
            with much flour sprinkled in it, and cheese grated (all which <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. c. 15. </note> <lb/>
            seem to be of inflammatory tendency), the sons of Æsculapius <lb/>
            neither blamed the woman who presented it, nor reproved <lb/>
            Patroclus, for presenting the cure. Surely such a potion, said <lb/>
            lie, is absurdly improper for one in such a case. Not so, said <lb/>
            I, if you consider, that the descendants of AEsculapius, as they <lb/>
            tell us, did not, before the time of Herodicus, practise the <lb/>
            method of cure now in use, which puts the patient on a regi­ <lb/>
            men -whereas Herodicus, being a teacher of youth, and in <lb/>
            weak health too, confounded gymnastics and medicine, and <lb/>
            made himself first very uncomfortable, and afterwards <lb/>
            many others besides. How was that ? said he. By procur­ <lb/>
            ing himself a lingering death, said I\ for while he was con­ <lb/>
            stantly attending to his disease, which was mortal, he was not <lb/>
            able, as I imagine, to cure himself; though, to the neglect of <lb/>
            everything else, he was constantly using medicines, and thus <lb/>
            passed his life, always most uneasy, if he departed in the <lb/>
            least from his usual diet; and through this wisdom of his, <lb/>
            struggling long with death, he arrived at old age. A mighty <lb/>
            reward, said he, he reaped for his cleverness! Such as <lb/>
            became one, said I, who was unconscious that it was not from <lb/>
            ignorance or inexperience of this method of cure, that Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius did not discover it to his descendants, but simply because <lb/>
            he was aware, that in all well-regulated states there every one <lb/>
            had a certain work enjoined him, necessary to be done, and <lb/>
            no one could be permitted to have time or leisure to get sick <lb/>
            throughout life, or busy himself with taking medicine \a <lb/>
            fact that we amusingly discover in the case of labouring <lb/>
            people, but do not see it in that of the rich, and those reputed <lb/>
            happy. How ? said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.-A builder, replied I, when he falls sick, gets <lb/>
            from the physician some potion for throwing up his disease, <lb/>
            or purging it downwards, or else, by means of caustic or am­ <lb/>
            putation, for getting freed from trouble ; but if any one pre­ <lb/>
            scribe him a system of regimen, putting caps on his head <lb/>
            and so on, he quickly tells him that he has no leisure to lie <lb/>
            sick, and it does not suit him to live in that manner, at­ <lb/>
            tending to his troubles, and neglecting his duty; and so, <lb/>
            bidding the physician farewell, he returns to his ordinary <lb/>
            diet, and, should he recover, he goes on managing his <lb/>
            affairs, but should his body be unable to bear up against the <lb/>
            disease, he dies, and gets rid of his troubles. Such an one, said <lb/>
            lie, ought to use the art of medicine just in this manner. 'is it <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. C. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            not, said I, because he has a certain business,-and which, if <lb/>
            he does not do it, it is no profit for him to live ? Plainly, <lb/>
            replied he. But the rich man, as we say, has no such work <lb/>
            allotted him, from which, when compelled to refrain, life is not <lb/>
            worth the having? It is said so of him, at least. You do not <lb/>
            mind, said I, what Phocylides says,-that one ought, throughout <lb/>
            life, to practise virtue. I think, replied he, we attended to that <lb/>
            formerly. We shall not differ on this point, said I. But let <lb/>
            us learn, whether excessive attention to one's disease is to be <lb/>
            the business of the rich, and life is not worth keeping, if he <lb/>
            does not give this attention ; inasmuch, as such a life hinders <lb/>
            the mind from attending to building and other arts,-but, as <lb/>
            respects the exhortation of Phocylides, it is no hinderance. <lb/>
            Yes, by Zeus, said he, it is, and that in the greatest degree, <lb/>
            when this unusual care of the body goes beyond gymnastics. <lb/>
            It agrees neither with attention to private economy, or mili­ <lb/>
            tary expeditions, or sedentary magistracies in the city. But <lb/>
            what is of most importance is, that such application to health <lb/>
            ill suits any sort of learning and inquiry and solitary study, <lb/>
            because one is then perpetually dreading certain pains and <lb/>
            swimmings of the head, and blaming philosophy as the cause <lb/>
            thereof,-so that, where there is this attention to health, it <lb/>
            greatly hinders the practice of virtue and improvement therein, <lb/>
            as it makes us always imagine that we are ill and ailing. Very <lb/>
            probably, said he. And shall we not say, that Ӕsculapius too <lb/>
            understood these things, when to persons in health, and such <lb/>
            as used a wholesome diet, but were afflicted by some particular <lb/>
            disease, to these and such kind of constitution he prescribed <lb/>
            medicine, resisting their ailments by drugs and incisions, but <lb/>
            still ordering them their usual diet, that the public might not <lb/>
            be injured; but he did not attempt, either by low or nourish­ <lb/>
            ing diet, to cure thoroughly diseased systems; and so to <lb/>
            afford a long and miserable life to the man himself, and his <lb/>
            descendants too, who would probably be of the same kind: <lb/>
            for he did not think that a man ought to be cured, who could <lb/>
            not live in the ordinary course, as in that case he would be of <lb/>
            no service either to himself or the state. You make Ӕsculapius, <lb/>
            a politician, observed he. Plainly so, said I; and his sons may <lb/>
            evince that he was so.* See you not again, that at Troy they <lb/>
            proved their bravery in war, and, as I say, practised medicine <note type="footnote"> * Viz. Machaon and Podalirius. </note> <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. Ill. C. 16. </note> <lb/>
            likewise ? And do not you remember, that when Menelaus <lb/>
            was wounded by Pandarus,­ <lb/>
            .... they sucked the wound, then spread it o'er <lb/>
            With drugs of balmy power ;*— <lb/>
            but as for what he wanted to eat or drink afterwards, they <lb/>
            prescribed for him no more than for Eurypylus, because they <lb/>
            deemed external applications sufficient to heal men, who, <lb/>
            before they were wounded, had been healthy and moderate in <lb/>
            their diet, whatever potion they might have drunk at the <lb/>
            time, but conceived, that a diseased constitution and an in­ <lb/>
            temperate life were beneficial neither to the men themselves nor <lb/>
            to others, and that their art ought not to be employed on, nor <lb/>
            minister to them, even were they richer than Midas.t How <lb/>
            vastly clever, said he, you are making the sons of Ӕsculapius!</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—It is quite right, replied I;—though in op­ <lb/>
            position to us, the tragedy-writers, and Pindar also, say that <lb/>
            AEsculapius was the son of Apollo, ‡ and was induced by gold <lb/>
            to undertake the cure of a rich man, already in a dying state,­ <lb/>
            for which indeed he was struck with a thunderbolt:—but we, <lb/>
            in accordance with what has been before said, will not believe <lb/>
            them as to both these statements, but assert, that were he <lb/>
            really a god's son, he would not have been given to filthy <lb/>
            lucre,-or else, if he were given to filthy lucre, he was not a <lb/>
            god's son. This at least, said he, is quite correct. But what <lb/>
            say you to this, Socrates ?—Must we not provide good phy­ <lb/>
            sicians for the state ; and must not these probably be such as <lb/>
            have been conversant with great numbers both of healthy and <lb/>
            sick people; and judges also, who have had experience of <lb/>
            all varieties of dispositions ? I am speaking particularly, said <lb/>
            I, of those who are good : but [tell me,]—are you aware <lb/>
            who they are, that I deem such ? [I shall be,] if you will <lb/>
            tell me, replied he. I will try to do so, said I; but you are <lb/>
            inquiring in one and the same question about two different <note type="footnote">* Horn. II. iv. 218, though somewhat modified by Plato. </note><note type="footnote"> t Place is here alluding to Tyrtæus, Eleg. iii. v. 6 :— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> B. in. c. 16.] </note> <lb/>
              things. As how ? said he. Physicians, replied I, would be­ <lb/>
              come extremely skilled, if, from childhood upwards, they <lb/>
              would, in course of learning their art, gain experience from a <lb/>
              large number of bodies, and these too of a very sickly charac­ <lb/>
              ter,-especially if they should be themselves afflicted with all <lb/>
              kinds of maladies, and not be altogether of a healthy consti - <lb/>
              tution,-for it is not by the body, methinks, that they cure the <lb/>
              body (else their own bodies would never be allowed to be <lb/>
              diseased, or become so), but they cure the body by the soul, <lb/>
              which, while in a diseased state, or becoming so, is incapable <lb/>
              of properly performing any cure whatever. Right, said he. But <lb/>
              as for the judge, friend, said I, he governs the soul by the soul; <lb/>
              and if it has been bred up from childhood with depraved <lb/>
              souls, has constantly associated with them, and has itself com­ <lb/>
              mitted all sorts of crime, it cannot so far emancipate itself, as <lb/>
              of itself to judge correctly about others' ill deeds, just as <lb/>
              happens with respect to bodily ailments :-no, it must even <lb/>
              in youth be unacquainted with and unpolluted by bad habits, <lb/>
              if it would be fair and honourable itself and judge correctly of <lb/>
              what is just. Hence, therefore, the virtuous, even in youth, <lb/>
              appear simple, and easily deceived by the unjust, because they <lb/>
              have within them, forsooth, no dispositions corresponding in <lb/>
              sentiment with those of the wicked. Aye, indeed, said <lb/>
              he, this very often happens to them. For this reason, <lb/>
              said I, the good judge must not be a youth, but old,­ <lb/>
              one who has been late in learning the nature of wicked­ <lb/>
              ness, which he apprehends not as a peculiar quality resident <lb/>
              in his own soul, but from having, as a foreign one, long studied <lb/>
              it in the souls of others, and from having ascertained the nature <lb/>
              of its evil by positive science, rather than personal experience. <lb/>
              Such an one as this, said he, is likely to be a very noble <lb/>
              judge. And a good one too, said I; the very thing you re­ <lb/>
              quired : for the man with a good soul is good ;-while on the <lb/>
              other hand, the clever, slyly suspicious man,—he, namely, who <lb/>
              has himself committed much sin, and is deemed subtle and wise <lb/>
              when in the society of his equals, has the repute of being a <lb/>
              clever, wary kind of person, because he has constantly in his <lb/>
              eye those models that reside within himself :-but whenever he <lb/>
              approaches the good, who are his seniors, he appears mightily <lb/>
              inferior, unseasonably suspicious, and wholly ignorant of <lb/>
              moral integrity, having within him no models of any such <pb n="92"/>
              <note type="margin"> In. III. c. 17. </note> <lb/>
              quality; but, on the other hand, as he has more frequent in­ <lb/>
              tercourse with the wicked than with the wise, he appears, <lb/>
              both to himself and others, unusually wise, rather than igno­ <lb/>
              rant. Quite true, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.-We must not then, said I, in such a man <lb/>
            as this, look for a wise and good judge, but in the former one. <lb/>
            Vice, indeed, can never know both itself and virtue; but virtue, <lb/>
            where the moral temper is gradually instructed, will attain to <lb/>
            a scientific knowledge both of itself and depravity also:­ <lb/>
            this man, then, and not the wicked one, is, as I think, <lb/>
            wise. I, too, said he, am of the same■opinion. You will <lb/>
            establish, then, in your state a science of medicine such as <lb/>
            we have described, and along with it a corresponding sys­ <lb/>
            tem of judicature, both of which together may carefully pro­ <lb/>
            vide for such of your citizens as are naturally well disposed <lb/>
            both in body and in mind; while, as regards the opposite, such <lb/>
            as are diseased in their bodies, they should let die; but <lb/>
            as for those who are thoroughly evil and incurable as to the <lb/>
            soul, these they are themselves to put to death ? It seems, <lb/>
            at any rate, the best, said he, that can happen, both for those <lb/>
            who are thus afflicted and for the state itself. As respects <lb/>
            your youths, however, it is quite plain, said I, that they will <lb/>
            be cautious in calling in the aid of judicial science, so long as <lb/>
            they are employed on that simple music, which, we said, <lb/>
            generates temperance. Of course, said he. Will not then, <lb/>
            the musician who pursues gymnastics, on the very same prin­ <lb/>
            ciples as his own art, prefer doing so in such a way as not to <lb/>
            want medicine except when absolutely necessary ? I think <lb/>
            so. His exercises too, and his labours, he will perform with <lb/>
            reference more to the spirited portion * of his nature thus <lb/>
            stirred into action, than to mere physical strength,-differ­ <lb/>
            ently, indeed, from all other wrestlers, who take food and <lb/>
            undergo toil with a view to the promotion of bodily strength ? <lb/>
            Most true, said he. In that case, said I, Glaucon, they who <lb/>
            propose to teach music and gymnastics, propose them, not for <note type="footnote"> * To <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμοειδές</foreign>. This refers to Plato's division of the mental faculties <lb/>

            ceives then, has for its object-not so much the promotion of the bodily <lb/>
            strength, as the excitement of the spirited part of our nature,-To <lb/>

            what some imagine, namely, to cure the body by the one, and <lb/>
            the soul by the other. If not, what is their motive ? asked <lb/>
            he. They seem to propose them both, said T, chiefly on the <lb/>
            soul's account. As how ? Perceive you not, said I, how <lb/>
            those persons have regulated their intellect itself, who have <lb/>
            all their life been conversant with gymnastics, yet never <lb/>
            studied music,-or how those are affected who have lived in <lb/>
            a manner quite the reverse of this ? What are you speaking <lb/>
            about ? said he, Of savageness and fierceness, said I, and again <lb/>
            of effeminacy and mildness. Yes, I understand, said he;­ <lb/>
            that is, persons who apply themselves to unmixed gymnastics <lb/>
            become more savage than they ought; and those again <lb/>
            [who attend] to music alone, are softer than becomes them. <lb/>
            And moreover, said I, this very savageness imparts probably <lb/>
            a certain spirit to the disposition, and, if rightly disciplined, <lb/>
            will become fortitude; but when stretched too far, it will <lb/>
            probably become indecently fierce and troublesome. So I <lb/>
            think, said he. But what ;-will not the philosophic nature <lb/>
            partake of the mild also; and when this disposition is carried <lb/>
            to excess, may it not prove softer than it ought, and if rightly <lb/>
            disciplined, both mild and modest ? Just so. We say <lb/>
            also, that our guardians ought naturally to be possessed of <lb/>
            both. They ought. Ought they not, then, to be made to <lb/>
            suit one another ? Of course. And the soul of the person <lb/>
            thus suited is temperate and brave? Certainly. But the <lb/>
            soul of a person not so suited is cowardly and savage ? Espe­ <lb/>
            cially so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.-As a matter of course, then, when one <lb/>
            consents to be soothed with the charms of music, and to have <lb/>
            poured into his soul through his ears (as through a pipe) <lb/>
            those lately called the sweet, effeminate, and doleful har­ <lb/>
            monies, and spends the whole of his life humming ditties and <lb/>
            charmed with melody,*—such an one, first of all,-should <lb/>
            he possess any spirit,-softens it like iron, and makes it ser­ <lb/>
            viceable, instead of useless and harsh. When, however, he <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> [B. III. C. 18. </note> <lb/>
              positively declines desisting, and becomes the victim of a kind <lb/>
              of fascination,—after this, he is melted and dissolved, till his <lb/>
              spirit is quite spent, and the nerves are, as it were, cut out <lb/>
              from his soul, making him an effeminate warrior.* Quite so <lb/>
              indeed, said he. Aye,-said I; if he had originally pos­ <lb/>
              sessed a nature devoid of spirit, he would quickly have done <lb/>
              thus; but, if [he possesses] one of high spirit, it makes the <lb/>
              mind weak, and causes it to be quickly overbalanced, speedily <lb/>
              either excited and overcome; and hence men become out­ <lb/>
              rageous and ill-tempered, rather than high-spirited. Quite <lb/>
              so, indeed. But what ;-if a man labour much in gymnastics <lb/>
              and live on extremely good diet, but pay no attention to <lb/>
              music and philosophy; is he not first of all, from having his <lb/>
              body in good condition, abundantly filled with prudence <lb/>
              and spirit, and does he not become braver than he was <lb/>
              before ? Surely. But what ;-supposing he does nothing <lb/>
              else, and has no commerce with the Muses, not even if he had <lb/>
              any love of learning in his soul, as neither having a taste for <lb/>
              investigation, nor sharing in any inquiry or reasoning, or <lb/>
              other musical pursuit whatever, does it not become feeble, <lb/>
              deaf, and blind, as being neither awakened, nor nurtured, nor <lb/>
              his perceptions purified? Just so. Such an one then be­ <lb/>
              comes, I suppose, a hater of argument, and indisposed to <lb/>
              music,-one who cannot at all be reasoned into anything, <lb/>
              but conducts himself in all matters with violence and ferocity, <lb/>
              like a wild beast; and thus he lives in ignorance and bar­ <lb/>
              barity, out of measure, and unpolished ? Quite so, said he. <lb/>
              Corresponding then to these two tempers, it seems, I would <lb/>
              say, that some deity has furnished men with two arts,-music <lb/>
              and gymnastics,-relating respectively to the high-spirited <lb/>
              and the philosophic nature,-not indeed, for the soul and <lb/>
              body, otherwise than as a by-work and accessory, but with a <lb/>
              view to those two tempers, that they may be mutually <lb/>
              suitable to each other by being tightened and loosened at <note type="footnote"> * Allusion is here made to Horn. II. xvii. v. 586 :— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              pleasure. Aye,-it seems so. Whoever then can most <lb/>
              cleverly mingle gymnastics with music, and introduce them <lb/>
              in justest measure into the soul, this person we may most <lb/>
              properly call completely musical, and most harmoniously <lb/>
              disposed,-far more, indeed, than the man who puts in <lb/>
              tune the strings of an instrument. Very likely, So­ <lb/>
              crates, said he. Shall we not then, always need, Glaucon, <lb/>
              such a president in our city, if its government is to be <lb/>
              kept entire ? It will indeed be quite needful, as far at least <lb/>
              as we can.</p>
          <p>Chap. XIX.—The above then are probably the true <lb/>
            models both of education and discipline :-for why should <lb/>
            one go through the dances, the hunts of wild beasts with <lb/>
            dogs and nets, the wrestlings and the horse-races expedient <lb/>
            for such persons ?—for it is almost manifest that they follow <lb/>
            as a matter of course, nor are they at all hard to discover. <lb/>
            Well, said he, perhaps they are not difficult. Granted, said <lb/>
            I :-but after this, what had we next to determine ?—Is it <lb/>
            not, which of these shall govern, and be. governed? What else ? <lb/>
            Is it not plain that the governors should be the elder, and <lb/>
            the governed the younger ? Plain. And also, that the best <lb/>
            of them [should govern ?]] Aye,-that too. And the best <lb/>
            husbandmen;—are they not the cleverest in tillage? Yes. <lb/>
            Now, if it be fit that our guardians be the best, will they not <lb/>
            be most strictly watehful over the city? Yes. With <lb/>
            this view should we not make them prudent, and able, and <lb/>
            careful also of the city ? It is the fact. At any rate a man <lb/>
            would be most careful of what he happens to love? Necessarily <lb/>
            so. And this at least one must especially love,-namely, what <lb/>
            he deems to have a community of interest with himself, espe­ <lb/>
            cially when he conceives, that in another's good fortune he <lb/>
            may find good fortune too,-but if otherwise, the reverse ? <lb/>
            Just so, said he. We must choose then, from the rest of the <lb/>
            guardians such men, as on inquiry most of all seem to per­ <lb/>
            form with all cheerfulness through an entire life whatever <lb/>
            they deem expedient for the state,-while, as to the inexpe­ <lb/>
            dient, they will not do it by any means at all. These are just <lb/>
            the proper persons, said he. I really think that they ought <lb/>
            to be observed at all stages of life, whether they act con­ <lb/>
            sistently with this opinion, without either being reduced or <lb/>
            forcibly compelled inconsiderately to throw up the opinion, <lb/>
            of its being a duty to do what is best for the state. What <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="margin"> In. III. c. 20. </note> <lb/>
            throwing up do you mean ? said he. I will tell you, said I. <lb/>
            Opinion seems to me to come from the intellect either volun­ <lb/>
            tarily or involuntarily,-voluntarily indeed as regards false <lb/>
            opinion, [when it comes] from him who unlearns it,-but <lb/>
            involuntarily, as regards every true one. The case of the <lb/>
            voluntary one, replied he, I understand; but that of the <lb/>
            involuntary I want to learn. What;—are not even you of <lb/>
            opinion, said I, that men are deprived of good things involun­ <lb/>
            tarily, but of evil things voluntarily? Is being deceived respect­ <lb/>
            ing the truth no evil, and the attainment of truth no good ? and <lb/>
            think you not, that to form opinions respecting things as they <lb/>
            really exist is attaining the truth? Aye, said he, you speak cor­ <lb/>
            rectly :-they do indeed seem to me to be deprived unwill­ <lb/>
            ingly of true opinion. Are they then thus affected by being <lb/>
            robbed, or enchanted, or forced ? Now, at any rate, said he, <lb/>
            I do not understand you. I am probably expressing myself, <lb/>
            said I, just like the tragedians * for, I say, that those <lb/>
            [have their opinions] stolen, who change them through per­ <lb/>
            suasion, or else forget them; because, in the one case, they <lb/>
            are imperceptibly removed by time, and in the other by <lb/>
            reasoning :-now perhaps you understand ? Yes. And <lb/>
            those, I say, are forced out of their opinions, whom grief or <lb/>
            agony obliges to change them ? This too, said he, I under­ <lb/>
            stand, and you are right in saying so. Those, moreover, <lb/>
            methinks, you will say, are enchanted out of their opinions, <lb/>
            who change them, either bewitched by pleasure or appalled <lb/>
            by fear. For whatever deceives, said he, seems to exercise a <lb/>
            kind of magical enchantment.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—We must now then inquire,-as I was saying <lb/>
            before,-who are the best guardians of their own particular <lb/>
            maxim, that they should do whatever they deem to be best for <lb/>
            the state; and they should observe them too quite from child­ <lb/>
            hood, setting before them such work, as may lead them most <lb/>
            readily to forget such a matter and delude themselves; and <lb/>
            we should choose one who is mindful and hard to be deluded, <lb/>
            while one who is not so we should reject :-is that it ? Yes. <note type="footnote"> * Plato here alludes to the obscure style sometimes adopted by them to <lb/>

              And we must appoint them labours and pains and contests, in <lb/>
              which we must observe these very same things. Right, said <lb/>
              be. Should we not, also, said I, appoint a third contest, that <lb/>
              of the mountebank kind; and look to see, just as persons <lb/>
              lead young colts amidst noises and tumults, to find out <lb/>
              whether they are frightened ?-and thus, while yet young, <lb/>
              they must be led into various fearful situations, and again <lb/>
              be thrown back into pleasures, trying them far more than <lb/>
              gold in the fire, whether a person appears hard to be beguiled <lb/>
              by mountebank tricks, and is of composed demeanour amidst <lb/>
              all, because lie is a good guardian of himself, and of that <lb/>
              music in which he had been instructed, proving himself in <lb/>
              all these respects to be in just rhythm and harmony. Being <lb/>
              of such character, he would truly be most useful both to him­ <lb/>
              self and the state. And be who in childhood, youth, and <lb/>
              manhood, has been thus tried, and come out pure, may be ap­ <lb/>
              pointed governor and guardian of the state; honours are to <lb/>
              be paid him while he lives, and at his death he should receive <lb/>
              the highest rewards of public burial and other memorials : <lb/>
              while one that is not such we must reject. Somewhat like this, <lb/>
              methinks, Glaucon, said I,—for we have only drawn it in out­ <lb/>
              line, not defined it accurately,*—should be the mode of choos­ <lb/>
              ing and establishing our governors and guardians. I think so <lb/>
              too, rejoined he. Is it not then really most correct to call <lb/>
              these the perfect guardians, both as to what relates to ene­ <lb/>
              mies abroad and friends at home, for taking from one party <lb/>
              the will, and from the other the power of doing mischief, <lb/>
              while the youth (whom we just now called guardians) will be <lb/>

          <p>CHAP. XXI.—What then, said I, should be our plan, <lb/>
            when we are falsifying by one of the well-intentioned and <lb/>
            necessary untruths, such as we just mentioned, with a view <lb/>
            to persuade chiefly the governors themselves;—but, if not <lb/>
            these, the rest of the state ? What kind of untruth do you <lb/>
            mean ? Nothing new, said I, but something like the Phoeni­ <lb/>
            cian fable,t which has often taken place heretofore, as the <note type="footnote"> * </note><figure type="illustration">

              poets say and have persuaded us, but which has not happened <lb/>
              in our times, nor do I know whether it is likely to happen,­ <lb/>
              to persuade one of which indeed requires great suasive power. <lb/>
              You seem to me, said he, to hesitate to tell it ! I shall appear <lb/>
              to you, said I, to hesitate with very good reason, whenever I <lb/>
              shall tell it. Speak, said he, and be not afraid. I will tell <lb/>
              you then, though I know not with what courage, or what <lb/>
              words I am to use in telling you;—and I will attempt, <lb/>
              first of all to persuade the governors themselves, and the <lb/>
              soldiers, and then also the rest of the state, that, whatever <lb/>
              training or education we gave them, all these particulars <lb/>
              seemed to affect and befal them like dreams, while really they <lb/>
              were in course of formation and development beneath the <lb/>
              earth, where are fabricated not only themselves, but also <lb/>
              their armour and other equipments :-but after they were <lb/>
              completely fashioned, the earth, who is their mother, brought <lb/>
              them forth; and now they ought to consult the interests <lb/>
              of the country in which they reside as for a mother and <lb/>
              nurse, and to defend her in case of invasion, and to <lb/>
              look upon the rest of the citizens as their brethren, and <lb/>
              sprung from the same soil. It is not without reason, said <lb/>
              he, that some time back, you were ashamed to tell this false­ <lb/>
              hood. Quite so, said I:—but still hear the remainder of <lb/>
              the fable. All of you in the state truly are brethren (as <lb/>
              we shall tell them by way of fable) ; but the God, in form­ <lb/>
              ing you, mixed gold in the formation of such of you as are <lb/>
              able to govern ;-on which account they are the most <lb/>
              honourable ;-in such as are auxiliaries, silver;-and in the <lb/>
              husbandmen and other craftsmen, iron and brass. Since <lb/>
              then you are all of the same kindred, you would for the most <lb/>
              part beget children resembling yourselves; and sometimes <lb/>
              perhaps silver will be generated out of gold, and out of silver <lb/>
              there might be a golden offspring; and thus in all other ways <lb/>
              [are they generated] out of one another.* Governors then, <lb/>
              first and chiefly, the God charges, that over nothing are they <lb/>
              to be such good guardians, or to keep such vigilant watch, as <note type="footnote"> myths related about the dragon and the sown men that arose at the <lb/>
              bidding of Cadmus, the son of Agenor, and grandson. of Poseidon and <lb/>
              Libya, whose native country was Phoenicia. </note><note type="footnote"> * Aristotle makes some rather strong remarks on these views in his <lb/>

              over their children ;-[to know] with which of these prin-' <lb/>
              ciples their souls are imbued ;-and should their descendants <lb/>
              be of brass or iron, they will show them no indulgence what­ <lb/>
              ever, but assigning them honour just proportioned to their <lb/>
              natural temper, will thrust them down to the rank of craftsmen <lb/>
              or husbandmen. And if again any from among these latter <lb/>
              shall exhibit a golden or silver sort of nature, they are to <lb/>
              pay them honour and elevate them ;-some to the guardian­ <lb/>
              ship, others to the rank of auxiliaries,-the oracle having de­ <lb/>
              clared that the state shall perish whenever iron or brass <lb/>
              shall hold its guardianship. With respect to this fable then, <lb/>
              have you any means of persuading them of its truth? <lb/>
              None, said he, of persuading these men themselves; but I <lb/>
              have as respects their sons -and posterity, and the rest of <lb/>
              mankind afterwards. Even this, said I, would act well in <lb/>
              making them more anxious about the state's welfare, and <lb/>
              for one another; for I almost understand what you mean ;— <lb/>
              and this truly will lead the same way as the oracle.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.-As for ourselves, having armed these earth­ <lb/>
            born sons, let us lead them forward under the conduct of their <lb/>
            leaders; and when they are come into the city, let them con­ <lb/>
            sider where they may best pitch their camp, so as best to keep in <lb/>
            order those within it, should any one be unwilling to obey the <lb/>
            laws; and likewise how they may defend it against those <lb/>
            without, should any enemy come, like a wolf, on the fold. <lb/>
            And when they have pitched their camp, and sacrificed to <lb/>
            the proper divinities, let them erect their tents: is that the <lb/>
            way? Just so, said he. They should be such then as may <lb/>
            suffice to defend them, both from winter's cold and summer­ <lb/>
            heat ? Of course; for I think, said he, you are alluding to <lb/>
            houses. Yes, said I, those of the military class, not those <lb/>
            of the money-makers. How, replied he, do you say that <lb/>
            the latter differs from the former ? I will try to tell you, <lb/>
            said I; for, of all things, it is the most dreadful, and dis­ <lb/>
            graceful to shepherds, to breed, as guardians of the flocks, <lb/>
            such kind of dogs, and in such a manner, as that, either <lb/>
            through want of discipline, or hunger, or some other ill habit, <lb/>
            the dogs should themselves attempt to hurt the sheep, and so <lb/>
            resemble wolves rather than dogs. It is dreadful, of course, <lb/>
            said he. Must we not then take all care, lest our allies act <lb/>
            thus towards our citizens, as being the more powerful, and, <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B in. c. 22. </note> <lb/>
            instead of generous allies, resemble savage masters ? We <lb/>
            must take care, said he. Would they not be prepared to <lb/>
            exercise the greatest caution, if they were really well edu­ <lb/>
            cated ? They are so, moreover, replied he. I then, for my <lb/>
            part, observed: that you cannot properly insist on, friend <lb/>
            Glaucon; but what we were just now saying is proper; <lb/>
            namely, that they should have a good education, whatever its <lb/>
            nature, if they are to possess what is most important towards <lb/>
            rendering them mild, both among themselves and towards <lb/>
            those under their guardianship. Right, said he. In addition <lb/>
            then to this training, any intelligent person would say, that <lb/>
            their houses and all other effects ought to be so contrived, as <lb/>
            neither to impede their guardians in becoming the very best <lb/>
            possible, nor to excite them to the injury of the other citizens. <lb/>
            Aye, and he will say true. If then they intend to be such, <lb/>
            consider, said I, whether they ought to live and arrange their <lb/>
            household in some such manner, as follows: First, let none <lb/>
            possess any private property unless it be absolutely necessary: <lb/>
            next, let none have any dwelling, or store-house, into which any <lb/>
            one that pleases may not enter: then, as for necessaries, let <lb/>
            them be such as both temperate and brave champions in war <lb/>
            may require; making for themselves this law, not to receive <lb/>
            such a reward of their guardianship from the other citizens, as <lb/>
            to have either surplus or deficiency at the year's end. Let them <lb/>
            also frequent public meals, as in camps, and live in common ; and <lb/>
            we must tell them, that they have ever in their souls from the <lb/>
            gods a divine gold and silver, and therefore have no need of <lb/>
            that which is human ; and that it were profane to pollute the <lb/>
            possession of the divine ore, by mixing it with the alloy of the <lb/>
            mortal metal; because the money of the vulgar has produced <lb/>
            many impious deeds, while that which they have is pure ; and <lb/>
            that of all men in the city, they alone should not be allowed <lb/>
            to handle or touch gold or silver, or harbour it under their <lb/>
            roof, or carry it about, nor to drink out of silver or gold. <lb/>
            By such means they will be likely to preserve both them­ <lb/>
            selves and the state; but whenever they shall possess private <lb/>
            lands and houses, and money, they will become stewards <lb/>
            and farmers instead of guardians, and hateful masters instead <lb/>
            of allies to the other citizens; in hating indeed, and being <lb/>
            hated, in plotting, and being plotted against, they will <lb/>
            pass the whole of their life ; much more frequently and more <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. c. 22.] </note> <lb/>
            really terrified by the enemies from within than by those from <lb/>
            without, as they and the rest of the state are hastening very <lb/>
            near to destruction. For all these reasons, said I, we must say, <lb/>
            that our guardians should be thus regulated, both as to their <lb/>
            houses and all other matters. And let us consider these things <lb/>
            as law ; shall we not ? By all means, said Glaucon.</p><pb n="102"/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψὺλαξ</foreign> and the arrangement of a model state,-which he further con­ <lb/>
            ceives to comprise, as essentials, wisdom, temperance, fortitude, and <lb/>

            analogy with the numerous mental faculties, which, like the members of <lb/>
            a state, exist by mutual connexion and dependence. This concord of <lb/>
            faculties is at the bottom of Plato's notion of a state ; and this consti­ <lb/>
            tutes justice, the benefits of which are negatively proved by the ex­ <lb/>
            posure of injustice. This justice, however, he proves to have numerous <lb/>
            ramifications, just in the same way as both himself and Aristotle con­ <lb/>

            civil administration when placed in the hands of the people themselves, <lb/>
            both generically and in its specific departments.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—ADIMANTUS hereupon rejoining said: What <lb/>
            answer will you make, Socrates, if one were to say that <lb/>
            you do not make these men very happy,-and that owing <lb/>
            to themselves, whose property the state really is,-yet <lb/>
            they enjoy no advantage in the state, such as others do <lb/>
            who possess lands, build beautiful and large houses, purchase <lb/>
            suitable furniture, offer sacrifices to the gods at their own <lb/>
            expense, entertain strangers, and, as you were just now <lb/>
            saying, possess gold and silver, and everything generally <lb/>
            supposed to contribute towards making men happy. Aye, <lb/>
            doubtless, he may say, they seem, like hired auxiliaries, <lb/>
            to be settled in the state for no other purpose than keeping <lb/>
            guard. Yes, said I; and that too only for their main­ <lb/>
            tenance, without receiving, like the rest, pay as well as ra­ <lb/>
            tions ;-so that they are not to be allowed so much as to travel <lb/>
            abroad privately, though they wish it, nor bestow money on <lb/>
            mistresses, nor spend it in such other ways as those do who are <lb/>
            reputed to be happy. These and many such like things <lb/>
            you leave out of the accusation. Well., let these charges too, <lb/>
            said he, be made against them. What answer then, are we <lb/>
            to make, you ask { I do. While travelling on the same <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            road, we shall find, methinks, what is to be said : for we shall <lb/>
            state, that it would be nothing strange, were these men, under <lb/>
            these circumstances, to be the happiest possible :-yet it was <lb/>
            not with an eye to this, that we are establishing our state,­ <lb/>
            to have any one tribe in it remarkably happy, but that the <lb/>
            whole state might be so to the fullest extent; for we judged, <lb/>
            that In such an one more particularly we should meet with <lb/>
            justice, and again in that the worst established injustice ; and <lb/>
            that, on thoroughly examining these, we might determine <lb/>
            what we have long been seeking. Now then, as we slip­ <lb/>
            pose, we are forming a happy state, not by selection, making <lb/>
            some few only so in it, but the whole: and we will next <lb/>
            consider one its reverse. Just as if, when we were paint­ <lb/>
            ing human figures, a person should come and blame us, <lb/>
            saying, that we do not place the most beautiful colours on <lb/>
            the most beautiful parts of the creature,-inasmuch as the <lb/>
            eyes, the most beautiful part, were not painted with purple, <lb/>
            but black; we should seem perhaps to make a sufficient an­ <lb/>
            swer to him, by saying, Clever fellow, do not suppose that <lb/>
            we ought to paint the eyes so beautifully, as that they <lb/>
            should not appear to be eyes, and so with the other parts ;— <lb/>
            but consider, rather, whether, in giving each particular part <lb/>
            its due, we make the whole beautiful. And especially now, <lb/>
            do not oblige us to confer such happiness on our guardians as <lb/>
            shall make them anything rather than guardians : for we <lb/>
            know too, how to dress out the husbandmen in fine robes and <lb/>
            gird them with gold, and bid them till the ground with a <lb/>
            view to pleasure only,-and in like manner, those who make <lb/>
            earthenware, to lie at their ease by the fire, drinking and <lb/>
            feasting, and placing the wheel near them to work just so much <lb/>
            as they like ;-and so also how to confer happiness on every <lb/>
            one in such a manner as to render the whole state happy. But <lb/>
            do not advise us in this way; because, if we obey you, <lb/>
            neither will the husbandman be really a husbandman, nor the <lb/>
            potter a potter: nor will any one else be really of any of <lb/>
            those professions of which the state is composed. As to all <lb/>
            the rest, it is of less consequence :-for, when shoemakers <lb/>
            become bad and corrupt, and profess to be shoemakers <lb/>
            when they are not so, no great mischief befals the state ; but <lb/>
            when guardians of the laws and of the state are not so really, <lb/>
            but only in appearance, you see how entirely they destroy <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            the whole state, and, on the other hand, that they alone have <lb/>
            the opportunity of managing it well and effecting its happiness. <lb/>
            fthen we would appoint men who shall be really guardians <lb/>
            of the city, [let us choose] those who will be least hurtful to it ; <lb/>
            but he who says that they should be a kind of farmers, and <lb/>
            as in a festival meeting, not in a state, jolly entertainers, <lb/>
            must speak of something else rather than a city. We must <lb/>
            consider, then, whether we establish guardians with this <lb/>
            view, that they may enjoy the greatest happiness,-or, look­ <lb/>
            ing to the entire state, we regard whether it is to be <lb/>
            found therein; and we must compel these allies and guar­ <lb/>
            dians to do this, and persuade them to become the best <lb/>
            performers of their own particular work, and act also towards <lb/>
            all others in the same manner; and thus, as the whole city <lb/>
            becomes prosperous, and well constituted, we must permit its <lb/>
            several classes to share in that degree of happiness which their <lb/>
            nature admits.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—I think you say well, said he. Well then, <lb/>
            said I, what is near akin to this, shall I be thought to say <lb/>
            rightly. In what particularly ? With respect to all other arti­ <lb/>
            ficers again, consider whether these things corrupt them, so <lb/>
            as,to make them bad workmen. To what do you allude ? <lb/>
            Riches, said I, and poverty. As how ? Thus :—Would the <lb/>
            potter, think you, after he has become rich, have any desire <lb/>
            still to mind his art? By no means, said he. But will he <lb/>
            not become more idle and careless than he was before? <lb/>
            Much more so. Will he not then become a worse potter ? <lb/>
            This too, much more so, said he. And, moreover, being unable <lb/>
            through poverty to supply himself with tools, or other <lb/>
            requisites of his art, his workmanship will be more imper­ <lb/>
            fectly executed, and his sons, or others whom he instructs, <lb/>
            will be inferior artists. Of course they will. Owing to both <lb/>
            these causes, then, [namely] poverty and riches, the work­ <lb/>
            manship in the arts becomes inferior, and [the artists] <lb/>
            themselves inferior too. It appears so. We have then, <lb/>
            it seems, found out other things for our guardians, against <lb/>
            which they must by all means watch, that they may not <lb/>
            steal into the state without their knowledge. Of what sort <lb/>
            are these ? Riches, said I, and poverty;-the one engender­ <lb/>
            ing luxury, idleness, and a love of innovation;-the other, <lb/>
            illiberality and mischief, as well as a love of innovation. <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. iv. c. . 2.] </note> <lb/>
            Quite so, said he. But, Socrates, pray consider this;— <lb/>
            how is our state to have the power of engaging in war, <lb/>
            when she is possessed of no money, especially if compelled <lb/>
            to wage war against a great and opulent one? It is plain, <lb/>
            said I, that to fight against one is somewhat difficult; <lb/>
            but against two such is more easy. How say you ? replied <lb/>
            he. First of all, now, said I, if there is any occasion for <lb/>
            fighting, will they not, being practised warriors, fight against <lb/>
            rich men? Yes, surely, said he. What then, said I, Adi­ <lb/>
            mantus, would not a single boxer, trained as highly as <lb/>
            possible to this exercise, seem to you easily able to fight <lb/>
            against two who are not boxers, but on the other hand, <lb/>
            are rich and fat? Not perhaps with both at once, said <lb/>
            he. Not even, said I, if he should be enabled to retire <lb/>
            a little, and then turn back and give a blow to the furthest <lb/>
            in advance, and repeat this frequently in the sun and heat ? <lb/>
            -would not a person of this kind easily defeat many such <lb/>
            as these ? Clearly so, and no wonder, said he. But think <lb/>
            you not, that the rich have more science and experience in <lb/>
            boxing than in the military art? I do, said he. In that case, <lb/>
            according to appearances, our wrestlers will easily combat with <lb/>
            double and threefold their number. I will agree with you, <lb/>
            said he; for I believe you say right. But what,-supposing <lb/>
            they were to send an embassy to another state, informing <lb/>
            them of their true situation, telling them, We make no use <lb/>
            either of gold or silver, neither is it lawful for us to use them, <lb/>
            while for you it is so :-if then you become our allies in war, <lb/>
            you shall receive the enemy's spoils ;-think you that any, <lb/>
            on hearing this, would choose to fight against stanch and <lb/>
            resolute dogs, rather than in alliance with the dogs to fight <lb/>
            against fat and tender sheep? I think not; but, if the <lb/>
            wealth of all the rest be accumulated in one single state, take <lb/>
            care that it [the wealthy state] does not endanger that <lb/>
            which is poor. How good you are, said I, to think that any <lb/>
            other deserves to be called a state except such as we have <lb/>
            established. Why not ? said he. To those others, said I, <lb/>
            we must give a more magnificent appellation; for each of <lb/>
            them comprises very many states, and is not one, as was said <lb/>
            in the game ;* for there are always in them, however small <note type="footnote"> The scholiast tells us, that " to play at cities " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλεις</foreign> •aai^tiv) is a <lb/>
            kind of game at dice, in which the players cried,—"One city," or "Many </note> <pb n="106"/>

            they be, two parties hostile to each other,-the poor and the <lb/>
            rich; and in each of these again there are very many;-to <lb/>
            which, if yon apply as to one, you would be entirely mis­ <lb/>
            taken ;—but if, as to many, giving one party the goods and <lb/>
            power, or even persona, of the other, yon will always have <lb/>
            the many for your allies, and the few for enemies ; and, so <lb/>
            long as your state be managed temperately, as lately esta­ <lb/>
            blished, it will be the greatest,-not I mean in mere repute, <lb/>
            but really the greatest, though its defenders were no more <lb/>
            than one thousand; for a single state of such size you will <lb/>
            not easily find, either among Greeks or barbarians, but many <lb/>
            which have the repute of being many times larger than one <lb/>
            such as this.* Are you of a different opinion? No, by Zeus, <lb/>
            said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—This, then, said I, will probably be the best <lb/>
            boundary-mark for our rulers as to the size that a state should <lb/>
            attain, and what extent of ground should be marked off for <lb/>
            it in proportion to its bulk, without reference to anything <lb/>
            further?t What boundary? said he. I suppose, said I, <lb/>
            [it should be] this : So long as the city, as it increases, <lb/>
            continues to be one, so far it may increase, but no <lb/>
            further. Very right, said he. We will impose, then, this <lb/>
            further injunction on our guardians, to take care by all <lb/>
            means that the city be neither small nor great, but of mode­ <lb/>
            rate extent, and one only. This probably, said he, will be a <lb/>
            trifling injunction. A more trifling one still, said I, is what <lb/>
            we previously mentioned, when we observed, that if any de­ <lb/>
            scendant of the guardians be depraved, he should be dismissed <lb/>
            to the other classes; and if one from the other classes be worthy, <lb/>
            he should be promoted to that of the guardians ;-by all which <lb/>
            it was intended to show that all the other citizens should <lb/>
            apply themselves each to that particular art for which he has <lb/>
            a natural genius, that so, each minding his own proper work, <note type="footnote">cities;" and he informs us, moreover, that the expression was pro­ <lb/>
            verbial. </note><note type="footnote"> * These notions are severely commented on by Aristotle in his Pol. <lb/>
            ii. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t From the previous discussion respecting the unity and harmony of a <lb/>
            state, Socrates conceives that it may be inferred also what decision should <lb/>
            be formed respecting its size and boundaries ; and he wishes it to be in­ <lb/>
            creased only in such way as may be consistent with moderate bulk, and <lb/>
            not endanger its unity and the harmony of its several parts. </note> <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. c. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            should not become many, but one ; and thus, consequently, the <lb/>
            whole state would have the nature of unity;-not plurality. <lb/>
            "Well,—this, indeed, said he, is a still more trifling injunction <lb/>
            than the other. We do not here, said I, good Adimantus, as <lb/>
            any one might suppose, impose on them many and grave in­ <lb/>
            junctions, but all of them rather trifling, if they take care of <lb/>
            one grand point that we speak about, or rather not so much <lb/>
            great as sufficient. What is that ? said he. The education, <lb/>
            said I, and nurture of children; for if, by being well edu­ <lb/>
            cated, they become temperate men, they will easily see through <lb/>
            all these things, and such other things as we pass by at <lb/>
            present,-women, marriages, and the propagation of the <lb/>
            species,-inasmuch as these things ought all, according to the <lb/>
            proverb,* to be made entirely common among friends. Yes, <lb/>
            -for that, said he, would be most right. And moreover, <lb/>
            said I, if once a republic is set a-going, it proceeds as a circle, <lb/>
            constantly on the increase. For nurture and good education, <lb/>
            when maintained, engender good dispositions, and good dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions, partaking of such education, turn out still better than <lb/>
            the former, especially with reference to propagation, just as <lb/>
            with all other animals. Probably, said he. To speak then in <lb/>
            brief, this, particularly, the guardians of the state must guard <lb/>
            against, that it may not be corrupted unawares,—nay, above all <lb/>
            things, must they guard against this, not to make innovations in <lb/>
            gymnastics and music, contrary to the established order of the <lb/>
            state, but as far. as possible maintain it, through fear that <lb/>
            while a man adopts that poetical expression, <lb/>
            ...... Men most admire that song <lb/>
            Which most partakes of novelty,t <lb/>
            one might often think that the poet means not new songs, but <lb/>
            some new style of song, and so commends it: but such as this <note type="footnote"> * Allusion is here made to the well-known Pythagorean adage,-<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> <lb/>

            necessity of keeping up the severe old style of music, inasmuch as the <lb/>
            introduction of a new and more luxurious style would infallibly produce a <lb/>
            general corruption of national morals. The importance attached to this <lb/>
            point will be more truly seen from considering the close relation which, <lb/>
            in the opinion of the Greeks, subsisted between all the liberal arts. Plato <lb/>
            alludes to the subject at length in the Laws, ii. pp. 656 c, 659 e, and iii. <lb/>
            pp. 700 a, &amp;c., and vii. throughout. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. c. 4. </note> <lb/>
            one ought neither to commend nor admit; for as to receiving a <lb/>
            new kind of music one should be specially cautious, as endan­ <lb/>
            gering the whole: for never, as Damon says, and I quite <lb/>
            agree with him, are the measures of music altered without <lb/>
            affecting the most important laws of the state. And me too, <lb/>
            you may place, said Adimantus, among those who are of that <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—We must erect then, said I, in music, as it <lb/>
            seems, a kind of citadel for our guardians. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            neglect of the laws even here, said he, easily and impercep­ <lb/>
            tibly steals in. Yes, said I, in the way of diversion, and as <lb/>
            if it were doing no mischief. No, for it does nothing else, said <lb/>
            he, but by gradually insinuating itself into it, insensibly flow <lb/>
            into their manners and pursuits ; and afterwards in a greater <lb/>
            degree it finds its way into their contracts with each other; and <lb/>
            from contracts it enters with much boldness into the laws and <lb/>
            political establishments, Socrates, till at last it overturns <lb/>
            everything, privately as well as publicly. Well, then, said I, <lb/>
            is this the case ? It appears so to me, he replied. Ought <lb/>
            not our children then, as I said at the beginning, even <lb/>
            from infancy, to be allowed diversions more conformable to <lb/>
            the laws ? because, if their diversions are inconsistent with <lb/>
            the laws, and the children such themselves, it is impossible <lb/>
            that they should grow up men obedient to the laws and vir­ <lb/>
            tuous. How can it be otherwise ? said he. When, therefore, <lb/>
            children beginning well set about their diversions conformably <lb/>
            to the laws, with music, quite the contrary to what happens in. <lb/>
            the former case attends them in everything, and grows up with <lb/>
            them, and corrects in the state whatever was before neglected. <lb/>
            True, indeed, said he. And regulations, even, said I, that <lb/>
            seem but of little importance, these persons discover anew, <lb/>
            which the others had allowed altogether to perish. What <lb/>
            regulations ? Such as these :-That the younger should keep <lb/>
            silence before the elder, as is proper, and give them place, and <lb/>
            rise up before them, * and show reverence to parents ; like­ <lb/>
            wise what shaving, what clothes and shoes are proper, with <lb/>
            the whole bodily dress, and all similar matters. Do not you <lb/>
            think so ? I do. But to make laws about these things, would, <lb/>
            I think, be silly ; neither is it done anywhere; nor would it <note type="footnote"> * Comp. here Aristot. Eth. ix. ch. 2 :–<foreign xml:lang="grc">παντὶ δὲ τψ̃ πρεσβυτέψ</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              stand, though established both by word and writing. For <lb/>
              how can it ? It seems then, said I, Adimantus, that in what­ <lb/>
              ever way a man sets out in his education, such accordingly <lb/>
              will be its consequences; for does not the like always <lb/>
              attract the like ? Of course. And we may say, I suppose, <lb/>
              that it results at last in something complete and vigorous, <lb/>
              whether it be good or the contrary ? Of course, said he. I <lb/>
              would not then, said I, for these reasons, undertake as yet, <lb/>
              to make laws about such matters as these. Very properly, said <lb/>
              he. But what, by the gods, said I, as to those laws relative <lb/>
              to matters of contract, and to the traffic which they severally <lb/>
              transact with each other in the market, and, if you please, their <lb/>
              traffic likewise among their handicrafts, their abusiveness and <lb/>
              bodily assaults, their entering of actions at law, their institution <lb/>
              of judges, and, likewise such imposts and payments of taxes as <lb/>
              might be expedient either in the markets or at the ports,-or <lb/>
              generally as to laws commercial, municipal, or marine, or any <lb/>
              other the like,-shall we venture to establish any of these ? <lb/>
              It is improper, said he, to prescribe them to good and worthy <lb/>
              men ; for the greater part of them, such as ought to be esta­ <lb/>
              blished by law, they will easily find out for themselves. Yes, <lb/>
              said I, my friend, if at least God grant them security for those <lb/>
              laws which we have above described. But if not so, said he, <lb/>
              they will spend the whole of their life making and amending <lb/>
              many such [regulations,] imagining that they will thus attain <lb/>
              to what is best. You say that such as these, said I, will lead <lb/>
              a life like that of sick persons, and such as are unwilling, <lb/>
              through intemperance, to relinquish a bad mode of living ? <lb/>
              Quite so. And truly, these at least pass their time very <lb/>
              pleasantly; for though they undergo remedial treatment, <lb/>
              they do nothing but make their ailments greater and <lb/>
              more complex; and they are ever in hopes, when any <lb/>
              one recommends any medicine to them, that by these <lb/>
              means they shall soon get well. Aye, that is just the case <lb/>
              with diseased persons like these. But what, said I, is not <lb/>
              this pleasant of them, to reckon that man the most hate­ <lb/>
              ful of all, who tells them the truth, namely, that, till one <lb/>
              abandons drunkenness, gluttony, unchaste pleasures, and lazi­ <lb/>
              ness, neither drugs nor caustics, nor the use of the knife, nor <lb/>
              charms, nor amulets, nor any other such things as these, will <lb/>
              be of any avail ? That, said he, is not very pleasant; for <pb n="110"/>
              <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 5.1 </note> <lb/>
              to be angry with one who tells us what is right, has nothing <lb/>
              in it that is pleasant. You seem to be no admirer, said I, of <lb/>
              such men as these. No, truly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—You cannot then surely approve of it, even <lb/>
            though the entire city (as we were lately saying) should act <lb/>
            so ; or rather, do they not seem to be doing the same that is <lb/>
            done by all those cities, which, however ill-governed, com­ <lb/>
            mand their citizens not to alter any part of the constitution, <lb/>
            for that death will be inflicted on all who do any such <lb/>
            things; while, on the other hand, whoever most cheerfully <lb/>
            serves those who thus govern, gratifying them with insinu­ <lb/>
            ating flattery, and exhibits great dexterity in anticipating and <lb/>
            satisfying their desires, will be deemed both good and wise in <lb/>
            matters of highest importance, and will be held by them also <lb/>
            in the greatest honour ? They seem to me at least, said he, to <lb/>
            do the very same thing, and I cannot by any means commend <lb/>
            them. But what again as to those who desire to manage such <lb/>
            states, and are even fond of it, do you not admire their cou­ <lb/>
            rage and dexterity ? I do, said he ; excepting, indeed, such <lb/>
            as are imposed on by them, and fancy that they are really <lb/>
            politicians, because they are praised by the multitude. How <lb/>
            do you mean ? Do you not pardon those men ? said I. Do <lb/>
            you think it even possible that a man ignorant of the art <lb/>
            of measuring, supposing he should hear many other such men <lb/>
            tell him that he is four cubits high, would not believe this <lb/>
            of himself? Impossible, said he. Be not angry then ; for <lb/>
            such as these are of all the most ridiculous ; because, as they <lb/>
            are ever making laws about such things as we have just men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and ever mending them, they conceive they shall find <lb/>
            some end to the frauds respecting commerce, and what else I <lb/>
            just now spoke about, through ignorance of the fact that they <lb/>
            are in fact, as it were, trying to destroy a hydra. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, it is nothing else, said he, that they are now attempting. <lb/>
            I think, then, said I, that a true lawgiver ought not to give <lb/>
            himself much trouble about such sorts of laws and police, <lb/>
            either in an ill or well ordered state; in the one, because it is <lb/>
            unprofitable and of no avail; in the other, because,, as for <lb/>
            some of the laws, any one whatever can find them out, while <lb/>
            others flow quite of their own accord out of their former <lb/>
            habits and pursuits.</p>
          <p>What then, in the enactment of laws, said he, yet re- <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 6.3 </note> <lb/>
            mains for us to consider? And I said: We have nothing, <lb/>
            indeed, remaining: to the Delphian Apollo, however, there <lb/>
            remains the greatest, noblest, and most important of legal <lb/>
            institutions. Of what kind ? said he. The erection of <lb/>
            temples, sacrifices, and other services to the gods, demons, and <lb/>
            heroes; likewise the rites of the dead, and what other cere­ <lb/>
            monies should be gone through, with a view to their propi­ <lb/>
            tiation. Such things as these, indeed, we neither know our­ <lb/>
            selves, nor, in founding the state, would we intrust them to <lb/>
            any other, if we be wise ; nor would we employ any other <lb/>
            interpreter than that of the country: for surely this god, being <lb/>
            the natural interpreter to all men about such matters, inter­ <lb/>
            prets to them sitting in the middle, and, as it were, navel of <lb/>
            the earth. Aye, you say well, said he; and we must act <lb/>
            accordingly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Thus then, son of Ariston, said I, is our state <lb/>
            established. And, in the next place, having provided from <lb/>
            some source or other sufficient light for it, do you your­ <lb/>
            self observe, and call on your brother and Polemarchus and <lb/>
            these others also to do so also, whether we can at all perceive <lb/>
            where justice lies, and where injustice, and in what respect they <lb/>
            differ from each other; and likewise which of the two that man <lb/>
            ought to possess, who proposes to be happy, whether with or <lb/>
            without the knowledge of gods and men. You say nothing to <lb/>
            the purpose, replied Glaucon; for you yourself promised to <lb/>
            inquire into this, as it was unholy for you not to assist by all <lb/>
            possible means the cause of justice. What you remind me <lb/>
            of, said I, is true; and I must act accordingly; still it is <lb/>
            proper, that you too should assist in the inquiry. Aye, that <lb/>
            we will, said he. I hope then, said I, to be able to find what I <lb/>
            want in the following manner:—I think that our city, if at <lb/>
            least it has been rightly established, should be perfectly good. <lb/>
            Necessarily so, said he. It is evident then, that it is wise, <lb/>
            and brave, and temperate, and just. Manifestly so. What­ <lb/>
            ever then of these [virtues] we shall find in it, the remainder <lb/>
            will be that which is not found ? Of course. Supposing of <lb/>
            any four things whatever, if we were in quest of one, were <lb/>
            we to discover this one at first, we should be satisfied; and <lb/>
            were we first to discover the other three, we should discover <lb/>
            from this itself what we were inquiring after; for it would <lb/>
            be manifestly no other than what was left behind. You say <pb n="112"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 7. </note> <lb/>
            right, said he. Well then, since of the virtues above men­ <lb/>
            tioned there happened to be four [in our state,] shall we not <lb/>
            inquire about them in a similar manner ? Plainly so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—First of all, indeed, to my mind at least, <lb/>
            wisdom appears to hold in it a very conspicuous place ; and <lb/>
            there appears to be something very peculiar about it. What <lb/>
            is that ? said he. The state which we have described appears <lb/>
            to me to be really wise, for it is well advised; is it not ? <lb/>
            It is. And surely this very thing, the ability of advising <lb/>
            well, is evidently a kind of science; for in no case do <lb/>
            men advise well through ignorance, but only by means <lb/>
            of science. Plainly so. But there are many and various <lb/>
            kinds of science in the state? Of course there are. Is <lb/>
            it then owing to the science of builders, that the <lb/>
            state is to be termed wise and well-advised? By no <lb/>
            means through this, said he; for it would only be clever in <lb/>
            building. A state, then, is not to be called wise on account <lb/>
            of its skill in advising the best methods of building ? Surely <lb/>
            not. And what, as respects skill in brass-work or any­ <lb/>
            thing else of a similar nature? For none of these, said <lb/>
            he. Nor yet for its knowledge of the productions of the <lb/>
            earth [is it said to be wise,] but only skilled in agricul­ <lb/>
            ture. I think so. But what, said I; is there any science <lb/>
            among any of the citizens in the state which we have just <lb/>
            founded, which deliberates, not about any particular thing in <lb/>
            the city, but about the whole, how it may best be conducted, <lb/>
            both as regards itself and its intercourse with other cities? <lb/>
            Yes, there is. What is it, said I, and among whom to be found ? <lb/>
            This very guardianship, said he; and [it may be found] among <lb/>
            those very governors, whom we lately termed perfect <lb/>
            guardians. On account then of this skill, what do you term <lb/>
            the state? Well-advised, said he, and really wise. Whe­ <lb/>
            ther then, said I, do you imagine that the braziers, or these <lb/>
            true guardians, will be the more numerous in the state ? <lb/>
            The braziers, said he, far more so. And of all, said I, <lb/>
            who owing to their skill are to be held in account, will not <lb/>
            these guardians be the fewest in number? By far. By <lb/>
            this smallest class and portion of the state then, and by the <lb/>
            science that presides over and governs it, is the whole city <lb/>
            wisely established on natural principles; and this class, as it <lb/>
            seems, is by nature the smallest, whose business it is to have a. <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. c. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            share in that science, which of all others ought alone to be <lb/>
            denominated wisdom. Your remark, replied he, is perfectly <lb/>
            true. We have found then, I know not how, one of the <lb/>
            four, both as respects its nature and the part of the state in <lb/>
            which it resides. And for my part, said he, I think it has <lb/>
            been sufficiently described.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—But as to fortitude, both as respects itself, <lb/>
            and the particular part of the state in which it resides, on <lb/>
            account of which the state is termed brave, that can be <lb/>
            no difficult matter to discover. How so ? Who, said I <lb/>
            would call a state brave or cowardly, with relation to any <lb/>
            other than that particular portion which makes war and <lb/>
            fights in its defence ? No one would, said he, with relation to <lb/>
            any other. No, said I, for I do not think that the other <lb/>
            classes therein, whether cowardly or brave, can have any <lb/>
            influence to make it either the one or the other. No, indeed. <lb/>
            Ihe state then is brave in a certain part of itself, because it <lb/>
            contains such a power as will constantly maintain its opinion <lb/>
            about things dreadful, as to their being these very things, and <lb/>
            such like, just as the lawgiver inculcated during training : <lb/>
            Do you not call this fortitude ? I have not thoroughly <lb/>
            comprehended, said he, what you say; so tell it over again. <lb/>
            Fortitude, said I, I term a kind of preservative. What sort <lb/>
            of preservative? A preservative of opinion formed by law <lb/>
            in a course of education about things dreadful, as to their <lb/>
            nature and quality; and I called it a constant preservative, <lb/>
            because one retains it both in pains and pleasures, desires <lb/>
            and fears, and never casts it off; aDd, if you please, I will <lb/>
            liken it to what I think it closely resembles. Pray do. <lb/>
            Do not you know then, said I, that dyers, when they want <lb/>
            to dye their wool, that it may be purple, choose out of ever <lb/>
            so many colours only the white, and then prepare and <lb/>
            manage it with no trifling pains, so that it may best take a <lb/>
            bright hue, and then they dye it? And whatever is dyed in <lb/>
            this manner is of an indelible dye; nor can any washing, <lb/>
            either without or with soap, take away its hue; but as for <lb/>
            wool not thus managed, you know of what sort it proves, <lb/>
            whether one dye either this or other colours, without previous <lb/>
            preparation. I know, said he, that they are easily washed <lb/>
            out, and get shabby.* Suppose then, that we, too. were to per­ <note type="footnote"> * The original is <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελοι̃α</foreign>–a word not very easy to render. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 9. </note> <lb/>
            form according to our ability a similar operation, when select­ <lb/>
            ing our soldiers, and instructing them in music and gym­ <lb/>
            nastics; and that we should attend to no other object, than that <lb/>
            they should obediently and in the best manner receive the laws, <lb/>
            as they would a colour, and so acquire indelible opinions <lb/>
            about the dreadful, and other things as well, through having <lb/>
            had a suitable temper and education ; these leys then, <lb/>
            however strongly detersive, could not wash away their dye, <lb/>
            whether they be pleasure (which is more powerful in effecting <lb/>
            this than any alkali* or ley whatever), or pain, fear, and <lb/>
            desire, which exceed in power all other solvents.-Such a <lb/>
            power then, and constant maintenance of right and legitimate <lb/>
            opinion about what is dreadful or not so, I term and define <lb/>
            to be fortitude, unless you offer some other meaning. No; I <lb/>
            can offer none, said he; for you seem to me to hold, that <lb/>
            when a right opinion about these matters arises without <lb/>
            education, it is both savage and slavish, and not at all <lb/>
            according to law; and you give it some other name besides <lb/>
            fortitude. Your remark is quite true, said I. I admit, then, <lb/>
            that this is fortitude. Admit further, said I, that it is poli­ <lb/>
            tical fortitude, and you will admit rightly; but we will inquire <lb/>
            about it, if you please, more perfectly some other time ; for, <lb/>
            at present, it is not this, but justice, that we are seeking; <lb/>
            and with regard to the inquiry about the other, that has, in <lb/>
            my opinion, been carried far enough. You say well, he <lb/>
            rejoined.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—There yet remain, said I, two [virtues] in <lb/>
            the state which we must consider,-namely, temperance, and <lb/>
            that, for the sake of which we have been searching after all <lb/>
            the rest,-that is justice. Certainly. How then can we <lb/>
            find out justice, so as to trouble ourselves no further about <lb/>
            temperance ? I truly neither know, said he, nor do I wish <lb/>
            it to be developed before the other, if at least we are on that <lb/>
            account to dismiss altogether the consideration of temperance ; <lb/>
            but, pray oblige me, and consider this before the other. I for <lb/>
            my part am quite willing, said I; for I should be acting wrongly <note type="footnote"> * The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλαστραι̃ον</foreign>, lit. nitre (nitrate of potash), is derived from <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            not to do so.* Consider then, said he. We must consider, <lb/>
            I replied; and as it appears from this point of view, it seems <lb/>
            to resemble a sort of symphony and harmony more than the <lb/>
            virtues formerly mentioned. How ? Temperance, said I, <lb/>
            is somehow a certain decorum, and a restraint, as one may <lb/>
            say, exercised over certain pleasures and desires; and when <lb/>
            one boasts of being superior to oneself, and many other such- <lb/>
            like expressions, these are mentioned as indications of it; are <lb/>
            they not ? Yes,—they are its leading indications, said he. But <lb/>
            is not the expression, " superior to oneself," ridiculous ?for <lb/>
            he who is superior to himself must somehow also be in­ <lb/>
            ferior to himself; and the inferior be the superior,-for the <lb/>
            same person is spoken of in all these cases. How otherwise ? <lb/>
            To me, however, said I, the expression seems to denote, that <lb/>
            in the same man, as regards his soul, there is one part better, <lb/>
            and another worse; and that when the better part of his <lb/>
            nature governs the inferior, this is what is termed being <lb/>
            superior to himself, and expresses a commendation; but <lb/>
            when, owing to bad education or associations, that better <lb/>
            and smaller part is swayed by the superior power of the <lb/>
            worse part,-then one says, by way of reproach and blame, <lb/>
            that the person thus affected is inferior to himself and alto­ <lb/>
            gether in disorder. Aye,-it would seem so, said he. Look <lb/>
            then, said I, at our new state, and you will find one of these <lb/>
            in it: for you will agree, that it may justly be addressed as <lb/>
            superior to itself, if that state, in which the better part <lb/>
            governs the worse, is called temperate and superior to itself. <lb/>
            I do see it, said he ;-and you say true. And moreover one <lb/>
            may find very many and various desires, and pleasures, <lb/>
            and pains, especially among children, and women, and do­ <lb/>
            mestics, and likewise among the greatest and most depraved <lb/>
            portion of those who are called free. Certainly. But as for <lb/>
            the simple and moderate desires, which are led by the intel­ <lb/>
            lect, with judgment and right opinion, you will meet with <lb/>
            them only in the few, those, namely, of the best temper and <lb/>
            best educated. True, said he. And do not you see that <lb/>
            these things are contained in our state, and that there too the <lb/>
            desires of the many and the baser part are restrained by the <note type="footnote"> * The original is very elliptical :–’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλλὰ μέντοι, ἡν</foreign> 3' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲγὼ, βούλομαί <lb/>

            desires and prudence of the smaller and more moderate part ? <lb/>
            I do, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—If then, we are to call any state superior to <lb/>
            pleasures and desires, and to itself also, this may be so called. <lb/>
            Yes, by all means, said he. And is it not on all these <lb/>
            accounts temperate ? Quite so, said he. And if, again, in <lb/>
            any other state, the governors and the governed agree in <lb/>
            opinion on the point, as to the fit governing party, it is to be <lb/>
            found in this :-do you not think so ? I am strongly of that <lb/>
            opinion. In whom then of the citizens will you say that <lb/>
            temperance resides, when they are thus situated;—in the go­ <lb/>
            vernors, or the governed ? In both of them, probably, said he. <lb/>
            Do you see then, said I, that we just now rightly guessed, <lb/>
            that temperance resembles a kind of harmony ? How so ? Be­ <lb/>
            cause-not as fortitude and wisdom (each of which resides in <lb/>
            a certain part, the latter making the state wise, and the former <lb/>
            courageous), not after this manner does temperance render <lb/>
            the state temperate ; but it is naturally diffused through the <lb/>
            whole, making the weakest and the strongest and the in­ <lb/>
            termediate all to agree, either in prudence, if you will, or if <lb/>
            you will, in strength, magnitude, or in substance, or anything <lb/>
            else of the same kind; so that most justly may we say, that <lb/>
            this concord is temperance, a natural consent between the worse <lb/>
            and the better part, [with reference to the question] which of <lb/>
            them ought to govern, either in the state or in each individual. <lb/>
            I am quite of the same opinion, said he. Well then, said <lb/>
            I, three qualities in our state, it would seem, have been <lb/>
            clearly discovered: but with respect to the remaining spe­ <lb/>
            cies, owing to which the state has the quality of virtue; <lb/>
            what can it be ? It is plain that it is justice. It is plain. <lb/>
            Ought we not then, Glaucon, like huntsmen, closely sur­ <lb/>
            rounding a thicket, to take great care that justice does not <lb/>
            somehow or other escape, and vanish from our sight ?-for it <lb/>
            is clear that it is somewhere here. Look earnestly, therefore, <lb/>
            to spy it out, if you can any how see it sooner than me, <lb/>
            and then point it out to me. Would that I could, said he; <lb/>
            but if you will use me rather as an attendant, and one able <lb/>
            only to perceive what is pointed out to him, you will then be <lb/>
            treating me just as you ought. Call on the gods with me, <lb/>
            said I, and follow. I will do so, said he; do you only lead the <lb/>
            way. To me, said I, this seems a place somehow hard of access, <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. TV. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
            and overcast with shadow :-it is indeed dark, and hard to <lb/>
            penetrate;—but still we must go on. We must, said he. <lb/>
            And I perceiving, said, Ho ! Ho! Glaucon, we seem to <lb/>
            have some track; and I think that it will not altogether <lb/>
            escape us. You tell good news, said he. Verily, said I, <lb/>
            our senses are somewhat blunted. As how ? Long since, <lb/>
            even from the first, my fine fellow, has it been rolling <lb/>
            at our feet; and we perceived it not, but made the most <lb/>
            ridiculous figure, like those who sometimes seek for what <lb/>
            they already have in their hands: -so we did not per­ <lb/>
            ceive it, but were looking out to a distance ; and thus per­ <lb/>
            haps it escaped us. How mean you ? said he. Thus, said <lb/>
            I ;—that I think, although we have been long talking and <lb/>
            hearing of it, we do not understand ourselves, as to the <lb/>
            manner in which we expressed it. A long preamble, said he, <lb/>
            to one who is eager to hear.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—Well now, said I, listen whether I say any­ <lb/>
            thing to the point:—for what we at first settled, when <lb/>
            regulating the state, as what ought always to be done,­ <lb/>
            that, I think, or a species thereof, is justice :-this surely we <lb/>
            settled, and frequently mentioned, if you remember ;-that <lb/>
            every one ought to apply himself to one thing, with reference <lb/>
            to the state,—to that, namely, to which his genius most <lb/>
            naturally inclines him? Yes, we did say so. And also, that <lb/>
            attending to one's own affairs, and not busying oneself about <lb/>
            many things, is justice, and this we have not only heard from <lb/>
            many others, but have frequently said ourselves. We have <lb/>
            said so. This then, my friend, said I, somehow seems to be <lb/>
            justice, to attend to one's own business.—Do you know whence <lb/>
            I infer this ? No ; pray tell me, said he. Besides what we <lb/>
            have already considered in the state,-namely, temperance, <lb/>
            fortitude, and wisdom,-this, said I, seems to remain, which <lb/>
            enables all these both to have a being in the state and to afford <lb/>
            safety to its indwellers as long as it continues therein ; and we <lb/>
            said likewise, that justice would be that remaining part, if we <lb/>
            found the other three. It must be so, said he. But if, said <lb/>
            I, you want to judge, which of these, by its presence in the <lb/>
            state, will do it the greatest proportionate good ; it would be <lb/>
            difficult to determine whether the coincidence of opinion <lb/>
            between the governors and the governed, or the maintenance <lb/>
            of legitimate opinion among the soldiers about what is <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
            dreadful, and what is not so,--or what is wisdom and guardian­ <lb/>
            ship in the rulers,- or whether this, by its existence in the <lb/>
            state, makes it proportionally best,—namely, when child and <lb/>
            woman, bond and free, artificer, magistrate, and subject, every <lb/>
            one in short attends to his own business, and does not meddle. <lb/>
            Yes, it is hard to decide, said he, of course. With reference, <lb/>
            then, to the virtue of a state, that power which makes each <lb/>
            person in it attend to his own business, rivals, as it seems, its <lb/>
            wisdom, temperance, and courage. Undoubtedly so, said he. <lb/>
            Will you not then constitute justice as a co-rival with these, <lb/>
            with reference to the virtue of a state ? By all means. Consider, <lb/>
            then, whether you agree with me in this: will you enjoin the <lb/>
            rulers to give just decisions in judgment? Of course. And in <lb/>
            giving judgment, what else are they to aim at in preference to <lb/>
            this,—namely, that no one shall have what belongs to others, <lb/>
            or be deprived of his own ? No; they [must aim] at this. <lb/>
            And [do they not aim at it,] when acting justly? Yes. And <lb/>
            thus justice is acknowledged to be the habitual practice of <lb/>
            one's own proper and special work ? It is so. See then, if <lb/>
            you agree with me :-suppose a carpenter to take in hand <lb/>
            the work of a shoemaker, or a shoemaker the work of <lb/>
            a carpenter, exchanging either their tools or wages; or if <lb/>
            the same man undertake both, and make all the other ex­ <lb/>
            changes ; think you that the state would be much injured ? <lb/>
            Not very much, said he. But methinks, if a craftsman, or <lb/>
            one born to a money-getting employment, should afterwards, <lb/>
            through being elated by wealth, popularity, strength, or any <lb/>
            thing else of the kind, try to advance into the military class, <lb/>
            or out of the military class into that of counsellor and guardian, <lb/>
            when unworthy of it,—and these should exchange tools and <lb/>
            rewards; or if the same man should undertake to do all these <lb/>
            things at once; then, I suppose, you will be of opinion, that <lb/>
            this interchange of things and this multiplicity of employments <lb/>
            by a single person is the destruction of the state. By all means. <lb/>
            A meddling spirit, then, in these three classes, and the change <lb/>
            from one to another, is the greatest injury to the state, and <lb/>
            may be most correctly called its depravity. Aye, truly so. <lb/>
            But will not you say that injustice is the greatest ill a state <lb/>
            can do itself? Of course. This then is injustice.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Again we say, as follows: The peculiar <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IT. c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            occupation of the money-getting, the auxiliary, and the guar­ <lb/>
            dian class, when each of them dOGS his own work in a state, <lb/>
            will be the contrary of the other, that is justice, and will make <lb/>
            the state just. The case appears to me, said he, to be no <lb/>
            otherwise than thus. Let us not as yet, said I, affirm this <lb/>
            for certain : but if it shall be conceded by us, that this kind <lb/>
            enters into each individual, and that there is justice, we will <lb/>
            then agree; for what shall we say ? but if not, then we <lb/>
            must push our inquiries further.-But now let us finish the in­ <lb/>
            quiry on which we were engaged,-namely, whether, in judging, <lb/>
            we should be better able, by first contemplating justice in some <lb/>
            of the greater objects that possess it, to distinguish its nature <lb/>
            in a single man, and that as a state appeared to us this very <lb/>
            object; we thus therefore formed it as well as we possibly <lb/>
            could, in the assurance that justice would be found in one <lb/>
            that is good. As to what we have discovered in the state, <lb/>
            then, let us now transfer and apply it to a single person; <lb/>
            and if the two correspond, it will be well; but if there be any <lb/>
            difference in the individual, we will go back again to the state, <lb/>
            and put it to the test; and, perhaps, in considering them <lb/>
            side by side, and by striking them, we shall make justice shine <lb/>
            forth, like fire from flints; and when once clearly apparent, <lb/>
            we can then firmly establish it among ourselves. Aye, you <lb/>
            are speaking quite in the right way, said he; and thus, too, we <lb/>
            must act.</p>
          <p>With respect then, said I, to what may be termed the <lb/>
            same, whether greater or less, does it happen to be dis­ <lb/>
            similar in that respect in which we call it the same, or is <lb/>
            it similar ? Similar, said he. The just man then, said I, <lb/>
            will not at all differ from the just state, as respects the idea of <lb/>
            justice, but will be similar to it. Aye, similar, said he. How­ <lb/>
            ever a state appeared to be just, because three kinds of dis­ <lb/>
            positions being in it, each performed its own work; but <lb/>
            it appeared to be temperate, brave, and wise, on account <lb/>
            of certain other affections and habits of these very same <lb/>
            kinds. True, said he. And in that case, my friend, we <lb/>
            shall deem it proper, that the individual, who has these very <lb/>
            same principles in his' soul (namely, temperance, fortitude, <lb/>
            wisdom), should have a good right, from having the same <lb/>
            affections with the state, to be called by the same names ? <pb n="120"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            He needs must, said he. Here again, my clever fellow, <lb/>
            we have fallen into a trifling discussion* about the soul, <lb/>
            whether it does or does not contain within itself these three <lb/>
            principles. I do not think it is a trifling one, said he: for <lb/>
            probably, Socrates, the common saying is true, that things <lb/>
            excellent are difficult. They seem so, said I. And be assured <lb/>
            of this at least, Glaucon, that, in my opinion, we shall <lb/>
            never comprehend this matter accurately by such methods <lb/>
            as we are now using in our conversation, because the <lb/>
            road which really leads to it is longer and of greater extent: <lb/>
            still we will consider it in a manner consistent with our for­ <lb/>
            mer disquisitions and inquiries. Ought we not to acquiesce <lb/>
            in this ? said he : for to me at least, and for the present, it <lb/>
            would be satisfactory enough. Aye, and for me too, said I, <lb/>
            it will be quite sufficient. Do not get tired then, said he ; <lb/>
            but pursue the inquiry. Is it then necessary, said I, that <lb/>
            we should acknowledge the very same characters and man­ <lb/>
            ners to exist in every individual that are found in the <lb/>
            state? because there is no other source whence they ar­ <lb/>
            rived thither. It were ridiculous, indeed, to imagine <lb/>
            that the high spirit for which the Thracians, Scythians, <lb/>
            and nearly all the northern nations are reputed, does not <lb/>
            arise from individual personages; and the same may be said <lb/>
            respecting the love of learning, which one may especially <lb/>
            deem natural to the people of this country,-or, with reference <lb/>
            to the love of riches, which we may say prevailed espe­ <lb/>
            cially among the Phœnicians and the people of Egypt. <lb/>
            Quite so, said he. It is so, of course, said I; and it is not <lb/>
            hard of recognition. No, indeed.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—This, however, is truly hard [to decide,] whe­ <lb/>
            ther we perform our separate acts by one and the same power, or <lb/>
            whether, as they are three, we perform one by one, and another <lb/>
            by another; that is, learn by one, get angry by another, and <lb/>
            by a third covet the pleasures of nutrition and propagation, and <lb/>
            others akin to these; or whether, when we devote ourselves <lb/>
            to them, we act on each with the whole soul: these matters <note type="footnote"> * Stallbaum reads—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς φαυ̃λόν ε σκέμμα</foreign>, which is the reading of the <lb/>
            best MSS., though the old editions read—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ εἰς φαυ̃λόν γε</foreign>. The words <lb/>
            are spoken ironically. </note> <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            are difficult adequately to determine. I think so too, said he. <lb/>
            Let us try to define these things, whether they are the same <lb/>
            with one another, or different. How can we ? It is plain <lb/>
            that the same thing evidently cannot at the same time pro­ <lb/>
            duce or experience contrary effects in the same respect, and <lb/>
            relatively to the same object; so that, if we ever find any­ <lb/>
            thing thus occurring, we shall know that it was not one <lb/>
            and the same thing, but several. Granted. Attend now to <lb/>
            what I am saying. Proceed, replied he. Is it possible for <lb/>
            the same thing, considered in the same relation, to be both at <lb/>
            rest and in motion ? By no means. Let us define this more <lb/>
            accurately still, lest, as we proceed, we be inclined to waver :— <lb/>
            for, if one were to say that, when a man stands, though <lb/>
            yet moving his hands and head, the same person is at once <lb/>
            still and in motion; we should not, I conceive, reckon this a <lb/>
            correct mode of speaking, but that one part of him is at rest, <lb/>
            and another part in motion :-is it not so ? Just so. But <lb/>
            if a person arguing thus were to proceed jestingly and <lb/>
            facetiously allege that tops are wholly at rest, but yet <lb/>
            are at the same time in motion, when, fixed on the same <lb/>
            point, they are whirled about their centre,-or that any­ <lb/>
            thing else going round in a circle in the same position <lb/>
            does the same,—we should not admit it, as it is not in <lb/>
            the same respect that they both stand still and are in <lb/>
            motion ; but we should say that they have in them the <lb/>
            straight line [i. e. the axis] and the circumference ; and that, <lb/>
            with relation to the axis they are at rest (because it inclines <lb/>
            to neither side) ; but with relation to the circumference, they <lb/>
            move in a circle :-and again, if, while it is whirling round, <lb/>
            its perpendicularity inclines either to the right or the left, <lb/>
            forwards or backwards, then it is by no means at rest. <lb/>
            Very right, said he. No assertion then of this kind will <lb/>
            frighten us; nor shall any one persuade us, that anything, <lb/>
            being one and the same, can do and suffer contraries at one <lb/>
            and the same time, in the same respect, and relatively to <lb/>
            the same object. Me, at any rate, he shall not, said he. <lb/>
            But once more, said I, not to be tedious in going over <lb/>
            and refuting all these quibbles, let us proceed on the <lb/>
            supposition, that this is really the case, acknowledging, also, <lb/>
            that if at any time these things are found to be different <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. iv. c. 14. </note> <lb/>
            from what they now are, all that we have gained will be lost. <lb/>
            This then, said he, is what we must do.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—Well then,-nodding an assent, said I, and <lb/>
            making a sign of dissent, desiring to take a thing and refusing <lb/>
            it, attracting or repelling-will you reckon all such things con­ <lb/>
            traries respectively, whether actions or passions;-for it matters <lb/>
            not which ? Contraries, certainly, said he. What then, said I,— <lb/>
            thirst, hunger, and the desires generally,-and further, to wish <lb/>
            and to will, may not all these be considered as of the same kind <lb/>
            with the species just mentioned?—As for instance, will you <lb/>
            not always say of a man who desires, that his soul aims after <lb/>
            what it desires, or attracts to itself what it wishes to have?-Or <lb/>
            again, so far as the soul wishes something to be given to it, <lb/>
            does it not make a sign for it, as if a person were asking for <lb/>
            it, through desire of acquiring its possession ? I should say <lb/>
            so. But what ?-to be unwilling, not to wish, and not to <lb/>
            desire,—shall we not deem them synonymous with repelling <lb/>
            and driving off from the soul, and so all things else that are <lb/>
            contrary of the former ? Of course. This being the case, <lb/>
            shall we say that there is a certain species of desires, and <lb/>
            that the most conspicuous are those which we call thirst <lb/>
            and hunger ? We shall say so, he replied. Is not one the <lb/>
            desire of drinking, the other of eating ? Yes. In the case <lb/>
            of thirst then, is it, so far as it is thirst, a desire in the <lb/>
            soul of anything more than what we were saying; and as <lb/>
            far as thirst goes,—is there a thirst for hot drink, or <lb/>
            cold, for much or little, or in short for some particular kind of <lb/>
            drink?—or again, if heat be added to the thirst, will it not <lb/>
            readily occasion a desire for cold drink; but if cold [be added <lb/>
            to it,] then [a desire] for warm drink: and if the thirst be <lb/>
            great, owing to numerous causes, will it not occasion a desire <lb/>
            for much drink, but if small, [a desire] for little; while as <lb/>
            for the desire of thirst itself, it never becomes the desire of <lb/>
            anything else, but of that only to which it naturally belongs, <lb/>
            -and so, also, of hunger with reference to meat? Just so, said <lb/>
            he, every desire belongs in itself to that alone of which it is <lb/>
            the desire; but whether they be desires of such or such a <lb/>
            particular kind, are adventitious circumstances. Let no one <lb/>
            then, said I, trouble us, as if we were inadvertent, [by object­ <lb/>
            ing to us] that no one desires drink, but good drink,-nor meat, <lb/>
            but good meat ;-inasmuch as all men desire what is good. <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            If then thirst be a desire, it is one of something good ; whether <lb/>
            it be of drink, or anything else whatever,-and in the same <lb/>
            way with all the other desires. Aye, perhaps, replied he, the <lb/>
            man who says this may be deemed to say something to the <lb/>
            purpose. But in truth, said I, things naturally relative, <lb/>
            refer in each particular, as I think, to this or that object, to <lb/>
            which they belong, while in their individual character they <lb/>
            refer only to themselves individually. I do not understand, <lb/>
            said he. Do not you understand, said I, that greater is rela­ <lb/>
            tively greater than something ? Certainly. Is it not <lb/>
            greater than the lesser? Yes. And that which is much <lb/>
            greater than that which is much less; is it not ? Yes. And <lb/>
            that which was formerly greater than that which was for­ <lb/>
            merly less, and that which is to be greater than that which is <lb/>
            to be less ? Of course, said he. And in like manner, the <lb/>
            more numerous has reference to the less numerous, and <lb/>
            the double to the half, and so in all such-like cases ;-and <lb/>
            further, the heavier to the lighter, and the swifter to the <lb/>
            slower; and further still, the hot to the cold; and all such <lb/>
            like, are they not thus related ? Entirely so. But what <lb/>
            as to the sciences ;-is not the case the same ?-for, science <lb/>
            itself is the science of pure learning, or of whatever else <lb/>
            one sees fit to make it the science; while, on the other <lb/>
            hand, a certain particular science, of a particular kind, refers <lb/>
            to a certain particular kind, and also to a particular object. <lb/>
            My meaning is as follows :-when the science of building <lb/>
            houses arose, was it not so far separated from the other sciences, <lb/>
            as to acquire the name of architecture? Of course. Was it <lb/>
            not so, because it was of a kind like none else? Yes. Was <lb/>
            it not then from its being the art of such a particular thing, that <lb/>
            it became itself such a particular art;—and are not all other <lb/>
            arts and sciences in like manner ? They are so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—Consider then, said I, that this is what <lb/>
            I wanted to express, if you now understand me; namely, <lb/>
            that things which are relative, taken by themselves alone, <lb/>
            relate to themselves alone, but considered as of such a <lb/>
            quality, relate to particular objects. I do not say, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that a science altogether resembles that of which <lb/>
            it is the science; (as if, for example, the science of <lb/>
            healthy and sickly were itself healthy and sickly, or the <lb/>
            science of good and evil itself good and evil;) but as <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. C. 15. </note> <lb/>
            science is not constituted the science of that generally of <lb/>
            which it is the science, but only of a certain quality of it <lb/>
            (that is, of its healthy and sickly state), so it comes to be <lb/>
            itself a particular science; and hence it is no longer called <lb/>
            simply a science, but the medicinal science, the particular <lb/>
            class to which it belongs being superadded. I understand <lb/>
            you, said he; and I think it is so. As for thirst then, said I, <lb/>
            will you not class it among those things which have relation <lb/>
            to something else, so far as it is what it is? and is not <lb/>
            thirst a thirst for something? I should, certainly, said <lb/>
            he, for drink. And does not a particular thirst desire a <lb/>
            particular drink ?—whereas thirst in general is neither of <lb/>
            much nor of little, nor of good nor bad, nor, in one word, <lb/>
            of any particular kind ; but abstractly and in general, the <lb/>
            natural desire of drink. Assuredly. The soul of the man <lb/>
            then who thirsts, so far as he thirsts, wishes nothing fur­ <lb/>
            ther than to drink; and this he covets, and to this he <lb/>
            hurries ? Clearly so. If therefore, when the soul is <lb/>
            athirst, anything draws it back, must it not be some dif­ <lb/>
            ferent principle from that which excites thirst, and leads it <lb/>
            as a wild beast to drink ;-since it is impossible, we say, for <lb/>
            the same thing, by itself, and at the same time, to produce <lb/>
            contrary results from the same cause ? It is indeed impossible. <lb/>
            Just as it is not proper, methinks, to say of an archer, that <lb/>
            his hands at once propel and draw in the bow, but that <lb/>
            one of his hands propels it, and the other draws it <lb/>
            in ? Assuredly, said he. Can we say, then, that there <lb/>
            are some, who when athirst are not willing to drink ? <lb/>
            Certainly, said he, many, and often. What then, said I, <lb/>
            is one to say of these persons ?-Might it not be said, <lb/>
            that there is something in their soul that prompts them to <lb/>
            drink, and likewise something that restrains them, quite <lb/>
            different, and that prevails over the prompting princi­ <lb/>
            ple ? I think so, said he. Does not the restraining princi­ <lb/>
            ple then, whenever it arises, arise from reason ; while those that <lb/>
            lead and urge men onwards, proceed from affections and <lb/>
            ailments? It appears so. We shall not then, said I, be un­ <lb/>
            reasonable in defining these as distinctly two, and separate <lb/>
            from one another, if we call that with which one reasons, <lb/>
            the rational part of the soul, but that part with which it loves, <lb/>
            and hungers, and thirsts, and is carried away by desires, the <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            irrational and concupiscent part, as associated with certain <lb/>
            gratifications and pleasures. We shall not, said he ; but we may <lb/>
            reasonably regard them in this light. Let these two then, <lb/>
            said I, be defined as distinct principles in the soul. But as to <lb/>
            that of anger, and by which we are angry, is it a third prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, or is it of like nature with one or other of these two ? <lb/>
            Perhaps, said he, with one of them, the concupiscent. But <lb/>
            I believe, said I, what I have somewhere heard : —Leon­ <lb/>
            tius, son of Aglaion, as he was returning from the Piræus, <lb/>
            along the outside of the northern wall, perceiving some <lb/>
            dead bodies lying close to the place of public punish­ <lb/>
            ment,* had a desire to look at them, but yet at the same <lb/>
            time revolted therefrom and turned away; and for a while <lb/>
            he resisted, and covered his eyes, but, at last, overcome by <lb/>
            his desire, ran with eyes wide open towards the dead bodies, <lb/>
            and said : " Here now, ye wretched eyes of mine! glut your­ <lb/>
            selves with this fine spectacle." I too have heard it, said he. <lb/>
            This story now shows, said I, that anger sometimes opposes <lb/>
            the desires, as being distinct from each other. Yes, said <lb/>
            he, it does show it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—Do we not then in other cases, and very fre­ <lb/>
            quently, perceive, said I, when the appetites compel any one <lb/>
            against his reason, that he reproaches himself, and is angry at <lb/>
            the compelling principle within him; and that like two <lb/>
            persons at variance, the anger of such a person becomes an <lb/>
            ally to reason; but that it sides with the desires when reason <lb/>
            decides that no opposition is to be offered, you will say, <lb/>
            I think, that you have never perceived anything of this <lb/>
            kind either in yourself, nor yet in any other? No, by <lb/>
            Zeus, replied he. What then, said I, is it not the case, <lb/>
            when a man imagines he is doing a wrong, that the <lb/>
            more generous he is, the less is he apt to be angry, how­ <lb/>
            ever he may suffer hunger or cold, or other like privations, <lb/>
            from one, who, as he thinks, inflicts them with justice ?— <lb/>
            And, as I have said, his anger will not incline him to rise <lb/>
            up against such an one. True, said he. But what ;-when <lb/>
            a man thinks himself injured, does he not in this case boil with <lb/>
            rage and become indignant and ally himself on the side of <lb/>
            what seems just; and under all the sufferings of hunger, <lb/>
            cold, and the like, does he not bear up and strive to conquer; <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τψ̃ δημείψ</foreign>, which admits of no concise rendering. </note> <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. IT. </note> <lb/>
            nor does he cease from his generous toils, until he has either <lb/>
            accomplished them, or dies, or, like a dog by the shepherd, <lb/>
            is called off and pacified by the rational principle within him ? <lb/>
            Certainly, said he, it is precisely like what you say; for, <lb/>
            in our state, we appointed the auxiliaries to be obedient, like <lb/>
            dogs, to the state rulers, as being shepherds of the state. <lb/>
            You quite understand, said I, what I mean to say :-but <lb/>
            have you considered this also ? What ? That here apparently, <lb/>
            as regards the irascible, the reverse takes place from what <lb/>
            took place in the former instance,—for then we reckoned <lb/>
            it the same as the concupiscent; but now we say it is <lb/>
            far from it, or rather that, in the sedition of the soul, it <lb/>
            more willingly arrays itself on the side of the rational part. <lb/>
            Entirely so, said he. Is it then as something entirely distinct, <lb/>
            or as a species of the rational ;-so as that there are not three <lb/>
            species, but only two in the soul, the rational and concupis­ <lb/>
            cent ?-or, as there were three species which completed the <lb/>
            city, the money-getting, the auxiliary, the deliberative ; so, in <lb/>
            the soul, is this irascible a third natural principle, auxiliary to <lb/>
            the rational, when not corrupted by bad education? Of course, <lb/>
            it must, said he, be a third. Yes, said I, if at least it seem <lb/>
            at all different from the rational, just as it seemed to be dis­ <lb/>
            tinct from the concupiscent. Aye, that is not hard to see, <lb/>
            said he;—and as a proof of this, one may see, even in <lb/>
            little children, that quite from their infancy they are full of <lb/>
            anger, while some of them, at least in my opinion, never have <lb/>
            any share in reason, the majority indeed only arriving at <lb/>
            it but late in life. Aye, truly, said I, you are right. And <lb/>
            in the brute beasts, too, one may observe yet further, that <lb/>
            what you say is really the case ; and besides this, it is attested <lb/>
            also by what we formerly cited from Homer*- <lb/>
            His breast he struck, and thus his heart reproved ;— <lb/>
            for, in this passage, Homer has plainly made one part reprove <lb/>
            the other; that part, namely, which reasons about good <lb/>
            and evil, to reprove the part which is unreasonably angry. You <lb/>
            are quite right, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—These things, said I, we have agreed to <lb/>
            after some difficulty ; and it is now sufficiently acknowledged, <lb/>
            that the same sort of principles that are in a state reside also <note type="footnote"> * Horn. Odyss. lib. xx. v. 17. </note> <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. C. 17.] </note> <lb/>
            in the soul of every individual, and equal in number. Must <lb/>
            it not, then, necessarily follow, that in whatever manner the <lb/>
            state is wise, and in whatever respect, after the same manner <lb/>
            and in the same respect, the individual is so also? Of course. <lb/>
            And in whatever respects, and after whatever manner, the <lb/>
            individual is brave, in the same respect, and after the same <lb/>
            manner, a state is brave also ? and so in all other respects, <lb/>
            both are the same as regards virtue ? Necessarily so. And <lb/>
            I think, Glaucon, it may be said that a man is so just in the <lb/>
            same way as a state is so. This also must needs be the case. <lb/>
            Aye ; but have we not somehow or other forgotten this, that the <lb/>
            state is just, when every one of the three species in it does its <lb/>
            own particular work ? No, said he, I do not think we have <lb/>
            forgotten that point. We must remember then likewise, that <lb/>
            each of us will be just, and do his own work, each part of whose <lb/>
            soul does its own proper duty. Aye, said he, we must be <lb/>
            sure to recollect that. Is it not proper, then, that the rational <lb/>
            part should govern, as being wise, and charged with the care <lb/>
            of the whole soul; and that the spirited part should obey <lb/>
            and ally itself to the other? Certainly. Will not the mixture <lb/>
            then, as we said, of music and gymnastics, make the two <lb/>
            to harmonize by exalting and nurturing the one with ex­ <lb/>
            cellent arguments and good discipline, while it unbends the <lb/>
            other by soothing and rendering it mild through harmony and <lb/>
            . rhythm? Assuredly, said he. And when these two are <lb/>
            thus nurtured and have been truly taught and practised in their <lb/>
            own affairs, they will preside over the concupiscent part, <lb/>
            which in every one occupies the largest part of the soul, <lb/>
            and by its nature is insatiable of wealth; and they will <lb/>
            take care, lest, having acquired growth and strength by <lb/>
            being filled with bodily pleasures, as they are termed, it <lb/>
            become discontented with its own work, and so attempt to <lb/>
            enslave and rule over those it ought not, and thus wholly upset <lb/>
            the entire system of life. Certainly, said he. And by this <lb/>
            principle, said I, will not the two maintain a good guard <lb/>
            against enemies from without, owing to their joint influence <lb/>
            over both soul and body, the one laying down the plans, and <lb/>
            the other fighting in obedience to its leader, and executing <lb/>
            with fortitude the plans laid down ? Such is the case. And I <lb/>
            think we call a man brave, when, through all the pains and <lb/>
            pleasures of life, the spirit maintains the opinion dictated by <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 18. </note> <lb/>
            reason about what is terrible, and what is not so. Right, said he. <lb/>
            And we call a man wise, from that small part which governs <lb/>
            him, and dictates this, inasmuch as it possesses the knowledge <lb/>
            of what is expedient for each separately, and for the whole <lb/>
            of the three together. Certainly. And, do we not more­ <lb/>
            over term a man temperate, from the association and <lb/>
            harmony of these very principles, when the governing and <lb/>
            governed agree in one,-namely, when reason governs, and <lb/>
            when the others are not at variance therewith ? Temperance, <lb/>
            said he, is no other than this, either as respects the state or <lb/>
            the individual. But he will be just, owing to those causes and <lb/>
            in the manner which we have often before mentioned ? He <lb/>
            must. What then, said I; has anything blunted us, that we <lb/>
            should regard justice as anything else than what it is seen to <lb/>
            be in a state ? Not in my opinion at least, said he. In this <lb/>
            manner then (if there yet remain any doubt in the soul), let <lb/>
            us, by all means, satisfy ourselves by bringing the man into <lb/>
            difficult circumstances. As what ? For instance, if we be <lb/>
            compelled to declare, concerning such a state and a man born <lb/>
            and educated conformably thereto, whether such a man, if <lb/>
            intrusted with gold or silver, is likely to embezzle it,—who <lb/>
            do you think would imagine, that such an one would do it <lb/>
            sooner than those of a different character? No one would, said he. <lb/>
            Will not such an one then be free from sacrileges, thefts, and trea­ <lb/>
            cheries, either privately against his friends, or publicly against <lb/>
            the state ? He will. Nor will he ever, in any shape, be <lb/>
            faithless, either as to his oaths, or other compacts ? How should <lb/>
            he. Adulteries, neglect of parents, and impiety against the <lb/>
            gods, will be found then in any one rather than such a man as <lb/>
            this ? Aye, in any one else, truly, said he. And is not this <lb/>
            the cause of all these things,-that, of all the parts within <lb/>
            him each separate one does its own work, as to govern­ <lb/>
            ing and being governed ? This is it, and nothing else. <lb/>
            What else do you wish justice to be, except such a power as <lb/>
            produces men and states like these ? Not I, truly, said he, <lb/>
            for my part.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XYIII.—Our dream then, which we conjectured, is <lb/>
            at last accomplished; that on our very first attempt to found <lb/>
            our state we have apparently arrived by divine assistance at <lb/>
            a principle and pattern of justice? Quite so. And that, <lb/>
            Glaucon, was a certain image of justice, that the man na- <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. c. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            turally fitted for the office of a shoemaker, should make <lb/>
            shoes properly, and do nothing else; and that he also, who is <lb/>
            a carpenter, should do that work,-and so also, of the rest. <lb/>
            It appears so. In truth, then, of such a kind was justice, as it <lb/>
            seems ; nor does it regard merely a man's external action, <lb/>
            but what is really internal, relating to the man himself, <lb/>
            and what is properly his own; not allowing any principle <lb/>
            in him to attempt what is another's province, or to <lb/>
            meddle and interfere with what does not belong to it; but <lb/>
            really well establishing his own proper affairs, and maintaining <lb/>
            proper self-government, keeping due order, becoming his <lb/>
            own friend, and most naturally attuning these three principles, <lb/>
            as three musical strings, base, tenor, and treble, or whatever <lb/>
            others may intervene:-thus will he be led to combine all <lb/>
            these together, and out of many to form one whole, temperate, <lb/>
            attuned, and able to perform whatever is to be done, either <lb/>
            in acquiring wealth, or managing the body, or any public <lb/>
            affair or private bargain, and in all these cases reckoning <lb/>
            that action to be just and good, which always sustains and <lb/>
            promotes this habit; and so also calling the knowledge which <lb/>
            presides over this action wisdom,-and on the contrary, calling <lb/>
            that an unjust action, which destroys this habit,-and the <lb/>
            opinion which presides over this, folly. Perfectly true, So­ <lb/>
            crates, said he. Be it so, said I:—if then we should say, <lb/>
            that we have found out a just man and state, and the nature <lb/>
            of justice in both, I think we should not be considered alto­ <lb/>
            gether in error. No, by Zeus, said he. May we assume <lb/>
            it, then? We may.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—Be it so, said I. But we were next, <lb/>
            I think, to consider injustice ? Clearly so. Is it not then <lb/>
            necessarily a kind of variance between the three principles, <lb/>
            a kind of meddling and interfering spirit in things foreign <lb/>
            to their proper business, and an insurrection of some one <lb/>
            principle against the whole soul, to govern where it is not <lb/>
            its province, though it be really of such a nature, that it <lb/>
            ought to be in subjection to the governing principle ? I <lb/>
            imagine then we are to call this tumult and error by some such <lb/>
            names as these,—injustice, intemperance, cowardice, folly, <lb/>
            and in a word, all vices ? Just so, said he. To commit in­ <lb/>
            justice then, said I, and to be injurious, and likewise to act <lb/>
            justly, all these must be very manifest, if indeed injustice <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 19. </note> <lb/>
            and justice are so. How? Because,, said I, they do not differ <lb/>
            from what is salutary or noxious;—as the latter are in <lb/>
            the body, so are the former in the soul. In what way ? <lb/>
            said he. Such things as are healthy produce health, and <lb/>
            such as are noxious, disease. Yes. And does not acting <lb/>
            justly produce justice, — and acting unjustly, injustice ? <lb/>
            Necessarily so. To produce health, however, is to estab­ <lb/>
            lish everything in the body, so that they shall mutually <lb/>
            govern and be governed, conformably to nature,-while <lb/>
            the production of disease, on the other hand, consists in one <lb/>
            part governing and being governed by another, contrary <lb/>
            to nature. It is indeed. Then again, said I, to produce <lb/>
            justice, is it not to establish all in the soul, so that its parts <lb/>
            shall mutually govern and be governed according to nature ;­ <lb/>
            and does not injustice consist in governing and being governed <lb/>
            by one another contrary to nature? Plainly so, said he. Virtue <lb/>
            then, as it seems, is a kind of health, beauty, and good habit <lb/>
            of the soul; and vice its disease, deformity, and infirmity? <lb/>
            It is so. Do not honourable pursuits then lead to the <lb/>
            attainment of virtue, but dishonourable to that of vice? <lb/>
            They must. What remains for us to consider then is,­ <lb/>
            whether it be profitable to act justly, and pursue what is <lb/>
            honourable, and to be just, and whether a man can be of <lb/>
            such a character unconsciously or not;—or to act unjustly, and <lb/>
            to be unjust, though one be never punished, or reformed by <lb/>
            correction ? But, said he, Socrates, this inquiry seems, to <lb/>
            me at least, quite ridiculous;—that if in a corrupt state <lb/>
            of the body life be deemed not worth possession, not even <lb/>
            though accompanied by all kinds of meats and drinks, and <lb/>
            all wealth and power, yet when the nature of the vital prin­ <lb/>
            ciple is disordered and thoroughly corrupted, life will then <lb/>
            be worth having, though a man were to do everything <lb/>
            else that he likes, except ascertaining how he shall get <lb/>
            released from vice and injustice, and cultivate justice and <lb/>
            virtue,—since both these things have been proved such as <lb/>
            we have represented them.. Aye, it would be truly ridiculous, <lb/>
            said I. However, since we have arrived at such a point as <lb/>
            enables us most distinctly to perceive that these things <lb/>
            are so, we must not get weary. On no account, by Zeus, <lb/>
            said he, must we be weary. Come then, said I, and let <lb/>
            us see also how many principles vice possesses,-principles <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV. c. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            indeed that are worthy of attention. I am all attention, said <lb/>
            he ;only tell me. And truly now, said I;—since we have <lb/>
            reached this part of our discourse, it appears to me, as to <lb/>
            one looking from a height, that there is but one prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of virtue, while those of vice are infinite :—and of these <lb/>
            there are four, particularly deserving of mention. How say <lb/>
            you ? replied he. There seem to be as many classes of the soul <lb/>
            as there are forms of government. How many then? Five, said <lb/>
            I, of governments, and five of the soul. Name them, said lie. <lb/>
            What we have just described, replied I, is one species of <lb/>
            government; and it may have a twofold appellation ; for, if <lb/>
            among the rulers one prevails over the rest, it may be termed <lb/>
            a Monarchy,-but if there be several, an Aristocracy. <lb/>
            True, said he. I call this then, said I, one species; for, <lb/>
            whether there be several, or whether it be but one who <lb/>
            governs, they will never alter the principal laws of the state, <lb/>
            —because they will observe the nature and education we have <lb/>
            described. It is not likely, said lie.</p>

          <p>In the fifth book he shows how the magistracy is to be constituted, so as <lb/>
            to establish a prosperous state. True philosophy, says he, is its basis; <lb/>
            and this, so far from being superficial and affecting only the outward <lb/>
            bearing and life of the citizens, turns the mind away from all these <lb/>
            fleeting subjects to that which is real, positive, and consistent with the <lb/>
            knowledge of God. Carrying the subject somewhat back, therefore, <lb/>
            he considers in detail the subject-matter of philosophy, proving that it <lb/>
            is the knowledge both of virtue and of God, both of which are indis­ <lb/>
            pensable to a well-ordered state, in which either philosophers must be <lb/>
            rulers or vice versâ. As however he had said in the third book, that a <lb/>
            state's welfare depended on the community of ideas and of property, he <lb/>
            now shows in detail, how the duties of men and women are common in <lb/>
            a state, and how consequently themselves and their property too should <lb/>
            be common,-a notion which Aristotle rather severely handles in the <lb/>
            second book of the Politics (ch. 3), where he says, that, though the state <lb/>
            be one, but with this restriction, that we must bear in mind that to <lb/>
            different men belong different dispositions, and if <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐταξία</foreign> is gently to <lb/>
            be maintained, we must specially guard against confusion and unneces­ <lb/>
            sary interference, the certain means of downfal to a state.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—Such a state and government then, and such <lb/>
            a man as we have described, I term good and upright: <lb/>
            and if this government be an upright one, I reckon the <lb/>
            others bad and erroneous, both as to the regulations in states, <lb/>
            and the establishment of the moral nature in individuals, <lb/>
            inasmuch as there are four species of depravity.* Of <lb/>
            what kind are these? said he. I was about to mention <lb/>
            them in order, as they each appeared to me to rise <lb/>
            one out of another; but Polemarchus stretching out his <lb/>
            hand—(for he sat a little further off than Adimantus,) <lb/>
            -caught him by the robe at his shoulder, and drew him <lb/>
            near; and, bending towards him, he spoke something in a <lb/>
            whisper, of which we heard nothing but this: Shall we <lb/>
            let that pass, then ? said he, or what shall we do ? By no <lb/>
            means, said Adimantus, now speaking aloud. And I replied, <lb/>
            What will not you let pass? You, indeed, said he :-for it <note type="footnote"> * The argument here interrupted respecting the four kinds of depravity, <lb/>
            individually or in states, is resumed at the commencement of the eighth <lb/>

            was to you I alluded. You seem to us to be getting careless <lb/>
            and to be stealing through a whole branch of the discourse, <lb/>
            and that not the least important, that you may not have <lb/>
            the trouble of going through it; and you think you escaped <lb/>
            our notice, when you made this speech so simply, viz., that it <lb/>
            is clear to every one both as to wives and children, that what­ <lb/>
            ever belongs to friends will be common. Did not I say right, <lb/>
            Adimantus ? Yes, said he: but this, which was rightly <lb/>
            said, like the rest of your discourse, requires explanation ;— <lb/>
            namely, to show what is the mode of that community; <lb/>
            for there must be many:-do not omit saying then which <lb/>
            mode you mean; for we have been expecting it for <lb/>
            some time past, thinking you would, some time or other, <lb/>
            speak of the propagation of children, how they are to be <lb/>
            propagated ;-and when born, how they should be brought <lb/>
            up, and everything relating to this community that you <lb/>
            were mentioning both of wives and children ; for we sup­ <lb/>
            pose it to be of great, nay—paramount importance to the <lb/>
            state, whether this be rightly performed or not. Now then, <lb/>
            since you are taking in hand another kind of state-government <lb/>
            before you have sufficiently discussed this, we have deter­ <lb/>
            mined, as you just heard, not to let you pass, without going <lb/>
            over all these things, as you did the others. And me too <lb/>
            you may reckon, said Glaucon, as joining in this vote. Be <lb/>
            quite sure, Socrates, said Thrasymachus, that this is the <lb/>
            opinion of us all.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—What have you done, said I, in seizing <lb/>
            me thus ? What a mighty talk is this you are again rais­ <lb/>
            ing, as you did at the beginning, about your republic, <lb/>
            which I was so glad at having completely described, pleased <lb/>
            [to think] that any one would let these things pass, and <lb/>
            admit what was then said!-And as to what you now challenge <lb/>
            me to, you know not what a swarm of disputes you are stirring <lb/>
            up : I foresaw them, and let them pass at that time, for fear <lb/>
            of making a great disturbance. What then, said Thrasy ma­ <lb/>
            chus, think you that these are now come hither to melt <lb/>
            gold, and not to hear reasonings?* Aye, said I, but in <lb/>
            moderation. As for moderation, Socrates, said Glaucon, <lb/>
            the whole of life serves for hearing such reasonings as <lb/>
            these :-but let pass what relates to us; and as to what we <note type="footnote"> * The verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρυσοχοει̃ν</foreign> is used proverbially to indicate the entertaining <lb/>
            of great hopes that are afterwards unfulfilled. </note> <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. v. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            are inquiring, do not begrudge explaining what you think <lb/>
            about it,-what sort of community of wives and children is <lb/>
            to be observed by our guardians, and how the latter ought to <lb/>
            be reared while very young, in the period between their birth <lb/>
            and their education, which seems to be the most troublesome <lb/>
            of all. Try and tell us now, how that is to be accomplished. <lb/>
            It is not easy, my good fellow, said I, to describe them ; <lb/>
            for many of them are very hard to be believed, even more than <lb/>
            those we have before described; for even their possibility we <lb/>
            might well disbelieve ; and even were they possible, one might <lb/>
            still doubt, whether they would best be done in this par­ <lb/>
            ticular way:-on this account, my dear friend, I somewhat <lb/>
            hesitate to touch on these topics, lest our reasoning appear <lb/>
            to be a mere wish, rather than absolute reality. Do not hesi­ <lb/>
            tate now, said he ; for your hearers are neither unreasonable, <lb/>
            nor incredulous, nor ill-disposed. Now, my very good <lb/>
            Glaucon, said I, is it with the desire of reassuring me, <lb/>
            that you say this ? I do, said he. Then you have produced <lb/>
            quite a contrary effect, said I; for could I trust to my­ <lb/>
            self, that I thoroughly know what I am to say, your encou­ <lb/>
            ragement would have been quite right; for among intelligent <lb/>
            and friendly persons, one who understands the truth, may <lb/>
            speak with safety and confidence about the most important <lb/>
            matters; but when one speaks, as of course I do, with diffi­ <lb/>
            deuce and a sort of searching spirit, there is both fear <lb/>
            and danger, not only of being exposed to ridicule (for <lb/>
            that is but a trifling thing), but lest, mistaking the truth, <lb/>
            I not only fall myself, but draw my friends along with me <lb/>
            into an error about matters, in which we ought least of all to <lb/>
            be mistaken. I conjure Adrasteia,* therefore, Glaucon, <lb/>
            with respect to what I am going to say :-For I hope it is a <lb/>
            smaller offence to be unintentionally a murderer, than an <lb/>
            impostor about what is good and excellent, just and law­ <lb/>
            ful : and as for this risk, it were better to risk it among <lb/>
            enemies than friends ; so that you are not giving me proper <lb/>
            encouragement. Then said Glaucon, laughing: Aye, but <lb/>
            Socrates, even if we should suffer aught amiss from your <lb/>
            discourse, we acquit you as clear of homicide, and as no <lb/>
            impostor: so proceed boldly. But the man, said I, who is <note type="footnote"> * Adrasteia or Nemesis was a daughter of Zeus, and regarded as the <lb/>
            punisher of murderers and homicides,-even those involuntarily so. See <lb/>
            Blomfield's note to Æschyl. Prom. v. 972. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. v. c. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            acquitted in a court of justice is, at any rate, deemed clear of <lb/>
            the crime, as the law says; and if it be so in that case, it <lb/>
            should be so in this. As respects this then, said he, pray <lb/>
            proceed. We must now, said I, once more return to what <lb/>
            perhaps in strict order should have been considered before; <lb/>
            and thus perhaps it would be correct, after having entirely <lb/>
            completed the men's part, to complete also the women's; <lb/>
            especially since you challenge me to do so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Men who have been born and educated as we <lb/>
            have described, cannot, in my opinion, otherwise rightly ac­ <lb/>
            quire and employ their wives and children than by following <lb/>
            the same track, in which we have proceeded from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning : for we surely undertook, in our argument, to repre­ <lb/>
            sent men as the guardians of a flock. Yes. Let us proceed <lb/>
            then, to give the children a corresponding birth and education ; <lb/>
            and let us consider, whether it be proper for us or not. <lb/>
            How ? replied he. Thus: Are we to reckon it proper <lb/>
            for the females among our guardian dogs to watch and hunt, <lb/>
            and do everything else in common with the males; or <lb/>
            rather to manage domestic affairs within doors, as being dis­ <lb/>
            abled from other exercises on account of bearing and nursing <lb/>
            the whelps, while the males are to labour and take the entire <lb/>
            charge of the flocks ? All in common, said he ; except that <lb/>
            we employ the females as the weaker, and the males as <lb/>
            the stronger. Is it possible then, said I, to employ an animal <lb/>
            for the same purposes [with another,] without giving it the <lb/>
            same nurture and education ? It is not possible. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we are to employ the women for the same purposes as <lb/>
            the men, must we not give them also the same kind of in­ <lb/>
            struction ? Yes. Were both music and gymnastics be­ <lb/>
            stowed on the males ? Yes. To the women too, then, we must <lb/>
            impart these two arts, and those likewise that refer to war; <lb/>
            and we must employ them in the same manner. It is probable <lb/>
            from what you say, said he. Perhaps, however, said I, many <lb/>
            things, concerning what we are now speaking, may appear <lb/>
            ridiculous, because contrary to custom,-if they shall be prac­ <lb/>
            tised in the way now mentioned. Quite so, replied he. But <lb/>
            which of them, said I, do you conceive to be the most ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous? Would it not clearly be to behold the women naked <lb/>
            in the palæstra wrestling with the men, and not only the <lb/>
            young women, but even those more advanced in years, just like <lb/>
            the old men in the wrestling-schools, who are still fond of the <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 4. </note> <lb/>
            exercises, though wrinkled, and not at all comely to the eye ? <lb/>
            Aye, by Zeus, said he; it would appear truly ridiculous, as <lb/>
            present fashions go. Ought we not then, said I, since we have <lb/>
            entered on this discourse, to fear the raillery of wits, which <lb/>
            they would probably bestow pretty abundantly on such inno­ <lb/>
            vations [as respects exercising the women] in gymnastics, <lb/>
            music, and more especially in the use of arms, and the ma­ <lb/>
            nagement of horses? You say right, he replied. But since we <lb/>
            have entered on this discourse, let us go to the rigour of the <lb/>
            law, and beg these men not to be the slaves of prejudice, <lb/>
            but to think seriously, and remember, that not long since <lb/>
            the sight of naked men appeared base and disgusting to the <lb/>
            Greeks, just as now indeed it does to most of the barbarians : <lb/>
            and when first the Cretans, and afterwards the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, began their exercises, the' wits of that day might <lb/>
            have made a jest of all this: do not you think so ? I do. <lb/>
            But methinks, when those experienced in the art thought it <lb/>
            better to strip themselves, than to cover up such parts, the <lb/>
            merely apparent ridiculousness of the thing is set aside by the <lb/>
            advantage stated in our reasoning; and this, too, manifestly <lb/>
            shows that the man is a fool who deems anything ridiculous <lb/>
            except what is bad, and tries to run down as ridiculous any <lb/>
            other idea but that of the foolish and the vicious, or employs <lb/>
            himself seriously with any other end in view but that of the <lb/>
            good. Assuredly, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Must we not then, first of all, agree on this,­ <lb/>
            whether these things be possible or not;—and set forth a <lb/>
            question, whether any one, either in jest or earnest, can <lb/>
            doubt, if the human nature in the female can in all cases <lb/>
            share with the male, or in no case share at all; or in some <lb/>
            cases, but not in others; and this too with reference to what <lb/>
            concerns war ? Would not the man who thus sets out so <lb/>
            also probably conclude? Certainly, said he. Do you wish <lb/>
            then, said I, that we should argue against ourselves about <lb/>
            these things, in order that the opposite side may not, if <lb/>
            attacked, be destitute of defence ? Nothing hinders, said he. <lb/>
            Let us then say this for them : There is no need, Socrates <lb/>
            and Glaucon, for others to dispute with you about this matter ; <lb/>
            for yourselves, in first establishing your state, agreed that each <lb/>
            individual ought to practise one business, according to his par­ <lb/>
            ticular talent. We did so agree, I think; for how could we do <lb/>
            otherwise? Does not then the nature of a woman differ widely <pb n="137"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            from that of a man ? Of course it differs. And is it not right <lb/>
            to allot to each a different work, according to the nature of <lb/>
            each ? Of course. Are not you in the wrong then, and do you <lb/>
            not contradict yourselves, in saying that men and women ought <lb/>
            to do the same things, with natures so widely different ? Have <lb/>
            you any answer to make against this, my clever Glaucon ? <lb/>
            To do so on the moment is no such easy matter, said he; but <lb/>
            I will entreat you, and I do so now, to unravel the argu­ <lb/>
            ments on our side, whatever they may be. These, Glaucon, <lb/>
            replied I, and many other such things, are what I long ago <lb/>
            foresaw; and I was both afraid and unwilling to touch on the <lb/>
            Jaw concerning the possession of wives and the education of <lb/>
            children. No, by Zeus, replied he, it seems no easy matter. <lb/>
            Certainly not, said I. The case, however, is thus: If a man <lb/>
            fall into a small fish-pond, or quite into the ocean itself, still <lb/>
            he has to swim no less. Certainly. Let us too, then, <lb/>
            swim, and try to escape from this argument, expecting that <lb/>
            either some dolphin* will rescue us, or that we shall have some <lb/>
            other remarkable deliverance ? It seems we ought, replied <lb/>
            he. Come then, said I;—let us see, if we can anywhere find <lb/>
            an outlet; for we acknowledged that different natures ought <lb/>
            to study different things, and that the natures of a woman <lb/>
            and a man are different; yet now we say, that different natures <lb/>
            ought to study the same things :—do you accuse us of this ? <lb/>
            Just so. How admirable, Glaucon, said I, is the power of the <lb/>
            art of disputing ! How ? Because, replied I, many seem to <lb/>
            fall into it unwillingly, supposing that they are not cavilling, <lb/>
            but reasoning truly, owing to their inability to divide a subject <lb/>
            rightly and investigate it according to its species: but following <lb/>
            the literal sense, they pursue what is quite contradictory to their <lb/>
            subject, making use of cavilling instead of argument. This is in­ <lb/>
            deed the case with many, said he; but does that extend likewise <lb/>
            to us in the present instance ? Quite so, said I; for I think, that <lb/>
            without meaning it, we have fallen into a contradiction. How? <lb/>
            Because we have very boldly and disputatiously asserted, that <lb/>
            unless persons natures are the same, they ought not to have <lb/>
            the same employments ; though we have not at all inquired the <lb/>
            sort of difference and identity of the nature [here referred to,] <note type="footnote"> * Allusion is here made to the fable of Arion,—or if not to that, to the <lb/>
            vulgar notion that the dolphin was particularly friendly to man. See <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. V. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
            and with reference to which we defined them, when we ascribed <lb/>
            different pursuits to different natures, and to the same natures <lb/>
            the same pursuits. No certainly, said he, we did not consider <lb/>
            that. It would seem then, replied I, that we may still ask <lb/>
            ourselves the question, whether the nature of the bald and <lb/>
            those who wear hair be the same and not different;—and if <lb/>
            we agree that it be different, whether, if the bald made <lb/>
            shoes, we should let those who wear hair make them ;-or if <lb/>
            again, those who wear hair [made them, whether we should <lb/>
            allow] the others [to do so likewise] ? That were ridiculous, <lb/>
            replied he. Is it then ridiculous, said I, for any other reason <lb/>
            than that we did not then in general define the sameness and <lb/>
            diversity of natures, but observed only that species of diversity <lb/>
            and sameness, which respects their peculiar functions, just as we <lb/>
            say that a physician, and a man who has a genius for being a <lb/>
            physician, have one and the same nature ? Do not you think <lb/>
            so ? I do. But have the physician and the carpenter a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent [nature] ? Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—In that case, said I, as regards the natures of <lb/>
            men and women, if they appear different, with respect to any <lb/>
            art, or other employment, we are supposed to assign to <lb/>
            each separately his proper employment :-but if it appear <lb/>
            to differ only in this,-namely, that the female bears chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and the male begets them,—we must not say that it <lb/>
            has at all as yet been proved that a man differs from a <lb/>
            woman in the sense of which we are speaking, and we must <lb/>
            still think, that both our guardians and their wives may <lb/>
            pursue the same employments. And with reason, said he. <lb/>
            After this, then, should we not require any one who says <lb/>
            the contrary, to inform us on this point,-what is that art or <lb/>
            function in the arrangements of a state, where the nature of a <lb/>
            man and woman is not the same, but different? A reasonable <lb/>
            demand, too. Perhaps then some one may reply, as you said <lb/>
            some time since, that it is not easy all at once to explain this <lb/>
            sufficiently, but yet no hard matter for one who has con­ <lb/>
            sidered it ? Yes,—one might well say so. Do you wish <lb/>
            then, that we should request such an opponent to follow us, <lb/>
            while we try to show him, that there is no function <lb/>
            peculiar to a woman in the management of a state ? <lb/>
            By all means. Come then (we will say to him), answer <lb/>
            us :-did you not mean that one man has a natural talent for <pb n="139"/>
             <note type="margin">B. v. c. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            anything, and another not, in this respect,-namely, that <lb/>
            one learns a thing easily, and another with difficulty; and <lb/>
            one with a little instruction discovers much in what he <lb/>
            learns, while another, after much instruction and care, <lb/>
            does not retain even what he lias learned; and that <lb/>
            with the one, the body is duly subservient to the mind; <lb/>
            while in the other it is opposed to it ?—Well, and what other <lb/>
            marks are there besides these, by which you would distinguish <lb/>
            a man that has particular talents from him that has none at <lb/>
            all ? One cannot mention any other, said he. Know you <lb/>
            then of any function performed by mankind, in which the <lb/>
            males have not all these characteristics in a superior degree <lb/>
            to the females ;-and would it not be tedious to specify par­ <lb/>
            ticularly the weaving art, and the making of pastry and <lb/>
            spice-meats, for which female talents seem to have some re­ <lb/>
            pute, and cannot be surpassed without the greatest disgrace ? <lb/>
            You are right, said he, in saying that in all things universally <lb/>
            the talent of the one is superior to that of the other ;-yet <lb/>
            many women are superior in many respects to many men ; <lb/>
            though, on the whole, it is as you say. There is no func­ <lb/>
            tion, my friend, then, among the entire members of our state <lb/>
            that is peculiar to woman, considered as such, nor to man, <lb/>
            considered as such; but natural talents are indiscriminately <lb/>
            diffused through both, and the woman naturally shares in <lb/>
            all offices, the same as the man, though in all cases the <lb/>
            woman is weaker than the man. Certainly. Are we then <lb/>
            to commit all [state concerns] to the men, and none to the <lb/>
            women ? How should we ? It is true then, I think (as we <lb/>
            say), that one woman too is fitted for being a physician, and <lb/>
            another not so,-one is musical, another by nature unmusical. <lb/>
            How otherwise ? And is one fitted for gymnastics and warlike, <lb/>
            -another not fitted either for war or gymnastics ? That is my <lb/>
            opinion too. And what ;-is not one a lover of philosophy, <lb/>
            and another averse to it; and one high-spirited, and another <lb/>
            timid ? This is true, too. And is not one woman naturally <lb/>
            suited for being a guardian, and another not so ;-and have <lb/>
            we not made choice of such a talent as this for our guardian <lb/>
            men? Yes—just of such as this. The nature then of the <lb/>
            woman and of the man, as respects the guardianship of the <lb/>
            state, is the same,-only that the one is weaker, the other <lb/>
            stronger. So it seems.</p><pb n="140"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 6. </note> CHAP. VI.—Women such as these then are to be chosen <lb/>
            to dwell with such men, and to be their fellow-guardians, <lb/>
            -inasmuch as they are naturally suited for them, and of kin­ <lb/>
            dred talents. Certainly. And must not the same employ­ <lb/>
            ments be assigned to the same natures ? The same. We <lb/>
            have now got round then, to our former point; and, we allow <lb/>
            that it is not contrary to nature, to allot to the wives of our <lb/>
            guardians the study both of music and gymnastics ? As­ <lb/>
            suredly. We did not establish then what is impossible, or <lb/>
            to be only vainly wished for, when we established the law <lb/>
            according to nature :-and it would seem rather, that what is <lb/>
            at present contrary to these things is contrary to nature ? <lb/>
            It seems so. Was not then our inquiry, whether our es­ <lb/>
            tablishment was possible and best ? It was. And we <lb/>
            have agreed, that it is possible ? Yes. And we must <lb/>
            next be convinced, that it is best ? Clearly so. In order, <lb/>
            therefore, that a woman may become a suitable guardian, <lb/>
            there will not be one mode of education for making men <lb/>
            [guardians,] and another for women, especially as the <lb/>
            latter have received the same natural genius ? No,-it <lb/>
            will not be different. What think you then of such an <lb/>
            opinion as this? Of what? That of imagining in your own <lb/>
            mind, that one man is better and another worse ;—or do you <lb/>
            deem them to be all alike ? By no means. In the state <lb/>
            then which we were just establishing,-which of the two do <lb/>
            you think to make the better men,—the guardians provided <lb/>
            with this education we have described, or shoemakers that <lb/>
            are taught shoemaking ? That question, replied he, is ridi­ <lb/>
            culous. I understand you, said I:—but, tell me; of all the <lb/>
            other citizens, are not they the best ? By far. But what; <lb/>
            -will not these women too be the best of women ? They <lb/>
            will, replied he, by far. Is there anything better in a <lb/>
            state, than that both women and men be rendered the very <lb/>
            best ? There is not. And this is to be effected by music <lb/>
            and gymnastics being imparted to them. as we have described ? <lb/>
            Of course. We have been establishing then a law, which is <lb/>
            not only possible, but best also for the state ? Just so. We <lb/>
            must unclothe, then, the wives of our guardians, since they <lb/>
            are to put on virtue for clothes ;* and they must bear a part <note type="footnote"> * The expression of Herodotus, Clio, ch. 8, is not dissimilar:—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅμα δὲ</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              to be allotted to the women rather than the men, on account <lb/>
              of the weakness of their sex :-and the man who laughs at <lb/>

              view to the best object, reaps the unripe fruit of a ridiculous <lb/>

              why he does it :*—for that ever was and will be deemed a <lb/>
              noble saying, that the profitable is beautiful, and the hurtful <lb/>
              base. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—We may say then, that we have escaped one <lb/>
            wave, as it were, by thus settling the law with respect to <lb/>
            women, and have not been quite overwhelmed, through deter­ <lb/>
            mining that our male and female guardians are to manage all <lb/>
            things in common :f and besides that, our reasoning has been <lb/>
            consistent with itself, as respects both what is possible and ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous also. Truly, it is no small wave you have escaped, <lb/>
            said he. You will not call it a great one, replied I, when you <lb/>
            see what follows. Tell me, said he ; and let me see. After <lb/>
            this enactment, replied I, and the others formerly mentioned, <lb/>
            the following, I think, comes naturally. Which is that? That <lb/>
            these women be all common to all these men, and that no one <lb/>
            woman dwell with any man privately, and that their chil­ <lb/>
            dren likewise be common ;-so that neither shall the parents <lb/>
            know their own children, nor the children their parents. ‡ <lb/>
            This, in comparison with the other, is far more difficult to <lb/>
            persuade, both as to its possibility and utility. I do not <lb/>
            think, replied I, as to its utility at least, that any one would <lb/>
            doubt about it being a very great good to have the women <note type="footnote"> * The cited words—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτελη̃ σοφίας δϱέπων καρπόν</foreign> are from Pindar. <lb/>

              and children in common, if it were but possible: — but <lb/>
              the greatest question, methinks, will be, whether it be possible <lb/>
              or not ? One might very well, said he, raise a discussion on <lb/>
              both points. You are mentioning, replied I, a combination <lb/>
              of discussions; but I thought, at least, that I should escape <lb/>
              from one of them, if its utility had been agreed on, and that <lb/>
              in that case it would only have remained to consider its pos­ <lb/>
              sibility. But you have not slunk off, said he, quite un­ <lb/>
              observed ; and so, give us an account of both. I must submit <lb/>
              to a trial, said I :-indulge me thus far, however: let me <lb/>
              feast myself, as the slow in intellect are wont to feast them­ <lb/>
              selves, when they walk alone :-for men of this sort, I <lb/>
              imagine, ere finding out how to attain what they desire, waive <lb/>
              that inquiry, in order that they may not tire themselves in de­ <lb/>
              liberating about its possibility or impossibility, supposing they <lb/>
              have obtained what they desire, and then they go through what <lb/>
              remains,-rejoicing, also, to recount what they will do, when <lb/>
              it has happened, and rendering their soul, otherwise indolent, <lb/>
              more indolent still. Now I too am become languid, and <lb/>
              would, therefore, defer such debates, and inquire after­ <lb/>
              wards into the possibility of these [arrangements]. At <lb/>
              present, however, supposing them possible, I will, if you <lb/>
              please, consider how our rulers are to regulate matters <lb/>
              thence arising, in order that the doing of these things may be <lb/>
              most advantageous both to the state and the guardians :-this, <lb/>
              first, I will try to examine with your assistance, and the <lb/>
              other question afterwards, if you allow me. Oh, I will give <lb/>
              you leave, said he;—so pray proceed with your inquiry.</p>
          <p>I imagine then, said I, if our rulers will be worthy of that <lb/>
            name, and those also who are their auxiliaries, that the latter <lb/>
            will cheerfully do whatever they are bidden, while the former <lb/>
            will take the command, giving their directions in some mat­ <lb/>
            ters conformably to the laws, and imitating their spirit in <lb/>
            whatever matters we leave to their sole guidance. Very <lb/>
            likely, said he. Do you then, their lawgiver, said I, as you <lb/>
            have chosen out the men, so choose out also the women, <lb/>
            making them, as far as possible, of similar dispositions :-and <lb/>
            these, as they dwell and eat together in common, and none <lb/>
            possesses anything whatever in private, will be always <lb/>
            together ;-and as they mingle in the gymnastic yards and <lb/>
            in all their other training exercises, they will, I think, <pb n="143"/>
             <note type="margin">n. v. c. 8. </note> <lb/>
            be led by innate necessity, to mutual intimacies :-do not <lb/>
            you think I am speaking of what must necessarily happen ? <lb/>
            Not, replied he, by any geometrical necessity, but by one <lb/>
            founded on love, which seems to be more cogent than the <lb/>
            other, in persuading and winning over the bulk of mankind.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Quite so, said I; but in the next place, <lb/>
            Glaucon, to form irregular intimacies, or to do anything else <lb/>
            of the same character, is not at all right in a city of happy <lb/>
            persons, nor ought the rulers to allow it. No, it were <lb/>
            not just, said he. It is evident, by right, in the next <lb/>
            place, to make marriages as far as possible sacred ; and <lb/>
            those most advantageous would be sacred. Altogether so. <lb/>
            How then are they to be most advantageous ? Tell me this, <lb/>
            Glaucon ;-for in your house I see both sporting dogs, and a <lb/>
            great number of well-bred birds; have you, by Zeus, ever <lb/>
            attended to their pairing, and bringing forth young ? How ? <lb/>
            said he. First of all, among these, though all be well-bred, <lb/>
            are not some of them far better than all the rest ? They are. <lb/>
            Do you breed then from all alike; or are you anxious to do <lb/>
            so, as far as possible, from the best breeds ? From the best. <lb/>
            But how; from the youngest or the oldest, or those quite in <lb/>
            their prime? From those in their prime. And if they are <lb/>
            not thus bred, you consider that the breed both of birds and <lb/>
            dogs greatly degenerates? I do, replied he. And what think <lb/>
            you as to horses, said I, and other animals;—is the case other­ <lb/>
            wise with respect to these ? It were absurd [to think so,] <lb/>
            said he. How strange, my dear fellow, said I ; what ex­ <lb/>
            tremely perfect governors must we have,-if the same applies <lb/>
            to the human race ! Nevertheless, it is so, replied he; but <lb/>
            what then ? Because, said I, they must necessarily use many <lb/>
            medicines; but as for a physician, where the body does not want <lb/>
            medicines, but men willingly subject themselves to a regimen of <lb/>
            diet, we think that an inferior and less skilful one may suffice; <lb/>
            but when there is need for taking medicines, we know that <lb/>
            we want a more able physician. True ; but with reference to <lb/>
            what do you say this ? With reference to this, replied I: it <lb/>
            seems likely that our rulers must use an abundance of lying <lb/>
            and deceit for the advantage of the governed; and we said <lb/>
            somewhere, that all these things were useful in the way of a <lb/>
            remedy. Rightly too, said he. This apparent right now <lb/>
            seems by no means inconsiderable in marriages and the prop a- <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 9. </note> <lb/>
            gation of children. How so? It necessarily follows, said <lb/>
            I, from what has been acknowledged, that the best men <lb/>
            should as often as possible form alliances with the best women, <lb/>
            and the most depraved men, on the contrary, with the most <lb/>
            depraved women ; and the offspring of the former is to be <lb/>
            educated, but not of the latter, if the flock is to be of the most <lb/>
            perfect kind :-and this must be so done, as to escape the notice <lb/>
            of all but the governors themselves, if at any rate the whole <lb/>
            band of the guardians is to be as free as possible from sedition. <lb/>
            Quite right, said he. Are there not to be festivals legally <lb/>
            established, in which we shall draw together the brides and <lb/>
            bridegrooms;—and must not there be sacrifices, and hymns <lb/>
            composed by our poets suitable to the marriages in course of <lb/>
            celebration ?-But as to the number of the marriages, this we <lb/>
            will leave to the rulers, that they may as much as possible <lb/>
            keep up the same number of men, having a regard both to <lb/>
            wars and diseases, and all other such matters, so that as far as <lb/>
            possible our state may be neither great nor small. Right, <lb/>
            said he. And chances too, I conceive, should be so well <lb/>
            managed, that the depraved man may, on every turn of them, <lb/>
            accuse his fortune, and not the governors. Of course, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—As for those youths, who distinguish them­ <lb/>
            selves, either in war or other pursuits, they ought to have <lb/>
            rewards and prizes given them, and the most ample liberty of <lb/>
            lying with women, that so, under this pretext, the greatest <lb/>
            number of children may spring from such parentage. Right. <lb/>
            And as for the offspring born from time to time, are the <lb/>
            authorities presiding over these matters to receive them, whe­ <lb/>
            ther they be men or women, or both ?-for somehow these <lb/>
            offices belong in common both to men and women. Yes, they <lb/>
            do. As respects, then, the children of worthy persons, I <lb/>
            think, they should carry them to some retirement, to certain <lb/>
            nurses dwelling apart in a certain quarter of the city; but as <lb/>
            for the children of the more depraved, and such of the rest as <lb/>
            may be maimed or lame, they will hide them, as is right, in <lb/>
            some secret and obscure place. Yes, indeed, said he, if the <lb/>
            race of guardians is to be pure. Will they not then take care <lb/>
            also of their children's nurture, bringing to the nursery <lb/>
            mothers with full breasts, taking every precaution that no <lb/>
            woman should recognise her own child, and, where the mo­ <lb/>
            thers cannot suckle them, providing others who would be able <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 9.J </note> <lb/>
            to do so ? And they will be careful also of this most par­ <lb/>
            ticularly, that the nurses suckle only during a proper time, <lb/>
            and they will enjoin, both on the nurses and keepers, their <lb/>
            watching duties, and every other necessary toil. You spoak, <lb/>
            said he, of a time of great ease to the wives of our guardians, <lb/>
            in the breeding of children. Yes, for it should be so, re­ <lb/>
            plied I. But let us next discuss what we were so anxious to <lb/>
            do, when we said that the procreation of children should take <lb/>
            place among persons in the prime of life. True. Do you <lb/>
            agree with me then, that this prime season is at twenty in a <lb/>
            woman, and at thirty in a man ? How do you reckon this <lb/>
            time for each sex ? said he.* The woman, replied I, is to <lb/>
            bear children to the state from the age of twenty to that of <lb/>
            forty; and the man, after having passed the most excitable <lb/>
            period of his course, is from that period to beget children to <lb/>
            the state'up to the age of fifty-five. This indeed, is the prime, <lb/>
            replied he, in both sexes, both as respects body and mind. If <lb/>
            then any one, either older or younger than these, should em­ <lb/>
            ploy himself in begetting children for the commonwealth, we <lb/>
            should say that the trespass is neither right nor just, since <lb/>
            he is begetting to the state a child, which (if concealed) is <lb/>
            born and grows up, ushered in neither by sacrifices nor <lb/>
            prayers—(which, on every marriage, the priestesses and priests, <lb/>
            and the whole state offer, that the descendants of the good <lb/>
            may be still better, and that from useful descendants others <lb/>
            still more useful may arise ),-but is born in darkness, and the <lb/>
            result of dreadful incontinence. Right, said he. And the law, <lb/>
            said I, must be the same, if any of those men, who are yet of <lb/>
            the age for procreation, have intercourse with women of a <lb/>
            proper age, without the magistrate's leave; for we may <lb/>
            consider him as having raised to the state a bastard, born <lb/>
            in adultery and unhonoured by religious auspices. Most <lb/>
            right, said he. And I presume, whenever either the women <lb/>
            or the men are past the age of procreation, we are to let the <lb/>
            men cohabit with any woman they like, except their daughter <lb/>
            and mother, and the children of their daughters, or those <lb/>
            upwards from their mother; and so likewise the women are <lb/>
            to embrace any, except a son, a father, and the children <lb/>
            of these, in either direction : all this liberty we are to <note type="footnote"> * The Greek (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ποι̃α αὐτω̃ν</foreign>) is very elliptical; but we agree with <lb/>
            Cousin in considering this to be its real meaning. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 10. </note> <lb/>
            grant them, after we have enjoined them to be careful, first, <lb/>
            if a child be conceived, not to bring it to the light, but if, <lb/>
            by accident, it should be brought forth, so to expose it as <lb/>
            if there were no provision for it. All these things, said <lb/>
            he, are reasonably said ;-but how are the fathers and daugh­ <lb/>
            ters, and the other relations you just mentioned, to be known <lb/>
            to one another? They are not to be known at all, said I ; <lb/>
            but from the day on which any one is married, whatever <lb/>
            children aro born between the seventh or tenth month after it, <lb/>
            all these he is to call, the males his sons, and the females his <lb/>
            daughters, and they are to call him father; and in the same <lb/>
            way again, he is to call the children of these—grandchildren; <lb/>
            and they in turn are to call them grandfathers and grand- <lb/>
            mothers ; and those who were born during the period in <lb/>
            which their fathers and mothers were begetting children, they <lb/>
            shall call sisters and brothers, as I just observed,-so that they <lb/>
            may have no sexual intercourse.-But as for brothers and sis­ <lb/>
            ters, the law will allow them to live together,-if their lot so <lb/>
            fall, and the Pythian oracle give consent. Quite right, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—This, and such as this, Glaucon, is the com­ <lb/>
            munity of women and children, among theguardiansof the state: <lb/>
            and that this is consistent both with the rest of our polity, <lb/>
            and is by far the best, we must next establish from reason;­ <lb/>
            or how shall we do ? By Zeus, just so, said he. Is not this, <lb/>
            then, the beginning of our agreement, to ask ourselves what <lb/>
            we can allege to be the greatest good for the establishment <lb/>
            of a state, with a view to which the lawgiver is to enact <lb/>
            the laws, and what the greatest evil,-and next to examine, <lb/>
            whether what we have hitherto described tends to or con­ <lb/>
            forms with the track of the good, and is opposed to that <lb/>
            of the evil ? Most certainly, said he. Is there, then, any <lb/>
            greater evil for a state than that which tears it in pieces, and <lb/>
            makes it many instead of one;—or, any greater good than <lb/>
            that which binds it together, and makes it one ? There is <lb/>
            not. Does not then the communion both of pleasure and pain <lb/>
            bind men together, when the whole of the citizens as <lb/>
            much as possible rejoice and mourn in fellowship, for <lb/>
            the same matters, whether gainful or the contrary?* As­ <lb/>
            suredly, he replied. And again, any mere private perception <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig31.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="147"/>
              <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
              of such things dissolves [that union,] when some grieve ex­ <lb/>
              ceedingly, and others rejoice exceedingly at the same events, <lb/>
              either in the state or those composing it? Of course. Does <lb/>
              not this then arise from the following circumstance,-when <lb/>
              such words as these are not pronounced at the same time in <lb/>
              a state, as mine, and not mine; and with regard to what <lb/>
              concerns another, in the same way ? Aye, surely. And <lb/>
              the state, in which the greatest number unite in saying of <lb/>
              the same things, that this concerns me, and that does not <lb/>
              concern me,—that is best regulated ? By far. And it is <lb/>
              that also, which most closely resembles the individual man; <lb/>
              -just as, when a person's finger is wounded, the entire <lb/>
              fellowship of feeling, extending through the body towards <lb/>
              the soul, and producing that harmony which is the work <lb/>
              of the governing principle within it, [viz. the soul,]* ex­ <lb/>
              periences a sensation, and at the same time wholly sym­ <lb/>
              pathizes with the ailing part; and thus we say that the man <lb/>
              has a finger-ache :-and so also, with respect to any part what­ <lb/>
              ever of the human frame, the same reasoning applies either <lb/>
              with respect to grief, when a part is in pain, or with respect <lb/>
              to pleasure, when it is at ease. Aye, the very same, said he : <lb/>
              and as to what you are asking, the state that nearest ap­ <lb/>
              proaches this is the best governed. When, therefore, any <lb/>
              individual citizen receives good or ill, such a state, methinks, <lb/>
              will most especially maintain that she herself is the party <lb/>
              affected, and will unite as a whole in joy or mourning. That <lb/>
              must be the case, said he, in a state, governed, at least, by <lb/>
              good laws.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—It will be time perhaps for us to return to our <lb/>
            state, and consider as to the points on which we have agreed <lb/>
            in our discussion, whether they belong more particularly to <lb/>
            our state than any other. Yes,—we must, he replied. What <lb/>
            then ? there are surely in other states, both governors and <lb/>
            people ?-and so also in this ? There are. And will not <lb/>
            all these address one another as citizens? Of course. But <lb/>
            besides calling them citizens, what do the people call their <lb/>
            governors under the other forms of government ? In most <lb/>
            states, masters, but in democracies, this very name gover- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig32.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 11. </note> <lb/>
              nors. But what as to the people in our state ? besides citi­ <lb/>
              zens, what do they say their governors are ? Saviours, <lb/>
              said he, and helpers. And what do they call the people ? <lb/>
              Paymasters, replied he, and supporters. And in the other <lb/>
              states, what do the governors call their people ? Slaves, lie <lb/>
              replied. And what do the governors call one another ? <lb/>
              Fellow-governors, said he. And ours, what? Fellow-guar­ <lb/>
              dians. Can you then tell about the governors in other states, <lb/>
              whether any one of them can address one of his fellow-gover­ <lb/>
              nors as an intimate, and another as a stranger ? Aye, very <lb/>
              many can. Does he not then esteem and speak of his inti­ <lb/>
              mate as his own, and the stranger as not his own ? Just so. <lb/>
              But how is it with your guardians ? Is there any one <lb/>
              of them, who can esteem or address any of his fellow- <lb/>
              guardians as a stranger? By no means, he replied ;—for <lb/>
              with whomever a person falls in, he will conceive that he falls <lb/>
              in with a brother or sister, or a father or mother, or a son or <lb/>
              daughter, or their descendants or ancestry. You speak ex­ <lb/>
              ceedingly well, replied I:—and further, tell me this also, <lb/>
              whether you will give them only a legal right to these fami­ <lb/>
              liar names,-or rather bid them perform all their actions <lb/>
              in accordance with these names, especially as respects parents, <lb/>
              whatever the law enjoins as the parents' due,—such as <lb/>
              reverence, and care, and obedience,—it being otherwise not <lb/>
              for his advantage, either in the sight of God or of men, <lb/>
              inasmuch as he would do what is neither holy nor just, if he <lb/>
              acted otherwise than thus ?—Will these, or other maxims com­ <lb/>
              ing from the whole body of our citizens, echo close round the <lb/>
              ears of our children, both about their parents, when pointed <lb/>
              out to them, and about other relations likewise? These <lb/>
              [maxims must so,] replied he; for it were ridiculous, if, <lb/>
              without actions, their proper names were uttered by the <lb/>
              mouth alone. Of all states then, in this especially, when <lb/>
              any one individual fares either well or ill, the citizens will <lb/>
              mostly agree in exclaiming, according to our late expression,­ <lb/>
              namely, "Mine fares well, or mine ill?" Quite true, said <lb/>
              he. Did we not say too, that agreeably to this opinion <lb/>
              and expression, their common pleasures and pains should <lb/>
              agree? Aye,—and we said rightly. Will not then our <lb/>
              citizens most especially hold in common that same thing, <lb/>
              which they call “my own”—and, holding this in common, thus <pb n="149"/>
              <note type="margin"> B V. c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
              have a special fellowship in pleasure and pain ? Very much <lb/>
              so. And the cause of all this, independently of other regu­ <lb/>
              lations of the state,—is it not the community of women and <lb/>
              children among the guardians? Most especially so, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—We had agreed, moreover, as to the greatest <lb/>
            good of a state, by comparing a well-managed state to a <lb/>
            body, which feels pleasure or pain affecting any part of it. <lb/>
            Aye, we were right, said he, in agreeing about this. The cause <lb/>
            then of all this high degree of good to our state was found to be <lb/>
            the community of women and children among our defenders ? <lb/>
            Surely, replied he. And in that case, we agree at least with <lb/>
            what was before alleged; for we said, I believe, that they <lb/>
            ought to have neither houses of their own, nor land, nor any <lb/>
            possession, but to receive their subsistence from others, as a <lb/>
            reward for their guardianship, and all to consume it in common, <lb/>
            if they mean really to be guardians ? Right, said he. Do <lb/>
            not then, as I say, the circumstances formerly mentioned, and <lb/>
            still more those now mentioned, cause them to be true <lb/>
            guardians, and prevent those divisions in the state [which <lb/>
            arise] from not calling one and the same thing their own,­ <lb/>
            but one one thing, and another another; — one drawing <lb/>
            to his own dwelling whatever he can acquire separately from <lb/>
            the rest, and another, to his likewise that which is separate ; <lb/>
            and also different wives and children, occasioning both plea­ <lb/>
            sures and pains, individually private, though holding one and <lb/>
            the same opinion concerning what is domestic,-all, as far <lb/>
            as possible, pointing towards the same thing, — namely, a <lb/>
            community of feeling respecting pleasure and pain ? Of <lb/>
            course, we grant that, replied he. But what ?-will not <lb/>
            lawsuits and criminal charges in the courts be banished <lb/>
            from among them (so to speak), from the fact of their <lb/>
            possessing nothing in private but their body, but all the <lb/>
            rest in common,—owing to which, they will be kept <lb/>
            free from all the dissensions which men raise about <lb/>
            money, or children and relatives? It is quite clear, they <lb/>
            will be thus relieved. And, moreover, in these there could not <lb/>
            fairly be any suits, as regards personal violence or improper <lb/>
            treatment:—for conceiving personal preservation to be an <lb/>
            absolute necessity, we will own it to be handsome and just <lb/>
            for compeers in age to help their compeers. Right, said he. <lb/>
            And this privilege, said I, at any rate this law possesses:- <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. v. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            if a man be in a passion with any one, he will in such <lb/>
            a case be less apt to venture on still greater seditions. <lb/>
            Certainly. The elder, moreover, will be ordered both <lb/>
            to govern and chastise all the younger. Clearly so. And <lb/>
            moreover, as to the younger, with regard to the elder, unless <lb/>
            the magistrates order it, he will never attempt to beat the <lb/>
            elder, or otherwise offer him violence,-nor, methinks, will <lb/>
            he by any other means dishonour him:—for there are <lb/>
            two sufficient guardians to hinder it, fear and respect,­ <lb/>
            respect on the one hand restraining him from laying hands <lb/>
            on a parent, and fear on the other, that others might come <lb/>
            to the defence of the sufferer; — some as sons, others <lb/>
            as brothers, and others as fathers. Yes,—such is the case, <lb/>
            said he. In every respect then, in consequence of the laws, <lb/>
            these men, [i. e. the warriors,] will enjoy peace with one <lb/>
            another? Yes, much. And so long as these do not quarrel <lb/>
            among themselves, there is no danger of the rest of the state <lb/>
            rising or mutually splitting into factions. No, of course not. <lb/>
            As for the least important evils, I am unwilling for pro­ <lb/>
            priety's sake even to mention from how many they will <lb/>
            have been relieved,-the poor, [for instance,] as regards the <lb/>
            work of flattering the rich,-and the difficulties and anxie­ <lb/>
            ties, which people have in bringing up their children and <lb/>
            procuring money for the support of servants,-sometimes <lb/>
            borrowing, sometimes denying debts, and at other times <lb/>
            using all manner of shifts in procuring [money,] and then <lb/>
            giving it to the management of their wives and domestics; <lb/>
            -about these matters, friend, how many slavish and ignoble <lb/>
            troubles they suffer are not even worthy to be mentioned. <lb/>
            Yes, they are manifest, said he, even to one blind.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—From all these troubles, therefore, they will <lb/>
            be relieved, and will live more blessedly than that most <lb/>
            blessed life which those live who gain the Olympic prizes. <lb/>
            How ? On one small account only are those esteemed <lb/>
            happy, compared with what these enjoy;—for the victory <lb/>
            of these is more noble, and their maintenance at the <lb/>
            public expense more complete : inasmuch as the victory that <lb/>
            they gain brings safety to the entire state,-and by way of <lb/>
            crown and reward, both they and their children receive their <lb/>
            maintenance and all other necessaries of life, thus winning <lb/>
            honours from their own state while living, and at their death <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            an honourable funeral. Noble rewards! indeed, said he. Do you <lb/>
            remember, then, said I, that in a former part of our discussion, <lb/>
            some one,—I know not who,—objected to us, that we were <lb/>
            not making our guardians happy, by decreeing that those <lb/>
            who had the whole wealth of the citizens at their com­ <lb/>
            mand should nevertheless have nothing at all ?-and we <lb/>
            said, I believe, that we would consider this afterwards, if <lb/>
            it fell in our way; but that at present we were making <lb/>
            our guardians real guardians, and the state itself as happy <lb/>
            as possible, without exclusively regarding any single class <lb/>
            in it, with a view to make it happy? I remember, said <lb/>
            he. What think you now of the life of our auxiliaries, <lb/>
            which appears far more noble and happy than that of those <lb/>
            of the Olympic prizemen ;—do you think it can be com­ <lb/>
            pared to the life of the leather-cutter, or any other kind <lb/>
            of craftsman, or even the farmer? I do not think so, said <lb/>
            he. Still even, what I said before, it is proper that I men­ <lb/>
            tion here also,-if the guardian should try to become <lb/>
            happy in such a way as to lose his character as a guardian, <lb/>
            and not be content with a life thus moderate and steady, <lb/>
            and as we say, of the best quality, but on the other hand <lb/>
            be impelled by a silly boyish notion about happiness, to <lb/>
            appropriate to himself all the property in the state, because <lb/>
            he has the power, he will know that Hesiod was really <lb/>
            wise, in saying that " the half is considerably more than the <lb/>
            whole."* If he take me for his counsellor, said he, he will <lb/>
            remain in such a life. You agree then, said I, as to the <lb/>
            fellowship of the women with the men, which we have <lb/>
            explained, in matters referring to education and children, <lb/>
            and the guardianship of the other citizens;—that whether <lb/>
            they remain in the state, or go forth to war, they ought to <lb/>
            keep guard with them, and hunt with them like hounds, and <lb/>
            in every case take a share in all things, as far as they can; <lb/>
            and that doing these things they will do what is best, and not <lb/>
            contrary to the nature of the female, as regards the male,-by <lb/>
            which nature, indeed, they act jointly with one another? I <lb/>
            agree, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—Does not this then, said I, still remain to <lb/>
            be discussed, whether it be possible that this community of <note type="footnote"> Comp. Hes. Op. et Di. v. 40—<foreign xml:lang="grc">νήπιοι οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσασν ὅσῳ πλέον ἥμισυ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 14. </note> <lb/>
            habits can take place among men, even as among other <lb/>
            animals ? and how it is possible ? You have forestalled me, <lb/>
            said he, by mentioning what I was just going to ask. Aye <lb/>
            for as to war, said I, it is plain, methinks, how they will <lb/>
            fight. How ? said he. They will go out jointly on their <lb/>
            military expeditions, and will carry along with them to battle <lb/>
            also such of their children as are robust, in order that those <lb/>
            of the craftsmen may see what they ought to practise <lb/>
            when arrived at full age, and, apart from mere observa­ <lb/>
            tion, may serve and minister in all such matters sub­ <lb/>
            serviently both to their fathers and mothers. Have you <lb/>
            not observed also what happens in the common arts, as, <lb/>
            for instance, among the children of the potters,-how long <lb/>
            a time they help and look on, before they apply themselves <lb/>
            to the making of pottery ? Yes, indeed. Should these <lb/>
            then, or our guardians, be more careful in instructing their <lb/>
            children by their own experience, and by observation of <lb/>
            what is suitable for them ? [To suppose that the craftsman <lb/>
            would,] replied he, were truly ridiculous. Yet every crea­ <lb/>
            ture whatever will fight more valiantly in the presence of its <lb/>
            offspring ? It is so : but there is no small danger, Socrates, <lb/>
            should they be defeated, as is often the case in war, that when <lb/>
            their children, as well as themselves, are cut off, it will be <lb/>
            impossible to restore the rest of the state. You speak truly, <lb/>
            replied I: but think you, that our first duty should be <lb/>
            never to expose them to risk ? No, by no means. What <lb/>
            then : if they are to hazard themselves in any case, is it not­ <lb/>
            where they will become better men, if they succeed ? Clearly <lb/>
            so. But do you think it a small matter, and unworthy <lb/>
            of the risk, that children destined for military life should or <lb/>
            should not be observers of the transactions of war? No ;— <lb/>
            for it is highly important with reference to what you now <lb/>
            mention. This then, we must first contrive,-to make our <lb/>
            children spectators of war, yet providing for their safety:­ <lb/>
            and then all will go well, will it not ? Yes. And surely their <lb/>
            fathers, said I, in the first place, as far as men can, will not be <lb/>
            ignorant, but well informed as to the kinds of expeditions <lb/>
            which are dangerous or not so. Probably so, said he. Into <lb/>
            the one then, they will take them ; but will be cautious <lb/>
            of exposing them to the other. Right. And they will <lb/>
            probably, said I, set governors over them, not such as are <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            the most depraved, but such as by experience and years are <lb/>
            able leaders and trainers of the young. Yes, quite proper. <lb/>
            Yet many things, we may say, happen to many contrary <lb/>
            to expectation. Quite so. With reference, therefore, to such <lb/>
            events as these, it is fit that we should provide the children <lb/>
            with things while quite young, in order, if need be, that they <lb/>
            may escape by flight. How do you mean ? said he. We <lb/>
            must mount them on horseback, said I, when extremely <lb/>
            young; and when they have learnt to ride, they must be taken <lb/>
            to see battles, not on high-mettled war-horses, but on <lb/>
            the fleetest and most obedient to the rein ; for thus they <lb/>
            will best observe their proper work, and in case of need, <lb/>
            escape with the greatest safety, following the aged leaders. <lb/>
            I think, said he, your remark is correct. What then, said I, <lb/>
            as to the affairs of war; how are you to manage our soldiers, <lb/>
            both as respects each other and their enemies ? Is my opi­ <lb/>
            nion correct or not ? Tell me what it is, replied he. As for <lb/>
            that man among them, said I, who has left his rank, thrown <lb/>
            away his arms, or done any such like act from mere cowardice, <lb/>
            ought we not to make him a craftsman, or field labourer ? <lb/>
            Certainly. And the man who is taken alive by the enemy, <lb/>
            should he not be given away as a present to those inclined <lb/>
            to use their booty just as they please ? Yes, surely. And <lb/>
            as to him who has signalized himself and attained to high <lb/>
            renown, think you not, that he ought, first of all in the <lb/>
            field itself, to be crowned successively by each of the youths <lb/>
            and boys who are his fellow-soldiers?—is it not so? Yes, I <lb/>
            think so. And will they give him the right hand likewise ? <lb/>
            And that too. But what I am going to tell you, said I, will <lb/>
            not, methinks, be quite so pleasing. What ? That they <lb/>
            should kiss and be kissed by each individually ? This is by <lb/>
            far the best of all, said he : and for myself, I would add this <lb/>
            regulation,-that, so long as they are on this expedition, no one <lb/>
            shall be allowed to refuse the man, whoever it be that he <lb/>
            pleases to kiss,-so that if a warrior happen to be in love <lb/>
            with any one, male or female, he may be the more animated <lb/>
            to win the noblest prize of valour.* Very well, said I:—for <lb/>
            it has been already said, that more opportunities for marriage <lb/>
            should be provided for the brave citizen than for others, and <note type="footnote"> * Comp, here Aristot. Pol. ii. 2. </note> <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 15. </note> <lb/>
            more frequent choice in such matters should be allowed to <lb/>
            them than to all others, in order that such a man's descend­ <lb/>
            ants may be as numerous as possible. Yes, we did say so, <lb/>
            replied he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—Moreover, even according to Homer, it is <lb/>
            just that really brave youths should be honoured in this <lb/>
            way ; inasmuch as Homer said, that Ajax, who on account of <lb/>
            the renown he had gained in battle, was rewarded with a large <lb/>
            share at the entertainments,—fit reward, too, for a brave and <lb/>
            youthful man, from which he at once acquired both honour <lb/>
            and strength. Most right, said he. In this matter, at least, <lb/>
            then, said I, we are to obey the authority of Homer ; and as a <lb/>
            proof of this, we will so honour the brave, both at our sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and on such like occasions, in as far as they appear <lb/>
            deserving, both with hymns, and the honours just men­ <lb/>
            tioned ; and besides this, with seats and viands, and brimming <lb/>
            cups, so as at once both to honour and exercise the virtue of <lb/>
            worthy men and women. You speak capitally well, replied <lb/>
            he. Well, of those then that die in the campaign, shall we <lb/>
            not, in the first place, say, of the man that closes his life with <lb/>
            glory, that he is of the golden race ? Quite so, indeed. And <lb/>
            are we not to believe Hesiod, when he tells us, that if any <lb/>
            of this race die, then- <lb/>
            Chaste, holy, earthly spirits they become, <lb/>
            Expelling evil, guardians of mankind ?* <lb/>
            Yes, we will believe him. We will ask the oracle then, how <lb/>
            we ought to bury noble and divine men, and with what marks <lb/>
            of distinction; and then we will bury them in the very man­ <lb/>
            ner that [the God] directs. Of course. And in all after- <lb/>
            time we will reverence and worship their tombs as those <lb/>
            of demigods, and enact that the same ceremonies shall be <lb/>
            observed with regard to persons dying of old age, or from <lb/>
            any other cause, after having been deemed remarkably <lb/>
            good during their lifetime? Aye, it is only just, said he. <lb/>
            But what ?-how are our soldiers to behave towards ene­ <lb/>
            mies ? In what respect ? First, as respects enslavement, <lb/>
            think you it just, that Greeks should enslave Greek <lb/>
            cities ?—nay, ought they not, as far as they can, to prevent <note type="footnote"> * Hesiod. Op. et Di. v. 121, 2. </note> <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. v. c. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            others from doing it, and act on the principle of sparing the <lb/>
            Grecian tribe, cautiously looking to the possibility of being <lb/>
            themselves enslaved by barbarians ? Aye, said he; both <lb/>
            generally, and in every particular case, it is the best plan to <lb/>
            be sparing. Are they then not to keep any Greek slave <lb/>
            themselves, and to counsel the rest of the Greeks to agree to <lb/>
            the same plan ? Surely, said he: because they will thus at <lb/>
            least, turn themselves the more against the barbarians, and <lb/>
            abstain from one war against another. But what ? Stripping <lb/>
            the dead, said I, of anything but their arms after conquering <lb/>
            them, is that right ;-or does it not rather furnish cowards <lb/>
            with an excuse not to go against a foe, as if they were <lb/>
            doing some duty when bending over a mere corpse; and <lb/>
            have not many armies been destroyed by this kind of <lb/>
            plunder? Very many. Do not you think it also illiberal <lb/>
            and forbidden to plunder a corpse, and the mark of a feminine <lb/>
            and little mind to deem the body of the deceased an enemy, <lb/>
            after the enemy has fled away, and nought remains behind, <lb/>
            but the instrument with which he fought ? Do you think that <lb/>
            they who act thus do any otherwise than dogs do, who snap <lb/>
            at the stones with which they are pelted and do not touch <lb/>
            the man who throws them? Not at all, he replied. We <lb/>
            must have done then with this stripping of the dead, and <lb/>
            these hinderances arising from the carrying off of booty. <lb/>
            Aye, by Zeus, said he, we must have done with them.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XYI.—Moreover, we shall not at any time bring <lb/>
            arms into the temples, for the purpose of dedicating them, <lb/>
            at least not the arms of Greeks,—if we at all care for <lb/>
            the kind feeling of the rest of the Greeks; but we shall <lb/>
            rather fear its being a kind of profanation to bring into <lb/>
            the temple such things as these from our close connex­ <lb/>
            ions, unless the oracle direct us otherwise. Quite right, <lb/>
            replied he. And as regards the laying waste of Grecian <lb/>
            lands and the burning of houses, how would your soldiers <lb/>
            treat their enemies? Aye,—I should be glad, said he, to <lb/>
            hear you state your opinion on that point. Truly then, said I, <lb/>
            my opinion is, that we should do neither of these things, <lb/>
            but only carry off the year's crop :-and would you have <lb/>
            me tell you the reason, why this should be done ? By all <lb/>
            means. It appears to me, that as these two words, war <lb/>
            and discord, are different, so two different things are signified <pb n="156"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 1G. </note> <lb/>
            by them; and I call them different—the latter between mem­ <lb/>
            bers of the same community, and the former between foreigners <lb/>
            and strangers.- hen hatred is among one's own people, it is <lb/>
            called discord; when it respects foreigners, war. What you say, <lb/>
            replied he, is not at all unreasonable. But consider, whether <lb/>
            what I now state is also to the purpose; for I assert that the <lb/>
            Greek nation itself is friendly and in alliance with itself, <lb/>
            though foreign and strange to the barbarian. Well observed, <lb/>
            said lie. Whentherefore Greeks fight with barbarians, and <lb/>
            barbarians with Greeks, we may then say, that they are at <lb/>
            war, and naturally enemies; and this hatred we may call <lb/>
            war : but when Greeks act thus towards Greeks, we may say <lb/>
            that they are naturally friends, and that Greece in such a case <lb/>
            is distempered, and at discord; and such a hatred is to be <lb/>
            called discord. I agree, said he, that we must view it thus. Con­ <lb/>
            sider then, said I, that in the discord just mentioned, whenever <lb/>
            such a thing happens, how the state is split in factions, and when <lb/>
            they sequester each other's lands and burn each other's houses, <lb/>
            how destructive the discord seems, and neither of them seem <lb/>
            to be lovers of their country; for otherwise they would never <lb/>
            have dared to pillage their nurse and mother, but it would <lb/>
            have been sufficient for the victors to carry off the crops of <lb/>
            the vanquished, and to conceive that they would one day be <lb/>
            reconciled, and not perpetually be at war. This indeed is by <lb/>
            far a milder sentiment than the other. But what then ? said <lb/>
            I; this state that you are founding, is it to be a Greek one ? <lb/>
            It ought, he replied. Are they not then to be good and <lb/>
            mild ? By all means. And will they not be lovers of Greece ; <lb/>
            and will they not account Greece as related to them; and <lb/>
            will they not observe the same religious rites as the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks ? Most decidedly. Any difference then, that they <lb/>
            have with Greeks, as kinsmen, will they not consider that <lb/>
            as discord,--not war? Yes, for it is not war. And they <lb/>
            will behave then, as those capable of being reconciled ? Quite <lb/>
            so, of course. They will be mild then and moderate, not <lb/>
            punishing so far as to enslave or destroy,-as advocates for <lb/>
            correction, and not as enemies. Just so, said he. Neither then, <lb/>
            as they are Greeks, will they pillage the lands, or burn the <lb/>
            houses of Greeks; nor will they allow, that in every state, <lb/>
            individually, all are their enemies, men, women, and children, <lb/>
            but that in all cases a few only are enemies,-the originators <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 17.] </note> <lb/>
            of the quarrel: and on all these accounts they will not choose <lb/>
            to lay waste their lands, since the majority of the occupants <lb/>
            are their friends; nor will they overturn the houses:—and so <lb/>
            far only will they carry on the war, until the real originators be <lb/>
            obliged by the innocent to make reparation to those whom they <lb/>
            have grieved. I agree, said he, that we ought so to behave <lb/>
            towards opponents among our own citizens,-but towards the <lb/>
            barbarians, as the Greeks now act towards each other. This <lb/>
            law, then, also, let us enact for our guardians, that they shall <lb/>
            neither lay waste the lands, nor burn the houses. Aye, let us <lb/>
            enact it, said he ; and this further, that these things are right, <lb/>
            and those also, that you before mentioned.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—It appears to me, however, Socrates, that <lb/>
            if one allow you to go on speaking in this fashion, you will <lb/>
            never remember what you formerly put aside, when you <lb/>
            entered on all that you have now said ;—namely, how far such <lb/>
            a government is possible, and in what way it is at all possible ? <lb/>
            For, if it be at all possible, I will allow that all these high <lb/>
            advantages will belong to that state in which it exists, and the <lb/>
            following also, which you omitted; and I now tell you, that <lb/>
            they will, with all possible courage, fight against their enemies, <lb/>
            and least of all abandon each other, recognising, and calling <lb/>
            one another by these names,-fathers, sons, and brothers ; and <lb/>
            if the females encamp along with them, whether in the same <lb/>
            rank, or drawn up behind them, they will strike terror into <lb/>
            the enemies, and at the same time, in case of need, give <lb/>
            all assistance :-in this way, I know, they will be utterly un­ <lb/>
            conquerable ; and as for the advantages they have at home, <lb/>
            which we have omitted, those at any rate I plainly see.-But <lb/>
            as I allow, that all these, and ten thousand other things, will <lb/>
            belong to this form of government, if it actually does exist, <lb/>
            let us talk no more about it, but try to persuade each <lb/>
            other of this itself, how far it is possible, and in what way: <lb/>
            -and let us omit the other points. You have suddenly, <lb/>
            said I, made an attack on my argument, and make no allow­ <lb/>
            ance for one who is but a bungler ;* because, perhaps, you <lb/>
            do not know with what difficulty I have got over two <lb/>
            breakers, and now you are driving me on the greatest and <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στραγγευομένῳ</foreign>, which is Bekker's emendation, the old reading <lb/>
            being <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατευομένῳ</foreign>. The verb means—to be wearied, to delay, trifle, <lb/>
            play the coward. </note> <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. IT. </note> <lb/>
            most dangerous of all the three. After having seen and <lb/>
            heard this, you will, I am sure, forgive me; allowing, that <lb/>
            I had reason for hesitation, and was frightened by the mention <lb/>
            of so great a paradox from undertaking its examination. The <lb/>
            more, said he, you mention such things, the less will you <lb/>
            be excused from explaining in what respect this govern­ <lb/>
            ment is possible. Proceed then without delay. Must we <lb/>
            not then, said I, first remember this, that we are come hither <lb/>
            to inquire into the nature of justice and injustice ? We <lb/>
            must, said he. But what is this to the purpose ? No­ <lb/>
            thing. But supposing we find out the nature of justice, are <lb/>
            we to judge then, that the just man ought nowise to differ <lb/>
            therefrom, but in every respect to resemble justice; or are <lb/>
            we to be satisfied, if he approach to it, as nearly as possible, <lb/>
            and, of all others, partake of it the most ? This will satisfy us, <lb/>
            said he. For example's sake, then, said I, we were in­ <lb/>
            quiring into this,-what is the nature of justice; and we were <lb/>
            in quest also of the perfectly just man, how he became so, and <lb/>
            what was his nature, if he really existed,-and so also with re­ <lb/>
            spect to injustice, and the supremely unjust man, in order <lb/>
            that, looking to them as regards their apparent qualities in re­ <lb/>
            lation to happiness and its opposite, we might be obliged to ac­ <lb/>
            knowledge concerning ourselves, that whoever most resembles <lb/>
            them in character will have a fortune most resembling theirs ; <lb/>
            and not for the purpose of showing that these things are possible <lb/>
            or not. It is quite true, said he. Think you, then, that he is in <lb/>
            any degree an inferior painter, who having painted the portrait <lb/>
            of a very handsome man, and having expressed everything <lb/>
            fully in his picture, is yet unable to show that such a man <lb/>
            really exists ? By Zeus, said he, I do not. Well, have we not <lb/>
            now then logically defined, [shall we say,] the model of a good <lb/>
            state ? Yes, indeed. Have we, indeed, less ably stated the case, <lb/>
            think you, for this reason, because we are unable to show the <lb/>
            possibility of a state being established as we have described ?* <lb/>
            No, indeed, said he. This then, said I, is the truth of the <lb/>
            case:—but if indeed, I must now, on your account, be <lb/>
            anxious on this point,—that is, to show how and in what <lb/>
            respects it is most possible, with a view to this discovery, <note type="footnote"> * Plato's object here is to show, that painters in the high departments <lb/>
            of art copy ideal, not actual nature,-nature in its perfection,-not in its <lb/>
            imperfect and actual nature. </note> <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. C. 18.] </note> <lb/>
            you must again allow what you did before. What ? Can <lb/>
            anything possibly be executed as perfectly as it is de­ <lb/>
            scribed ; or, is it the nature of practice, that it does not ap­ <lb/>
            proach so near to truth as theory, though some may think <lb/>
            otherwise :-will you allow this or not ? I allow it, said <lb/>
            he. Do not oblige me then to show you, that all these things <lb/>
            in every respect positively exist in as great perfection as we <lb/>
            have described in our reasoning :-if, however, we can find <lb/>
            out how a state may be established as closely as possible <lb/>
            to what has been mentioned, you will agree that we have <lb/>
            discovered the possibility of what you require; or will you <lb/>
            not even be satisfied, if this be proved ? For my own part I <lb/>
            should be satisfied. Yes, and I too, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.-Next then, it seems, we must endeavour <lb/>
            to find out and show what is the evil now existing in states, <lb/>
            owing to which they are not established in the manner we <lb/>
            have described,-and what is that smallest change, by making <lb/>
            which we could bring the state to this model of government; <lb/>
            -and let us chiefly see, if this can be effected by the change of <lb/>
            one thing,—if not, by the change of two,—if not that, by the <lb/>
            change of the fewest things in number, and the smallest in <lb/>
            power. By all means, said he. By changing one thing only <lb/>
            then, said I, methinks, I can show that the state may be <lb/>
            moulded into this form of government:—that change, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is neither small nor easy, though possible. What is <lb/>
            it ? said he. I am now come, said I, to what I compared to <lb/>
            the greatest wave: and it shall now be mentioned, even <lb/>
            though, as with a wave, I should be overwhelmed with ridi­ <lb/>
            cule and infamy. Consider, however, what I am now <lb/>
            going to say. Proceed, replied he. Unless either philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, said I, govern in states, or those who are at present <lb/>
            called kings and governors philosophize genuinely and sum­ <lb/>
            ciently, and both political power and philosophy unite <lb/>
            in one,-and until the bulk of those now pursuing each <lb/>
            of these separately are of necessity excluded, there will <lb/>
            be no end, Glaucon, to the miseries of states, nor yet, as <lb/>
            I think, to those of the human race ; nor till then will that <lb/>
            government, which we have described in our reasonings, ever <lb/>
            spring up to a positive existence, and behold the light of the <lb/>
            sun.—And this is what all along made me dislike mention­ <lb/>
            ing it, that I saw what a paradox I was about to advance : for <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. C. 19. </note> <lb/>
            one can scarcely be convinced that no other government but this <lb/>
            can enjoy happiness, either public or private. You have thrown <lb/>
            out such an expression and argument, Socrates, said he, as <lb/>
            you think may bring on you a great many, and these too so <lb/>
            specially bold as to put off their clothes, and snatch naked <lb/>
            whatever weapon each happens to have ready (as if about <lb/>
            performing prodigies) for rushing forward in battle-array: <lb/>
            -and if you do not mow them down with argument, and so <lb/>
            make your escape, you will pay for it by suffering the se­ <lb/>
            verest ridicule. And are not you the cause of all this ? said <lb/>
            I. Aye, through acting well at least, replied he :-yet in this <lb/>
            affair, I will not betray but defend you, as far as I can; <lb/>
            and I am enabled to do so both by my own good-will and your <lb/>
            encouragement; and your questions probably I shall answer <lb/>
            more carefully than any other :-only do you try, by help <lb/>
            of such assistance, to show those who are loath to be­ <lb/>
            lieve these things, that they really are what you represent <lb/>
            them. I must try, said I; especially, as you afford me so <lb/>
            much assistance. And here it seems necessary, if we can <lb/>
            at all escape from those you mention, that we should at any <lb/>
            rate define clearly what kind of men those are whom we <lb/>
            call philosophers,-those, who, we are bold enough to say, <lb/>
            ought alone to govern;—so that, when they are clearly <lb/>
            pointed out, an able defence may be set up, by asserting that <lb/>
            it is their natural province both to study philosophy, and <lb/>
            also assume to themselves the government of the state,­ <lb/>
            while the other members of the state study neither philosophy <lb/>
            nor politics, but only obey their leader. It is quite fit, said <lb/>
            he, that we should define them. Come then, follow me this <lb/>
            way, [and see] if we can in some way or other sufficiently <lb/>
            explain this matter. Lead on then, said he. Will it be neces­ <lb/>
            sary then, to remind you, said I,—or do you recollect, that <lb/>
            when we say of any one, that he loves a thing, he would <lb/>
            not appear, if we speak strictly, to love one part of it, and <lb/>
            not another, but to have an affection for the whole ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—I need, it seems, to be reminded of that, <lb/>
            replied he ; for I do not understand it perfectly. Some one <lb/>
            else, indeed, Glaucon, replied I, might say what you say; <lb/>
            out it does not become a man who is a lover, to forget <lb/>
            that all things in their bloom somehow excite, and agi­ <lb/>
            tate an amorous person and lover, as seeming worthy <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. c. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            both of respect and of proper salutes:—do you not behave <lb/>
            in this manner towards the beautiful? One, because flat­ <lb/>
            nosed, will be called agreeable, and be an object of praise; <lb/>
            and the hooked nose of another, you call princely; and <lb/>
            that between these, formed with exact symmetry: the dark <lb/>
            are said to have a manly look, and the fair to be the chil­ <lb/>
            dren of the gods : but this name of delicate white, think <lb/>
            you it is the invention of any other than a flattering <lb/>
            lover, who easily bears with the paleness, if it be in the <lb/>
            season of youth ?—in one word, do you not make all kinds <lb/>
            of pretences, and say everything that you can, so as not <lb/>
            to reject any one who is in the prime of life ? If you <lb/>
            are disposed, said he, to judge by me of other lovers, that <lb/>
            they act in this manner, I agree to it for argument's sake. <lb/>
            And what, said I, as to lovers of wine :—do not you find they <lb/>
            act in the same manner, cheerfully drinking every kind of <lb/>
            wine on every pretext ? Yes, indeed. And you perceive, <lb/>
            I suppose, that the ambitious likewise, if they cannot obtain <lb/>
            the command of an army, will take the command of a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριττύς</foreign>;* and if they cannot get honour from greater and <lb/>
            nobler men, are content to be honoured by the lesser and <lb/>
            the meaner sort, because they are desirous of honour at any <lb/>
            rate ? Perfectly true. Will you allow this or not: if we <lb/>
            say, one desires a thing, are we to say that he desires the <lb/>
            whole species, or that he desires one part of it, but not <lb/>
            another ? The whole, replied he. May we not then like­ <lb/>
            wise say, that the philosopher desires wisdom, and that <lb/>
            too, not one part only, but the whole ? True. He then, <lb/>
            who is averse to a course of discipline, especially if he be <lb/>
            young, and has not understanding to discern what is good <lb/>
            and what is otherwise, should not be called a lover of <lb/>
            learning, nor a philosopher ;-just as we say of a person <lb/>
            disgusted with meats, that he neither hungers after nor <lb/>
            desires meats, and is not a lover but a hater of them. <lb/>
            Aye,and we shall say right. But the man who has a <lb/>
            ready inclination to taste of every branch of learning, and <lb/>
            enters with pleasure on its study, and is insatiable thereof, <note type="footnote"> * The Scholiast states by way of explanation, that the Athenian people <lb/>
            were divided into ten <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕυλαι</foreign> or wards, which were again subdivided into <lb/>

            this man we may with justice call a philosopher, may we <lb/>
            not ? Whereon Glaucon said, Many such philosophers as <lb/>
            those will go into great absurdities; for all your lovers of <lb/>
            shows appear to me to be of this kind, from taking a pleasure <lb/>
            in learning; and your story-lovers are of all persons to <lb/>
            be reckoned the most stupid,-among philosophers at least. <lb/>
            These indeed would not willingly attend to such reasoning, or <lb/>
            to such a disquisition as this. But yet, as if they had hired <lb/>
            out their ears to listen to every public ditty, they run about <lb/>
            to the Dionysia, omitting neither the civic nor village fes­ <lb/>
            tivals.* Are all these then, and others who run after such <lb/>
            matters, and those likewise who devote themselves to the infe­ <lb/>
            rior arts, to be called by us philosophers ? By no means, said I, <lb/>
            but only like philosophers.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—Who are they, however, said he, whom you <lb/>
            call the true ones? Those, said I, who are desirous of discerning <lb/>
            the truth.† That too, said he, is correct :-but how do you <lb/>
            mean? It is not easy, said I, to tell another this; but you, I <lb/>
            think, should agree with me in this. In what ? That since the <lb/>
            beautiful is contrary to the deformed, these are two things. Of <lb/>
            course, they are. And if they are two, then each of them is <lb/>
            one. Granted also. And as regards justice and injustice,­ <lb/>
            good and evil,-and also respecting all ideas whatever, the <lb/>
            argument is the same-that each of them is one in itself, <lb/>
            though, as to their relation with actions and bodies, and each <lb/>
            other mutually, they take an all-varying number of forms, <lb/>
            so as to make the one appear many. Right, said he. In this <note type="footnote"> * There were three festivals at Athens, commonly termed Bacchic,­ <lb/>
            the great or city festival (the most important of all, at which the dramatic <lb/>
            poets contended with their new plays), celebrated in the month Elaphebo­ <lb/>
            lion,-the Lenæa, in the month Maimacterion,—and the rural Dionysia, <lb/>
            in the month Poseideon. </note><note type="footnote"> t The portrait of the true philosopher, whom Plato conceives to be the <lb/>
            only true president and ruler of his state, is described from this chapter <lb/>
            onwards to the end of the third chapter of the sixth book, with further <lb/>
            illustration in the thirteenth chapter of that book. Should the reader <lb/>
            conceive, that too little regard is paid to worldly affairs and too little <lb/>
            stress laid on the doctrine of ideas, he must recollect that this philosopher <lb/>
            conceived that all knowledge of truth (-without which not even civil busi. <lb/>
            ness could be conducted, according to his notions—) is to be gained onlyfrom <lb/>
            the contemplation of things considered per se,—and that there can be no <lb/>
            real human felicity unconnected with wisdom and virtue, which can only <lb/>
            be attained by true philosophers engaged in inquiring into the eternal <lb/>
            nature of things around or in themselves. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. v. c. 20.] </note> <lb/>
            manner then, said I, do I distinguish and set apart those that <lb/>
            you just mentioned, the lovers of public shows, from crafts­ <lb/>
            men and mechanics; and then quite apart from these I place <lb/>
            those of whom we are now discoursing, whom alone we may <lb/>
            properly call philosophers. How say you ? replied he. The <lb/>
            lovers of common stories and spectacles, delight in fine sounds, <lb/>
            colours, and figures, and everything made up of these; but <lb/>
            the nature of beauty itself their intellect is unable to dis­ <lb/>
            cern and admire. That is the case, indeed, said he. As to <lb/>
            those, however, who are able to approach this beauty itself <lb/>
            and behold it in its real essence, surely they must be few in <lb/>
            number ? Extremely so. He then who deems some things <lb/>
            beautiful, but neither knows beauty itself nor is able to <lb/>
            follow, should any one lead to the knowledge of it, do <lb/>
            you think he lives in a dream, or is awake ? consider: is <lb/>
            not this to dream, when a man, either asleep or awake, <lb/>
            imagines the likeness of a thing not to be its likeness, but <lb/>
            the real thing itself which it resembles ? I for my part <lb/>
            would assert, replied he, that such a person is really in a <lb/>
            dream. But what now as to him who comes to an exactly <lb/>
            opposite conclusion, who understands the real nature of <lb/>
            beauty, and is able to discern both it and its accessories, and <lb/>
            deems neither the accessories to be beauty, nor beauty the <lb/>
            accessories ;-does such a man, think you, live in a waking <lb/>
            or dreaming state ? Wide awake, said he. May we not <lb/>
            then properly call this man's intellectual power, so far as he <lb/>
            really knows, knowledge, but that of the other, opinion,­ <lb/>
            as he only opines ? Surely so. But what,—if the person, who, <lb/>
            we say, only opines things, but does not really know them, <lb/>
            becomes indignant, and raises a dispute, alleging that our posi­ <lb/>
            tion is not true, shall we have any method of soothing and <lb/>
            gently persuading him, and yet at the same time concealing <lb/>
            that he is not in a sound state ? We surely ought, replied <lb/>
            he. Come then, bethink you what we are to say to him. <lb/>
            -are you disposed that we should question him thus,­ <lb/>
            saying, that if he knows anything, no one envies him, and <lb/>
            we should gladly see him possessed of more knowledge ;—and <lb/>
            tell us this too, does the man who has so much knowledge, <lb/>
            know something or nothing? Do you answer me in his <lb/>
            behalf. I will answer, said he, that he knows something. <lb/>
            Is it something then, that does or does not exist ? What <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. c. 21. </note> <lb/>
            does exist : for how can that, which does not exist, <lb/>
            be known ? This, then, we have sufficiently considered;­ <lb/>
            though we might have considered it more fully,-that what <lb/>
            really is, may be really known, but what does not at all exist, <lb/>
            cannot be known at all? Yes,—this we have examined quite <lb/>
            sufficiently. Be it so : but if there be anything of such. <lb/>
            character, as both to be and not to be, must it not lie between <lb/>
            what has a perfect existence, and what has none at all ? <lb/>
            Between them. If then there is knowledge as to what really <lb/>
            exists, and necessarily ignorance as to what does not exist,­ <lb/>
            as to what lies between these, must we not seek for something <lb/>
            between ignorance and science, if there be any such thing ? <lb/>
            By all means. Are we to allege, then, that opinion is any­ <lb/>
            thing ? Of course. Is it a different faculty from science, or <lb/>
            the same ? Different. Opinion then is conversant about one <lb/>
            thing, and science about another, each according to its own <lb/>
            peculiar faculty ? Just so. Is not then the nature of science <lb/>
            as regards that which exists, to know what existence is ? It <lb/>
            seems to me, however, far more necessary to lay down the <lb/>
            distinction thus. How ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—We will say, that faculties are a certain <lb/>
            kind of real existences, by which both we can do whatever <lb/>
            we are able, and every being else also whatever it is able : <lb/>
            for instance, I say, that seeing and hearing are faculties, <lb/>
            if you understand what I mean to call 'the species' [or idea].* <lb/>
            I understand, said he. Hear then what is my opinion about <lb/>
            them : for I do not see any colour nor figure, nor any of <lb/>
            such qualities of a faculty, as of many other things, with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to which I form a mental internal perception of their <lb/>
            differences : but in a faculty, I regard that alone, about <lb/>
            which it is employed, and what it accomplishes ; and on this <lb/>
            account I call each of these a faculty; and that which is <lb/>
            employed about and accomplishes one and the same purpose, <lb/>
            this I call the same faculty; but what is employed about and <lb/>
            accomplishes a different purpose, that I call a different faculty : <lb/>
            —what say you ? In what manner do you call it ? Just the <note type="footnote"> * Plato makes use of two terms in his system,— <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ετδος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἰδἑα</foreign>;— <lb/>
            and some commentators are disposed to think, that the former corresponds <lb/>
            with the dialectical term, species,—the higher intellectual, abstract notion <lb/>
            being expressed only by the latter. It must be confessed, however, that <lb/>
            they are often used with scarcely any distinction of meaning. </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V. c. 21.] </note> <lb/>
            same, he replied. Here again, excellent Glaucon, said I,— <lb/>
            do you allege, that science is itself a certain faculty, or to <lb/>
            what class do you refer it? To this, he said, the strongest <lb/>
            of all the faculties. But what then ;-are we to refer <lb/>
            opinion to faculty, or to some other species ? By no <lb/>
            means, said he; for that by which we have the power <lb/>
            of forming opinions is nothing else but opinion. But <lb/>
            some time since, you allowed that science and opinion were <lb/>
            not the same. How, said he, can any one with common <lb/>
            sense reduce under one, what is infallible, and what is <lb/>
            not infallible ? Right, said I;—and it is plain, that we <lb/>
            have allowed opinion to be a different thing from science. <lb/>
            Yes,-different. Each of them then has naturally a different <lb/>
            faculty in reference to a different object ? Of course. Science <lb/>
            surely as regards that which exists, so as to know the nature of <lb/>
            real existence? Yes. But we say that opinion opines? Yes. <lb/>
            Is it cognizant of the same thing that science is;—and will that <lb/>
            which is known, and that which is matter of opinion, be the <lb/>
            same ;-or is this Impossible ? Impossible, said he, from what <lb/>
            has been granted : since they are naturally faculties of different <lb/>
            things, and both of them are faculties,-opinion and science, <lb/>
            -and each of them different from the other, as we have said; <lb/>
            hence it cannot be, that what is opined is the same with that <lb/>
            which is known. If then that which exists is known, must <lb/>
            it not differ from what is perceived by opinion ? It does <lb/>
            differ. Does opinion then entertain what has no exist­ <lb/>
            ence ;-or is it impossible to opine what does not exist at <lb/>
            all ?-Consider now, does not the man who opines, refer his <lb/>
            opinion to some standard;—or is it possible to opine, and yet <lb/>
            opine nothing at all ? Impossible. But whoever opines, <lb/>
            opines some one thing? Yes. But surely that which does <lb/>
            not exist, cannot be called any one thing, but most properly <lb/>
            nothing at all? Certainly. But we necessarily referred igno­ <lb/>
            rance to that which has no true being, and knowledge to <lb/>
            real existence? Right, said he. He does not, therefore, <lb/>
            opine true being, nor yet that which has no being ? He does <lb/>
            not. Opinion then is neither knowledge, nor is it Ignorance ? <lb/>
            It seems not. Does it then exceed these, either know­ <lb/>
            ledge in perspicuity, or ignorance in obscurity? Neither. <lb/>
            Think you then, said I, that opinion is more obscure than <lb/>
            knowledge, but clearer than ignorance? Far, said he. Does <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. v. c. 22. </note> <lb/>
            it lie then between them both? Yes. Opinion then is <lb/>
            between the two ? Entirely so. And have we not already <lb/>
            said, that if anything appeared of such a nature, as at <lb/>
            once to exist and yet not exist, such a thing would lie <lb/>
            between what really exists, and that which has no exist­ <lb/>
            ence at all, and neither science nor ignorance would take <lb/>
            cognizance of it, but that only which appeared to be be­ <lb/>
            tween ignorance and science ? Right. And now, what we <lb/>
            call opinion has been shown to lie between them. It has <lb/>
            been so shown.</p>
          <p>CHAP, XXII.—This then yet remains for us, as it seems, <lb/>
            to discover,-what participates in both-that is, being, and <lb/>
            non-being, and what can properly be called neither of them <lb/>
            perfectly,-so that if it seems to be what it is reputed, <lb/>
            we may with justice term it so, assigning to the extremes <lb/>
            what are extreme, and to the middle what are between <lb/>
            the two : —must we not? Just so. These things being de­ <lb/>
            termined, I will say, let this worthy man tell and answer <lb/>
            me, — he who reckons that there is neither beauty, nor <lb/>
            idea of beauty, always the same; but that lover of beau­ <lb/>
            tiful objects* reckons that there are many beautiful objects, <lb/>
            not enduring to be told that there is only one beautiful, <lb/>
            and one just, and so of the rest. Of all these many things, <lb/>
            excellent man! shall we say, whether there be any which <lb/>
            will not appear deformed, and of those just which will <lb/>
            not appear unjust, and of those holy which will not appear <lb/>
            profane ? No; but said he, the objects themselves must <lb/>
            in some respects necessarily appear both beautiful and de­ <lb/>
            formed, and whatever else you ask. But what ?-Do double <lb/>
            quantities generally seem to have less capacity for being <lb/>
            halves than the doubles [of others ?] Not at all. And things <lb/>
            great and small, light and heavy, are they to be termed what <lb/>
            we call them, any more than the opposite ? No ; said he : <lb/>
            -each of them, always participates of both. Is then, or <lb/>
            is not, each of these many things just what it is said to be? <lb/>
            It resembles their equivocal jokes at feasts, said he, and the <lb/>
            riddle of children about the eunuch's striking the bat, with <note type="footnote"> * The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκει̃νος</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕιλοθεἁμων</foreign> (which Ast. considers superfluous) <lb/>

            immutable beauty of truth and virtue. </note> <pb n="167"/>

            what and on what part they guess he strikes it :* for all <lb/>
            these things have a double meaning, and it is impossible to <lb/>
            know accurately whether they are, or are not,-or are both, <lb/>
            or neither of the two. How can you act with them then, <lb/>
            said I, or what better position have you for them than a <lb/>
            medium between being and non-being ?-For nothing seems <lb/>
            more obscure than non-being as compared with having no <lb/>
            being at all, nor more clear than being in respect of real <lb/>
            being.† Most true, said he. We have discovered then, it <lb/>
            seems, that most of the maxims of the people about the <lb/>
            beautiful, and those other things, fluctuate somehow between <lb/>
            being and non-being. Yes, we have discovered it. But it <lb/>
            was formerly agreed at least, that if such a thing were appa­ <lb/>
            rent, it ought to be called that which is opined, and not what <lb/>
            is known ; and that which fluctuates between the two is <lb/>
            to be perceived by the intermediate faculty. We agreed. <lb/>
            Those then, who contemplate many beautiful things, but yet <lb/>
            never perceive beauty itself, and cannot follow another who <lb/>
            would lead them to it,—and many just things, though not <lb/>
            justice itself, and all other things in like manner, these persons, <lb/>
            we will say, hold opinions on all things, yet have no accurate <lb/>
            knowledge of what they opine. It must be so, said he. But <lb/>
            what then, as regards those who perceive each of the objects <lb/>
            themselves, always existing in the same manner, and in the <note type="footnote"> * The Scholiast cites the following lines, which he ascribes to Cle­ <lb/>

          <p>In the sixth book,-continuing the argument respecting the indispensa­ <lb/>
            bility of true philosophy to a well-ordered state, and the absolute need <lb/>
            of distinguishing true from false philosophy (i. e. that of the sophists <lb/>
            which throws discredit on the whole pursuit), and likewise from what is <lb/>
            warped by prejudice, he goes on to show that a state will be blessed <lb/>
            with philosophers for rulers, and shows what is the true subject of true <lb/>
            philosophy, as well as the means and manner of learning it,-the sum of <lb/>
            which is, that a good <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕὑλαξ</foreign> must be provided with all the defences of <lb/>
            true science, not with a view to unprofitable speculations, but that <lb/>
            all science and all virtue, his moral clothing, may be considered with <lb/>
            reference to its real bearing on the common good of human society. <lb/>
            Philosophy, says Plato, has for its proper subject the idea of good (the <lb/>
            true end of being), and this being the subject, he next goes on to show <lb/>
            the mode of becoming acquainted therewith.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—Philosophers then, Glaucon, said I, and those who <lb/>
            are not so, have, at length, after a long parade of talk and with <lb/>
            some difficulty, been respectively defined. Aye, said he,--for <lb/>
            perhaps, it was not easy to do it briefly. It appears not, said I. <lb/>
            —I still think, however, that their qualities would have been <lb/>
            better exhibited, had we deemed it right to speak about this <lb/>
            alone, and not discussed a multitude of other matters <lb/>
            while considering the difference between a just and an un­ <lb/>
            just life. What then, said he, are we to consider next ? <lb/>
            What else, said I, but that which is next in order ?-Since <lb/>
            those are philosophers who are able to concern themselves <lb/>
            with what always maintains a constant relation, whereas <lb/>
            those who cannot effect this, but ruminate among a host <lb/>
            of [ material objects] that are every way shifting, ∗ are not <lb/>
            philosophers ;-which of these ought to be the rulers of the <lb/>
            state ? Which way, said he, shall we define the matter, and <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig34.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="170"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
              define correctly? Such of them, said I, as seem capable <lb/>
              of preserving the laws and institutions of states, these are <lb/>
              to be made guardians. Right, said he. This then, said I, <lb/>
              is of course evident,-whether we ought to seek for a <lb/>
              guardian one that is blind or one that is sharp-sighted. <lb/>
              Of course, that is quite evident, said he. What difference <lb/>
              then is there between blind persons and those who are <lb/>
              in fact deprived of the knowledge of each individual es­ <lb/>
              sence, and have no clear demonstration of it In the soul, <lb/>
              and cannot (like painters who look at what is positively true, <lb/>
              and refer everything thereto, examining it with all possible <lb/>
              accuracy), if need be, form settled notions, of the beau­ <lb/>
              tiful, just, and good, and so maintain them, as if sanctioned <lb/>
              by law ? No, by Zeus, said he ;-they do not differ much. <lb/>
              Shall we then rather appoint these as our guardians, or those <lb/>
              rather who know each individual being, and in experience <lb/>
              are not at all inferior to those others, nor behind them in <lb/>
              any other department of virtue ? It were absurd, said he, to <lb/>
              choose any others, if at least they be not deficient in all other <lb/>
              matters; since they excel in this, which is the most important. <lb/>
              Must we not inquire this then,-in what manner the same <lb/>
              persons will be able to have both the one and the other ?* <lb/>
              Certainly. As we observed then, at the opening of this <lb/>
              discussion, we must first of all thoroughly understand their <lb/>
              disposition; and I think, if we are pretty well agreed about <lb/>
              that, we shall agree also, that the same persons are able to <lb/>
              possess both these qualities; and none else but these ought <lb/>
              to be the governors of states. How so ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—Let us then so far agree about philosophic <lb/>
            dispositions, that as respects learning they always covet <lb/>
            that which discovers to them that ever-existing essence which <lb/>
            does not vary through generation or corruption. Let it be <lb/>
            agreed. And likewise, said I, that they desire the whole <lb/>
            of such learning, and do not willingly omit any part of <lb/>
            it, either small or great, more honourable or more dis­ <lb/>
            honourable, as we formerly observed concerning the am­ <lb/>
            bitious and those engaged in love. You say right, said he. <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἁκει̃να καἰ ταυ̃τα ἔχειν</foreign>,-that is, both a practical acquaintance <lb/>
            and experience of things, and a more subtle and scientific knowledge <lb/>
            of truth. </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. C. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            Consider then, in the next place, whether, besides, what <lb/>
            we have mentioned, it be necessary for those who would <lb/>
            be such as we have described, to have this also in their <lb/>
            natures. What? Freedom from falsehood, and never <lb/>
            willingly to admit a lie, but rather to hate it through <lb/>
            love of truth. It probably would, replied he. It is not <lb/>
            only probable, my friend, but quite necessary, that one who <lb/>
            naturally loves a thing should love everything that is allied <lb/>
            and belongs to the object of his affection. Right, said he. <lb/>
            Is there anything that you can find more nearly allied to <lb/>
            wisdom than truth ? I cannot, said he. Is it possible, <lb/>
            then, for the same disposition to be both philosophic, and <lb/>
            fond of falsehood ? By no means. He then who is really <lb/>
            a lover of learning, ought from early infancy wholly to <lb/>
            desire all truth ? By all means. But we know somehow, <lb/>
            that whoever has his desires vehemently set on one object, for <lb/>
            this very reason has them weaker as regards other things,-just <lb/>
            as a current diverted from its channel. Certainly. Whoever <lb/>
            then has his desires running out after learning and such like <lb/>
            matters, would be engaged, methinks, with the pleasure of <lb/>
            the soul itself, and forsake the pleasures arising from the <lb/>
            body,—if indeed, he be not a pretender, but a real phi­ <lb/>
            losopher. This of course must necessarily follow. Such <lb/>
            an one moreover is prudent, and by no means fond of money;­ <lb/>
            for the reasons why money is so anxiously sought at so great <lb/>
            a sacrifice are likely to make any one anxious rather than a <lb/>
            man like this. Certainly. And surely you should consider this <lb/>
            too, when deciding about a philosophic disposition, and one <lb/>
            that is not so. What ? That it shall not unconsciously take <lb/>
            an illiberal turn,-since narrow-mindedness is most revolting <lb/>
            to a soul that is ever earnestly pursuing all that is divine <lb/>
            and human. Most true, said he. Think you then, that <lb/>
            he who possesses magnificent intellectual conceptions and <lb/>
            can contemplate all time and all being, can possibly con­ <lb/>
            sider human life as a thing of great consequence? It is <lb/>
            impossible, said he. Such an one then will not regard death <lb/>
            as anything terrible. Least of all, surely. It seems then, that <lb/>
            a cowardly and illiberal disposition will not readily connect <lb/>
            itself with true philosophy. I do not think it will. What <lb/>
            then ;-can the well-disposed man, who has moderate desires, <pb n="172"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            and is not a lover of money, nor illiberal, nor arrogant, nor <lb/>
            cowardly, ever possibly be unjust, or a breaker of engage­ <lb/>
            ments? It is impossible. And this also you will likewise <lb/>
            consider, when viewing from its very source what is and <lb/>
            is not a philosophic soul, whether it be just and gentle, or <lb/>
            unsocial and savage. By all means. Neither, as I think, <lb/>
            will you omit this. What ? Whether it learn easily or with <lb/>
            difficulty:-in fact, do you expect that a person will ever <lb/>
            love a thing sufficiently, while he is uneasy in its performance, <lb/>
            and makes but small progress ? It cannot be. But what <lb/>
            if he be oblivious and retains nothing of what he learns, <lb/>
            can lie then possibly acquire science ?* How is it possible ? <lb/>
            And when he thus vainly labours, think you not that he <lb/>
            will be forced at last to hate both himself and such employ­ <lb/>
            ment ? Of course he must.. We can never reckon then <lb/>
            among philosophic souls, that which is forgetful; but we shall <lb/>
            on the other hand require it to have a good memory ? By all <lb/>
            means. And we can never say this at any rate, that an un­ <lb/>
            musical and ill-regulated disposition leads anywhere but to­ <lb/>
            wards irregularity. Where else should it ? But as regards <lb/>
            truth, think you it is allied to irregularity or regularity? To <lb/>
            regularity. Let us require then, in addition to all other <lb/>
            qualities, an intellect naturally well-regulated and gracious, <lb/>
            as a willing and naturally well-disposed guide in realizing <lb/>
            the idea of individual being. Of course. What then do <lb/>
            you not think, that we have in some measure discussed the <lb/>
            necessary qualifications, and such as are mutually connected <lb/>
            in a soul that would attain a fitting and perfect apprehen­ <lb/>
            sion of being?-Aye, the most necessary, said he. Can you <lb/>
            then any how blame such a study as this, which a man can <lb/>
            never sufficiently pursue, unless he has a naturally good <lb/>
            memory, learns with facility, and is generous, kind-hearted, <lb/>
            the friend and ally of truth, justice, manliness, and tem­ <lb/>
            perance ? Not even Momus himself, said he, could find <lb/>
            fault with such a study.t Aye, said I, and will it not be <lb/>
            to such as these alone, when perfected by education and <lb/>

            kind of play, not with the dice, but your reasonings;—though <lb/>
            the truth at least is not thus at all advanced.∗—I say this with <lb/>
            reference to the present inquiry; for a person may tell you, <lb/>
            that he has nothing to allege as an argument against your <lb/>
            questions individually, but sees in fact that all those who <lb/>
            plunge into philosophy do not pursue it with the view of <lb/>
            being taught in it during childhood, and liberated from it <lb/>
            when they arrive at mature age, but rather in order that they <lb/>
            may continue in it much longer, becoming most of them quite <lb/>
            perverse,-not to say, altogether depraved ; while even such of <lb/>
            them as appear most worthy, are still so far affected by this <lb/>
            pursuit that you so much commend, as to become useless to <lb/>
            the public. When I had heard this, I said,-Think you <lb/>

              planation?—Yet attend to the comparison, in order that you <lb/>
              may the better see how nicely I make it :-for the suffer­ <lb/>
              ings of the best philosophers in the management of public <lb/>
              affairs are so grievous, that there is not one other suffering <lb/>
              so severe: but in making our simile, and putting in a defence <lb/>
              for them, we must collect from many particulars, in the <lb/>
              same way as painters mingle together different figures, and <lb/>
              paint a creature both goat and stag in one,* and others of <lb/>
              the same kind. Conceive now such a person as this to be <lb/>
              the pilot of a fleet or a single ship, one who surpasses all in <lb/>
              the ship both in bulk and strength, but is somewhat deaf, <lb/>
              and short-sighted as well, and whose skill in nautical affairs <lb/>
              is much of the same kind;—and also that the sailors are all <lb/>
              quarrelling among each other about the pilotage, each think­ <lb/>
              ing he ought to be pilot, though he never learned the art, and <lb/>
              cannot show who was his master, nor at what time he got his <lb/>
              learning ;-that besides this, they all say that the art itself <lb/>
              cannot be taught, and are ready to cut in pieces any one who <lb/>
              says that it can.--Imagine further, that they are constantly <lb/>
              crowding round the pilot himself, begging, and forming all <lb/>
              schemes to induce him to commit the helm into their hands, and <lb/>
              that sometimes even, when they do not so well succeed in <lb/>
              persuading him as others may, they either kill these others, <lb/>
              or throw them overboard, and after having, by mandragora or <lb/>
              wine or something else, rendered the noble pilot incapable, <lb/>
              they manage the ship by aid of the crew, and sail on, thus <lb/>
              drinking and feasting, as may be expected of such people ;— <lb/>
              and besides this, if anyone be clever at assisting them in get­ <lb/>
              ting the management into their own hands, and either by per­ <lb/>
              suasion or force, setting aside the pilot, they praise such an one, <lb/>
              calling him sailor and pilot, and versed in navigation, but despise <lb/>
              as useless every one not of this character,—not in the least con­ <lb/>
              sidering that the true pilot must necessarily study the year, the <lb/>
              seasons, the heavens, and stars, and winds, and everything <lb/>
              belonging to his art, if he would be a real commander of a <lb/>
              ship; but at the same time as respects the art and practice of <lb/>
              governing men, whether some be willing or not, they think it <lb/>
              impossible for a man to attain it in connexion with the art <lb/>
              of navigation.—Whilst affairs are thus situated as regards <note type="footnote"> * The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγἑλαϕος</foreign> was a mere fictitious or fabled animal, like the <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> B. VI. C. 4.] </note> <lb/>
              ships, do you not think that the true pilot will be called <lb/>
              by the sailors on board of ships thus regulated, a mere star­ <lb/>
              gazer,* trifler, and of no use to them whatever? Un­ <lb/>
              doubtedly, said Adimantus. I think then, said I, that you <lb/>
              do not want this comparison explained, in order to see that <lb/>
              it represents how people feel in states towards true philoso­ <lb/>
              pliers, but that you quite understand what I mean. Perfectly, <lb/>
              said he. First of all then, as regards this,-namely, a person's <lb/>
              wondering that philosophers are not honoured in states,—you <lb/>
              must acquaint him with our comparison, and try to persuade <lb/>
              him, that it would be much more wonderful if they were <lb/>
              honoured. I will so, replied he. And further, that it is quite <lb/>
              true, as you were just observing, that the best of those who <lb/>
              study philosophy are useless to the bulk of mankind :-but <lb/>
              nevertheless, for all this, they intend to lay the blame not on <lb/>
              the philosophers, but on such as make no use of them,-for it <lb/>
              is not natural that the pilot should beg of the sailors to allow <lb/>
              him to govern them, nor that the wise should hold attend­ <lb/>
              ance at the gates of the rich :†-and whoever wittily said this <lb/>
              was mistaken; for this indeed is the natural method, that <lb/>
              whoever is sick, whether rich or poor, must necessarily go <lb/>
              to the gates of the physician, and whoever wants to be <lb/>
              governed must wait on a person able to govern; for it is <lb/>
              not natural that a really worthy governor should beg of the <lb/>
              governed to subject themselves to his government.—You will <lb/>
              not be far wrong, however, in comparing our present political <lb/>
              governors to those sailors we now mentioned, and those whom <lb/>
              they call insignificant and star-gazers to those who are truly <lb/>
              pilots. Quite right, said he. Hence, then, it would seem, <lb/>
              that the best pursuit is not likely to be held in much honour <lb/>
              by persons engaged in those of an opposite nature,-but by <lb/>
              far the greatest and most violent outcry against philosophy is <lb/>
              caused by those who profess its study;-the very persons, <lb/>
              whom most of all, you say, your reviler of philosophy calls <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετωροσκὁπον</foreign>, the usual term of reproach with which the Sophists <lb/>
              visited Socrates. Compare Apolog. Socr. p. IS b ; and see throughout <lb/>

              that you spoke correctly,-did I not? Yes.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Have we not now fully explained the cause, <lb/>
            why the best of them are useless? We have. Do you <lb/>
            wish, then, that we should next explain the reason, why <lb/>
            most of them must necessarily be depraved, and try also to <lb/>
            show, that philosophy is not the cause of this. Certainly. <lb/>
            Let us open our argument then, by carefully calling to mind <lb/>
            what we before observed about the natural disposition <lb/>
            necessarily belonging to the good and worthy [philosopher;] <lb/>
            —and if you remember, the leading part therein was truth, <lb/>
            which he must by all means wholly pursue, or else be a vain <lb/>
            boaster, having no fellowship with true philosophy. Aye,— <lb/>
            so it was said. Is not this single part of his character wholly <lb/>
            the reverse of what is at present held respecting him ? Quite <lb/>
            so, replied he. We shall be urging, therefore, no trifling ar­ <lb/>
            gument in his defence, if we can show that the true lover of <lb/>
            learning is naturally inclined to aspire after the knowledge of <lb/>
            real being, and, so far from being arrested by the numerous in­ <lb/>
            dividual things which are the objects of opinion, that he pro - <lb/>
            ceeds undauntedly forward and desists not from his love of <lb/>
            truth* till he becomes acquainted with the nature of all existing <lb/>
            things through the agency of that part of the soul whose busi­ <lb/>
            ness it is to take cognizance of such matters:-but it is the <lb/>
            office of that part of the soul which is allied [to real being;] <lb/>
            and when this true lover of learning approaches thus far, and <lb/>
            mingles therewith, thus giving rise to intellect and truth, he <lb/>
            will attain to true knowledge, and truly live and be main­ <lb/>
            tained, and at length become liberated from the pains of <lb/>
            production, † –but not before. As good a defence, said he, as <lb/>
            there possibly can be. What then;-will it be a part of <lb/>
            such a person's business to love falsehood, or quite the con­ <lb/>
            trary, to hate it ? To hate it, said he. While truth, how­ <lb/>
            ever, leads the way, we can never say, I think, that any <lb/>
            band of evils follows in her train ? No, we cannot. But <lb/>
            on the contrary, sound and just morals accompanied with <lb/>
            temperance ? Right, said he. Well then ;-is it necessary <note type="footnote"> * Camp. here Book v., ch. 20 (p. 476, c, d). </note><note type="footnote"> t Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὓτω</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">λήγοι ὠδι̃νος</foreign>.

            of this character possess fortitude, magnanimity, aptitude for <lb/>
            learning, and a good memory; and when you said by way of <lb/>
            rejoinder, that every one would be compelled to agree to our <lb/>
            statement, we quitted that subject, and turned to the subject of <lb/>
            our present discourse-your assertion of having found some <lb/>
            of the philosophers useless, and the majority also com­ <lb/>
            pletely depraved.-And in investigating the cause of that <lb/>
            calumny, we are at length come to inquire, how it is, that <lb/>
            the greater part of them are bad; and on this account we have <lb/>
            again analyzed the nature of true philosophers, and necessarily <lb/>
            defined it. It is so, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—We must therefore, consider, said I, the cor­ <lb/>
            ruptions of this nature, how it becomes ruined in many, so <lb/>
            that only some few escape, whom men call not depraved, <lb/>
            but useless ; and next we must consider those dispositions that <lb/>
            counterfeit this nature, and only pretend to pursue it, and what <lb/>
            is the nature also of those souls, which aspire to a pursuit <lb/>
            not belonging to them, and above their reach : for these per­ <lb/>
            sons, by their multiplied errors, have everywhere and among <lb/>
            all men, attached this opinion to philosophy which you are <lb/>
            now mentioning. To what kind of corruptions, said he, do <lb/>
            you allude ? I will try to recount them, said I, if I can.- <lb/>
            And this now, methinks, every one will allow us, that such <lb/>
            a nature, with all the qualifications that we just now en­ <lb/>
            joined to a person aspiring to be a perfect philosopher, is <lb/>
            rarely to be found among men, and of these there are but <lb/>
            very few : do you not think so? Quite so. And among those <lb/>
            few, just consider how many and how great are the causes of <lb/>
            corruption. What are they ? The most surprising of all to <lb/>
            hear,– namely, that of those qualities which we commended <lb/>
            in the nature of a philosopher, each corrupts the soul pos­ <lb/>
            sessing them, and withdraws it from philosophy-from for­ <lb/>
            titude, I mean, and temperance, and all those other quali­ <lb/>
            ties which we enumerated. That is a strange saying, said <lb/>
            he. And further still, said I;—besides these things, all that <lb/>
            are commonly called good,—such as beauty, riches, bodily <lb/>
            strength, a powerful family connexion in the state,* and all <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυγγἑνεια ἐῤῥωμἑνη</foreign> tv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁλει</foreign>.Plato similarly speaks of political </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>

            that relates to these, corrupt and withdraw it from philoso­ <lb/>
            phy:-there, you now have the outline of what I mean. <lb/>
            I have, he replied, and would be glad more clearly to under­ <lb/>
            stand what you say. Apprehend, therefore, the whole of it <lb/>
            aright, said I; and it will become perfectly clear, and what we <lb/>
            before said will not be thought absurd. How then, said he, <lb/>
            do you bid me act ? With respect to every kind of seed, or <lb/>
            plant, said I, whether of vegetables or animals, we know, <lb/>
            that what is not properly nurtured and has not its proper <lb/>
            nourishment, or season, or place, the stronger it is, so many <lb/>
            more kindly influences does it require,- for evil is more <lb/>
            contrary to good, than to that which is not good. Of <lb/>
            course. It is reasonable then, I suppose, that the very best <lb/>
            nature, if supported on diet unsuited to it, should become <lb/>
            worse than one which is inferior? It is. Well then, <lb/>
            Adimantus, said I, are we to say, that souls naturally the <lb/>
            best, if badly trained, become more than commonly de­ <lb/>
            praved;—or think you that gross iniquity and extreme <lb/>
            wickedness arise from an inferior rather than from a good <lb/>
            disposition ruined in its education; whereas a weak dis­ <lb/>
            position will never produce either great good or great evil? <lb/>
            No,—I think not, said be;-and the case is as you say. <lb/>
            If then this philosophic nature, that we have here defined, <lb/>
            meet with suitable training, it will of necessity grow up, <lb/>
            I suppose, and attain to every virtue; but if it be sown in an <lb/>
            improper soil, and grow up and be nurtured accordingly, it <lb/>
            will become quite the reverse, unless one of the gods should <lb/>
            by chance come to its assistance;—think you then, as most <lb/>
            do, that some youths are corrupted by sophists, and that <lb/>
            these sophists are men in private life who corrupt them in any <lb/>
            matter soever that is worthy of their attention ;-or rather, <lb/>
            that the very persons who say these things are themselves the <lb/>
            greatest sophists, conveying their instruction with most per­ <lb/>
            fect skill, and rendering young and old, men and women, such <lb/>
            as they wish them to be ? When is that ? said he. When <lb/>
            many of them, said I, are seated and crowded together in an <lb/>
            assembly, in their law-courts, theatres, camps, or other public <note type="footnote"> connexions in the Sympos. p. 178 c :-<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂ γἁρ χρή ἁνθρὡποις ήγει̃σθαι</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              meetings of the people, and when they blame with much tumult <lb/>
              some speeches and acts, and commend others, shouting and <lb/>
              stamping, [to see] which shall outvie the other; — and <lb/>
              besides this, the echo from the rocks and the place where <lb/>
              they are sitting, redoubles the tumult of their disapprobation <lb/>
              and applause;-in such a situation as this, what kind of heart, <lb/>
              as the saying is, do you think the youth has; or what <lb/>
              private instruction can so restrain him, as to prevent him <lb/>
              from being quite overwhelmed by such blame or applause, <lb/>
              and from yielding and being carried along the stream <lb/>
              wherever it bears him;—and will he not call things beautiful <lb/>
              and base,. according as these people call them, and just as they <lb/>
              pursue them, thus becoming of the very same character ? This, <lb/>
              said he, must of course be the case, Socrates.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.-And yet, said I, we have not yet men­ <lb/>
            tioned what is the greatest necessity of all. What is that ? <lb/>
            said he. What these, your teachers and sophists, add, by <lb/>
            way of acts to their talk, when they cannot persuade :-know <lb/>
            you not that they punish with disgraces and fines and deaths, <lb/>
            the man whom they cannot persuade ? I know that, said he, <lb/>
            extremely well. What other sophist then, or what private <lb/>
            reasonings, do you think, will counteract and overpower <lb/>
            these ? I know none, said he. Is it not besides, said I, <lb/>
            great folly also even to attempt it ?-For there neither is, nor <lb/>
            was, nor can ever possibly be, any other system as regards vir­ <lb/>
            tue, to be compared with this education by the sophists,- <lb/>
            I mean a human method, my friend ; for a divine one, <lb/>
            according to the proverb, we keep out of the question.∗ — <lb/>
            Indeed, you must well know, with respect to whatever is pre <lb/>
            served, and becomes what it ought in such a constitution of <lb/>
            government, that you will not be far wrong in deeming it <lb/>
            preserved by divine destiny. t Nor am I, said he, of a <lb/>
            different opinion. But further now, besides this, said I, you <lb/>
            must also be of this opinion. Of what? That each of these <lb/>
            hired private teachers, whom these men call sophists and <note type="footnote"> * Ast conjectures that there was a well-known adage;—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ θει̃ον <lb/>

            consider as rival artists, teach nothing else but those dog­ <lb/>
            mas of the vulgar, which they approve in their assemblies, <lb/>
            and term wisdom ;-just as if a man were to learn the <lb/>
            tempers and desires of a great and strong animal that he is <lb/>
            training,—how it must be approached, how touched, and when <lb/>
            it is most fierce or most mild,—and from what sorts it <lb/>
            springs, and the sounds also which it is used occasionally to <lb/>
            utter, and by what sounds when uttered by another, this beast <lb/>
            is rendered either gentle or savage ; and if, after learning all <lb/>
            these things by long associating with this animal, he should <lb/>
            call this wisdom and, apply himself to the teaching thereof, as <lb/>
            to an established art,-while yet, as regards these dogmas and <lb/>
            desires, he has no real knowledge of what is beautiful or base, <lb/>
            good or ill, just or unjust, but defines them all by the opinions <lb/>
            of that great animal, calling those things good by which it is <lb/>
            pleased, and those evil with which it is vexed, having no other <lb/>
            measure respecting them, but calling things necessary both just <lb/>
            and beautiful, though he has never himself seen, nor can show <lb/>
            to another, the nature of the necessary and the good, and how <lb/>
            far they really differ from each other. Being such as this, then, <lb/>
            do you not, by Zeus, think him a ridiculous teacher? I do, <lb/>
            lie replied. And, think you, he in any way differs from <lb/>
            the man, who deems it wisdom to have understood the tempers <lb/>
            and pleasures of the multitude, and of mixed assemblies, either <lb/>
            in painting, music, or politics ?-For if any one converse with <lb/>
            these, and show them either a poem, or other work of art, or <lb/>
            piece of service connected with the state, and make the multi­ <lb/>
            tude the judges thereof, he is, beyond all other necessities, <lb/>
            under what is called a " Diomedean"* necessity,-that of <lb/>
            doing whatever they commend.-But as respects these things <lb/>
            being really good and beautiful, did you ever hear any of <note type="footnote"> * A Diomedean necessity is a proverbial expression applied to those, who <lb/>
            do anything from necessity : its origin is as follows. Diomedes and <lb/>
            Ulysses, having stolen the Palladium from Ilium, returned by night to <lb/>
            their ships. Ulysses, however, most anxious that the glory of the deed <lb/>
            should be his alone, endeavoured to slay Diomedes, who walked before <lb/>
            him with the Palladium. Diomedes, however, on seeing by moonlight <lb/>
            the shadow of the sword raised over him, seized Ulysses, bound his <lb/>
            hands, bid him walk before him, and, after striking him on the back with <lb/>
            the flat part of his sword, proceeded onward, and at length reached the <lb/>
            Argive camp. </note> <pb n="181"/>

            them advance a reason that was not quite ridiculous ? No;­ <lb/>
            and I think, said he, I never shall.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.— Considering all these things, then, bear <lb/>
            this in mind, that the multitude never will admit or reckon <lb/>
            that there is the one beautiful itself, and not many beau­ <lb/>
            tiful,—one thing itself individually existing, and not many <lb/>
            such individual things. They will be the last to do so, <lb/>
            lie replied. It is impossible, then, for the multitude to <lb/>
            be philosophers. Impossible. And those who philosophize <lb/>
            must necessarily be subject to their reproach ? Necessarily <lb/>
            so. And likewise to that of those private persons, who, in <lb/>
            conversing with the multitude, desire to please them? Clearly. <lb/>
            In consequence of this, then, what security do you see for <lb/>
            the philosophic nature to continue its pursuit, and arrive at <lb/>
            perfection ?-And consider from what has gone before; for <lb/>
            it has been admitted, that aptitude for learning, memory, <lb/>
            fortitude, and magnanimity belong to this kind of disposition. <lb/>
            Yes,—it has. Will not such an one as this, then, be the first <lb/>
            of all men in all things whatever, especially if he have a <lb/>
            body naturally suited to his soul ? Of course he will, <lb/>
            he replied. And when he is further advanced in years, his <lb/>
            kindred and citizens, methinks, will be disposed to employ <lb/>
            him in their affairs. Why not? As suppliants then they <lb/>
            will pay him homage, and submit to him, anticipating and <lb/>
            flattering beforehand his growing power. Aye, said he, such <lb/>
            is usually the case. What then, said I, think you such <lb/>
            an one will do under such circumstances, especially if <lb/>
            he be a member of a great state, rich, and nobly born, <lb/>
            handsome withal and of large stature ?∗—Will he not be <lb/>
            filled with extravagant hopes, deeming himself capable of <lb/>
            managing the affairs both of Greeks and barbarians, and on <lb/>
            this account demean himself loftily, being full of ostentation and <lb/>
            vain conceit, but without judgment ? Quite so, he replied. If <lb/>
            one should gently approach a man of this disposition, and tell <lb/>
            him the truth, that he has no judgment, but needs it;—as <lb/>
            judgment is only to be acquired by one who devotes himself <lb/>
            as a slave to its acquisition, think you, that, amidst all these <note type="footnote"> * It seems highly probable that Plato is here drawing a portrait of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 9. </note> <lb/>
            evils it would be easy for him to hearken ? Far from it, <lb/>
            he replied. But if, said I, through a good natural temper, <lb/>
            and innate attachment to reasoning, he were to acquire pene­ <lb/>
            tration, and thus be bent and drawn towards philosophy,­ <lb/>
            what, think we, will those others do, when they reckon on <lb/>
            losing his services and company:-will they not by every <lb/>
            action, and every speech, say and do all to the man to pre­ <lb/>
            vent his being persuaded,-and as respects his adviser, take <lb/>
            away all his influence, both by forming private plots and <lb/>
            arraigning him at public trials ? This, of course, must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily be the case, he replied. Is it likely then, that such an <lb/>
            one as this will be a philosopher? Not at all.</p>
          <p>CIIAP. IX.—You see then, said I, that we were not wrong <lb/>
            in saying, that even the very essentials of the philosophic dis­ <lb/>
            position, are, when badly directed, in some measure the cause <lb/>
            of a falling off from this pursuit, as well as from those <lb/>
            vulgarly reputed goods,—riches, and all such-like matters. <lb/>
            No, certainly, he replied ;-that was correctly observed. <lb/>
            Such then, said I, admirable friend! is the ruin, such and so <lb/>
            great the corruption of the best nature for the best of all <lb/>
            pursuits, and which, as we observe,, is rarely elsewhere to be <lb/>
            found :* and among these are the men who do the greatest <lb/>
            harm both to states and private persons, and those also who <lb/>
            do the greatest good, such as are drawn to one particular <lb/>
            side, [viz. what is good :]-whereas small talents do no­ <lb/>
            thing great for any one, either private person or state. <lb/>
            Most true, said he. Since those, then, who thus fall off, <lb/>
            whose chief business was to apply to philosophy, and who, <lb/>
            leaving her deserted and imperfect, lead themselves a life <lb/>
            neither becoming nor true,—while on this same philosophy <lb/>
            other unworthy persons have intruded and disgraced her, <lb/>
            loading her with reproaches, such as those with which you <lb/>
            say her revilers reproach her: — of those who engage <lb/>
            with her, — some are worth nothing, and most of them <lb/>
            deserve great punishments. Aye surely, this, replied he, <lb/>
            is commonly said. Aye,—and said too with reason, <lb/>
            replied I;—for other contemptible men seeing the field <lb/>
            unoccupied, and the possession of it followed by digni­ <lb/>
            ties and honourable names, just like persons who take <lb/>
            refuge from their prisons in the temples, these likewise <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> B. vi. c. ] 0.] </note> <lb/>
              gladly leap from their trade-crafts to philosophy;-such of <lb/>
              them I mean, as are most adept in their own little art.- <lb/>
              Indeed, even in this position of philosophy, her remain­ <lb/>
              ing dignity, in comparison with all the other arts, is still <lb/>
              of surpassing magnificence,—which dignity many eagerly <lb/>
              covet, who yet are of an imperfect nature, and have bodies <lb/>
              not only deformed by their arts and crafts, but souls <lb/>
              likewise that are broken and crushed by their servile <lb/>
              occupations:∗—must it not necessarily be so? Un­ <lb/>
              doubtedly, said he. Think you, then, said I, that they <lb/>
              at all differ in appearance from a bald and puny black- <lb/>
              smith, who having made a little money, has been newly <lb/>
              liberated from chains, and washed in the bath, † with a <lb/>
              new robe on him, just decked out as a bridegroom, pre­ <lb/>
              suming, on account of his master's poverty and forlorn situa­ <lb/>
              tion, to propose for his daughter's hand ? There is no great <lb/>
              difference, replied he. What sort of a race must such as <lb/>
              these produce ;—must it not be bastardly and abject? Cer­ <lb/>
              tainly,—it must. But what;-when persons unworthy of <lb/>
              instruction study it, and meddle with it unworthily, what <lb/>
              kind of sentiments and opinions must we say come from <lb/>
              them ?—Must they not be such as to be properly termed <lb/>
              sophisms, and neither genuine, nor allied to true discretion ? <lb/>
              Wholly so, of course, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—An extremely small number is left, said I, <lb/>
            Adimantus, of those who engage worthily in philosophy,— <lb/>
            men of that noble and well-cultivated nature, which some­ <lb/>
            how seeks retirement, and naturally persists in philosophic <lb/>
            study, through the absence of corrupting tendencies; or it <lb/>
            may be, in a small state, some mighty soul arises, who has <lb/>
            despised and wholly neglected civil honours ;-and there <lb/>
            may be some small portion perhaps, who, having a naturally <lb/>
            good disposition, hold other arts in just contempt, and then turn <lb/>
            to philosophy.-These the bridle of our friend Theages will <lb/>

              of his health occupies him to the exclusion of politics :* <lb/>
              -and as to what concerns myself, namely the sign of my <lb/>
              demon, it is not worth while to mention that; for I think it <lb/>
              has heretofore been met with only by one other, if any at all. <lb/>
              -And even of these few [they are] such as taste, and have <lb/>
              tasted, how sweet and blessed is the acquisition of philosophy, <lb/>
              and have withal sufficiently observed the madness of the <lb/>
              multitude, and that none of them, as I may say, does what <lb/>
              is wholesome in state matters, and that a man can get none <lb/>
              to aid him in securely succouring the just, but is like one <lb/>
              falling among wild beasts, neither willing nor able to aid <lb/>
              them in doing wrong, as one only against a host of wild <lb/>
              creatures, and so without doing any good either to the state <lb/>
              or his friends, perishes unprofitably to all the world. Quietly <lb/>
              reasoning on all these things, and attending to his own affairs, <lb/>
              like a man sheltered under a wall in a storm of dust and foam <lb/>
              borne along on the wind, by which he sees all about him over­ <lb/>
              whelmed in disorder, such an one is content anyhow to pass <lb/>
              his life pure from injustice and unholy deeds, and to effect his <lb/>
              exit hence with good hopes cheerful and agreeable. Aye,— <lb/>
              and he will make his exit, said he, without having done even <lb/>
              the least of them. Nor the greatest either, said I;—because <lb/>
              he has not found a suitable form of government; for in one <lb/>
              that suits him, he will both make greater progress himself, <lb/>
              and together with the affairs of private persons, will preserve <lb/>
              those of the public also.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—As respects philosophy, then, for what <lb/>
            reasons it has been traduced, and that it has been so un­ <lb/>
            justly, we have, I think, sufficiently stated,-unless you <lb/>
            have anything else to allege. Nay, said he;—I can say <lb/>
            nothing further about this point :-but which of the present <lb/>
            forms of government do you conceive to be suited to philo­ <lb/>
            sophy ? None whatever, said I; and this particularly is <lb/>
            what I complain of, that no existing constitution of a state <note type="footnote"> * Theages is stated in the Apology of Socrates (p. 33 c), to be the son <lb/>
            of Demodocus and the brother of Paralus, and to have been most desirous <lb/>

            here told that his delicate health hindered him from persevering in its <lb/>
            punsuit: –so true is the trying of Plutarch (de Sanit. tuend. p. 126 b), </note> <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> B. VI. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
              is worthy of the philosophic nature; and on this account <lb/>
              therefore it is turned and altered, just as a foreign seed sown <lb/>
              in an improper soil becomes worthless, and has a tendency to <lb/>
              fall under the influence of the soil in which it is placed ;-so <lb/>
              this race likewise has not at present its proper power, but <lb/>
              degenerates to some pattern foreign to it;-but in case that it <lb/>
              does meet with the best form of government, being itself also <lb/>
              best, it will then be evident that this is really divine, and all <lb/>
              others only human, both as to their natures and pursuits :-but <lb/>
              as a matter of course you are evidently about to ask what is <lb/>
              this form of government ? You are mistaken, said he,-for this <lb/>
              I was not going to ask; but whether it be this, which we have <lb/>
              described in establishing our state, or some other. As re­ <lb/>
              gards all other things, said I, it is this one :-and this very <lb/>
              thing was then mentioned, that there must always be in <lb/>
              our state something having the same regard for the govern­ <lb/>
              ment, which you the legislator had in establishing the <lb/>
              laws. Aye,—that was mentioned, said he. Yes, but, said <lb/>
              I, it was not made sufficiently clear, owing to the fear of <lb/>
              what you objected, when you showed also, that the illustration <lb/>
              of the thing would be both tedious and difficult;—for indeed <lb/>
              it is not on the whole quite easy to discuss what remains. <lb/>
              What is that ? In what manner a state is to undertake the <lb/>
              study of philosophy, so as not itself to be destroyed; for all <lb/>
              great pursuits are dangerous ; and,—as the saying is,—those <lb/>
              noble even are truly difficult. But still, rejoined he, let our <lb/>
              demonstration be completed by making this evident. Want <lb/>
              of inclination, said I, will not hinder, though possibly want of <lb/>
              power may:-and now you shall at once be assured of my rea­ <lb/>
              diness.—Consider indeed, how readily and adventurously I <lb/>
              am about to assert, that a state ought to attempt this study in <lb/>
              a way opposite to what it does at present. How ? At pre­ <lb/>
              sent, said I, those who engage in it are striplings, who, quite <lb/>
              from childhood, amidst their domestic affairs and lucrative <lb/>
              employments, betake themselves to most abstruse inquiries, <lb/>
              considering themselves consummate philosophers,—(and I call <lb/>
              what respects reasoning, the most difficult of all;)—and should <lb/>
              they in after-time be invited by others practising this art., <lb/>
              they are pleased to become hearers, and think it a great con­ <lb/>
              descension, reckoning they ought to do it as a by-work :-but <pb n="186"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
              towards old age, with the exception indeed of some few, they <lb/>
              are extinguished even more than the Heraclitean∗ sun, <lb/>
              because they are never again rekindled. But how should <lb/>
              they act ? said he. Quite the reverse of what they do : <lb/>
              while they are lads and youths they should study youthful <lb/>
              learning and philosophy,† and, take special care of the body, <lb/>
              during its growth and strengthening by inviting its services <lb/>
              to the aid of philosophy; and then, as that time of life pro­ <lb/>
              gresses, during which the soul is attaining its perfection, they <lb/>
              should vigorously apply to her exercises;—but when strength <lb/>
              decays, and is no longer suited for civil and military employ­ <lb/>
              ments, they should then be dismissed, and live at pleasure, with <lb/>
              the exception of a by-work, [that is, studying philosophy,]— <lb/>
              if indeed they propose to live happy, and, when they die, <lb/>
              possess in the other world, a destiny suited to the life which <lb/>
              they have led in this.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—How truly do I think, Socrates, said he, that <lb/>
            you speak with ready zeal:—I think, however, that most of <lb/>
            your bearers will still more zealously oppose you, and by no <lb/>
            means be persuaded, and Thrasymachus even first. Do not <lb/>
            divide Thrasymachus and me, said I, who are now become <lb/>
            friends, though not enemies heretofore ; for we will not at all <lb/>
            relax our efforts, till we either persuade both him and the <lb/>
            rest, or make some advances towards that life, on attaining <lb/>
            which they will again meet with such discourses as these. <lb/>
            You have spoken, said he, only for a short time. No time at all, <lb/>
            said I, as compared at least with the whole of time: but that <lb/>
            the multitude are not persuaded by what is said, is no wonder; <lb/>
            for they have never as yet seen that what was mentioned <lb/>
            actually came to pass, but rather that they were certain mere <lb/>
            words cleverly fitted to each other, and not as now coming out <lb/>
            spontaneously:and as regards the man, who is, as completely <lb/>
            as possible, squared and made consistent with virtue both in <lb/>
            word and deed, holding power in a state of such different <note type="footnote"> * Heraclitus the Ephesian said that the sun descended to the western <lb/>

            character; they have never at all seen either one or more <lb/>
            of the kind:-do you think they have ? By no means. <lb/>
            And again, as respects arguments, my excellent friend, they <lb/>
            have not sufficiently listened to what are fair and liberal, <lb/>
            such as persevere in the search for truth, by every method, <lb/>
            for the mere sake of knowledge, saluting at a distance* <lb/>
            such intricate and contentious questions, as tend only to <lb/>
            opinion and strife, either in their law-courts or private <lb/>
            meetings. Not even as respects these, he replied. On <lb/>
            these accounts then, said I, and foreseeing these things, <lb/>
            we, although with fear, still asserted (compelled by truth), <lb/>
            that neither state nor government, nor even a man in <lb/>
            the same way, could ever become perfect, till some need <lb/>
            of fortune should compel those few philosophers, who at <lb/>
            present are termed not depraved but useless, to take <lb/>
            the government of the state, whether they will or not, <lb/>
            and oblige it to be obedient to them; or till the sons <lb/>
            of those who are now in high offices and magistracies, or <lb/>
            they themselves, be by some divine inspiration filled with <lb/>
            a true love of sincere philosophy: and I am sure that no <lb/>
            one can reasonably suppose either or both of these to be <lb/>
            impossible; for thus might we justly be derided, as <lb/>
            saying things which otherwise are only like wishes :-is it <lb/>
            not so? It is. If then, in the infinite series of past ages, <lb/>
            absolute necessity has compelled men who have reached the <lb/>
            summit of philosophy to take the government of a state,—or <lb/>
            even if such is now the case in some barbarous region, remote <lb/>
            from our observation, or is likely to be the case hereafter, <lb/>
            we are ready, in that case, to advance in argument, that this <lb/>
            form of government just described has existed and now exists <lb/>
            Din possibility,] and will actually arise, when this our muse <lb/>
            shall obtain the government of the state : for this is neither <lb/>
            impossible to happen, nor do we speak of impossibilities, <lb/>
            though we ourselves confess that they are difficult. I too, <lb/>
            said he, am of the same opinion. But you will say, replied <lb/>
            I, that the multitude are not of that opinion ? Very likely, <lb/>
            said he. My excellent friend, said I, do not thus altogether <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πὀῤῥωθεν άσπαζομένων</foreign>, an elegant phrase equivalent to xat­ <lb/>

              condemn the multitude; and do not upbraid them for their <lb/>
              opinion, but rather encourage them,-remove the reproach <lb/>
              thrown on philosophy,-and point out to them the persons <lb/>
              you call philosophers, defining distinctly, as at present, <lb/>
              both their genius and pursuits, that they may not think <lb/>
              that you speak of such as they themselves call philosophers. <lb/>
              -Indeed, if they talk of the same men, will you not say <lb/>
              that they have conceived a different opinion of the men from <lb/>
              what you have, and give very different replies from yours; <lb/>
              and think you that one man can be angered at another, who <lb/>
              is not angry himself; or that a man will envy the envious, <lb/>
              who is himself free from envy, and of a gentle temper? <lb/>
              I will anticipate you by saying, that I think some few, <lb/>
              though not the great mass of mankind, have naturally so bad <lb/>
              a temper as you have described. I am quite of that opinion <lb/>
              also, said he. Are you then of my opinion in this also,­ <lb/>
              namely, that, as regards the ill-feeling of the populace towards <lb/>
              philosophy, those people from without, Ei. e. the sophists,] are <lb/>
              the real cause of it, by making an indecent and turbulent <lb/>
              irruption thereinto, insulting and showing a downright hatred <lb/>
              of philosophers, ever directing their discourses at particular <lb/>
              men, and so doing what least of all becomes philosophy? <lb/>
              Certainly, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—In fact, Adimantus, the man who really <lb/>
            applies his intellect to reflect on true being, probably has no <lb/>
            leisure to look down on the little affairs of mankind, and by <lb/>
            fighting with them, become filled with envy and ill-nature; but <lb/>
            on the other hand, beholding and contemplating objects that <lb/>
            are orderly, always self-consistent and stable,* such as neither <lb/>
            injure nor are injured by each other, but are in all respects <lb/>
            beautiful and consonant with reason, these he imitates and <lb/>
            resembles as far as possible :-what, think you it at all pos­ <lb/>
            sible, that a man will not imitate what he admires as soon as <lb/>
            he is conversant therewith? Impossible, he replied. The <lb/>
            philosopher then, who is occupied with what is divine and <lb/>
            orderly, becomes himself divine and orderly, as far as lies <note type="footnote"> * The reader will take in connexion with this what had been stated at <lb/>
            the close of the first chapter of this book,-that the philosopher's studies <lb/>
            were concerned with real and eternal being, and not allowed to wander to the <lb/>
            changeable and destructible-<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὑ πλανωμἑνην ὑπὀ γενἑσεως καἰϕθορα̃ς</foreign>. </note> <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. C. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            in man's power :-yet in all there is great room for blame.. <lb/>
            Most assuredly. If then, said I, he should be any how <lb/>
            compelled to try to introduce among men what he beholds <lb/>
            there [in his world of contemplation,] with a view of <lb/>
            forming their manners, both in private and public, and not <lb/>
            merely to form himself alone,-would he prove, think you, <lb/>
            a bad artist, in the matter of temperance and justice and <lb/>
            every civil virtue? Not at all, said he. But, supposing <lb/>
            that the multitude should perceive that we are speaking <lb/>
            the truth about him, [i. e. the philosopher,] will they be <lb/>
            angry at philosophers and discredit our assertion, that the <lb/>
            state can never otherwise be happy, except as portrayed <lb/>
            by painters who employ a divine pattern ?* They will <lb/>
            not be angry, said he, if they do perceive it: but what <lb/>
            method of painting do you mean? When they have got <lb/>
            for their groundwork, said I, the state and manners of <lb/>
            mankind, they would first make them pure, which is not <lb/>
            altogether an easy matter; for you know, that in this they <lb/>
            differ from others,-in being unwilling to meddle either with <lb/>
            a private man or state, or to prescribe laws, till they have <lb/>
            either received them as pure, or themselves have made them <lb/>
            so. Rightly too, said he. And after this, think you not they <lb/>
            will draw a sketch of their form of government? Of course. <lb/>
            Afterwards, I think, as they proceed in their work, they <lb/>
            will frequently look in two directions,—not only to what is <lb/>
            naturally just and beautiful, and temperate and the like, <lb/>
            but also, again, to that which they can establish among <lb/>
            mankind, blending and compounding their human form out <lb/>
            of different human characters and pursuits, drawing from <lb/>
            what Homer calls the divine likeness, and the divine re­ <lb/>
            semblance subsisting among men ? Right, said he. They <lb/>
            will, of course, I think, erase one thing, and put in another, <lb/>
            till they have, as far as possible, made human morals pleasing <lb/>
            to the gods ? At that rate, said he, the picture will be most <lb/>
            beautiful. In this case, said I, do we at all succeed in <lb/>
            persuading these men, who, you said, were coming upon us <note type="footnote"> * Philosophers ideally contemplating the image of a perfect state are here <lb/>

            mitting to him our states :-and will they now be more <lb/>
            mild, when they hear our mention thereof? Certainly, said <lb/>
            he, if they be wise :-for what is there now, that they can <lb/>
            further question ?-will they assert that philosophers are not <lb/>
            lovers of real being and truth? That, said he, were absurd. <lb/>
            Or that their disposition, as just described, is not allied to <lb/>
            what is best? Nor this either. What then ;-will not a <lb/>
            disposition such as we have described, by finding suitable <lb/>
            employments, become perfectly good and philosophic, if any <lb/>
            other be so ;—will men say that those more attain to it, whom <lb/>
            we have selected ? Not at all. Will they still then be in­ <lb/>
            dignant at us for saying, that until the philosophic race have <lb/>
            the government of the state, the miseries neither of state <lb/>
            nor citizens can have an end, nor can this government, <lb/>
            which we ideally describe, be ever perfectly realized ? Per­ <lb/>
            haps somewhat less indignant, rejoined he. Is it your wish, <lb/>
            then, said I, that we say--not that they are somewhat less <lb/>
            [indignant,] but that they have become altogether mild, <lb/>
            and are persuaded, that they will at least consent, if no more, <lb/>
            through very shame? By all means, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—Let them then, said I, be persuaded of <lb/>
            this :-and is there any one who will dispute this,-that men <lb/>
            of a philosophic disposition do not usually spring from kings <lb/>
            and sovereigns ? No one, said he, would assert that. And <lb/>
            though they be born of such a character, one may say they <lb/>
            are necessarily prone to be corrupted; for indeed, it is a hard <lb/>
            matter for them to be preserved untainted, even we ourselves <lb/>
            agree;—but will any one contend throughout all time, that <lb/>
            not one of the whole human race, would be preserved <lb/>
            pure and untainted? How can there be? But surely, said <lb/>
            I, any individual born with adequate abilities, and who has <lb/>
            his state in obedience to him, can accomplish everything now <lb/>
            so much disbelieved? Yes, for he is adequate to his task, <lb/>
            said he. And when the governor, said I, establishes the laws <lb/>
            and customs here detailed, it is not at all impossible for <lb/>
            him to make the citizens willingly obey him ? In no way <lb/>
            whatever. But is it wonderful or impossible, that what is our <lb/>
            opinion should be the opinion of others also ? I, at least, do <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. o. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            not think so, said he. And that these things are best, if they <lb/>
            be possible, we have, I think, sufficiently explained in the <lb/>
            former part of our discourse. Yes, quite sufficiently. Now <lb/>
            then, it seems, we are agreed about our legislation; that the <lb/>
            laws we mention are the best, if they could be realized,-and <lb/>
            that if it be hard to establish them, yet it is not Impossible ? <lb/>
            Yes,—we are agreed, said he.</p>
          <p>CIIAP. XV.—Since this then has been with difficulty brought <lb/>
            to a conclusion, shall we not next consider what remains ;-in <lb/>
            what manner, and in consequence of what sciences and pur­ <lb/>
            suits, they will become installed as the preservers of the go­ <lb/>
            vernment, and at what periods of life they will all apply to <lb/>
            their several pursuits ? Aye, we must talk of this, observed <lb/>
            he. My cunning has done me no service, said I, In having <lb/>
            left untouched, in the former part of our discourse, the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty attending the possession of women, and the procreation <lb/>
            of children, and the establishment of governors, knowing how <lb/>
            invidious the business is, and full of difficulty, even though it <lb/>
            be perfectly true and correct :-for we are now under no less <lb/>
            a compulsion of entering into these details.—What relates to <lb/>
            women and children has already been brought to a close; and <lb/>
            as to what concerns the governors, we must now from the <lb/>
            beginning reconsider that subject.—We have alleged, if you <lb/>
            remember, that they should appear to be lovers of the state,­ <lb/>
            proved to be so both by pleasures and pains, and not seen to <lb/>
            abandon this principle, either through toils or fears or any <lb/>
            other change; and that he who cannot do this should be re­ <lb/>
            jected ; while as for him who conies forth altogether pure, as <lb/>
            gold tried in the fire, we should appoint him ruler, and endow <lb/>
            him with honours and rewards both during life and after death. <lb/>
            Such was what we said, when our argument was wandering and <lb/>
            assuming a veil, through fear of disturbing the present state <lb/>
            of things. You speak quite truly, said he ;-for I remember <lb/>
            it. Yes,—for I was loath, to say, my friend, what I must now <lb/>
            venture to assert :-but now this assertion must at any rate <lb/>
            be ventured,-that the most perfect guardians must be esta­ <lb/>
            blished philosophers. Yes,—that has been stated, replied he. <lb/>
            But consider, I pray, that you will probably have only a few <lb/>
            of these; for such a disposition, as we declared that they <lb/>
            must necessarily have, is but rarely used to centre in one <lb/>
            single individual; though its different parts are commonly <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 16. </note> <lb/>
            found in many different persons. How say you ? he replied. <lb/>
            That such as learn with facility, have a good memory, are <lb/>
            sagacious and acute, and endued with all qualifications thereto <lb/>
            allied, are yet not at the same time of so vigorous and lofty an <lb/>
            intellect, as to live orderly, with calmness and constancy, but <lb/>
            are carried hapchance by mere buoyancy of spirits, and are <lb/>
            deserted by everything like stability. Your remark is true, <lb/>
            replied he. Well then, these firm habits of the mind, which <lb/>
            are not easily changeable, and which one might specially em­ <lb/>
            ploy as trusty, and which in time of war are hard to be <lb/>
            excited to terror ;-and similarly also as regards learning, <lb/>
            -they move heavily, and learn with difficulty, as if <lb/>
            benumbed, and oppressed with sleep and yawning, when <lb/>
            compelled to labour at any work of this description? It <lb/>
            is so, replied he. But we said, that he ought to have a good <lb/>
            and fair share of both these, or else should have no share what­ <lb/>
            ever either in the most perfect kind of education, or in magis­ <lb/>
            terial dignities or state-honours ? Right, said he. Do not <lb/>
            you think then, that this will but rarely happen ? Of course it <lb/>
            will. They must be tried then both in what we before alluded <lb/>
            to,—labours, fears, and pleasures ;-and likewise in what we <lb/>
            then passed over, and are now mentioning ;—we must exer­ <lb/>
            cise them in various kinds of learning, with due regard for <lb/>
            the power of their talents to go through the highest branches <lb/>
            of study, or else their failure, as that of persons failing in <lb/>
            all other things. It is fit now, said he, that we consider this <lb/>
            question in this manner:—but what kind of studies are they, <lb/>
            which you call the highest?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—You remember, perhaps, said I, that when <lb/>
            we divided the soul into three parts, we defined the nature <lb/>
            respectively of justice, temperance, fortitude, and wisdom ? <lb/>
            If I did not remember, said he, I should have no right to hear <lb/>
            what remains. [Do you remember likewise] what was said <lb/>
            before that? What was it? We somewhere said, that it <lb/>
            was possible to behold these in their most beautiful forms, but <lb/>
            that the journey would be tedious, which a person must make, <lb/>
            who would see them clearly; yet that it was possible, <lb/>
            to approach them through our proofs before mentioned, <lb/>
            and you said also, that these were sufficient; so, what was <lb/>
            then asserted fell in my opinion far short of the truth ; though <lb/>
            if agreeable to you, you may say so. I at least thought, re- <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. C. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            plied lie, that they had been discussed in fair measure ; and <lb/>
            the rest seemed to think so too. But my friend, said I, in <lb/>
            speaking of things of this kind, such a measure as omits any <lb/>
            part whatever of the truth is not wholly in measure;—for <lb/>
            nothing imperfect is the measure of anything ;-though <lb/>
            people sometimes think that things are sufficiently well when <lb/>
            thus circumstanced, and there is no need for further in­ <lb/>
            quiry. Very many, said he, thus behave through indolence. <lb/>
            But the guardian of the state and the laws, said I, should <lb/>
            least of all be thus affected. So it seems, replied he. <lb/>
            Such an one, then, my friend, said I, must make a more <lb/>
            comprehensive circuit, and labour as much in learning as in <lb/>
            exercising himself: otherwise, as we were just saying, he will <lb/>
            never arrive at the summit of the greatest and most suitable <lb/>
            learning. But are not these branches the highest :-or is <lb/>
            there, said he, any one yet higher than justice, and those <lb/>
            virtues which we have discussed ? There is something greater, <lb/>
            said I; and even of these we must not, as just now, only con­ <lb/>
            template the mere rude sketch; but we must not omit even its <lb/>
            complete elaboration : is it not ridiculous in other things of <lb/>
            small moment to employ our whole labour, and strive to attain <lb/>
            the utmost accuracy and perfection, and yet not deem the highest <lb/>
            and most important affairs worthy of our highest attention, <lb/>
            with a view to making them as perfect as possible ? The sen­ <lb/>
            timent, said he, is very just:-but with respect to the question, <lb/>
            -what is this most important branch of study, and about <lb/>
            what you say it is employed,—think you that any one will let <lb/>
            you go without asking its nature? Not at all, said I:—but <lb/>
            do you ask; although you have assuredly often heard it, but <lb/>
            at present you do not bear it in mind, or else intend to em­ <lb/>
            barrass me by raising objections :-and I think this the <lb/>
            more, as you have often heard at least, that the idea of the <lb/>
            good is the highest branch of study;-about which, when <lb/>
            justice and the other virtues employ themselves, they then <lb/>
            become useful and advantageous.—Now then, you know <lb/>
            pretty well that I mean to say this, and besides, that we do <lb/>
            not sufficiently know that idea; and without this know­ <lb/>
            ledge, though we were to understand everything else as fully <lb/>
            as possible, yet you know that it could be of no service what­ <lb/>
            ever to as : in the same manner as no possession whatever <lb/>
            would be of aught avail, without the possession of the good:­ <note type="footnote">o </note> <pb n="194"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI. C. 17. </note> <lb/>
            and think you that it is more profitable to possess all things <lb/>
            without the possession of the good than to know all things <lb/>
            without the knowledge of the good, having no perception at <lb/>
            all of the beautiful and good ? Not I, by Zeus, he exclaimed.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—Of this, moreover, you may be quite <lb/>
            certain, that to the multitude pleasure seems to be the good, <lb/>
            while the more refined think it to be virtue. How other­ <lb/>
            wise ? And you know also, my friend, that those who hold <lb/>
            this opinion, are unable to show what knowledge is, but <lb/>
            are compelled at last to call it the knowledge of the <lb/>
            good. Aye, and most absurdly too, said he. How indeed <lb/>
            can it be otherwise, replied I, if when upbraiding us for <lb/>
            not knowing the good, they yet speak as to persons know­ <lb/>
            ing it,* and say that knowledge is good itself, as if <lb/>
            we understood their meaning when pronouncing the word <lb/>
            " the good ?" Most true, said he. But what ? those who <lb/>
            define pleasure to be good, are they less in error than the <lb/>
            others ; or are not these too compelled to confess that <lb/>
            pleasures are evil ? Quite so. It happens then, I think, that <lb/>
            they acknowledge the same things to be both good and evil,­ <lb/>
            do they not ? Undoubtedly. Is it not clear, then, that on <lb/>
            this point there are great and manifold varieties of opinion ? <lb/>
            Of course there are. But what ;-is it not clear also, that <lb/>
            with reference to things just and beautiful, the multitude <lb/>
            choose what is apparent, even though it has no real existence, <lb/>
            yet acting and possessing and appearing to possess it;­ <lb/>
            though the acquisition of only apparent goods, never yet <lb/>
            satisfied any one:-for people on the other hand seek what <lb/>
            is real, and all men despise what is only apparent ? Just <lb/>
            so, said he. This then is what every soul pursues, and <lb/>
            for the sake of which it does everything, conjecturing it <lb/>
            to be something, though still in doubt, and unable either <lb/>
            fully to comprehend its nature, or employ belief alone re­ <lb/>
            specting it as of other things; and hence is it, that they <lb/>
            fail of success even in other matters however useful.- <lb/>
            Are we to say then, that about a matter of this nature, <note type="footnote"> * The meaning is ;-that as such persons are forced to allow that <lb/>
            knowledge of itself is not the highest good, but should be referred to the <lb/>
            highest good, as the arbiter thereof,-those persons run into an absurd <lb/>
            error, who denying that we have any knowledge of " the good," yet so <lb/>
            act as if we had a sufficient knowledge thereof,—fixing their notion on <lb/>
            some abstract theory of good. </note> <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. c. 18.] </note> <lb/>
            and of such vast consequence, even the best men in the state, <lb/>
            to whom we commit the management of all things, will be <lb/>
            thus in the dark? By no means, said he. I am of <lb/>
            opinion then, said I, that the just and the beautiful, so long <lb/>
            as they are unknown in what particular way they are good, <lb/>
            cannot be of any great importance to have a guardian who <lb/>
            is ignorant of this; and I suspect that no one will before <lb/>
            this attain a sufficient knowledge thereof. Yes,—you guess <lb/>
            rightly, observed he. Will not our government, therefore, <lb/>
            have been completely set in order, if a guardian be set over <lb/>
            it that is scientifically acquainted with these things ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—It must of necessity, said he:—but yet <lb/>
            with respect to yourself, Socrates, say you that the good <lb/>
            is science, or pleasure, or something independent of these ? <lb/>
            Oh, you fine fellow, said I, you long ago clearly showed <lb/>
            that you were not to be satisfied with other men's opinions <lb/>
            about these matters. Nor does it seem to me just, Socrates, <lb/>
            said he, that a man should keep talking of other men's <lb/>
            opinions, and not his own, after having spent so much time <lb/>
            in inquiring about these particulars. But what, said I;— <lb/>
            do you think it just then, that a man should talk about <lb/>
            matters of which he is ignorant, just as if he knew them ? <lb/>
            By no means as if he knew them, said he; yet, according <lb/>
            to his thoughts, whatever he thinks he should willingly <lb/>
            tell us. But what, said I;—have you not observed re­ <lb/>
            specting unscientific opinions, how contemptible they all are, <lb/>
            and the best of them blind ;-and think you, that these <lb/>
            persons, who without intellect form true opinions, are at all <lb/>
            different from blind men walking on the right road ? Not at all, <lb/>
            said he. Do you wish, then, that we should contemplate <lb/>
            things base, blind, and crooked, when it is in our power to <lb/>
            hear from others what is clear and beautiful ? By Zeus, <lb/>
            Socrates, said Glaucon, do not stop here, as if you had come <lb/>
            to a close; for we shall be satisfied, if, in the same way <lb/>
            as you have spoken of justice, temperance, and the other <lb/>
            virtues, you will in like manner discourse of the good. And <lb/>
            I too shall be very well satisfied, my friend, said I; but [I am <lb/>
            afraid] that I shall not be able, and so, by my readiness may <lb/>
            incur the ridicule of unmannerly persons.-But, my excel­ <lb/>
            lent friends, let us at present dismiss* this inquiry about the <note type="footnote"> * Socrates says this in consequence of the inability of his auditors to </note> <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. IS. </note> <lb/>
            nature of the good, (for it seems to me more, as far as I now <lb/>
            think, than we can attain, in our present attempt) : but I <lb/>
            am willing to tell you, if you please, what I conceive to <lb/>
            be the offspring of the good, and its nearest representation; <lb/>
            and if not, I shall dismiss it. Well then, tell us, said he; for <lb/>
            you shall afterwards acquit yourself of your debt by telling <lb/>
            us of its parent. I could wish, said I, both that I were able <lb/>
            to oblige you by explaining that, and not as now the off­ <lb/>
            spring only and interest of my debt.* This child and off­ <lb/>
            spring of the good itself, pray receive ;-but still take due <lb/>
            care that I deceive you nowise unwillingly by paying my <lb/>
            account of this offspring in base coin. We will take care <lb/>
            of that, said he, as far as we can :-only do you tell us. <lb/>
            I will then, said I, when we are once thoroughly agreed, <lb/>
            and I have reminded you of what was before mentioned, <lb/>
            and has been often said on other occasions. What is that ? <lb/>
            said he. That there are many things beautiful, said I, <lb/>
            and many good also ; and each of these we declare to be so, <lb/>
            and so define them in our argument. Yes, so we say. But as <lb/>
            to the beautiful itself and the good itself, and similarly as to <lb/>
            all those things which we then considered as of various na­ <lb/>
            tures, we are now again establishing them according to the <lb/>
            unity of the general idea, to which we conceive each re­ <lb/>
            lated; and these indeed, we say, are observed by the eye, but <lb/>
            are not objects of intellectual perception ; whereas the ideas are <lb/>
            perceived by the intellect, not seen by the eye. Assuredly. <lb/>
            By what part then of ourselves do we see things visible ? <lb/>
            By the sight, said he. And is it not, said I, by hearing, that <lb/>
            we perceive what is heard ; and by the other senses, all the <lb/>
            other objects of sense ? Of course. But have you not per­ <lb/>
            ceived, said I, as regards the artificer of the senses, with what <lb/>
            perfect skill he has formed the power of seeing, and being <lb/>
            seen ? Not quite, he replied. But consider it thus :-is there <note type="footnote"> understand the nature of the good: for the Greek Scholiast well observes <lb/>

              a third kind of faculty required by the hearing and voice, in <lb/>
              order that the one may hear and the other be heard, in the <lb/>
              absence of which the one will not hear, and the other not be <lb/>
              heard ? There is not, said he. I conceive, said I, that <lb/>
              many others also (not to say, none at all) require no such <lb/>
              thing :-can you name any one that does? Not I, he re­ <lb/>
              plied. But with reference to the sense of seeing and the object <lb/>
              of sight, do you not perceive that they require something ? <lb/>
              How ? When there is sight in the eyes, and when He who <lb/>
              has it attempts to use it, and when there is colour in the ob­ <lb/>
              jects before him, unless there concur some third kind of medium <lb/>
              naturally formed for the purpose,—the sight, you are aware, <lb/>
              will see nothing, and colours will be invisible. What is this <lb/>
              of which you are now speaking ? inquired he. What you call <lb/>
              light, said I. Your remark is true, replied he. This sense <lb/>
              of seeing then, and power of being seen, are no unimportant <lb/>
              ideas, and are connected by a bond more precious than all <lb/>
              other bonds, if light be not valueless. But it is far, said <lb/>
              he, from being valueless.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—Whom then of the gods in heaven can you <lb/>
            assign as the cause of this,-that light makes our sight to see, <lb/>
            and visible objects to be seen, in the best manner ? The same, <lb/>
            he replied, as you and others do; for it is evident that you <lb/>
            mean the sun. Does not sight then derive its nature through <lb/>
            its relation to this god ? How ?-The sight is not the sun, <lb/>
            nor is that the sun, in which sight is engendered,--:-which we <lb/>
            call the eye. It is not. But yet, methinks, this at least of <lb/>
            all the organs of sense is most sun-like ? Very much so. <lb/>
            And the power which it possesses, does it not possess, as dis­ <lb/>
            pensed and emanating hence ? Certainly. Is not the sun <lb/>
            then, though not sight itself, but the principle thereof, seen <lb/>
            by sight itself? It is so, said he. This then, said I, be <lb/>
            assured, is what I called the offspring of the good, which <lb/>
            the good generates, analogous to itself; and what this is in <lb/>
            the sphere of intelligence, with reference to intellect, and the <lb/>
            objects of intellect, that the sun is in the visible [world] with <lb/>
            reference to sight and visible things. How is that ? said he: <lb/>
            pray further explain it. You are aware, that the eyes, said <lb/>
            I, when directed towards objects, whose colours are no longer <lb/>
            visited by the light of day,* but by the glimmerings of the <note type="footnote"> * The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">φῶς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέγγος</foreign> are here opposed,-the first referring to </note> <pb n="198"/>

            night, grow dim and appear almost blind, as if they had in <lb/>
            them no pure vision. Just so, said he. But when they turn <lb/>
            to objects which the sun illuminates, then, methinks, they see <lb/>
            clearly, and in those very eyes there now appears vision. <lb/>
            There does. Understand the same, then, to be the case with <lb/>
            reference to the soul.- When it firmly adheres to what is <lb/>
            enlightened by truth and real being, then it understands and <lb/>
            knows it, and appears to possess intellect; but when it ad­ <lb/>
            heres to what is blended with darkness, and is subject to <lb/>
            generation and destruction, it then has to do with opinion, <lb/>
            and is dull, wandering from one opinion to another, like <lb/>
            one without intellect. So it seems. That therefore <lb/>
            which imparts truth to what is known, and dispenses the <lb/>
            faculty of knowledge to him who knows, you may call <lb/>
            the idea of the good and the principle of science and <lb/>
            truth, as being known through intellect. And as both <lb/>
            these,-knowledge and truth, are so beautiful, you will be <lb/>
            right in thinking that the good is something different, and <lb/>
            still more beautiful than these. Science and truth here <lb/>
            are as light and sight there, which we rightly judged to <lb/>
            be sun-like, but yet did not think them to be the sun: <lb/>
            -so here it is right to hold, that both of them partake <lb/>
            of the form of the good,—but yet not right to suppose that <lb/>
            either of them is the good, inasmuch as the good itself is <lb/>
            worthy of still greater honour. You speak, said he, of some <lb/>
            inestimable idea of "the beautiful,", which exhibits science <lb/>
            and truth, and yet is itself their superior in beauty;-for <lb/>
            you have nowhere said, that it was pleasure. Hope better <lb/>
            things, said I; but thus rather consider its image still further. <lb/>
            How ? You will say, I think, that the sun imparts to things <lb/>
            which are seen, not only their visibility, but likewise their <lb/>
            generation, growth, and nourishment, though not itself ge­ <lb/>
            neration?* Of course. We may say, therefore, as to things <note type="footnote"> the original and primary light of the sun, the latter to the inferior and <lb/>
            borrowed light of the moon and stars. </note><note type="footnote"> * The generation of things illuminated by the sun, shows that it is <lb/>
            perfectly unbegotten; for, according to the Platonic philosophy, the sun <lb/>

            ceiving any accession nor diminution; whereas all that it illuminates receives <lb/>
            light, through the motion of the sun about its proper centre, which also at <lb/>
            different times sends different rays to the heavenly bodies belonging to its <lb/>
            system. So far therefore as the sun illuminates, it is unbegotten; and, on <lb/>

            to the good. </note> <pb n="199"/>

          <p>CHAP. XX.—Here Glaucon, heartily laughing, said, By <lb/>
            Apollo, here is a marvellous transcendency ! You yourself, re­ <lb/>
            plied I, are the cause of it, by compelling me to relate what <lb/>
            I think about it. And by no means stop, said he, unless there <lb/>
            be some cause ; from again discussing the analogy about the <lb/>
            the sun, if you have omitted anything. Aye, I have omitted <lb/>
            many things, replied I. Ah, but, replied he, pray do not <lb/>
            omit the smallest particular. I think, said I, that much will <lb/>
            be omitted : yet, as far as I can at present, I will not willingly <lb/>
            omit anything. Do not, said he. Understand then, said I, that <lb/>
            we allege these to be two ; ruling-the one over the intel­ <lb/>
            ligible genus and place, and the other over the visible world, <lb/>
            -not to say the heavens, lest I should seem to you to employ <lb/>
            a sophistical expression: you understand then these two de­ <lb/>
            scriptions of being,-the visible and Intelligible ? I do. Sup­ <lb/>
            posing now you to take a line cut into two equal sections, <lb/>
            then again cut each part according to the same ratio, both that <lb/>
            of the visible and that of the intelligible species, you will then <lb/>
            have them placed in contrast with each other, either in clear­ <lb/>
            ness or obscurity,-the second section in the visible species <lb/>
            being images. Now images I call, in the first place, shadows, <lb/>
            —in the next, appearances in water, and such as subsist in <lb/>
            opaque, polished and bright bodies, and all such-like repre­ <lb/>
            sentations, if you understand me. Yes, I understand. Con­ <lb/>
            sider now the other section of the visible which this re­ <lb/>
            sembles,—the animals around us, and all kinds of plants, <lb/>
            and everything of an artificial nature. I do consider it, <lb/>
            said he. Do you wish to assert, then, that this section <lb/>
            is divided by truth and its opposite ;-and just as the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of opinion are opposed to the objects of true know­ <lb/>
            ledge, so also that which is compared [is opposed] to that <lb/>
            with which it is compared ? Aye, indeed: I am quite <lb/>
            willing. Consider once more about this section of the in­ <lb/>
            telligible, how it is to be effected. How ? That with re­ <lb/>
            spect to one part thereof, the soul uses the former sections as <lb/>
            images, and is compelled to investigate by means of hypo- <pb n="200"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI. c. 21. </note> <lb/>
            thesis, not going back to first principles, but advancing on­ <lb/>
            ward to conclusions; and the other part, again, is that where <lb/>
            the soul proceeds from hypothesis to an unhypothetical prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, and makes its way even without those images by means <lb/>
            of the ideas themselves. What you now say, rejoined he, I do <lb/>
            not fully understand. Once more, said I,—for you will more <lb/>
            easily understand me, from what has been previously stated, <lb/>
            —you are not unaware, methinks, that persons versed in <lb/>
            geometry, and computations, and such-like, after laying <lb/>
            down hypotheses of the odd and even, and figures, and three <lb/>
            kinds of angles, and other similar matters, according to each <lb/>
            method, proceed on them as known, after establishing them as <lb/>
            mere hypotheses, and give no further reason about them, <lb/>
            either to themselves or others, as being things obvious to all; <lb/>
            -but, beginning with these, then directly discuss the rest, <lb/>
            and end by meeting at the point where the inquiry set <lb/>
            out ? I know this, said he, perfectly well. And [do you <lb/>
            not likewise know] that they use the visible species, and <lb/>
            reason about them, not employing their intellect about these <lb/>
            species, but about those of which they are the resemblances, <lb/>
            arguing about the square itself, and the diameter itself, and <lb/>
            not about what they describe ; — and, so also, with reference <lb/>
            to other particulars, those very things which they form and <lb/>
            describe, among which are shadows and images in water, <lb/>
            these they use as images, trying to behold those very things, <lb/>
            which a man can only perceive by his intellect? You say <lb/>
            true, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—This then was what I meant by the idea <lb/>
            of the Intelligible ; but [I said also,j that the soul was obliged <lb/>
            to use hypotheses in its investigation, not going back to the <lb/>
            principle, as though unable to ascend higher than hypo­ <lb/>
            theses, and employed comparisons formed from things below, <lb/>
            to lead to those above, as to clearly-seen objects of thought, <lb/>
            distinct from the things themselves. I understand, said <lb/>
            he, that you are speaking of what concerns geometry and its <lb/>
            sister arts. By that other section of the intelligible, then, <lb/>
            you must understand me to mean what reason itself attains <lb/>
            by its dialectic faculty, forming hypotheses, not as principles, <lb/>
            but really hypotheses, just like steps and starting-points, in <lb/>
            order that by proceeding up to the unhypothetical,—[that is,] <lb/>
            the principle of the universe, coming in contact therewith, <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. c. 21.] </note> <lb/>
            and so again coming into union with what is united to it in <lb/>
            principle, it may thus reach the end without making use of <lb/>
            anything sensible, but only of ideas themselves, proceeding <lb/>
            through some to others, and so ending in ideas. I under­ <lb/>
            stand, said he, but not fully :-( for I think you are talking <lb/>
            of some difficult work :) but I understand it is your wish <lb/>
            to prove that knowledge obtained by dialectic science re­ <lb/>
            specting real and intelligible being is clearer than that ac­ <lb/>
            quired by means of what are called arts, which take <lb/>
            hypotheses for their first principles, and which those who <lb/>
            contemplate must view with the understanding and not the <lb/>
            perceptive faculties; whereas, through their inability to <lb/>
            go back to first principles, and as they reason only from <lb/>
            hypotheses, you think they do not exercise intellect [<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦν</foreign>] <lb/>
            in these matters, much as they might become intelligible <lb/>
            with some principle for a foundation -and as for under­ <lb/>
            standing [or reasoning,]—that which we acquire through <lb/>
            geometry and its kindred arts, and not pure reason, this is <lb/>
            something lying between opinion and pure intellect. You <lb/>
            have fully understood me, said I:—and understand me now, <lb/>
            that analogous to these four branches of knowledge are four <lb/>
            affections [or faculties] of the soul,-pure reasoning answer­ <lb/>
            ing to the highest,-understanding [or reasoning] to the <lb/>
            second, faith to the third,- conjecture to the last :*—and so <lb/>
            arrange them, as to assign to them respectively more or less <lb/>
            of clearness, as they are more or less allied to truth. I un­ <lb/>
            derstand, replied he, and quite agree; and so let us adopt <lb/>
            your proposed arrangement. <note type="footnote"> * Plato conceived that there was an ideal and a visible world,-the <lb/>
            world of reason and the world of sense, and two essences in each ;-in <lb/>
            the former, pure or abstract ideas and mixed ideas,-in the visible world <lb/>
            (which comprises exclusively the objects of sense), material substances ; <lb/>
            and secondly, the images, shadows, or representations of bodies. Analo­ <lb/>
            gous to these also are four faculties of the human mind, two only of <lb/>
            which have any relation to the ideal world or form any part of true <lb/>
            science;—1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόησις</foreign>, the knowledge of pure ideas (reflection, the pure <lb/>
            reason of Kant) ;—2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign> (understanding), the knowledge of mixed <lb/>
            ideas ;—3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>, faith, the knowledge of bodies and their properties ;— <lb/>
            4. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκασία</foreign>, conjecture, the knowledge of the images or shadows of bodies. <lb/>
            The two last belong to unstable, varying opinion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα</foreign>). This explana­ <lb/>

          <p>In the seventh book, which opens with a beautiful description of the <lb/>
            nature of man confined in a dark cave, Plato proceeds to show the <lb/>
            means and plan for learning true philosophy, and how we may attain <lb/>
            to the serious and sober practice of social life and politics. That moral <lb/>
            discipline, argues he, which I require in my guardian, is not mere vacant <lb/>
            contemplation, but a profound and practical knowledge of all matters <lb/>
            nearly or more remotely concerning the duties of life and the social rela­ <lb/>
            tions of mankind,that is, the state in its most broad and general sense: <lb/>
            in fact, that he should be a philosophic ruler acquainted with divine and <lb/>
            human things,—in other words, with true and primary philosophy. <lb/>
            This he terms dialectic, the subordinates of which are physics, the <lb/>
            science which considers the origin and formation of matter, and mathe­ <lb/>
            matics, which is halfway between the two others, engaged indeed in <lb/>
            contemplating abstract and purely argumentative, but not on that <lb/>
            higher eternal truth; emphatically, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄ</foreign>v, that primarily exists in the <lb/>
            mind of God : of these matters he treats, particularly the first, at very <lb/>
            considerable length : which, as Hitter says, is a regulating superin­ <lb/>
            tendent, which, from the knowledge of the eternally true, may indicate <lb/>
            to each special science its proper object.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.After this then, said I, compare our nature <lb/>
            as respects education, or the want thereof, to a condition such <lb/>
            as follows :-Behold men, as it were, in an underground <lb/>
            cave-like dwelling, having its entrance open towards the light <lb/>
            and extending through the whole cave,-and within it persons, <lb/>
            who from childhood upwards have had chains on their legs <lb/>
            and their necks, so as, while abiding there, to have the <lb/>
            power of looking forward only, but not to turn round their <lb/>
            heads by reason of their chains, their light coming from <lb/>
            a fire that burns above and afar off, and behind them; and <lb/>
            between the fire and those in chains is a road above, along <lb/>
            which one may see a little wall built along, just as the stages <lb/>
            of conjurers are built before the people in whose presence they <lb/>
            show their tricks. I see, said he. Behold then by the side of <lb/>
            this little wall men carrying all sorts of machines rising <lb/>
            above the wall, and statues of men and other animals wrought <lb/>
            in stone, wood, and other materials, some of the bearers <pb n="203"/>

            probably speaking, ethers proceeding in silence.* You are <lb/>
            proposing, said he, a most absurd comparison and absurd <lb/>
            captives also. Such as resemble ourselves, said I;—for <lb/>
            think you that such as these would have seen anything <lb/>
            else of themselves or one another except the shadows that <lb/>
            fall from the fire on the opposite side of the cave ? How <lb/>
            can they, said he, if indeed they be through life compelled <lb/>
            to keep their heads unmoved ? But what respecting the <lb/>
            things carried by them :-is not this the same ? Of course. <lb/>
            If then they had been able to talk with each other, do you <lb/>
            not suppose they would think it right to give names to <lb/>
            what they saw before them ? Of course they would. But <lb/>
            if the prison had an echo on its opposite side, when any <lb/>
            person present were to speak, think you they would imagine <lb/>
            anything else addressed to them, except the shadow before <lb/>
            them ? No, by Zeus, not I, said he. At all events then, <lb/>
            said I, such persons would deem truth to be nothing <lb/>
            else but the shadows of exhibitions. Of course they would. <lb/>
            Let us inquire then, said I, as to their liberation from cap­ <lb/>
            tivity, and their cure from insanity, such as it may be, and <lb/>
            whether such will naturally fall to their lot;—were a person <lb/>
            let loose and obliged immediately to rise up, and turn round <lb/>
            his neck and walk, and look upwards to the light, and doing <lb/>
            all this still feel pained, and be disabled by the dazzling from <lb/>
            seeing those things of which he formerly saw the shadows; <lb/>
            -what would he say, think you, if any one were to tell him <lb/>
            that he formerly saw mere empty visions, but now saw more <lb/>
            correctly, as being nearer to the real thing, and turned towards 4 <lb/>
            what was more real, and then, specially pointing out to him <lb/>
            every individual passing thing, should question him, and oblige <lb/>
            him, to answer respecting its nature :-think you not he <lb/>
            would be embarrassed, and consider that what he before saw <lb/>
            was truer than what was just exhibited ? Quite so, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—Therefore, even if a person should compel him <lb/>
            to look to the light itself, would he not have pain in his <lb/>
            eyes and shun it, and then, turning to what he really could <lb/>
            behold, reckon these as really more clear than what had <lb/>
            been previously pointed out? Just so, replied he. But if, <note type="footnote"> * Allusion is here made to puppets which are made to perform on a <lb/>

            Lexicon to the Timæus, on the word Sahara, which he explains by the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            said I, a person should forcibly drag him thence through a <lb/>
            rugged and steep ascent without stopping, till he dragged him <lb/>
            to the light of the sun, would he not while thus drawn be in <lb/>
            pain and indignation, and when he came to the light, having <lb/>
            his eyes dazzled with the splendour, be unable to behold even <lb/>
            any one thing of what he had just alleged as true ? No, he <lb/>
            could not, at the moment at least, said he. He would require, <lb/>
            at least then, to get some degree of practice, if he would <lb/>
            see things above him :-and first, indeed, he would most <lb/>
            easily perceive the shadows, and then the images of men <lb/>
            and other animals in the water, and after that the things <lb/>
            themselves ;-and after this he would more easily behold the <lb/>
            things in heaven, and heaven itself, by night, looking to the <lb/>
            light of the stars and the moon, than after daylight to the <lb/>
            sun and the light of the sun. How else ? Last of all, then, <lb/>
            methinks, he might be able to perceive and contemplate the <lb/>
            nature of the sun, not as respects its images in water or any <lb/>
            other place, but itself by itself in its own proper station ? Neces­ <lb/>
            sarily so, said he. And after this, he might reason with him­ <lb/>
            self concerning the sun, that it is the body which gives us the <lb/>
            seasons and years and administers everything in its stated <lb/>
            place, being the cause also in a certain manner of all natural <lb/>
            events. It is evident, said he, after what has been formerly <lb/>
            stated, that one must arrive at this conclusion. What then,­ <lb/>
            when a man remembers his first habitation and the wisdom <lb/>
            therein residing, and his fellow captives also,-think you not, <lb/>
            that he would congratulate himself on the change and pity the <lb/>
            rest ? Quite so. And whatever honours and praises and re­ <lb/>
            wards were assigned by mutual consent to him that had the <lb/>
            most acute perception of the present, and the best recollec­ <lb/>
            tion both of long past and recent events, and from such obser­ <lb/>
            vations was best able to conjecture the future,-think you <lb/>
            that he would desire such honours, or envy those honoured by <lb/>
            these, or possessing influence, or would not he rather experi­ <lb/>
            ence what Homer says, and ardently desire <lb/>
            As labourer, for some ignoble man <lb/>
            To work for hire,*­ <lb/>
            and rather endure anything than entertain such opinions <lb/>
            and live in such a manner ? I think, said be, that he <lb/>
            would choose to suffer anything rather than live in that <note type="footnote"> * Comp. Horn. Odyss. x. 428. </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            way. And consider this, said I, whether, in the case <lb/>
            of such an one going down and again sitting in the same <lb/>
            place, his eyes would not be blinded in consequence of <lb/>
            coining so suddenly from the sun? Quite so, replied <lb/>
            he. As for those shadows again, if he were compelled to <lb/>
            split straws and dispute about them with those persons who <lb/>
            had been in constant captivity, while yet he was in dark­ <lb/>
            ness before the establishment of his sight,—(and this time <lb/>
            of getting habituated would not be short,)-would he not <lb/>
            excite ridicule; and would it not be said of him, that <lb/>
            after having once ascended he had come back with his eye­ <lb/>
            sight destroyed, and should not even try to ascend again ; <lb/>
            and as for any one that attempted to liberate him and lead <lb/>
            him up, they ought to put him to death, if they could get <lb/>
            him into their hands ? Especially so, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—As respects this image then, we must apply <lb/>
            the whole of it to our preceding discourse; comparing the <lb/>
            region that is seen by the eyes to the prison-habitation, <lb/>
            and the light of the fire therein to the power of the sun; <lb/>
            —and if you were to consider the ascent above, and the <lb/>
            contemplation of things above as the soul's ascent into the <lb/>
            region of intellect, you would not disappoint my expectations, <lb/>
            since this it is which you desire to hear;—but God knows <lb/>
            whether it be true. As respects appearances then, it thus <lb/>
            seems, that in the subjects of human knowledge the idea of <lb/>
            the good is the last object of vision, and hard to be seen ; <lb/>
            and when beheld it must be inferred from reason to be the <lb/>
            cause of what is right and beautiful in all things, generating <lb/>
            in what is visible, both light and its parent also, [viz. the <lb/>
            sun,] while in that which is intelligible, it is itself the sove­ <lb/>
            reign producing truth and intelligence; and it must be seen <lb/>
            too by him that would act with judgment, either privately or <lb/>
            in public. I too, said he, am quite of your opinion, as far in­ <lb/>
            deed as I can be. Come then, said I, agree on this point also;­ <lb/>
            and be not surprised that those who come here are unwill­ <lb/>
            ing to act in human affairs, but have their souls ever urged to <lb/>
            dwell on things above; for it is surely reasonable it should <lb/>
            be so, since these things take place according to the above- <lb/>
            mentioned image. Aye, quite reasonable, replied he. But <lb/>
            what, said I;—think you it at all surprising, that a man <lb/>
            coming from divine contemplations to mere human woes, <lb/>
            should appear awkward and extremely ridiculous, while he is <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 4. </note> <lb/>
            yet dazzled,*—and when, ere being used to the present darkness, <lb/>
            he is obliged to contend in courts of law or elsewhere about <lb/>
            the shadows of justice, or the statues of which they are the <lb/>
            shadows, and then to dispute how these matters are appre­ <lb/>
            hended by those who have never contemplated justice it­ <lb/>
            self? No wonder this, replied he. Nay, said I, if a man has <lb/>
            intelligence, he will be conscious, that there are two dis­ <lb/>
            turbances of vision arising from two causes,—viz., when we <lb/>
            turn from light into darkness and from darkness into light;­ <lb/>
            and when a man thinks that the same takes place with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the soul likewise, when it beholds him disturbed and <lb/>
            unable to realize its perceptions, he will not laugh immode­ <lb/>
            rately, but rather consider whether the soul has come out of a <lb/>
            more brilliant existence and is now darkened by ignorance, or <lb/>
            else emerging out of gross ignorance into a more luminous ex­ <lb/>
            istence, be overpowered by dazzling splendour;—and thus he <lb/>
            will congratulate the former on its life and destiny, while he <lb/>
            pities the life and destiny of the other; and even if he wished <lb/>
            to laugh at it, his laughter will be less ridiculous than if it <lb/>
            were directed to the soul which comes from light into darkness. <lb/>
            Your remark is perfectly reasonable, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—It is fit then, said I, if these things be true, <lb/>
            that we form such an opinion as this respecting them,-that <lb/>
            education is not of that character which some persons an­ <lb/>
            nounce it to be, when they somehow assert that, there is no <lb/>
            science in the soul, but that they can implant it just as if <lb/>
            they implanted sight in the eyes of the blind. Aye, they say <lb/>
            so, he replied.† Our present argument however, said I, shows <lb/>
            this power to reside in the soul of every person, and to be the <lb/>
            organ by which every one learns.-Just as the eye cannot <lb/>
            turn otherwise than with the whole body from darkness to <lb/>
            the light, so also one must turn with the whole soul from <note type="footnote">* This refers to the reproach made to philosophers on the unpractical <lb/>

              sensible objects until it has become able to endure the <lb/>
              contemplation of what is real, and what is most apparent <lb/>
              of the real, and this we term the good: do we not? Yes. <lb/>
              It will be the art then of this very person, said I, in <lb/>
              turning about, to contrive this; namely, how he may <lb/>
              turn with the greatest ease and advantage, not for the <lb/>
              sake of implanting sight in him, but viewing him as already <lb/>
              possessing it, though not rightly turned, and not looking in <lb/>
              the right direction ? It seems so, said he. The other vir­ <lb/>
              tues of the soul, as they are called, seem to me somewhat like <lb/>
              those of the body; for in fact those not before contained <lb/>
              therein are afterwards engendered by custom and practice: <lb/>
              -but the faculty of intellect possesses, it seems, a nature <lb/>
              somewhat more god-like than all the rest;—never losing <lb/>
              its power, but by exertion becoming useful and profit­ <lb/>
              able,-by the opposite, useless and hurtful. Have you <lb/>
              never yet observed of those that are termed wicked yet clever, <lb/>
              -how sharply the little soul looks, acutely distinguishing all <lb/>
              to which it is turned, having indeed no contemptible power of <lb/>
              vision, but compelled to be so far the servant of wickedness, <lb/>
              that in proportion as its vision is more acute, the more <lb/>
              crime it perpetrates ? Quite so, of course, observed he. As <lb/>
              regards this part of such a disposition, if from childhood <lb/>
              upwards it should be stripped and cut off from what <lb/>
              belongs to human production, as from leaden weights, <lb/>
              -which have a relation to feastings, and pleasures, and <lb/>
              lusts, that turn the sight of the soul to things downward ;— <lb/>
              if the soul can free itself and turn towards truth, the very <lb/>
              same principle in the same individuals would as acutely <lb/>
              see those things as the objects to which it is now turned. <lb/>
              Certainly, he replied. What then, is not this probable, said I, <lb/>
              and a necessary consequence of what has just been stated, <lb/>
              that those who are untaught and inexperienced in truth can <lb/>
              never exercise a sufficient superintendence over the state, <lb/>
              nor yet those who are allowed to spend the whole of their <lb/>
              time in philosophical pursuits,-the former, because they <lb/>
              have no single object in life, towards which they should <lb/>
              direct all their actions both private and public,-and the <lb/>
              latter, because, as far as their will is concerned, they <lb/>
              will not engage in public life, from the idea that even while <lb/>
              yet living they have been transported to the islands of the <pb n="208"/>
               <note type="margin">[B. VII. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
              blessed ? True, said he. It is our business then, said I, to <lb/>
              compel those of the inhabitants, who possess the greatest <lb/>
              talent, to devote themselves to that learning which we formerly <lb/>
              considered most important, both to contemplate the good and <lb/>
              go in search of it ;-and when they have gained it, and taken <lb/>
              a sufficient view thereof, yet they are not to be allowed what <lb/>
              is now allowed them. What is that ? To abide there, said I, <lb/>
              and show an unwillingness to descend again to those captives <lb/>
              of whom we were speaking, or share with them both their <lb/>
              labours and honours, whether trifling or more important. In <lb/>
              that case, said he, are we to do them injustice, and make <lb/>
              them live a worse life, when they could have lived a better ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—You have forgotten again, said I, that this is <lb/>
            not the lawgiver's concern, how any one class in a state <lb/>
            may be especially happy, but to contrive rather that hap­ <lb/>
            piness shall be generated throughout the state, uniting the <lb/>
            citizens both by persuasion and compulsion, making them share <lb/>
            each other's services, such as they can confer on the community <lb/>
            at large; and when he introduces such men as these into the <lb/>
            state, he does so, not that he may dismiss them and let <lb/>
            them turn whichever way each likes, but that he may em­ <lb/>
            ploy them as a bond of the state. True indeed, said he, for <lb/>
            I had forgotten that. Anxiously consider then, Glaucon, <lb/>
            that we must do no injustice to the philosophers born among <lb/>
            us, but tell them what is just, when we compel them to take <lb/>
            charge of and guard the remainder :-for we will assert, that <lb/>
            those who in all other states become such [philosophers,] do <lb/>
            not probably take a share in the labours going on therein, as <lb/>
            they spring up of their own accord without the consent of the <lb/>
            government in each ; and it is just that what is voluntary, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it owes its nurture to none, should willingly pay <lb/>
            no one the price of its nurture ;-but as for you, we brought <lb/>
            into being both yourselves and the rest of the state, as <lb/>
            leaders and kings in beehives, brought up better and more <lb/>
            perfectly than the others, and better able to take a share in <lb/>
            both [public life and philosophical pursuits]. Each must then <lb/>
            in turn descend to the dwelling of the rest, and accustom <lb/>
            himself to behold obscure objects; for, when once used to <lb/>
            them, you will perceive the individual images of each, what <lb/>
            they are and whence sprung, ten thousand times better from <lb/>
            having already seen the truth concerning what is beautiful, <pb n="209"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            and just, and good :-and thus the state will be settled as a <lb/>
            real vision, both by us and yourselves, and not as a dream, <lb/>
            like most of those inhabited by persons fighting about sha­ <lb/>
            dows, and quarrelling about government, as if it were some <lb/>
            great good.-The truth, however, is as follows : in whatever <lb/>
            state those about to rule are least anxious to take the <lb/>
            government, this must necessarily be the best and most <lb/>
            peacefully governed, while one that has governors of an <lb/>
            opposite character, must of course be the opposite. Certainly, <lb/>
            said he. Think you then, that those under our charge, when <lb/>
            they hear these things, will disobey us, and be unwilling to take <lb/>
            their individual share in the labours of the state, and spend the <lb/>
            greater part of their time with one another in a state of leisure ? <lb/>
            Impossible, said he ;-for we will prescribe what is just to just <lb/>
            men, and each of them will enter on his office from this con­ <lb/>
            sideration above all others, that he should act in a manner <lb/>
            directly contrary from those who now govern individual states. <lb/>
            Yes, for so it is, my friend;—if you find the life of those <lb/>
            appointed to official stations superior to the dignity of their <lb/>
            office, then your state may possibly be well settled; as in that <lb/>
            alone will the really wealthy govern,-not those rich in <lb/>
            gold, but as happy men should be rich, in a life of virtue <lb/>
            and good sense ;-whereas, should they be poor, and desti­ <lb/>
            tute of property of their own, and then come into public life, <lb/>
            thinking that they ought to plunder the public of its pro­ <lb/>
            perty, it is not possible [that such a state can be rightly <lb/>
            settled] :-for as the contest is about the possession of the <lb/>
            ruling power, such a war being domestic and intestine, is de­ <lb/>
            structive to themselves as well as the rest of the state. Most <lb/>
            true, he replied. Do you conceive then that any other <lb/>
            kind of life despises political offices except that of true <lb/>
            philosophy ? No, by Zeus, said he. But still it is fitting, at <lb/>
            least, that those should enter upon it who are not fond of <lb/>
            governing, otherwise the rivals will fight about it. Of <lb/>
            course, it cannot be otherwise. Whom else, then, would you <lb/>
            compel to enter on the guardianship of a state, except <lb/>
            such as are most intelligent in what concerns the best <lb/>
            establishment of a state, and possess other honours, and a mode <lb/>
            of life superior to that of a mere politician ? None other, <lb/>
            he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Do you wish, then, that we should now consider <note type="footnote"> p </note> <pb n="210"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 6. </note> <lb/>
            this,—in what manner such persons will be produced and <lb/>
            how any one can draw them upward into light, just as some <lb/>
            are said to have ascended from Hades to the gods ? Of <lb/>
            course that is my wish, lie replied. This then, as it seems, is <lb/>
            not a mere turning of a die,* but a movement of the soul, <lb/>
            which ascends from some half-night kind of day to the true <lb/>
            light of existence, which we will term true philosophy. Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. Ought we not, then, to inquire what branch of learn­ <lb/>
            ing possesses this influence ? Of course. What then, Glaucon, <lb/>
            may that training of the soul be, which draws it from what <lb/>
            is generated and unstable towards that which has a positive <lb/>
            existence ? And talking of this, I am reminded :-did we <lb/>
            not say that it is necessary for these persons even while young <lb/>
            to engage in warlike exercises? We did say so. We should <lb/>
            add this, then, to the training which we are now seeking. <lb/>
            What is that ? That of not being useless to military men. <lb/>
            Aye, we must indeed, said he, if it be possible. Moreover, <lb/>
            in our former discourse, we somewhere said we would have <lb/>
            them taught gymnastics and music. We did so, said he. <lb/>
            The art of gymnastics has to do, I think, with what is unsta­ <lb/>
            ble and perishable; for it presides over corporeal growth <lb/>
            and decrease. It appears so. This then cannot be the <lb/>
            branch of study, of which we are in pursuit. It cannot. <lb/>
            Is it music then, such as we have previously described? <lb/>
            That, said he, if you remember, corresponded to gym­ <lb/>
            nastics, as it trains the habits of the guardians, giving them <lb/>
            a sort of concord founded on harmony — not science,­ <lb/>
            and good rhythm on the principles of rhythm, and other <lb/>
            things in discourses which are akin to these both in such <lb/>
            as are fabulous and such as more resemble truth; but as <lb/>
            to its being a branch of science that refers to a good such <lb/>
            as you are now investigating, music had no such character. <lb/>
            Most correctly, said I, do you remind me; for it is in <lb/>
            reality no such thing: but, excellent Glaucon, what branch <lb/>
            of science is it, that possesses this character ?-for all <lb/>
            the arts somehow seem to be mechanical and illiberal. Of <lb/>
            course;—and moreover what other branch of science is <lb/>
            there, that is distinct from music, gymnastics, and the <note type="footnote"> * This alludes to a game of chance,—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀστϱακίνδα</foreign>, fully described in <lb/>

            arts ? Come, said I, if we cannot conceive any except <lb/>
            these, let us take one of those which extends over all. <lb/>
            Of what kind is that ? Such as this common idea which <lb/>
            all arts, and intellects, and sciences employ, and which <lb/>
            every person must learn at the outset. What is that? said he. <lb/>
            This trifling matter, said I;—how to distinguish one, and two, <lb/>
            and three, which I call in general terms arithmetic and com­ <lb/>
            putation :—is it not thus as regards these, that every art and <lb/>
            science must necessarily have a share in these ? Surely, he <lb/>
            replied. Must not then the art of war? said I. Necessarily, <lb/>
            he replied. What a ridiculous general then, said I, does <lb/>
            Palamedes in his tragedies constantly represent Agamemnon <lb/>
            to be.*—And have you not observed how he says, that after <lb/>
            inventing numeration he adjusted the ranks at Ilium, and <lb/>
            numbered the ships and the rest of the forces, as if they had <lb/>
            never been numbered before, even when Agamemnon, as it <lb/>
            seems, did not know how many feet he had, since he did not <lb/>
            know how to count ;-what kind of a general would you <lb/>
            think him to be? I should think him a mighty absurd one, <lb/>
            he replied, if this be true.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Shall we not say, then, said I, that the power <lb/>
            of computing and reckoning is a necessary attainment for a <lb/>
            military man ? Most certainly, he replied, if he intends to <lb/>
            understand anything at all about marshalling troops,­ <lb/>
            or rather, if he means to be a man. Do you then under­ <lb/>
            stand, said I, about this branch of learning just what I <lb/>
            do? What is that? It seems in its nature to be among <lb/>
            the number of those things which lead to pure reason-of <lb/>
            which indeed we are in search; but no one seems rightly <lb/>
            to employ it, as evidently leading the mind to the considera­ <lb/>
            tion of true being. How say you ? inquired he. I will at <lb/>
            least, try, said I, to explain what is my opinion.—As to <lb/>
            what I distinguish in my own mind as leading or not leading <lb/>
            whither we are saying, [viz., to true being,] do you assist <lb/>
            me in contemplating them, and either agree or dissent, so that <lb/>
            we may more distinctly see whether they be such as I conjec­ <lb/>
            ture. Pray show me, said he. I will show you then, said I, if <lb/>
            you will observe that some things relating to the perceptions do <note type="footnote"> * This passage refers, no doubt, to some one or more lost tragedies in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 7. </note> <lb/>
            not invite intellect to the inquiry, as being sufficiently deter­ <lb/>
            mined by perception; while there are other things which <lb/>
            by all means bid its interference, as perception alone does no­ <lb/>
            thing correct. You are evidently speaking, said he, of objects <lb/>
            seen at a distance, and things sketched in a picture. You <lb/>
            have not quite comprehended my meaning, said I. What are <lb/>
            you speaking of then ? asked he. There are some things, re­ <lb/>
            plied I, which do not appeal [to the intellect], and yet do <lb/>
            not issue at once into a contrary perception; while those that <lb/>
            do so issue I consider as so appealing, when the percep­ <lb/>
            tive faculty takes cognizance of one thing more than ano­ <lb/>
            ther, on meeting it either near or afar off.—And you will <lb/>
            thus more clearly know what I mean : these we say are <lb/>
            three fingers, the little finger, the next to it, and the middle <lb/>
            finger. Just so, observed he. Consider me then to speak of them <lb/>
            as seen only from a short distance, and consider this also, <lb/>
            respecting them. What ? Each of them appears equally to <lb/>
            be a finger, and so far it makes no difference whether one looks <lb/>
            at the middle one or the last, whether it be white or black, <lb/>
            thick or slender, or anything of the kind; for in all these the <lb/>
            soul of man is not compelled to ask the intellect what of many <lb/>
            things a finger is,* for sight itself never at the same time in­ <lb/>
            dicates a finger to be a finger, and its contrary. Of course not, <lb/>
            replied he. It is probable, then, said I, that such a case as this <lb/>
            would neither appeal to nor rouse the intellect. Probably. But <lb/>
            what then ;-does the sight sufficiently distinguish their large <lb/>
            or small size, and does it make no difference to it whether one <lb/>
            of them be placed in the middle or at the end ?-And so in <lb/>
            like manner does the sense of touch take cognizance of <lb/>
            thickness and slenderness, softness and hardness ?-And as <lb/>
            for the other perceptions, are they not defective in show­ <lb/>
            ing such things, or rather does not each of them so act; <lb/>
            and first of all, is not the sense which is affected by hardness <lb/>
            necessarily also affected by softness, and does it not, when it <lb/>
            perceives this, announce to the soul, that hard and soft are one <lb/>
            and the same thing? Just so. he replied. It must necessa­ <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 8.] </note> <lb/>
              rily follow then, said I, that in such matters, the soul will be <lb/>
              in doubt as to what the perception indicates as hard, since it <lb/>
              calls the same thing soft also ;—and so also as regards the <lb/>
              sense referring to light and heavy, the soul must be in doubt <lb/>
              what is light and what is heavy, if the sense intimates heavy <lb/>
              to be light, and light heavy? These at least, said he, are <lb/>
              truly absurd reports made to the soul, and require investi­ <lb/>
              gation. Probably then, said I, in such cases as these the <lb/>
              soul would first call in reason and intelligence to investi­ <lb/>
              gate the question whether the things reported be one or <lb/>
              whether they be two. Of course. If then they appeared to <lb/>
              be two, each of them will appear to be one and distinct from <lb/>
              the other? Yes. If then each of them be one and both of <lb/>
              them two, he will understand them to be two distinct; for, were <lb/>
              they not distinct, he would not perceive two, but only one. <lb/>
              Right. The sight, moreover, we say, could contemplate <lb/>
              what is great and small, though not as distinct from each <lb/>
              other, but as somewhat confused :-could it not? Yes. But for <lb/>
              the sake of clearness in this matter, the intellect is once more <lb/>
              obliged to consider great and small, not as confused, but as <lb/>
              distinct in an opposite way from the other,—viz., the sense of <lb/>
              sight. True. And is it not hence somehow, that it first sets <lb/>
              on questioning us, as to what is the great and what is the <lb/>
              small ? Assuredly. And thus then we call the one intel­ <lb/>
              ligible, and the other visible. Very right, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—This then is what I just now attempted to <lb/>
            express, that some things appeal to the intellect and others <lb/>
            not; defining those that make such an appeal, as what affect <lb/>
            the senses at the same time as their opposites, while such <lb/>
            as do not, do not excite the intellect. I quite understand <lb/>
            now, said he ; and I am of the same opinion. What then ;­ <lb/>
            to which of them, think you, do number and unity belong ? <lb/>
            I do not understand, replied he. But let us reason by <lb/>
            analogy, said I, from what we have already said :-for if <lb/>
            unity can be sufficiently seen of itself, or comprehended by <lb/>
            any other sense, it still would not lead to true being, just as <lb/>
            we remarked about the finger :-but if there be always <lb/>
            seen at the same time an exact opposite thereto, so that it <lb/>
            shall no more appear unity than it does the contrary, some <lb/>
            one would then be wanted to judge respecting it; and in <lb/>
            that very matter the soul would necessarily be in difficulty, <pb n="214"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VlI. C. 8. </note> <lb/>
            exciting reflection within itself, and would inquire into the <lb/>
            nature of this same unity, and thus that branch of science <lb/>
            which concerns unity would be among those which lead and <lb/>
            turn the soul to the contemplation of real being. Ah, said <lb/>
            he;—this is what the very sight of it does in no small <lb/>
            degree; for we at once behold the same thing, both as <lb/>
            one and as an infinite multitude. If then, said I, unity <lb/>
            be thus affected, will not number generally be so likewise ? <lb/>
            Of course. Yet, again, all computation and arithmetic <lb/>
            concern number ? Quite so. But these at least seem <lb/>
            to lead towards truth ? Especially so, of course. They <lb/>
            belong then, it seems, to the branches of learning which we are <lb/>
            now investigating;—for a military man must necessarily learn <lb/>
            them with a view to the marshalling of his troops, and so must <lb/>
            a 'philosopher with the view of understanding real being, after <lb/>
            having emerged from the unstable condition of becoming, or else <lb/>
            he can never become an apt reasoner. That is the fact, he re­ <lb/>
            plied. But that guardian of ours happens to be both a military <lb/>
            man and a philosopher? Unquestionably so. It would be proper <lb/>
            then, Glaucon, to lay down laws for this branch of science <lb/>
            and persuade those about to engage in the most impor­ <lb/>
            tant state-matters to apply themselves to computation, and <lb/>
            study it, not in the common vulgar fashion, but with the view of <lb/>
            arriving at the contemplation of the nature of numbers by <lb/>
            the intellect itself,—not for the sake of buying and selling as <lb/>
            anxious merchants and retailers, but for war also, and that the <lb/>
            soul may acquire a facility of turning itself from what is in <lb/>
            course of generation to truth and real being. A capital re­ <lb/>
            mark, he replied. And, moreover, I now observe, said I, <lb/>
            respecting that branch of science which concerns computation, <lb/>
            how refined it is, and in many ways useful to us as respects <lb/>
            our wishes, if we will apply thereto for the sake of getting <lb/>
            knowledge, and not with a view of traffic. In what way? <lb/>
            inquired he. Just what we now said,-that it power­ <lb/>
            fully leads the soul upwards, and compels it to reason on <lb/>
            abstract numbers, without in any way allowing a person in <lb/>
            his reasoning to advance numbers which are visible and <lb/>
            tangible bodies ;*—for perhaps you know of some persons <note type="footnote"> * Abstract, ideal numbers, Plato terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοὶ οἱ ἀϱιθμοί</foreign>; and these <lb/>
            only are the subject of scientific calculation. The concrete numbers <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱιθμοὶ σώματα ἔχοντες</foreign>) are the subjects only of every-day practical </note> <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. c. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            skilled in these matters, who, if one were in argument to <lb/>
            attempt dividing unity itself, would at once both ridicule him <lb/>
            and not allow it; though, were you to divide it into parts, <lb/>
            they would multiply them, lest unity should somehow seem <lb/>
            not to be unity, but numerous parts. A very true remark, <lb/>
            be replied. What think you then, Glaucon, if a person <lb/>
            should ask them—You wonderfully clever men, about what <lb/>
            kind of numbers are you reasoning ;-in which unity, such as <lb/>
            you deem it, is equal, each whole to the whole, without any <lb/>
            difference whatever, and having no parts in itself ?-what <lb/>
            think you they would reply? This, as far as I think;­ <lb/>
            that they speak of such numbers only-as can be compre­ <lb/>
            hended by the intellect alone, but in no other way. You see <lb/>
            then, my friend, I observed, that our real need of this branch <lb/>
            of science, is probably because it seems to compel the soul to <lb/>
            use pure intelligence in the search after pure truth. Aye, <lb/>
            remarked he, it does this to a remarkable extent. Have you yet <lb/>
            considered this,-that persons naturally skilled in compu­ <lb/>
            tation seem clever in all branches of science,-whereas <lb/>
            those naturally slow, if instructed and exercised in this, will <lb/>
            yet all of them, if they derive no other advantage, make <lb/>
            such progress, as to become cleverer than they were before ? <lb/>
            Exactly so, he replied. And, moreover, I think you will <lb/>
            not easily find that many things give the learner and student <lb/>
            more trouble than this. Of course not. On all these accounts, <lb/>
            then, we must not omit this branch of science, but those with <lb/>
            the best of talents should be instructed therein ? I agree <lb/>
            with you, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—Let this one thing then, said I, [that has <lb/>
            just been discussed,] be settled between us ; and now let us <lb/>
            consider, in the second place, with respect to what follows <lb/>
            from it,-whether and how far it concerns ourselves. <lb/>
            What is it, said he ;-is it geometry you mean ? That very <lb/>
            thing, said I. So far, observed he, as it bears a relation to <lb/>
            the concerns of war, it evidently does concern us;—for in <lb/>
            pitching encampments, occupying positions, contracting and <lb/>
            extending a line of troops, and as respects all the varied <lb/>
            forms in which they draw up armies, either in battle itself or <lb/>
            during a march, it would make a vast difference, whether a <note type="footnote">numeration and computation. The monad is the idea of unity, abstract, <lb/>

            general were a geometrician or not. Of course, rejoined <lb/>
            I, for such purposes as these a very slender knowledge of <lb/>
            geometry, and a small portion of arithmetic would suffice ;— <lb/>
            but as for any considerable amount thereof, and great <lb/>
            progress in it, we must inquire how far they tend to this,­ <lb/>
            namely, to make us apprehend more easily the idea of <lb/>
            the good :-and we say that all things contribute thereto, <lb/>
            which compel the soul to turn itself to that region in <lb/>
            which is the happiest portion of true being, which it must <lb/>
            by all means perceive. Your remark is correct, said he. If <lb/>
            then it compels the soul to contemplate true being, it is suit­ <lb/>
            able,-but if only what is sensible and evanescent, it is not <lb/>
            suitable. Aye, truly, we say so. This point then, at least, <lb/>
            said I, those who have but little acquaintance with geometry, <lb/>
            will not argue with us,—that this science has an entirely oppo­ <lb/>
            site nature to the words employed in it by those who practise <lb/>
            it. How ? said he. They speak somehow most absurdly, <lb/>
            and necessarily so, since all the terms they use seem to be <lb/>
            with a view to operation and practice,*—such as squaring, <lb/>
            producing, adding, and such-like sounds; whereas on the <lb/>
            other hand, the whole science should be studied for the <lb/>
            sake of real knowledge. Assuredly, said he. Is this, <lb/>
            then, further to be agreed on? What? That [it be <lb/>
            studied] with a view to the knowledge of eternal being, <lb/>
            and not of that which is subject to generation and destruction ? <lb/>
            We may well grant that, said he; for it is the business of <lb/>
            geometry to concern itself with eternal being. It would have <lb/>
            a tendency, therefore, gentle sir, to draw the soul to truth, <lb/>
            and to cause a philosophic intelligence to direct upwards <lb/>
            [the thoughts] which we now improperly cast downwards. <lb/>
            As much as possible, he replied. As far as possible, then, <lb/>
            said I, we must give special orders, that the inhabitants of that. <lb/>
            fine statet of yours should by no means omit the study of <lb/>
            geometry, since even its by-works are not inconsiderable. <lb/>
            What are they ? inquired he. Those which you have just <lb/>
            mentioned that concern war;—and indeed with reference to <figure type="illustration">

              all branches of science, for the better understanding thereof, <lb/>
              we are some how sure that it makes an entire difference <lb/>
              every way, whether a man be acquainted with geometry or <lb/>
              not. Every way, indeed, by Zeus, observed he. Let us <lb/>
              fix on this then, as the second branch of learning for youth. <lb/>
              Let us so fix it, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—But what; shall we fix upon astronomy, as the <lb/>
            third, or think you otherwise ? I quite think we should, said he; <lb/>
            for to have unusually acute perceptions respecting the times <lb/>
            of months and years, is suitable not only for agriculture and <lb/>
            navigation, but not less so for the art of war. You are jest­ <lb/>
            ing, said I; when you seem to be afraid that the multitude <lb/>
            will charge you with enjoining useless objects of study : <lb/>
            -yet it is not altogether a trifle, but rather difficult to per­ <lb/>
            suade that by these branches of study some organ of the soul <lb/>
            in each individual, is purified and rekindled like fire, after <lb/>
            having been destroyed and blinded by other kinds of study,­ <lb/>
            an organ, indeed, better worth saving than ten thousand eyes, <lb/>
            since by that alone can truth be seen. Among such, then, as join <lb/>
            me in this opinion, you will have the reputation of reasoning <lb/>
            admirably well; though such as never had any perception of <lb/>
            this will think perhaps that you say nothing to the purpose, as <lb/>
            they see no advantage therefrom accruing that is worthy of <lb/>
            notice. Consider, then, from this point, against which of the <lb/>
            parties you are arguing,-or whether against neither, but <lb/>
            chiefly for your own sake you are carrying on the discussion ; <lb/>
            moreover, do not envy any other, if therefrom any one could <lb/>
            derive any possible advantage. Thus, said he, do I choose, on <lb/>
            my own account chiefly, to argue and ask questions, and <lb/>
            make replies. Let us go a little back then, in our argument, <lb/>
            for just now, indeed, we did not rightly take what is next <lb/>
            in order after geometry. How then did we act ? asked he. <lb/>
            After a plain surface, said I, we took a solid in a state of <lb/>
            revolution, without first considering it by itself, in the abstract; <lb/>
            but the correct plan is to take the third in order, after the <lb/>
            second dimension :-and this, probably, refers to the dimen­ <lb/>
            sion of cubes, and what has to do with depth. Aye, it is <lb/>
            so, said he : but these matters, Socrates, do not seem yet <lb/>
            to have been investigated. Aye, there are two causes for <lb/>
            this: because no state holds them in honour, they are only <lb/>
            slightly investigated, as being difficult; and those that do so <pb n="218"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 10. </note> <lb/>
            investigate them require a guide, without whom they can­ <lb/>
            not discover them,-one whom, first of all, it would be <lb/>
            hard to get, and, when he is got, as things are at present, the <lb/>
            investigators of these matters having lofty notions of them­ <lb/>
            selves, would not obey him; whereas, if the whole state <lb/>
            were to hold such pursuits in honour, and superintend them, <lb/>
            these persons would be obedient, and the investigations being <lb/>
            conducted with assiduity and vigour, would exhibit their true <lb/>
            character; whereas now, despised and mutilated by the <lb/>
            multitude, as well as by those who study them without being <lb/>
            able to account for their usefulness, they still, in spite of all <lb/>
            things, increase through their native grace; and it is no <lb/>
            wonder that they should appear so to do. Aye, indeed, said <lb/>
            he, this gracefulness is especially remarkable; but tell me <lb/>
            more plainly what you were just now saying,-for you somehow <lb/>
            defined geometry to be a study that concerns plane sur­ <lb/>
            faces. I did, said I. Then next in order you mentioned <lb/>
            astronomy; but afterwards you drawback. Yes, replied I, <lb/>
            because when I am in a hurry to get quickly over the discus­ <lb/>
            sion, I get on the more slowly; for as regards the mode of <lb/>
            measuring depth, which is- next in order, that I passed over, <lb/>
            a.; a hopeless investigation, and proceeded, after geometry, to <lb/>
            speak about astronomy, which is the motion of solids. You say <lb/>
            rightly, observed he. Let us fix on astronomy then, said he, as <lb/>
            a fourth branch of science; as if that which we now omit, [viz. <lb/>
            solid geometry,] may have an existence, whenever the state <lb/>
            enters on that pursuit. Probably, said he : and as to what you <lb/>
            just now urged on me, Socrates, about astronomy, as having <lb/>
            needlessly praised it, I now praise it in accordance with your <lb/>
            notions: for I think it is clear to every one, that it is this which <lb/>
            compels the soul to look upwards, and from what is here con­ <lb/>
            ducts it thither. Perhaps, rejoined I, it may be clear to all <lb/>
            except myself ;-to me it does not seem so. Ah ! how is that ? <lb/>
            said he. As those who introduce it into philosophy, nowadays <lb/>
            pursue it, it makes the soul look altogether downwards. <lb/>
            How say you ? inquired he. I am of opinion, replied I, that <lb/>
            you are not ungenerous in forming your mental estimate of <lb/>
            the real nature of that branch of science which concerns <lb/>
            things above; for you seem to be of opinion, that if a person <lb/>
            were to look up and discover some of the heavenly bodies in <lb/>
            an enclosed space, be would contemplate them with his in­ <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin"> is. VII. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
            tellect and not his eyes. Perhaps, then, you judge rightly, and <lb/>
            I am wrong; though I, on the other hand, cannot hold the <lb/>
            opinion that any other branch of science can make the soul <lb/>
            look upwards, except that which concerns real being and <lb/>
            the invisible,-whether one were to gape upwards, or try <lb/>
            by peering downwards to get acquainted with those matters: <lb/>
            -and if any one were to gape upwards and so try to get <lb/>
            acquainted with any perceptible object, I think that he never <lb/>
            would get acquainted with it; as his soul has no scientific <lb/>
            knowledge of such things,-nor would his soul look upwards, <lb/>
            but downwards,-even though he were to try to learn, swim­ <lb/>
            ming on his back at sea or lying so on the ground.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—I am punished, rejoined he;—for you have <lb/>
            rightly reproved me :-but in what manner did you say we <lb/>
            ought to learn astronomy different from that in which they <lb/>
            now teach it, if people are to be taught advantageously for <lb/>
            the purposes of which we now speak ? Thus, said I:—these <lb/>
            various bright bodies in the heaven,-since indeed they are <lb/>
            so variously placed in visible space,-ought to be deemed very <lb/>
            beautiful and most perfect in their kind, though much in­ <lb/>
            ferior to the true magnificence of movement, with which real <lb/>
            velocity and real retardation mutually bear along those bodies <lb/>
            with all that belongs to them, in their true number and in all <lb/>
            their true shapes ;*—which things, indeed, can be appre­ <lb/>
            bended only by reason and intelligence, not by sight:­ <lb/>
            do you think they can ? By no means, said he. Must <lb/>
            we not then, said I, use the various heavenly phenomena, <lb/>
            as an exhibition for the purpose of instructing us in those <lb/>
            [real] concerns,-just as one might meet with sketches, <lb/>
            capitally well drawn and elaborated by Dædalus, or some other <lb/>
            artist or painter ?-For one skilled in geometry, on seeing <lb/>
            such drawings, would, perhaps, think them to be exceedingly <lb/>
            well wrought, and nevertheless deem it absurd to give them a <lb/>
            serious consideration,-as if he were thence to get his concep­ <lb/>
            tion of truth about equals, or doubles, or any other proportion, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig46.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> corrupt,-and, as it now stands, is almost incapable of translation. That <lb/>
              given above closely resembles that given by Victor Cousin, a far better <lb/>
              one than Schleiermacher's. </note> <pb n="220"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. VII. C. 12. </note> <lb/>
              Of course, it would be absurd, he replied. And think you <lb/>
              not then, that the true astronomer will feel just the same, <lb/>
              when he looks up to the orbits of the stars,-reckoning, in­ <lb/>
              deed, that the heavens and all in them are established by the <lb/>
              heavenly architect in the most beautiful manner possible for <lb/>
              the formation of such works; and would not one deem it <lb/>
              absurd of a man to conceive that this proportion of night <lb/>
              with day, and of both these to a month, and of a month to a <lb/>
              year, and of other stars to both of these, and towards each <lb/>
              other has existed always in the same manner, and without <lb/>
              experiencing any change, because they have a body, and are <lb/>
              visible, and so to take all possible means to apprehend the <lb/>
              truth of these things ? So I think, he replied, whilst I listen <lb/>
              to you. Let us then, said I, make use of problems, [or hypo­ <lb/>
              theses,] in astronomy, as in geometry, and dismiss the heavenly <lb/>
              bodies,—if we intend really to get acquainted with astronomy, <lb/>
              and render useful instead of useless that portion of the soul <lb/>
              which is naturally intelligent. You really impose, said he, a <lb/>
              far harder task on astronomers than is enjoined them at present. <lb/>
              I think, however, replied I, that we must enjoin other duties <lb/>
              likewise, according to the same fashion, if we would be of any <lb/>
              service as lawgivers.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—But have you anything to suggest about <lb/>
            the fitting branches of study ? I have not, he replied,-at pre­ <lb/>
            sent at least. Motion, moreover, said I, affords us, I think, <lb/>
            not one indeed, but many species thereof;—all of which any <lb/>
            wise man can probably tell; but those which occur to me are <lb/>
            two. What are they ? In addition to this, said I, there is its <lb/>
            counterpart. Which ? As the eyes, said I, seem formed <lb/>
            for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for bar­ <lb/>
            monious motions; and these seem to be twin sciences to one <lb/>
            another, as also the Pythagoreans* say; and we too, Glaucon, <lb/>
            agree with them :-how shall we do ? Just so, replied he. <lb/>
            Shall we not, then, said I, since it is a matter of high import­ <lb/>
            ance, inquire of them how they speak concerning them, and <lb/>
            whether they have anything else to say besides this; but we, <note type="footnote"> * It is here alleged that there are two species of motion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φορά</foreign>),—one <lb/>
            affecting the eyes, and including the motion of the heavenly bodies, which <lb/>
            are the subject-matter of astronomical science,-the other affecting the <lb/>
            ears, and comprising that harmony of the heavenly motions which the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans conceived to have given the first notion of music. </note> <pb n="221"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            notwithstanding all this, shall defend our own conclusion ? <lb/>
            What is that? That those whom we educate should never attempt <lb/>
            to learn these things imperfectly, nor without always aiming <lb/>
            at the object, to which all ought to be directed,-as we just <lb/>
            stated with reference to astronomy:-and do not you know <lb/>
            that they do some such thing with regard to harmony ?— <lb/>
            for, while they measure one with another the symphonies <lb/>
            and sounds which are heard, they go through a fruitless toil, <lb/>
            like the astronomers. Aye, by the gods, said he,-and <lb/>
            absurdly too, when they make very frequent trials of the <lb/>
            notes, lending their ears to catch the sound as from a neigh­ <lb/>
            bour's voice,-some indeed saying that they hear some middle <lb/>
            note, with the smallest appreciable interval, and others again <lb/>
            doubtingly saying that the notes are just what were sounded <lb/>
            before,-both parties placing the ears above the intellect. But <lb/>
            you are now speaking, said I, of those thrifty, money-making <lb/>
            musicians, who are ever harassing and tormenting their strings, <lb/>
            turning them on the pegs :-but, that the comparison may not <lb/>
            be too tedious, I refrain from speaking of their complaints <lb/>
            about the refusal and stubbornness of the strings, and at once <lb/>
            give up the simile, saying that we do not mean to speak of <lb/>
            these, but of those true musicians whom we before mentioned:­ <lb/>
            for these do here just what the others did in astronomy; for <lb/>
            they search for numbers, in the symphonies which they <lb/>
            hear, but do not go on to the inquiry proposed,-what <lb/>
            numbers are symphonious, what not, and the reason why <lb/>
            they are either the one or the other. You speak, said he, <lb/>
            of a noble undertaking. It is serviceable, of course, said I, in <lb/>
            the search for the beautiful and good,-but, if pursued in an­ <lb/>
            other manner, it is quite useless. Aye, probably so, said he. <lb/>
            Still, methinks, said I, the plan of inquiry into all these mat­ <lb/>
            ters that we have described, if it touches on their mutual com­ <lb/>
            munion and alliance, and proves how they are mutually <lb/>
            related, will contribute something to what we require, and our <lb/>
            labour will not be fruitless; but otherwise it will. I like­ <lb/>
            wise, said he, guess the very same thing :-but you are speak­ <lb/>
            ing, Socrates, of a most laborious undertaking. Mean you the <lb/>
            introduction, or what else ? said I:—what,—know we not, that <lb/>
            all these things are introductory to the strain itself ;* which <note type="footnote"> * Glaucon is here complaining of the difficulty of the task proposed ; </note> <pb n="222"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            we ought to learn ?-for even persons clever in these things <lb/>
            you perhaps do not think skilled in dialectics. No, by Zeus, said <lb/>
            he, only some very few of such as I have met. But supposing <lb/>
            some of them not able, said I, to offer and admit reasoning, <lb/>
            will they ever be able to get acquainted with what we say they <lb/>
            ought to know ? They will never be able to do this, he replied. <lb/>
            Is not this then the very strain, Glaucon, said I, which <lb/>
            dialectic science executes,-which also, being cognizable by the <lb/>
            intellect, may be said to be imitated by the power of sight,­ <lb/>
            which faculty seeks, first, as we observed, to gaze at animals, <lb/>
            then at the stars, and last of all at the sun himself :-so when <lb/>
            a man attempts to discuss a subject without the aid of his per­ <lb/>
            ceptive faculties, he is impelled by reason to what is indi­ <lb/>
            vidual and real being; and if he stops not, till he apprehends by <lb/>
            intelligence what is the good itself, then, indeed, he arrives at <lb/>
            the end of the intelligible, as the other does at the end of the <lb/>
            visible. Assuredly, he replied. What then ;-do not you <lb/>
            call this the dialectic process ? What else ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—And now, said I, [to revert to our former <lb/>
            simile of the man in the cave,] there is his liberation from <lb/>
            chains, his turning from shadows towards the images and the <lb/>
            light, and his ascent from the underground cavern to the sun, <lb/>
            -and when there, his looking at images in water, owing to a <lb/>
            want of power at first of beholding animals and plants, and <lb/>
            the sun itself ;-so also here [in the intellectual world] you <lb/>
            have the contemplation of divine phantasms, and the shadows <lb/>
            of real beings, and not the shadows of images shadowed out <lb/>
            by another similar light, as by the sun.*—All this exercise <lb/>
            in the arts which we have discussed has this tendency, <lb/>
            -namely, to lead back again the best part of the soul to <lb/>
            the contemplation of what is best in existing beings; as in <lb/>
            the former case, what is brightest in the body is led to what <lb/>
            is most splendid in bodily and visible existence. I admit <lb/>
            these things, said he ; though it really seems to me extremely <lb/>
            difficult to admit them, though in other respects difficult not to <note type="footnote">and Socrates replies, that is a mere introduction or prelude to the main <lb/>

            admit them. However, granting what has been asserted (for <lb/>
            we shall not only now hear these things, but often again <lb/>
            discuss them), let us proceed to and discuss the strain itself, <lb/>
            as we have finished the introduction. Say, then, of what <lb/>
            kind is the power of dialectic,—into what species is it <lb/>
            divided,-and what are the paths leading to it;—for these <lb/>
            probably conduct us to that place, which we shall find a <lb/>
            resting-place, and the end of our journey. You will not as <lb/>
            yet, dear Glaucon, said I, be able to follow :-had you been so, <lb/>
            no zeal would be wanting on my part; nor should you any <lb/>
            longer only see the image of what we are now speaking about, <lb/>
            but the truth itself, or what to me seems so. Whether it be <lb/>
            so really or not, however, it is not proper positively to affirm ; <lb/>
            but that it is somewhat of this kind may be most strongly <lb/>
            affirmed :-may it not ? Of course. And further, that it is <lb/>
            the power of dialectics alone, which can discover this to a <lb/>
            person skilled in what we have discussed, and that it can be <lb/>
            done by no other power. This also, said he, we may posi­ <lb/>
            tively affirm. This statement at least no one, said I, will dis­ <lb/>
            pute with us,—that no other method can attempt to ascertain <lb/>
            through a regular process the nature of each particular being ; <lb/>
            for all other arts respect either the opinions and desires of men, <lb/>
            or generations and compositions, or are employed wholly in <lb/>
            the study of what is generated and compounded :-but as for <lb/>
            those others, which we alleged to have some relation to being, <lb/>
            as geometry, and its dependent sciences, we behold them, as <lb/>
            if dreaming indeed about real existence, it being impossible to <lb/>
            have a true vision, so long as they employ hypotheses and <lb/>
            keep them immovable, without the power of accounting for <lb/>
            their existence :-for where the starting-point is the unknown, <lb/>
            and the conclusion and intermediate steps are connected with <lb/>
            that unknown principle, how can any such kind of assent ever <lb/>
            possibly become science? By no means, replied he. Is it not then <lb/>
            the dialectic method only, said I, that proceeds thus on wards,­ <lb/>
            removing all hypotheses back to the starting-point, that it <lb/>
            may become firmly established, and so gradually draw and lead <lb/>
            upward the eye of the soul, which was truly buried in a cer­ <lb/>
            tain barbaric mire, by the aid and guidance of those arts we <lb/>
            have mentioned, which through custom we frequently call <lb/>
            sciences, but which require another name clearer indeed than <lb/>
            opinion, but more obscure than science? We have somewhere <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 14. </note> <lb/>
            in the former part of our discourse termed it reflection, or <lb/>
            reasoning. But the controversy is not, as it appears to me, <lb/>
            about a mere name, when people are investigating things of <lb/>
            such great importance as those now before us. It is not, said <lb/>
            he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—You are pleased, then, said I, as formerly, to <lb/>
            call the first part science, the second reflection, the third faith, <lb/>
            the fourth conjecture,-both these last being opinion, and the <lb/>
            two former intelligence;—and that opinion is employed also <lb/>
            about generation, and intelligence about true being ;-likewise, <lb/>
            that true being bears to generation the same relation as intel­ <lb/>
            ligence to opinion, science to faith, and reflection to conjec­ <lb/>
            ture ;-but as for the analogy of the things which these powers <lb/>
            respect, and the twofold division of each,—viz., into the <lb/>
            objects of opinion, and those of intellect, these we omit, Glau­ <lb/>
            con, that we may not be more prolix here than in our former <lb/>
            discussions. As for me, said he, as regards those other things, <lb/>
            so far as I can comprehend, I am of the same opinion. But <lb/>
            do not you call that man skilled in dialectics, who apprehends <lb/>
            the reason of the essence of each particular ?-and as for the <lb/>
            man who is unable to give a reason to himself, and to <lb/>
            another, so far as regards this inability, will you not so far <lb/>
            say he wants intelligence of the thing? Of course I shall, <lb/>
            he replied. And is not the case the same with reference to the <lb/>
            good ?—whoever cannot logically define it, abstracting the <lb/>
            idea of the good from all others, and taking as in a fight <lb/>
            one opposing argument after another, and cannot proceed <lb/>
            with unfailing proofs, eager to rest his case, not on the ground <lb/>
            of opinion, but of true being,-such an one knows nothing of <lb/>
            the good itself . nor of any good whatever: and should he <lb/>
            have attained to any knowledge of the good, we must say he <lb/>
            has attained it by opinion, not science; that he is sleeping, <lb/>
            and dreaming away his present life; and before he is roused, <lb/>
            will descend to Hades, and there be profoundly and perfectly <lb/>
            laid asleep. By Zeus, said he, I will certainly affirm all these <lb/>
            things. But surely, methinks, you will not allow those chil­ <lb/>
            dren of yours, whom you are ideally training and educating,­ <lb/>
            if ever in fact you should educate them,—to have the supreme <lb/>
            government of the most important affairs in the state, while <lb/>
            they are void of reason, as letters of the alphabet ? By no <lb/>
            means, he replied. You will lay this down then as a law: <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> B VII. C. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            that they shall most especially get that amount of education <lb/>
            which may enable them to question and answer in the most sci­ <lb/>
            entific manner. I will make that a law, said he, by your assist­ <lb/>
            ance at least. Are you of opinion then, said I, that dialectic <lb/>
            science is to be placed on high as a bulwark to moral training, <lb/>
            and that no other training can with propriety be more elevated <lb/>
            than this, but that this is the completion of scientific training ? <lb/>
            I am, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—There now remains for you, said I, the regu­ <lb/>
            lation of the persons to whom we shall assign these studies, <lb/>
            and after what manner. That is evident, said he. Do you <lb/>
            remember then, in our former election of rulers, what kind we <lb/>
            chose ? Of course I do, said he. As to other things then, <lb/>
            conceive, said I, that those dispositions should be selected, <lb/>
            and that we should prefer the bravest, most resolute, and, <lb/>
            as far as possible, the most handsome; and besides, we <lb/>
            must not only seek for those whose manners are noble and <lb/>
            grave,* but such as have dispositions adapted to this <lb/>
            education. What dispositions do you enjoin ? They must <lb/>
            have, said I, my excellent friend, acuteness as respects <lb/>
            instruction, that they may learn without difficulty; for <lb/>
            souls are much more daunted by severe mental studies, <lb/>
            than by strenuous bodily exercise; for the employment <lb/>
            which is most familiar to them is of a peculiar nature, <lb/>
            having no connexion with the body. True, said he. And <lb/>
            we must seek for one of good memory, hardy, and in every <lb/>
            way fond of toil:—or how think you any one would will­ <lb/>
            ingly endure bodily fatigue, and at the same time accom­ <lb/>
            plish such learning and study? No one, said he, unless he <lb/>
            be in all respects of a naturally good disposition. The <lb/>
            mistake then about philosophy, and the dishonour done to <lb/>
            it, have been occasioned by this, as I formerly said, that it is <lb/>
            not studied in a way suitable to its dignity: for it ought not <lb/>
            to have been attempted by bastards, but the well-born. <lb/>
            How ? said he. In the first place, he who is to apply to <lb/>
            philosophy, said I, must not be lame in his love of labour, <lb/>
            half-laborious, and half-averse to it; and this is the case, when <lb/>
            a man is fond of wrestling and hunting, and all bodily exer­ <lb/>
            cises, bat has no fondness for learning, or hearing instruction or <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> [B. VII. C. ] 6. </note> <lb/>
              making investigations, but in all these respects has an aver­ <lb/>
              sion to labour.-He too is lame, though in an opposite manner <lb/>
              from the man who has wrongly employed his love of labour. <lb/>
              You say most truly, replied he. And shall we not, said I, <lb/>
              in like manner account that soul lame as to truth, which, <lb/>
              though it hates a voluntary falsehood and is troubled by it, and <lb/>
              « is vastly indignant when others tell a lie, yet easily admits <lb/>
              the involuntary lie, and if at any time it be found ignorant, <lb/>
              is not displeased, but like a savage sow willingly wallows <lb/>
              in Ignorance ? Assuredly, said he. And in like manner, <lb/>
              said I, as to temperance and fortitude, and magnanimity, and <lb/>
              all other branches of virtue, we must no less carefully attend <lb/>
              to what is bastardly, and what is well-born ; for when either <lb/>
              private persons or a state understand not how to attend to <lb/>
              all these things, they unwarily employ the lame and the <lb/>
              bastardly for whatever they want,-private persons employ­ <lb/>
              ing them as friends, and states as governors. Such is exactly <lb/>
              the case, said he. But we must be on our guard, said I, <lb/>
              about all such things; so that if we select for such extensive <lb/>
              discipline such as are entire in body and mind, and take care <lb/>
              to instruct them in suitable exercises, justice herself will <lb/>
              not blame us, and we shall preserve both the state and <lb/>
              constitution ; but if we introduce persons of a different de­ <lb/>
              scription into these affairs, we shall do everything the <lb/>
              reverse, and pour still greater contempt on philosophy. That <lb/>
              indeed were shameful, said he. Certainly, said I. But I <lb/>
              myself seem at present to be somewhat ridiculous. How <lb/>
              so ? said he. I forgot, said I, that we were amusing our­ <lb/>
              selves, and I spoke with too great keenness; for, while <lb/>
              speaking, I was referring to philosophy; and seeing her most <lb/>
              unworthily abused, I seem to have been filled with indigna­ <lb/>
              tion, and, through rage, as it were, with those who are the <lb/>
              cause of it, to have said what I did somewhat too earnestly. <lb/>
              No truly, said he, not for me as a listener at least. Aye, but <lb/>
              for me, said I, who said it :-but let us not forget this, that <lb/>
              in our former election we made choice of old men, which in <lb/>
              this will not be allowed ;-for we must not believe Solon, that <lb/>
              a man in years can learn many things, far less even than <lb/>
              running, but that all the most important and numerous kinds <lb/>
              of toil are assigned to the young. Of necessity, said he.</p>

            <note type="margin"> B VII. C. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            geometry and all the previous instruction which they should <lb/>
            receive before they learn dialectics, ought to be set before <lb/>
            them while they are children, and on such a plan of teach­ <lb/>
            ing that they may learn without compulsion.* Why so ? <lb/>
            Because, said I, a free man ought to acquire no learning <lb/>
            under slavery: for the labours of the body when endured <lb/>
            through compulsion do not at all deteriorate the body: but <lb/>
            as for the soul, it can endure no compulsory discipline. True, <lb/>
            said he. Do not then, said I, my best of friends, force boys <lb/>
            to their learning; but train them up by amusements, that you <lb/>
            may be better able to discern the direction of each one's genius. <lb/>
            What you say, replied he, is reasonable. Do not you re­ <lb/>
            member our stating then, said I, that the boys should even be <lb/>
            carried to war, as spectators, on horseback, and be brought <lb/>
            as near as possible with safety, and allowed like young hounds, <lb/>
            to taste the blood? I remember, said he. Whoever then, <lb/>
            said I, shall appear the most forward in all these labours, <lb/>
            studies, and dangers, such as these are to be selected to a certain <lb/>
            number. At what age ? said he. When they have finished <lb/>
            their necessary exercises, said I; for this period of life, even <lb/>
            should it last two or three years, cannot accomplish anything <lb/>
            else; for fatigue and sleep are hostile to learning; and this <lb/>
            too is none of the least of their trials, what each will prove <lb/>
            himself in his exercises. Certainly, said he. And after this <lb/>
            period, said I, such as have formerly been selected of the age <lb/>
            of twenty are to receive greater honours than others; and <lb/>
            those studies, which in their youth they have pursued pro­ <lb/>
            miscuously, must be brought before them in one view, that <lb/>
            they may see the connexion of the whole with each other, and <lb/>
            with the nature of real being. This indeed is the only kind <lb/>
            of instruction that will abide permanently in those in whom <lb/>
            it is engendered. And this, said I, is the best criterion for <lb/>
            distinguishing talents naturally fitted for dialectics, from <lb/>
            those which are not so. He who perceives this alliance <lb/>
            is skilled in dialectics; he who does not, is not so. I am <lb/>
            of the same opinion, said he. You will need then, said I, <lb/>
            after observing these things, and seeing who are most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished herein, and who persevere both in learning and in <note type="footnote"> * So Quinctilian in his Institutes, lib. i. c. 1, 20 :—Nam id in primis <lb/>

            war, and in other things established by law, to make choice <lb/>
            of them after they exceed thirty years, selecting from those <lb/>
            before chosen, and then advance them to greater honours. <lb/>
            Observing them likewise by the test of dialectics, in order <lb/>
            to ascertain which of them can without aid from the eyes, <lb/>
            or any other sense, proceed with truth to being itself. And <lb/>
            here, my companion, is a work of great caution. In what <lb/>
            principally? said he. Do not you perceive, said I, how <lb/>
            great is the evil which at present attends dialectics ? What <lb/>
            is it, said he, you mean ? [Its followers,] observed I, are <lb/>
            somehow or other full of disorder. Very much so, replied <lb/>
            he. Think you then, said I, that their being so is at all <lb/>
            extraordinary ; and will you not forgive them ? How do you <lb/>
            mean ? said he. Just as if, said I, a certain supposititious child <lb/>
            were brought up in great opulence in a rich and noble family, <lb/>
            and amidst many flatterers, and were to perceive, when grown <lb/>
            up to manhood, that he is not descended from those alleged <lb/>
            to be his parents, but yet cannot discover his real parents; <lb/>
            can you guess how such an one would feel both towards <lb/>
            his flatterers and his supposed parents, both at the time <lb/>
            when he knew nothing of the cheat, and again at the time <lb/>
            when he came to perceive it ?-are you willing to hear me <lb/>
            while I give a guess ? I am willing, said he. I guess <lb/>
            then, said I, that he will honour his father and mother, <lb/>
            and other supposed relatives, more than the flatterers, and <lb/>
            that he will neglect them less in case of their need, and <lb/>
            be less apt to do or say anything amiss to them, and in <lb/>
            matters of consequence will disobey them less than those flat­ <lb/>
            terers, during that period in which he knows not the truth. <lb/>
            It is likely, said he. But when he perceives the real state <lb/>
            of the case, I again guess, he will relax in honour and <lb/>
            respect for them, and attend to the flatterers, and be much <lb/>
            more persuaded by them now than formerly, and live also <lb/>
            according to their fashion,-while for the father, and the rest <lb/>
            of his fictitious relations, if he be not of an entirely good <lb/>
            natural disposition, he will have no regard. You mention <lb/>
            everything, said he, just as it would happen. But in what <lb/>
            manner does this comparison respect those conversant with <lb/>
            dialectics ? In this : — there are certain doctrines about <lb/>
            justice and honour, in which we have been bred, as by <lb/>
            parents, from childhood to render them respect and obedience. <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 17.] </note> <lb/>
            There are, said he. Aye,—and there are other pursuits also, <lb/>
            the opposite of these, attended by pleasures, that flatter and <lb/>
            seduce the soul, but do not persuade those who are in any <lb/>
            degree well-mannered; because these honour their relations <lb/>
            and obey them. Such is the case. What then, said I, <lb/>
            if to a person thus affected the question be proposed, What <lb/>
            is the beautiful? and, in reply to what he has heard from <lb/>
            the lawgiver, he be refuted by reason ; which frequently <lb/>
            and in all ways convicts him and brings him round to the <lb/>
            opinion, that objects are no more beautiful than they are <lb/>
            deformed; and so also, as respects what is just and good, <lb/>
            and whatever else he held in highest esteem, what do <lb/>
            you think such an one will after this do, with regard to <lb/>
            these things, as to honouring and obeying them ? Of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity, said he, he will no longer either honour or obey <lb/>
            them, as he formerly had done. If then, said I, he no <lb/>
            longer deems these things honourable, and allied to him as <lb/>
            formerly, and cannot discover those which really are so, can <lb/>
            he possibly with readiness join himself to any other life than <lb/>
            that of flattery ? It is not possible, said he. And from <lb/>
            being an observer of the law, he will now, I think, appear to <lb/>
            be a law-breaker. Of necessity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—Is it not likely then, said I, that the <lb/>
            affections of persons who thus engage in reasoning, are <lb/>
            deserving, as I was just now saying, of great considera­ <lb/>
            tion ?Aye, and pity too, said he. While you take care <lb/>
            then, that this pitiable case befal not those of the age of <lb/>
            thirty, ought they not by every method to apply themselves <lb/>
            to reasoning? Certainly, said he. And is not this one pru­ <lb/>
            dent caution,that they meddle not with discussions while <lb/>
            young: for you have not forgotten, I suppose, that youths, <lb/>
            when they first join in discussions, abuse them by way of <lb/>
            mere amusement, ever using them for the purpose of con­ <lb/>
            tradiction ; and in imitation of those who are refuters, they <lb/>
            themselves oppose others, ever delighting like whelps to drag <lb/>
            and tear to pieces, by arguments, those who are their <lb/>
            neighbours. Especially so, said he. And after they have <lb/>
            confuted many, and been themselves confuted by many, <lb/>
            then they vehemently and speedily fall into an indifference <lb/>
            about their former opinions ; and by these means they them­ <lb/>
            selves, and the whole of philosophy, are calumniated by <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. C. IT. </note> <lb/>
            the rest of the world. Most true, said he. But he who is <lb/>
            of a riper age, said I, will not like to share in such madness, <lb/>
            but will imitate him who is disposed to reason and inquire after <lb/>
            truth, rather than one who, for the sake of diversion, amuses <lb/>
            himself by contradiction; and he will himself be more modest, <lb/>
            thus rendering the practice of disputing honourable instead of <lb/>
            dishonourable. Right, said he. Have not then all our former <lb/>
            remarks been rightly premised, by way of precaution on this <lb/>
            point, that those who are to be taught dialectics should have <lb/>
            gracious and steady dispositions, and not as now, when every <lb/>
            chance person, even when quite unfit, is admitted thereto ? <lb/>
            Certainly, said he. Is twice the former period then sufficient <lb/>
            for a man to be diligently and constantly engaged in ac­ <lb/>
            quiring dialectics without doing anything else but practising <lb/>
            by way of contrast all bodily exercises ? Do you mean six <lb/>
            years, said he, or four ? No matter, said I;—make it five : <lb/>
            -for after this they must be made to descend to that cave <lb/>
            again, and obliged to govern both in things relating to war, <lb/>
            and in other youthful offices, so as not to fall short of others <lb/>
            in experience; and among these they must be still further <lb/>
            tested, that it may be seen whether they will continue firm, <lb/>
            when drawn in all directions, or be somewhat drawn aside. <lb/>
            And how long a time, said he, do you reckon for this ? <lb/>
            Fifteen years, said 1. And when they are of the age of fifty, <lb/>
            such of them as have been kept safely, and have in every <lb/>
            way obtained all the prizes both in actions and sciences, are <lb/>
            now to be led to the end, and are to be obliged to incline <lb/>
            the eye of their soul to look at that which imparts light <lb/>
            to all things, and, when they contemplate the good itself, <lb/>
            to use it as a pattern, each in turn, either state or private <lb/>
            persons, for adorning themselves, during the remainder of <lb/>
            their life, for the most part, indeed, occupying themselves <lb/>
            with philosophy, and when it is their turn, toiling in poli­ <lb/>
            tical affairs, and taking the government, each for the good of <lb/>
            the state performing this office, not as something honourable, <lb/>
            but as a thing necessary; and after bringing up others also <lb/>
            from time to time to be of the same character, and leaving <lb/>
            them to be state-guardians, they depart to inhabit the islands <lb/>
            of the blest:—and the state, will erect monuments for them <lb/>
            at the public cost, and if the Pythian goddess consent, will <lb/>
            offer sacrifice, as to superior beings,-if not, as to happy and <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 17 ] </note> <lb/>
            divine men. Socrates, said lie, you have made our governors <lb/>
            all-beautiful, just as a sculptor would. And our governesses <lb/>
            likewise, Glaucon, said I;—for suppose not that what I have <lb/>
            said referred more to men than women,-such at least as <lb/>
            have sufficient talent. Right, said he, if at least, as we said, <lb/>
            they are to share in all things equally with the men. What <lb/>
            then, said I;—do you agree, that with reference to a state <lb/>
            and form of government, we have not altogether stated mere <lb/>
            wishes,-but such things as though difficult, are yet in a <lb/>
            certain respect possible, and not otherwise than has been <lb/>
            mentioned,—[that is,] when true philosophers, whether one <lb/>
            or more of them, on becoming governors in a state, despise <lb/>
            present honours, and deem them illiberal and of no value; but <lb/>
            esteem, above all things, rectitude and the honours therefrom <lb/>
            derived; account justice as a thing of all others the greatest, <lb/>
            and most absolutely necessary; and, by ministering to it and <lb/>
            advancing it, thoroughly regulate the constitution of their <lb/>
            own state ? How ? said he. Such, said I, of the more ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in life, as have lived ten years in the state, let them <lb/>
            send all into the country ; and, removing their children away <lb/>
            from the habits now contracted by domestics, let them bring <lb/>
            them up according to their own manners and laws, as we <lb/>
            formerly described them :-thus the state and government <lb/>
            that we have described being most speedily and easily esta­ <lb/>
            blished, will both be happy itself, and of the greatest service <lb/>
            to the people among whom it is established. Very much so <lb/>
            indeed, said he ;-and you seem to me, Socrates, to have <lb/>
            very well described how this state will rise, if it rise at <lb/>
            all. Well then, said I, have we not had sufficient talk, both <lb/>
            about such a state as this, and the individual that corre­ <lb/>
            sponds thereto ?-For it is now clear, parhaps, what kind of <lb/>
            a man we shall say he ought to be. It is evident, replied he ; <lb/>
            and your inquiry, methinks, is now at an end.</p>
          <p>THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.</p><pb n="232"/>

          </ab>
          <p>The mode of rightly governing a state having been duly set forth, Plato <lb/>
            in the eighth book treats of the bad government which he had previously <lb/>
            designated as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικία</foreign>. Having mentioned then three principal forms of, <lb/>
            government, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, he shows in this <lb/>
            and also the following book the excesses and defects peculiar to each. <lb/>
            He considers these faults in two lights ; first, as affecting the manners of <lb/>
            the citizens individually; and, secondly, those of the state collectively. <lb/>
            Aristocracy, says he, is apt to verge into oligarchy,-democracy into <lb/>
            ochlarchy, and monarchy into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμαρχία</foreign> and tyranny. The two former <lb/>
            classes only are treated in this book.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—Well then, Glaucon, these things have been <lb/>
            agreed on, that in a state that is to be perfectly administered <lb/>
            the women are to be in common, the children in common, and <lb/>
            their education also.—so likewise their employments both in <lb/>
            war and peace in common, and their kings the best possible <lb/>
            both in philosophy and warfare. It has been so agreed, <lb/>
            he replied. And this, moreover, we agreed on, that when the <lb/>
            commanders are appointed and leading their soldiers, they <lb/>
            should dwell in habitations, such as we have described, con­ <lb/>
            taining nothing particularly belonging to any individual, but <lb/>
            common to all; and besides these habitations, we agreed also, <lb/>
            if you recollect, as to their possessions, to what sort they <lb/>
            should be entitled. Aye, I recollect, said he, that we thought <lb/>
            them entitled to no possessions whatever, like the other citi­ <lb/>
            zens, but that, like military wrestlers and guardians, they <lb/>
            should receive the yearly pay of their service in maintenance <lb/>
            provided by the rest, and should take care both of themselves <lb/>
            and the rest of the state. You say rightly, said I:—but <lb/>
            come,-since we have settled these matters, let us recollect <lb/>
            from what point we made this digression, in order that we may <lb/>
            again take up the same argument. No hard matter, said he;­ <lb/>
            for you were pursuing much about the same argument respecting <lb/>
            the state, as you did just now, when saying that you considered <pb n="233"/>
             <note type="margin">in. VIII. C. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            such a state to be good as you then described, and the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual man also analogous thereto,-and this, too, as it seems, <lb/>
            when you were able to define both a better state and a better <lb/>
            man. You said, moreover, that all the rest were wrong, if <lb/>
            this were fight ;-and of the other kinds of states you said, I <lb/>
            remember, that four were deserving of consideration, with <lb/>
            the view of seeing the errors therein and the people thereto <lb/>
            corresponding,—in order that by seeing all these and deciding <lb/>
            on the best and worst man, we might inquire whether the best <lb/>
            be the happiest, and the worst the most wretched or other­ <lb/>
            wise :-and when I inquired which were the four kinds <lb/>
            of states to which you referred, on this Polemarchus and <lb/>
            Adimantus interrupted us ;* and so now resuming the subject <lb/>
            you have arrived at this point. You have recollected it, said <lb/>
            I, with great accuracy. Once more then, like a wrestler, <lb/>
            furnish me with the same handle; and when I ask the same <lb/>
            question, try to say just what you were then about to tell me. <lb/>
            Aye, said I, if I can. Moreover, said he, I am anxious <lb/>
            also myself to hear what those four kinds of states were. <lb/>
            You shall hear that, and welcome, said I:—for, of those <lb/>
            which I can mention and which have names,-that praised <lb/>
            by the multitude is the Cretan and Lacedæmonian polity, <lb/>
            -the second, and that which deserves the second praise, <lb/>
            called oligarchy, a polity full of abundant evils,-that <lb/>
            which differs from it, and follows next in order, demo­ <lb/>
            cracy,—and then genuine tyranny, [or monarchy,] differing <lb/>
            from all the others, the fourth and last ailment of the <lb/>
            state :-surely you have no other form of polity, having <lb/>
            a distinct and established species ?-for small principalities <lb/>
            and purchased kingdoms, and such-like polities as these, <lb/>
            are of an intermediate class, and may be found no less <lb/>
            among barbarians than Greeks. Aye, indeed, said he;­ <lb/>
            many are mentioned, and those, too, absurd enough.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—Do you know, then, said I, that of men there <lb/>
            are as many descriptions as of states ?-or do you think <lb/>
            that states, somehow or other, spring out of an oak or a <lb/>
            rock, and not out of the habits of those in the state, whither, <note type="footnote"> * This refers to the interruption at the beginning of the fifth book, <lb/>
            when, Socrates being about to describe the four kinds of wickedness <lb/>
            in both individuals and states, was desired to develop his notions about <lb/>
            the community of women and children. </note> <pb n="234"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VITI. C. 3. </note> <lb/>
            indeed, everything else must verge and be attracted ? I, for <lb/>
            my part, think it is derived from no other source than that. <lb/>
            In that case, if there be five kinds of states, the intellectual <lb/>
            distinctions of the individuals will be five likewise. Of course. <lb/>
            As for the person then, who resembles an aristocracy, we <lb/>
            have already described him, and rightly pronounced him to <lb/>
            be both good and just. Aye, we have described him. Are <lb/>
            we then, in the next place, to argue about the inferior, <lb/>
            -the contentious and ambitious man formed according <lb/>
            to the Spartan model, and him again, who resembles an <lb/>
            oligarchy, or a democracy, or a tyranny, in order that we may <lb/>
            contemplate the most unjust, and contrast him with the most <lb/>
            just, and thus our inquiry may be complete, how unmingled <lb/>
            justice stands in opposition to unmingled injustice, as respects <lb/>
            the happiness or misery of its possessor,-thus either pursuing <lb/>
            injustice in compliance with Thrasymachus's suggestion, or else <lb/>
            justice in compliance with our present argument? We must <lb/>
            do so, by all means, said he. Are we then, just as we began, <lb/>
            to consider moral habits in states primarily, or rather in private <lb/>
            individuals, as being there more clearly developed; and <lb/>
            now must we not thus first consider the ambitious republic <lb/>
            (for I cannot call it by any other term, but only denominate it a <lb/>
            timocracy or a timarchy), and in connexion with it an indi­ <lb/>
            vidual of the same character,-then again an oligarchy and a <lb/>
            man of oligarchical character,-and so also, when considering <lb/>
            a democracy, must we contemplate a democratic person,-and, <lb/>
            fourthly, coining to a state governed by a tyrant, consider a <lb/>
            person of tyrannical disposition ;-thus trying to become com­ <lb/>
            petent judges about what we proposed ? According to reason, <lb/>
            indeed, such should be both our view and decision.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Come then, said I;—let us try to show in <lb/>
            what way a timocracy arises out of an aristocracy:—is it not <lb/>
            plain, at any rate, that every government changes through the <lb/>
            agency of that portion which holds the public offices, when­ <lb/>
            ever sedition arises in that particular part; whereas, if it only <lb/>
            agree with itself, however small the state, it cannot possibly <lb/>
            be disturbed ? Such is the case. How then, Glaucon, said I, <lb/>
            will our state be disturbed and how will our allies and rulers <lb/>
            fall into quarrels with each other and amongst themselves:­ <lb/>
            do you wish, like Homer, that we implore the muses to tell us <lb/>
            how first sedition rose, and address them in tragic fashion, as <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. c. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            if we were children, playing and jesting, so to speak, with <lb/>
            seriousness uttering lofty language? How so ? Somehow thus : <lb/>
            —it is hard indeed for a state thus constituted to become <lb/>
            disturbed ;-but: as everything generated is liable to corrup­ <lb/>
            tion, not even such a constitution as this can abide for ever, <lb/>
            but must be dissolved :-and its dissolution is as follows.—Not <lb/>
            only as regards terrestrial plants, but likewise terrestrial ani­ <lb/>
            mals, a fertility and sterility both of soul and body take place, <lb/>
            when the revolutions of the heavenly bodies complete the <lb/>
            periphery of their respective orbits, which are shorter to <lb/>
            the shorter-lived, and contrariwise to the contrary : and with <lb/>
            reference to the fertility and sterility of your race, though <lb/>
            those are wise whom you have trained as governors of the <lb/>
            state, yet they will never, by intellect and sense united, <lb/>
            observe the proper season for procreation, but let it slip by, <lb/>
            and sometimes generate children when they ought not.-To <lb/>
            that, however, which is divinely generated, there is a period <lb/>
            which is comprehended by the perfect number; whereas, to <lb/>
            that generated by man, there is one, in which the augmenta­ <lb/>
            tions, both surpassing and surpassed, after having received <lb/>
            three separations and four boundaries of things similar and dis­ <lb/>
            similar, increasing and decreasing, will render all things cor­ <lb/>
            respondent and rational;—of which the sesquiternian root, con­ <lb/>
            joined with the pentad and thrice increased, affords two har­ <lb/>
            monies,-one of these, the equally equal, just a hundred times <lb/>
            as much;-while the other, of equal length indeed, but of oblong <lb/>
            shape, is of a hundred numbers from enable diameters of the <lb/>
            pentad, each wanting one, two of which are irrational and of a <lb/>
            hundred cubes of the triad.-And the whole of this geometric <lb/>
            number is, having such an influence, concerned with worse and <lb/>
            better generations.* Now, if our governors be ignorant of this, <lb/>
            and join our couples together unseasonably, the children will <lb/>
            neither possess talent, nor be fortunate either; and though for­ <lb/>
            mer governors should have placed the best of them in office, <lb/>
            nevertheless as they are unworthy of it, and only come into the <lb/>
            power which their fathers had, they will begin to neglect us in <note type="footnote"> * This passage, descriptive of the geometric or fatal number, has <lb/>
            baffled the ingenuity of every commentator. Any literal translation is <lb/>
            little better than nonsense, and any explanation would be too long for a <lb/>
            mere note. The views of Baroccius, Schneider, &amp;c. are given in a disser­ <lb/>
            tation at the end of the volume ;-but they are all far from satisfactory. </note> <pb n="236"/>

            their guardianship, holding niusic first of all, and then gym­ <lb/>
            nastics in less esteem than they ought, and hence our young <lb/>
            men will become too little disposed to music;—in consequence <lb/>
            of which the governors to be appointed from among them will <lb/>
            not be very clever guardians, as respects proving, according to <lb/>
            Hesiod and ourselves, what are the several species of talents, <lb/>
            the golden, the silver, the brazen, and the iron. Where iron, <lb/>
            however, mingles with silver, and brass with gold, then <lb/>
            there arises a dissimilitude and unharmonious unevenness ;- <lb/>
            (and when this is the case, wherever it prevails, it perpetually <lb/>
            generates war and hatred;)—we must say that sedition be­ <lb/>
            longs to such a race as this, whenever it arises. Aye,—and <lb/>
            we shall say that the answer was correctly given, replied he. <lb/>
            Aye, and it must be so too, said I—as they are Muses. <lb/>
            What then, said he, do the Muses say next ? Sedition having <lb/>
            once arisen, said I, two classes of genius,-the iron and the <lb/>
            brazen, will be allured to gain, and the acquisition of land <lb/>
            and houses, gold and silver,—while the golden and silver, <lb/>
            not being in poverty but naturally rich, will lead souls to <lb/>
            virtue and their original constitution ; whereas, should they <lb/>
            be violent and strive one against the other, they would <lb/>
            agree to divide their lands and houses as individual pos­ <lb/>
            sessions ; and then, enslaving those formerly guarded by <lb/>
            them as freemen, friends, and tutors, keep them as denizens <lb/>
            and slaves, themselves providing for war and their own pro­ <lb/>
            tection. This revolution, said he, seems to me to have <lb/>
            just this origin. Will not then this government, said I, <lb/>
            be a medium between aristocracy and oligarchy ? Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Thus then will the revolution be effected, and <lb/>
            when it has taken place, what arrangement will then be <lb/>
            made ?-Is it not plain, that in some things they will follow <lb/>
            the pattern of the former republic, and in others oligarchy, <lb/>
            as halfway between the two, and having something also <lb/>
            peculiar to itself? Just so, he replied. Will they, then, <lb/>
            in honouring their rulers, in allowing their military to <lb/>
            abstain from agriculture, as with us from mechanical and <lb/>
            other money-making pursuits, in establishing common meals, <lb/>
            and in studying both gymnastics and military contests,—in <lb/>
            all these things will they not follow the pattern of the last <lb/>
            form of government ? Yes. But, through the fear of admit- <pb n="237"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. C. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            ting wise men into the magisterial office, inasmuch as the <lb/>
            state no longer possesses men who are simple and resolute, but <lb/>
            only such as are of a mixed character,-and through an in­ <lb/>
            clination towards the high-spirited and even simple, naturally <lb/>
            more suited for war than peace, and also towards those who <lb/>
            are clever at tricks and schemes, spending their whole time in <lb/>
            continual war ;-in all these respects, will it not possess many <lb/>
            such things as are peculiar to itself? Yes. And such as these, <lb/>
            said I, will ever be lovers of wealth, just like those in oli­ <lb/>
            garchies, and will have a wild though disguised love for gold <lb/>
            and silver, as if they possessed treasuries of their own and <lb/>
            domestic storehouses in which to hoard and hide them,-and <lb/>
            circularly-enclosed houses also,-nests as it were wholly their <lb/>
            own, in which they can lose and spend much, together with <lb/>
            their own wives and such others as they fancy. Most true, <lb/>
            said he. Well then,-will they not from their love of <lb/>
            wealth be sparing of it also, though not openly acquiring <lb/>
            it, but disposed to squander other people's property through <lb/>
            lustful desire and secret indulgence in pleasure ;-just as <lb/>
            children escaping from parental law, who have been brought <lb/>
            up not by persuasion but force, owing to their neglect of <lb/>
            the true muse, which unites reasoning and philosophy and <lb/>
            the preference also which they give to gymnastics over music ? <lb/>
            It is quite a mixed government, said he, of which you are <lb/>
            now speaking,-compounded of good and ill. Aye, mixed <lb/>
            indeed, said I:—but the most remarkable thing in it is <lb/>
            what simply arises from the prevalence of high spirit,­ <lb/>
            contention and ambition. Aye, just so, said he. Such then <lb/>
            is the origin and character of this form of government, if one <lb/>
            may ideally sketch it without giving a complete description, <lb/>
            -though enough for us to see from this sketch,-who is the <lb/>
            just and the unjust man; and it were a work of tedious <lb/>
            length to argue on all governments and all the various <lb/>
            manners of men without any exception whatever. Quite <lb/>
            right, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—What then will the individual be, who cor­ <lb/>
            responds to this form of government;—how did he become <lb/>
            so : and what is his nature ? I think indeed, said Adimantus, <lb/>
            he has a tendency to be like this Glaucon here, as far at least as <lb/>
            concerns the love of contention. Perhaps so, said I, as to this <lb/>
            particular;—but I think, that in these respects he cannot at <pb n="238"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
            all resemble him. How ? He must necessarily, said I, be more <lb/>
            self-willed, and somewhat unapt to music, though fond of it; <lb/>
            and fond of hearing, but by no means a rhetorician :-such an <lb/>
            one will be rough towards the slaves, without despising them, <lb/>
            as the man does who is fairly educated. He will be polite <lb/>
            towards the free, submissive to governors, a lover of dominion <lb/>
            and honour,-not thinking it proper to govern by eloquence <lb/>
            or anything of the kind, but by political management and <lb/>
            military achievements, being a lover of gymnastics and hunt­ <lb/>
            ing. This indeed, said he, is the spirit of that form of <lb/>
            government. And will not such an one, said I, despise money <lb/>
            during his youth, but the older he grows, always value it <lb/>
            the more, because he partakes of the covetous disposition, and <lb/>
            is not sincerely affected towards virtue, because destitute of the <lb/>
            best guardian ? Of what guardian ? said Adimantus. Rea­ <lb/>
            son, said I, accompanied with music, which being the only <lb/>
            inbred preservative of virtue, dwells with the possessor <lb/>
            through the whole of life. You say well, he replied. And <lb/>
            surely the timocratic youth, said I, resembles such a state. <lb/>
            Certainly. And such an one, said I, is somehow thus <lb/>
            formed.-He may happen perhaps to be the youthful son of <lb/>
            a worthy father, dwelling in an ill-governed state, and <lb/>
            shunning public honours, magisterial offices, lawsuits, and <lb/>
            all such public business, content to live neglected in ob­ <lb/>
            scurity, that he may have no trouble. In what manner <lb/>
            then, said he, is he formed? First of all, said I, when he <lb/>
            hears his mother complaining that her husband is not in <lb/>
            magisterial office, and that she is on this account neglected <lb/>
            among other women, and then sees that he is not over at­ <lb/>
            tentive to the acquisition of wealth, and does not wrangle <lb/>
            and quarrel privately and publicly in the law courts, but on <lb/>
            all these occasions acts indolently;—and when she perceives <lb/>
            him always attentive to himself, and treating her neither with <lb/>
            extreme respect nor contempt;—on all these accounts, she is <lb/>
            filled with indignation, and tells her son that his father is <lb/>
            unmanly, extremely careless, and whatever else wives are <lb/>
            wont to chant about such matters. Aye,—many things, truly, <lb/>
            said Adimantus, and quite in accordance with their spirit.- <lb/>
            And you know, said I, that the domestics likewise of such <lb/>
            families, such of them as would be thought good-natured, <lb/>
            sometimes say privately the very same to the sons; and if <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII. C. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            they see either a debtor whom the father does not sue, or <lb/>
            any one otherwise acting unjustly, they exhort him to <lb/>
            punish all such persons when he comes to manhood, and <lb/>
            to be more of a man than his father.-And when he <lb/>
            goes abroad, he hears other such-like things, and sees also <lb/>
            that such in the state as attend to their own affairs are <lb/>
            called simple, and held in little esteem, while such as do not <lb/>
            attend to their affairs are both honoured and commended.- <lb/>
            The youth then who hears and sees all this, and then again <lb/>
            hears his fathers speeches, and closely observes his pursuits <lb/>
            in contrast with those of others, is drawn in two opposite <lb/>
            directions,-his father irrigating and promoting the growth of <lb/>
            his rational part, and the others his passions and high spirit ;­ <lb/>
            and so, being not naturally bad, but spoiled only by evil <lb/>
            connexion with others, he is brought to a mean between both <lb/>
            and delivers up the government within himself to a middle <lb/>
            power,-the love of contention and high spirit :-and so he <lb/>
            becomes a haughty and ambitious man. I think, said he, <lb/>
            you have quite correctly explained the training of such a <lb/>
            person.—We have here then, said I, the second form of <lb/>
            government and the second individual. Aye,—we have, said <lb/>
            he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Shall we not then after this say with Æschy­ <lb/>
            lus,— <lb/>
            Where state to state,-then each to each incline ;— <lb/>
            or rather, shall we, according to our plan, establish the state <lb/>
            first ? Certainly, he replied. It would be an oligarchy then, <lb/>
            methinks, that would succeed such a government as this. But <lb/>
            what constitution is it, said he, that you call an oligarchy? <lb/>
            That government, said I, which is founded on the estimate <lb/>
            of men's property;—in which the rich rule, and the poor <lb/>
            have no share in the government. Aye,—I understand, <lb/>
            said he. Should we not, first of all explain, how the <lb/>
            change is made from a timocracy to an oligarchy ? We <lb/>
            should. And surely the way, in which this change is made, <lb/>
            said I, is manifest even to the blind ! How ? That trea­ <lb/>
            sury, said I, which each one fills with gold destroys such <lb/>
            a state; for, first of all, they discover for themselves <lb/>
            modes of expense, for which they set aside the laws,-both <lb/>
            themselves and their wives disobeying them. Very likely, <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. C. 6. </note> <lb/>
            said he, and afterwards, I think, when one observes another, <lb/>
            and enters into rivalry, the people generally become of this <lb/>
            character. It is likely. And thence then, said I, as they <lb/>
            advance in the intensity of the desire for acquiring wealth, <lb/>
            the more honourable they account this, the more dishonour­ <lb/>
            able will they deem virtue ;-for is not virtue so at variance <lb/>
            with wealth, that, supposing each to be placed at the oppo­ <lb/>
            site end of a balance, they would always weigh the one <lb/>
            against the other? Justly so, he replied. While wealth <lb/>
            then and the wealthy are honoured in the state, both virtue <lb/>
            and good men must necessarily be held in dishonour ? It is <lb/>
            plain. And what is honoured is always pursued, while what is <lb/>
            dishonoured is neglected? Just so. Instead then of being <lb/>
            contentious and ambitious men, they have at last become <lb/>
            lovers of gain and wealth ;and the rich they praise and <lb/>
            admire, elevating them to the magistracy, while the poor <lb/>
            man they quite despise. Certainly. And do they not enact <lb/>
            laws, marking out the boundary of the oligarchal con­ <lb/>
            stitution, and regulating the quantity of oligarchal power <lb/>
            by the quantity of wealth,-allotting more to the more <lb/>
            wealthy and less to those less so, intimating that he who has <lb/>
            not the amount settled by law can have no share in the <lb/>
            government ;-and do they not settle these matters com­ <lb/>
            pulsorily, by force of arms, establishing such a state after <lb/>
            previous intimidation ?-Is it not thus ? Aye, indeed. This <lb/>
            then, so to speak, is its constitution ? Yes, replied he. What <lb/>
            then is the nature of the government, and what are the faults <lb/>
            thereto ascribed ? First of an, said I, of this very thing, the <lb/>
            constitution itself, what think you ?-for consider, if a per­ <lb/>
            son were thus to appoint pilots of ships, by the amount of <lb/>
            their property, never intrusting one of them with a poor <lb/>
            man, though better skilled in piloting,-what would then be <lb/>
            the consequence ? They would make a very bad voyage, <lb/>
            he replied. And is it not the same about any other matter, <lb/>
            or any presiding office whatever ? I think so. Is it always so, <lb/>
            except in a state, said I; or is it so as regards a state like­ <lb/>
            wise ? There, beyond all others, said he; inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            the most difficult, and most important kind of goVernment. <lb/>
            Oligarchy then would seem to have this unquestionably <lb/>
            very great fault. So it seems. But what;—is this no less a <lb/>
            fault ? What ? That such a state is not integrally one, hut <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. C. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            necessarily two; one containing the poor, and the other the <lb/>
            rich, dwelling in one place and always plotting against one <lb/>
            another. By Zens, said he, not a whit less ;-and this be­ <lb/>
            sides is a fine thing,-the incapacity of waging war, through <lb/>
            the necessity, either of employing the armed multitude, who <lb/>
            are to be dreaded more than the enemy themselves, or else <lb/>
            refusing to employ them at all, and so appearing quite <lb/>
            oligarchical in battle,-being unwilling also to advance <lb/>
            money for the public service, through a natural disposition <lb/>
            to covetousness ? This is not well. What then ;-with re­ <lb/>
            ference to what we long ago condemned,-engaging in a <lb/>
            variety of pursuits, the same persons in such a state giving <lb/>
            their attendance all at once to agriculture, money-making, <lb/>
            and military affairs; does this seem right? Not at all, of <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Let us see, then,-does this form of govern­ <lb/>
            ment above all others introduce this greatest of all evils ? <lb/>
            What is that ? The permission to each person of selling the <lb/>
            whole of his effects, and to another of purchasing them from <lb/>
            him, and the privilege to the seller of dwelling in our state, <lb/>
            though he belongs to no one class therein, and can be called <lb/>
            neither a money-maker, nor mechanic, nor horseman, nor foot­ <lb/>
            soldier, but poor and destitute. Yes, above all others, he re­ <lb/>
            plied. Such a thing is not prevented in oligarchal govern­ <lb/>
            ments ; for, in that case some of them would not be over-rich, <lb/>
            and others altogether poor. Right. But consider this likewise; <lb/>
            -when such a rich man as this spends his property, would it <lb/>
            do the state any more service, as regards the objects just men­ <lb/>
            tioned ; or did he only seem to he one of the magistrates, while <lb/>
            in truth he was neither magistrate nor servant to the state, <lb/>
            but only a consumer of its substance? Aye,—he did seem so, <lb/>
            he replied ;—he was nothing but a consumer. Do you desire, <lb/>
            then, said I, that we should say of him, that, as a drone in a <lb/>
            beehive brings ailment among the whole swarm, just so, such <lb/>
            a person as this, like a drone in his house, is the ailment of a <lb/>
            state ? Quite so, Socrates, he replied. And has not God, <lb/>
            Adimantus, made all the winged drones without any sting,­ <lb/>
            and those that have feet, some without stings, and some <lb/>
            with dreadful stings ?-And do not those that are with­ <lb/>
            out stings continue poor to old age :-whereas those that <lb/>
            have stings, are those that we called mischievous? Most <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. C. 8. </note> <lb/>
            true, said he. It is plain then, said I, that in a state <lb/>
            where you would observe poor people, there are doubtless <lb/>
            concealed thieves, cutpurses, sacrilegious persons, and workers <lb/>
            of all such evils. Evidently so, said he. What then ? Do <lb/>
            not you find poor people in states that are placed under <lb/>
            oligarchal government ? Almost all are so, said he, ex­ <lb/>
            cept the governors themselves. And do we not think, said <lb/>
            I, that they contain within them many mischievous persons <lb/>
            with stings, whom the magistrates must restrain by vigilance <lb/>
            and compulsory measures ? We do indeed think so, said <lb/>
            he. And must we not say, that it is through want of educa­ <lb/>
            tion, bad nurture, and a corrupt constitution of state, that <lb/>
            persons of this character are here engendered ? Yes we must. <lb/>
            Well then, is not the state oligarchally governed when <lb/>
            under an oligarchy of this character; and is it not affected <lb/>
            by all these evils, and probably more too ? It is nearly so, <lb/>
            said he. Let us distinguish then this form of government <lb/>
            likewise, said I, which they call oligarchy, as one having its <lb/>
            governors [elected] according to the valuation of their pro­ <lb/>
            perty.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Next let us consider the man who is ana­ <lb/>
            logous to this [form of government,] how he is formed and <lb/>
            what is his character. By all means, said he. Is it not thus <lb/>
            then chiefly that the individual man changes from the <lb/>
            timocratic to the oligarchic form ? How ? When such <lb/>
            an one has a son, he, first of all, emulates his father, and <lb/>
            follows his steps; afterwards, when he sees him suddenly <lb/>
            dashed on the state [like a ship] on a rock, squandering his <lb/>
            property and ruining himself, either at the head of the army, <lb/>
            or in some other high magisterial office,—then falling into <lb/>
            the law-courts, ruined by public informers, and either put to <lb/>
            death, or exiled, and stripped of his honours and entire pro­ <lb/>
            perty. It is likely, said he. Aye, my friend, and after seeing <lb/>
            and suffering this, and losing his property, he instantly, <lb/>
            through fear, I think, pushes headlong from the throne within <lb/>
            his soul, his ambitious, lofty temper, and at length, humbled <lb/>
            by poverty, turns his attention to gain, lives meanly and <lb/>
            sparingly, and by hard labour acquires wealth ;—do you not <lb/>
            think that such a man will seat on that throne in his soul a <lb/>
            covetous and money-loving spirit, making it a mighty king <lb/>
            within himself, and girding it, as it were, with tiaras, and <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. c. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            bracelets, and sceptres ? I think so, said lie. But, as for <lb/>
            the principles of reason and high spirit, having laid them <lb/>
            both at his feet on either side as mere slaves, he forbids the one <lb/>
            to reason at all, or at any rate to inquire into aught else, ex­ <lb/>
            cept by what means a smaller amount of property can be made <lb/>
            greater ; and the other, again, to admire and honour any­ <lb/>
            thing but riches and the rich, and to receive honour with <lb/>
            any other view than the acquisition of money, or whatever <lb/>
            else may tend thereto. There is no change, said he, so <lb/>
            sudden and powerful as that of an ambitious to an avari­ <lb/>
            cious man. Is not this, then, said I, the oligarchic man ? <lb/>
            Aye—the change which he undergoes is from a person who <lb/>
            resembles that government from which oligarchy arises. Shall <lb/>
            we consider, now, if he does at all resemble it ? Let us <lb/>
            consider.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—Does he not, in the first place, resemble it in <lb/>
            valuing money above all things ? Of course he does. And <lb/>
            he does so surely in being sparing and laborious, satisfying <lb/>
            only his necessary desires, and not allowing himself any other <lb/>
            expenses, but subduing the other desires as foolish. Certainly. <lb/>
            And in being, said I, a sordid kind of man, making gain of <lb/>
            everything, intent oil hoarding,-one, such as the multitude <lb/>
            extols, will not this be the man that resembles such a form of <lb/>
            government ? Aye, I think so, he replied : wealth at least <lb/>
            must be highly valued by the state, as well as by the individual <lb/>
            of such a character. Aye,—for I do not think, said I, that such <lb/>
            a man has attended to education. I do not think lie has, said <lb/>
            he; for he would not then have chosen a blind guide for <lb/>
            his chorus.* But further still, consider this attentively, <lb/>
            said I;—must we not say that, owing to his want of educa­ <lb/>
            tion, dronish desires springing in him, some of them beg­ <lb/>
            garly, and some mischievous, forcibly kept under restraint by <lb/>
            the rest of his pursuits ? Just so, said he. Do you know, then, <lb/>
            said I, where you will best observe their wickedness ? Where ? <lb/>
            said he. [By looking] at their tutelage of orphans, or what­ <lb/>
            ever else of this kind comes in their way, so as to give them <lb/>
            much power to do injustice. True. Is not this then quite <lb/>
            clear, that in all other kinds of contracts, wherever such an <note type="footnote"> * Allusion is here made to Plutus, the god of riches,—who is usually <lb/>
            represented blind. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορου̃</foreign>, which is the reading of the best <lb/>
            MSS., refers to the noisy crowd of desires that hurry a man through life. </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. C. 10. </note> <lb/>
            one gains approbation, by the mere semblance of justice, <lb/>
            he restrains the other wrong desires within him by exer­ <lb/>
            cising a certain moderation, not from any persuasion that <lb/>
            it is not better to indulge them, nor from sober reason, <lb/>
            but from necessity and fear, because he trembles for the <lb/>
            rem ainder of his property ? Certainly, said he. Aye, by <lb/>
            Zeus, said I, my friend, most of them, when they want to <lb/>
            spend the property of others; display passions much akin to <lb/>
            those of drones. Yes, exceedingly so, observed he. Such a <lb/>
            person as this, then, will not be free from internal discord ; <lb/>
            nor be integrally one, but a kind of double man ; possessing <lb/>
            desires, however, that are at variance with one another, the <lb/>
            better, usually, governing the worse. It is so. On these <lb/>
            accounts, then, such an one, methinks, will present a better <lb/>
            appearance than many others ; though the true virtue of a <lb/>
            harmonized and consistent soul will wholly escape him. Aye, <lb/>
            it seems so. And the sparing man, either privately or in the <lb/>
            state, will be but a poor rival, as regards any victory or other <lb/>
            struggle for honour; because either for reputation's sake, <lb/>
            or any such contests, he is unwilling to spend his property, <lb/>
            through fear of kindling expensive desires, and calling them <lb/>
            into alliance or rivalry; — and warring, as he does, in <lb/>
            oligarchic fashion, with only a few of his resources, he is in <lb/>
            most cases defeated, though he still contrives to get rich. <lb/>
            Quite so, replied he. Can we any longer hesitate, said I, to <lb/>
            rank the niggard and the money-maker as resembling a <lb/>
            state under an oligarchy ? By no means, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Democracy, as it seems, must next be consi­ <lb/>
            dered,—how it arises, and when once arisen, what kind of man <lb/>
            it produces;—in order that understanding the nature of such <lb/>
            a man, we may at once bring him to trial. Yes, said he;­ <lb/>
            that would be our consistent course. Well then, said I, is not <lb/>
            the change from oligarchy to democracy produced in some <lb/>
            such way as this,-through the insatiable desire of the pro­ <lb/>
            posed good, viz. the desire of becoming as rich as possible ? <lb/>
            How ? Inasmuch as its governors govern through the posses­ <lb/>
            sion of great wealth, they will have no wish, methinks, to <lb/>
            restrain by law the profligate portion of the young men <lb/>
            from squandering and wasting their property at pleasure; <lb/>
            because, by purchasing such persons' effects, and lending on <lb/>
            usury, they will not only be still more enriched, but held in <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin"> D. VInI. C. 10.] </note> <lb/>
            higher repute. Far more so than any other. This, then, is <lb/>
            already quite clear in our state, that to honour riches, and at <lb/>
            the same time practise temperance, is impossible, since either <lb/>
            the one or the other must necessarily be neglected Of course, <lb/>
            that is quite plain, said he. While, therefore, they are neg­ <lb/>
            lectful in oligarchies, and allow the youths to indulge in <lb/>
            licentiousness, they must necessarily sometimes bring men to <lb/>
            poverty, even those that are not ignoble. Quite so. And <lb/>
            these, I suppose, stand in our state both spurred, and in <lb/>
            armour; some in debt, others in disgrace, others in both, <lb/>
            hating and conspiring against those who have got what <lb/>
            belonged to them, and against others also, for mere love <lb/>
            of change. Aye, such is the case. These usurers, however, <lb/>
            bent on their own interests, and apparently unobservant of <lb/>
            these, wound all that ever yield to them by advancing them <lb/>
            money, and so, by getting multiplied interest for the parent <lb/>
            principal,* fill the state with many a drone and pauper. Aye, <lb/>
            with many a one, he replied. And even when such an evil <lb/>
            is raging in the state, said I, they are not willing to ex­ <lb/>
            tinguish it, not even by restraining people from spending <lb/>
            their property at pleasure, nor yet in this way by making <lb/>
            another law to destroy such disorders. What law ? One <lb/>
            that shall follow the other, compelling the citizens to culti­ <lb/>
            vate virtue; for if they were bidden to engage in volun­ <lb/>
            tary contracts chiefly at their own hazard, their usurers <lb/>
            would create less scandal in the state, and fewer also of <lb/>
            the evils now mentioned would arise therein. Far fewer, said <lb/>
            he. At present, however, said I, it is by all these means <lb/>
            that the governors in the state thus dispose of the governed ; <lb/>
            and both as to themselves and those belonging to them, do <lb/>
            they not render the youths luxurious and idle as respects <lb/>
            all bodily and mental exercises, effeminate in bearing plea­ <lb/>
            sure and pains, and indolent likewise ? What else ? And as <lb/>
            to themselves, they neglect everything but the acquisition of <lb/>
            wealth, and pay no more regard to virtue than the poor? <lb/>
            No, surely. Having then been thus trained up, when the <lb/>
            governors and their subjects are thrown together, either on a <lb/>
            journey along the road, or in other meetings, either at public <note type="footnote"> * The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατήρ</foreign> is here used to signify the principal sum (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ κεφά­ <lb/>

            spectacles, or on warlike expeditions, either as fellow-sailors <lb/>
            or fellow-soldiers, or when they see one another in real dan­ <lb/>
            gers, the poor in this case are by no means despised by the <lb/>
            rich ;-but very often a robust fellow, poor and sunburnt, <lb/>
            whose post in battle is by the side of a rich man bred up in <lb/>
            the shade, and swoln with much unnecessary fat,* if he should <lb/>
            see him panting for breath and in agony,-think you not, he <lb/>
            will consider such persons to grow rich to their own injury, <lb/>
            and will say to his fellow, when meeting in private, that our <lb/>
            rich men are good for nothing ? Of course, I well know, said <lb/>
            he, that they do so. Well then, as a diseased body needs <lb/>
            but the smallest shock from without to give it pain, and <lb/>
            is sometimes thrown into disorder without any interference <lb/>
            from without, so also the state that resembles it will, on the <lb/>
            smallest occasion from without, either when one party forms <lb/>
            an alliance with an oligarchal, or the other with a democratic <lb/>
            state, become disorded, and fight with itself, and also rise in <lb/>
            revolt without any external interference. Yes, certainly. <lb/>
            A democracy then, I think, arises, when the poor prevailing <lb/>
            over the rich, kill some, and banish others, and share the <lb/>
            state-offices and magistracies equally among the remainder; <lb/>
            and for the most part the magistracies therein are disposed <lb/>
            of by lot. Aye, said he, this is the establishment of a <lb/>
            democracy, whether it be effected through force of arms, or <lb/>
            from the withdrawal of the other party through fear.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.-In what way then, said I, do these live,­ <lb/>
            and what will be the character of this government;—for it <lb/>
            is plain, that a man of this kind will appear democratic ? It <lb/>
            is plain, said he. First, then, are they not free, and is not <lb/>
            the state full of freedom of action, and speech, and each one <lb/>
            at liberty to do what he pleases ? So it is said, he replied. <lb/>
            And where there is liberty, every one will evidently regulate <lb/>
            his own plan of life just as he pleases ? Plainly so. Under <lb/>
            such a government especially, methinks, men of all charac­ <lb/>
            ters will spring up. Of course. This, said I, seems likely <lb/>
            to be the best of all governments;—just as a various- <lb/>
            coloured robe, embroidered with flowers of all kinds,-so will <lb/>
            this appear best, variegated as it is with all sorts of man­ <lb/>
            ners. Of course, said he. And perhaps too, said I, the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig48.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="247"/>
              <note type="margin"> B. VIII. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
              multitude will reckon this the best, just as children and <lb/>
              women looking at embroidered dresses. Very likely, said <lb/>
              he. Aye, my excellent friend, here is a state in which we <lb/>
              may fitly look for a government. How so ? Because it <lb/>
              comprises all kinds of government on the score of its liberty; <lb/>
              and it seems necessary for one that desires to establish a state, <lb/>
              as we are now doing, to come to any democratic state, the <lb/>
              form of which he likes, as to a general political fair, and <lb/>
              establish that which he has chosen. Aye, said he, he would <lb/>
              probably be in no want of models. Is not this, said I, a <lb/>
              divine and pleasant kind of life for the present,-that there <lb/>
              be no need of governing in this state, even though you be <lb/>
              able to do so,-nor yet of being a subject, unless you please, <lb/>
              -nor of engaging in war because others do,-nor of keeping <lb/>
              peace when others keep it, unless you desire peace;-nor <lb/>
              again, though there be a law that restrains you from govern­ <lb/>
              ing or administering justice, yet you no less shall govern and <lb/>
              administer justice, if so disposed ? It is likely, said he ;-in <lb/>
              this particular at least. But what; is not their lenience <lb/>
              towards some of those who are condemned very polite; and <lb/>
              in such a government did you never yet see its lenity to­ <lb/>
              wards men condemned to death or banishment, who never­ <lb/>
              theless remain there in open intercourse, the banished man, <lb/>
              too, returning like a hero as if no one attended to or observed <lb/>
              him ? Aye, many, he replied. But this indulgence of the <lb/>
              state,-not to mention the small regard, and even contempt <lb/>
              which it shows for all that we deemed so important when <lb/>
              settling our state, as that, unless a man had a most exalted <lb/>
              nature,* he would never become a good man, except he had <lb/>
              from childhood upwards delighted in noble actions, and <lb/>
              diligently followed all such pursuits ;-how magnanimously <lb/>
              does it despise and think as naught all these things, evincing <lb/>
              an utter disregard as to the kind of pursuits from which a <lb/>
              man comes to engage in politics, though it honours him if he <lb/>
              only declares himself well affected towards the multitude ? <lb/>
              How very generous, he rejoined. These then, said I, and <lb/>
              others akin to these, are to be found in democracy; and it <lb/>
              seems to be a pleasant sort of government, both anarchical <lb/>
              and variegated, distributing a certain equality to all alike, <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερβεβλημένην φύσιν</foreign>. Euripides uses a similar expression in <lb/>
              the Alcestis, v. 155 :—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τί χρὴ γενέσθαι τὴν ὑπερβεβλημένην</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναι̃κα</foreign>. </note> <pb n="248"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. C. 12. </note> <lb/>
              both equals and unequals. Aye, you say, be replied, what <lb/>
              is perfectly well known.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Consider then, said I, what kind of man such <lb/>
            an one is in private; or shall we first consider, as we did <lb/>
            with respect to the government, in what manner he is formed? <lb/>
            Yes, said he. Is he not then formed in this manner,­ <lb/>
            namely, from the parsimonious man who was under the oligar­ <lb/>
            chy,—as a son, trained up under his father according to his <lb/>
            habits ? Of course. Such an one forcibly governs his own <lb/>
            pleasures,-such as are expensive, but not tending to the ac­ <lb/>
            quisition of wealth, which are hence called unnecessary. It is <lb/>
            plain, said he. That we may not argue in the dark then, said <lb/>
            I, let us first, if you please, determine what desires are neces-. <lb/>
            sary, and what are not. Willingly, said he. May not such <lb/>
            be justly called necessary, which we cannot get rid of, and <lb/>
            the gratification of which does us service ? For both these <lb/>
            kinds our nature must necessarily seek after; must it not ? <lb/>
            Quite so. This then, we may justly say, is a necessary part <lb/>
            to these desires ? Justly. But what now? Such desires as <lb/>
            a man may relinquish, if he try to do so from his youth, and <lb/>
            which while they remain, do no good, if we say of these that <lb/>
            they are not necessary, shall we not say right ? Right, in­ <lb/>
            deed. Let us select a pattern of each, that we may under­ <lb/>
            stand from example what they are. Quite right. Is not the <lb/>
            desire of eating necessary so far as is conducive to health and <lb/>
            a good habit of body, and the desire of food and victuals ? <lb/>
            I think so. The desire of food, at least, is necessary on two <lb/>
            accounts, as being advantageous in itself, and because the <lb/>
            want of it must bring life to an end.* It is. And the desire <lb/>
            of victuals is likewise necessary, as contributing towards a <lb/>
            good habit of body. Certainly. But what ?-even such <lb/>
            desire as goes beyond these things, or any other sorts <lb/>
            of meats, and yet can be curbed from youth, and trained <lb/>
            to abstain from most things, and which is hurtful both to <lb/>
            body and soul as regards the attainment of wisdom and tem­ <lb/>
            perance, may not that be rightly called unnecessary ? Most <lb/>
            rightly, indeed. May we not say then that these too are ex­ <lb/>
            pensive, and the others frugal, as they conduce towards the <note type="footnote"> * Gr. y rf <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠφέλιμος σι̃τος, ῇ τε παυ̃σαι ζω̃ντα δυνατή</foreign>,—i. e. if there <lb/>
            be no sufficient supply,-the general meaning being, that the desire for <lb/>
            food is not only useful, but indispensable to the maintenance of life. </note> <pb n="249"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            actions of life ? Of course. We may speak in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner, surely, of venereal, and the other desires ? In the same <lb/>
            manner. And did we not, by him whom we just now called <lb/>
            the drone, indicate a person full of such desires and pleasures, <lb/>
            and governed by those that are unnecessary; but one go­ <lb/>
            verned by those merely necessary, a parsimonious man, and <lb/>
            disposed to -an oligarchy ? Without doubt.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—Let us again mention, said I, how the <lb/>
            democratic mail arises out of the oligarchic; and to me he <lb/>
            appears to arise chiefly thus. How ? When a young man <lb/>
            brought up, as we now mentioned, without proper instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, and in niggard fashion, comes to taste the drones' <lb/>
            honey, and associates with those fiery, terrible creatures who <lb/>
            can procure all sorts and varieties of pleasures, and from <lb/>
            every quarter ;-then you may conceive, he somehow begins <lb/>
            to change the oligarchic for the democratic character. It <lb/>
            must be so, he observed. Well then, just as the state was <lb/>
            changed by the aid of another party from without to <lb/>
            which it was related, is not the youth so changed likewise, <lb/>
            through the aid of one species of desires from without, to <lb/>
            others within him, which resemble them and are allied there­ <lb/>
            to ? By all means. And methinks, if any alliance should <lb/>
            come to counteract the oligarchic principle within him, <lb/>
            either through his father or other relatives, admonishing and <lb/>
            upbraiding him, then truly will arise sedition, opposition, and <lb/>
            an internal struggle against himself. Undoubtedly. And <lb/>
            sometimes, indeed, I think the democratic yields to the <lb/>
            oligarchic principle, and some of the desires are destroyed, <lb/>
            while others retire, because a certain modesty is engendered <lb/>
            in the youth's soul, and he is again restored to order. This <lb/>
            is sometimes the case, said he. And again, I suppose, when <lb/>
            some desires retire, others allied to them secretly grow up, <lb/>
            which through neglect of parental instruction, become both <lb/>
            many and powerful. This is usually the case, said he. They <lb/>
            draw them then towards the same intimacies as before, and <lb/>
            through their connexions secretly generate a multitude? <lb/>
            What else ? And in the end, I think, they seize the citadel of <lb/>
            the youth's soul, because they find it empty, as regards vir­ <lb/>
            tuous pursuits and true reasoning,-the best guardians and <lb/>
            preservers of the rational part of men dear to the gods. Just <lb/>
            so, said he. And then, indeed false and arrogant reasonings <pb n="250"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            and opinions rush up in their stead, and take their place in <lb/>
            such people. Assuredly, said he. And does lie not then <lb/>
            come once more, and dwell openly among those Lotophagi ?* <lb/>
            -And if any aid come from intimate friends to strengthen <lb/>
            the parsimonious principle within him, these said arrogant <lb/>
            reasoning,-, by shutting against it the gates of the royal wall, <lb/>
            neither permit the alliance itself, nor allow the ambassadorial <lb/>
            admonitions of individual old men, but struggle against them <lb/>
            and maintain themselves in power;- and as for modesty, <lb/>
            they call it stupidity, and thrust it out into disgraceful <lb/>
            exile, while temperance they call unmanliness, load it with <lb/>
            abuse, and then expel it ;-and as for moderation and decent <lb/>
            expense, they persuade themselves that they are nothing else <lb/>
            but rusticity and illiberality, and banish them from their <lb/>
            territories, with many other unprofitable desires. Assuredly, <lb/>
            they do. Having emptied and purified from all these desires, <lb/>
            the soul, thus held by them, and initiated in the great <lb/>
            mysteries, t they next introduce with encomiums and false <lb/>
            eulogies, indolence and anarchy, extravagance and shame­ <lb/>
            lessness, shining with a great retinue, and wearing crowns,­ <lb/>
            calling insolence, good-breeding,-anarchy, liberty,-luxury, <lb/>
            magnificence,—and impudence, manliness. Is it not, said I, <lb/>
            somehow thus,-that a youth, after being bred up with ne­ <lb/>
            cessary lesires falls away into the license and dissoluteness <lb/>
            induced by needless and unprofitable pleasures? Yes, plainly <lb/>
            so, he replied. Such an one, then, methinks, thenceforth <lb/>
            passes his life, spending his property, labour, and time as <lb/>
            much on necessary as. unnecessary pleasures, but if he be for­ <lb/>
            tunate and not unusually excited by passion, he, as he advances <lb/>
            in years, and the sovereignty of the passions is subdued, <lb/>
            re-admits part of those expelled, and does not deliver him­ <lb/>
            self wholly up to mere intruders, but regulates his pleasures <lb/>
            on the principle of equality, and so lives, giving himself <lb/>
            up to each incidental desire that happens to rule him, <lb/>
            till he is sated,-and then another, undervaluing none, <lb/>
            but indulging all alike. Quite so, of course. And yet <note type="footnote"> * These Lotophagi are described by Homer, Odyss. ix. 94, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> t Allusion is here made to the Eleusinian mysteries, which after certain <lb/>

            months subsequently, the greater (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μεγάλα τέλη</foreign>). </note> <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. C. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            such an one, said I, will not listen to true reasoning, nor <lb/>
            admit it into his stronghold,—should he be told that some <lb/>
            pleasures are attached to honourable and virtuous desires, <lb/>
            others to those that are depraved, and that he should pursue <lb/>
            and honour the former, but chastise and hold captive the <lb/>
            latter,-but in all these cases will dissent, and say that they are <lb/>
            all alike, and to be held in equal honour. Assuredly, said he, <lb/>
            one thus affected, does this. Well then, said I, thus does <lb/>
            he daily live, gratifying every incidental desire, sometimes <lb/>
            getting drunk to the sound of the flute, at others tempe­ <lb/>
            rately drinking water,-at others, again exercising gym­ <lb/>
            nastics ; sometimes indolent and wholly careless ; then <lb/>
            again applying, as it were, to philosophy,-often too acting <lb/>
            the politician, saying and doing by skips and jumps what­ <lb/>
            ever comes first :-and if he would imitate any of the <lb/>
            military tribe, thither he is carried; if the mercantile, then <lb/>
            again thither; nor is his life regulated by any plan or law, <lb/>
            but, deeming this particular life pleasant, and free, and <lb/>
            blessed, he follows it throughout. You have most fully <lb/>
            described, said he, the life of the man who places all laws <lb/>
            on a level. I at least am of opinion, said I, that he is mul­ <lb/>
            tiform, and filled with different habits; like the state, too, <lb/>
            he is handsome and of varied complexion, a man whose <lb/>
            life many men and women would emulate, because he contains <lb/>
            within himself numerous patterns both of forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment and moral habits. He does, said he. What then ? <lb/>
            Have we then so described and arranged such an one on the <lb/>
            principles of democracy, as that he may be truly called one <lb/>
            of democratic character. We will allow that it has, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.*-It still remains, however, that we discuss, <lb/>
            said I, that most excellent form of government and that most <lb/>
            excellent man,—tyranny and the tyrant. Surely, said he. <lb/>
            Come then, my dear fellow;-what is the manner in which <lb/>
            tyranny arises ?-for it is almost plain, that it is a change from <lb/>
            democracy. Plain. Does not tyranny arise in the same manner <lb/>
            from democracy, as democracy does from oligarchy ? How­ <lb/>
            as respects the good then, which oligarchy proposed to itself <lb/>
            and according to which it was constituted; was it not with <lb/>
            a view of becoming extremely rich? Yes. An insatiable <note type="footnote"> * A large portion of this and the following chapter will be found ren­ <lb/>
            dered into Latin in Cicero de Republ. i. ch. 43. 44. </note> <pb n="252"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 14. </note> <lb/>
            desire then for riches, and a neglect of all besides, through <lb/>
            attention to the acquisition of wealth, destroys it. True, <lb/>
            said he. And with reference to what democracy deno­ <lb/>
            minates good, an insatiable thirst for it destroys it like­ <lb/>
            wise ? But what say you, it denominates as good ? Liberty, <lb/>
            said I:—for this, you are told, is best found in a state <lb/>
            under democratic rule, and hence any one naturally free <lb/>
            would choose to dwell in this alone. This word liberty, said <lb/>
            he, is vastly much talked about. Well then, observed I, as <lb/>
            I was just going to say, does not the insatiable desire for <lb/>
            this, and the neglect of other things, change even the form <lb/>
            of government, and prepare it to need a tyrant ? How ? <lb/>
            said he. When a state, said I, is under democratic rule, <lb/>
            thirsts after liberty, and happens to have bad cupbearers <lb/>
            appointed it, and gets immoderately drunk with an unmixed <lb/>
            draught thereof, it punishes even the governors, unless they <lb/>
            be quite tame-spirited, and allow them excessive liberty, by <lb/>
            accusing them of being corrupt and oligarchical. They do so, <lb/>
            said he. But such as obey the magistrates, said I, it abuses <lb/>
            as willing and good-for-nothing slaves ; both publicly and in <lb/>
            private they commending and honouring magistrates who re­ <lb/>
            semble subjects, and subjects who resemble magistrates: must <lb/>
            it not happen in such a state, that we must necessarily arrive <lb/>
            at the acme of liberty ? Of course. And must it not descend, <lb/>
            too, my friend, said I, into private families, and at last <lb/>
            reach even the brutes ? How, said he, can we assert aught <lb/>
            like this ? For instance, said I, when a father gets used to <lb/>
            become like his child, and fears his sons, and the son [in <lb/>
            like manner] his father, and has neither respect nor fear <lb/>
            of his parents, in order, forsooth, that he may be free;­ <lb/>
            and thus a mere resident is placed on a level with a <lb/>
            citizen, and a resident with a stranger, and so likewise a <lb/>
            foreigner. Just so, said he. Aye, these indeed happen, said <lb/>
            I, and other similar little things also :-and in such cases a <lb/>
            teacher fears and flatters his scholars, and the scholars despise <lb/>
            their teachers, and so also their tutors; and on the whole the <lb/>
            youths resemble those more advanced in years, and rival <lb/>
            them both in speech and action : while the old men sit <lb/>
            down with the young, and imitate them in their love of mer­ <lb/>
            riment and pleasantry, for fear of appearing morose and <lb/>
            despotic. Quite so, of course, replied he. But as to this <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. c. 15.] </note> <lb/>
            extreme liberty of the multitude, said I, what a height it <lb/>
            attains in a state like this, where purchased slaves, male <lb/>
            or female, are no less free than their purchasers, and how <lb/>
            much equality and liberty wives enjoy with their husbands, <lb/>
            and husbands with their wives,—this we have almost for­ <lb/>
            gotten to mention. Are we not then to say, according to <lb/>
            Æschylus, he observed, whatever now comes into our mouth? <lb/>
            By all means, said I ; and accordingly I thus speak: <lb/>
            —with reference even to brutes, such as are under the <lb/>
            care of men, how much more free they are in such a state; <lb/>
            he who has no experience thereof will not easily believe <lb/>
            — for according to the proverb, even dogs resemble their <lb/>
            mistresses;* and horses and asses are used to run about <lb/>
            at large, surlily driving against whomsoever they meet, unless <lb/>
            they get out of their way; and many other such-like things <lb/>
            happen, that indicate an abundance of liberty. You are just <lb/>
            telling me my dream, said he, for this has often happened to <lb/>
            me when going into the country. But do you observe, said <lb/>
            I, when all these things are collected together in a whole, that <lb/>
            they make the soul of the citizens so sensitive, that if they <lb/>
            were any how to be brought into slavery, they would be in­ <lb/>
            dignant and not endure it;—for in the end, you know, they <lb/>
            regard laws neither written nor unwritten, and hence no one <lb/>
            will by any means become their master? I know it well, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—This then, said I, my friend, I suppose, is that <lb/>
            government so beautiful and youthful, whence tyranny springs. <lb/>
            Youthful, indeed, he replied; but what then? The same <lb/>
            malady, said I, that existed in an oligarchy, destroys this <lb/>
            form likewise; rising also to a higher pitch of power, and en­ <lb/>
            slaving the democracy by its very licentiousness ; for, in fact, <lb/>
            the doing of anything to excess usually causes great change <lb/>
            in an opposite direction : and so it is in the seasons, as in <lb/>
            vegetable and animal bodies, and so also not least of all in <lb/>
            forms of government. Probably so, said he. Aye, for. <lb/>
            excessive liberty seems only to degenerate into excessive <lb/>
            slavery, either in private individuals or states. It is probable, <lb/>
            indeed. Probably then, said I, tyranny is established out <lb/>
            of no other form than democracy;-out of the highest degree <note type="footnote"> * The proverb here alluded to runs thus, according to the scholiast:— <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶάπερ ἡ δέσποινα</foreign>, rota <foreign xml:lang="grc">χά κύων</foreign>. The adage from Æschylus, some­ <lb/>
            what above, is of an origin equally unknown. </note> <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. c. 16. </note> <lb/>
            of liberty, methinks, the greatest and fiercest slavery. Yes, <lb/>
            it is reasonable, said he. This, however, methinks, said I, was <lb/>
            not what you asked :-but what is that same disease which <lb/>
            arises in an oligarchy and a democracy, and reduces each <lb/>
            to slavery? Your remark is true, replied he. I meant, <lb/>
            said I, that there was a race of idle and profuse men, the <lb/>
            bravest of whom were the leaders, and the more cowardly <lb/>
            their followers, whom indeed we compared to drones ; some to <lb/>
            those with stings, others to those without stings. Rightly too, <lb/>
            said he. These two now, said I, when they spring up in a <lb/>
            government, disturb it, just like phlegm and bile in a natural <lb/>
            body,-and against these it is the duty of a wise physician and <lb/>
            lawgiver of a state, no less than of a wise bee-master, to take <lb/>
            much fore-caution,—first, that they never gain admittance;­ <lb/>
            and if they should enter, that they be as soon as possible cut off, <lb/>
            with their cells as well. Yes, by Zeus, said he ; altogether so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—Let us thus then conceive the matter, said <lb/>
            I, that we may more distinctly see what we want. How ? Let <lb/>
            us ideally divide a democratic state into three parts, as it <lb/>
            in fact is; for some such classification is natural to it, owing <lb/>
            to its liberty, no less than to an oligarchy. It is so. Yet <lb/>
            it is much more fierce at least in this than in the former. <lb/>
            How ? In an oligarchy, from not being held in honour, but <lb/>
            excluded from the magisterial office, it is unexercised and <lb/>
            gains no strength;—but in a democracy it is, with a few ex­ <lb/>
            ceptions, the presiding party, the fiercest of them ever talking <lb/>
            and agitating, while the rest bustle about at the law-courts, <lb/>
            and cannot endure any one else to speak differently from <lb/>
            itself; and thus all things, with only a few exceptions, under <lb/>
            such a government, are managed by a party. Very much the <lb/>
            case, said he. Some other party, then, is always separated <lb/>
            from the multitude. Which ? While the general body are <lb/>
            engaged in the pursuit of gain, such as are naturally the most <lb/>
            temperate generally become the wealthiest. Very probably. <lb/>
            And hence is it, methinks, that the greatest quantity of <lb/>
            honey, and what comes with the greatest ease, is pressed out <lb/>
            of these by the drones. Yes,—for how, said he, can any one <lb/>
            press it from those who have but little ? Such wealthy people, <lb/>
            I think, are called the pasture of the drones. Nearly so, <lb/>
            replied he. And the people will be a sort of third species,­ <lb/>
            such as mind their own affairs, without meddling with <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. c. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            others, who have little property, but are yet the most <lb/>
            numerous, and most prevailing in a democracy, whenever it <lb/>
            is densely populated. It is so; but this it will not often <lb/>
            consent to do without getting some share of the honey. This <lb/>
            class, of course, always obtains a share, said I, as far as their <lb/>
            leaders are able, by robbing those that have property, and <lb/>
            giving it to the people, in order that they may eat most them­ <lb/>
            selves. Aye, said he, that is the way in which these become <lb/>
            sharers. These, then, are obliged to defend themselves. Those <lb/>
            thus despoiled are compelled to defend themselves, saying and <lb/>
            doing all they can among the people. Of course. And though <lb/>
            they have no inclination to introduce a change of government, <lb/>
            they are charged with forming plots and plans against the <lb/>
            common people, and being oligarchally disposed. What next ? <lb/>
            After seeing that the people, not willingly, but through <lb/>
            ignorance and the impositions of these slanderers, attempt <lb/>
            to injure them, do they not then, indeed, even against their <lb/>
            wills, become truly oligarchic ?-though not spontaneously, <lb/>
            for this very mischief is generated by the drone that stings <lb/>
            them. Quite so. And so they lay informations, make <lb/>
            lawsuits, and have contests one with another. Very much <lb/>
            so. And are not the people always used to place some <lb/>
            one in special presidency over themselves, and to cherish him, <lb/>
            and promote him to great power ? They are. And this, said I, <lb/>
            is plain, that whenever a tyrant rises, it is from the fact of <lb/>
            thus presiding, and nothing else, that he flourishes. This is <lb/>
            very clear. How, then, begins the change from a president <lb/>
            into a tyrant ?-is it not clearly when the president begins <lb/>
            to do the same as is told in the fable, about the temple <lb/>
            of the Lycean Zeus, to whom the wolf was dedicated in <lb/>
            Arcadia ? What is that? said he. That whoever tastes <lb/>
            human entrails mixed with those of other offerings, must <lb/>
            necessarily become a wolf :-have you not heard the story ? <lb/>
            I have. Well, then, supposing him to be thus the president of <lb/>
            the people, and having to deal with an extremely compliant <lb/>
            multitude, he should not refrain from shedding even kindred <lb/>
            blood, but by unjust charges, as usual, should bring men <lb/>
            into the law-courts and murder them, as if he set no value on <lb/>
            human life, and, tasting with unholy mouth and tongue even the <lb/>
            blood of relations, should banish men and slay them, proposing <lb/>
            the abolition of debts and fresh division of lands,-must not <pb n="256"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. c. 17. </note> <lb/>
            such an one of necessity, and by destiny, be either destroyed <lb/>
            by his enemies, or else act the tyrant, and from a man, be­ <lb/>
            come a wolf? Of great necessity, said he. This then, is <lb/>
            he, said I—the same who rises in sedition against those <lb/>
            who have property. Yes. And when he has been banished <lb/>
            and returns against the will of his adversaries, he comes <lb/>
            back, of course, an accomplished tyrant. It is plain. And if <lb/>
            they cannot expel him, or put him to death on a state accu­ <lb/>
            sation, then they conspire to cut him off privately by a <lb/>
            violent death. It usually so happens, he observed. And <lb/>
            besides this, all who have advanced to this station invent <lb/>
            this much-vaunted tyrannical demand, asking the people <lb/>
            for certain body-guards, that the people's aid may be secured <lb/>
            them. Of this, said he, they take special care. And <lb/>
            methinks they grant them this through fear of his safety, <lb/>
            though secure as to their own. Quite so. And when a man <lb/>
            observes this, who has property, and who, besides that, is <lb/>
            further charged with hating the people,-he then, my friend, <lb/>
            according to the answer of the oracle to Crœsus, <lb/>
            ...... To pebble-bedded Hermus flies, <lb/>
            Nor waits the brand of cowardice ;* <lb/>
            because he would not, said he, be a second time in fear. But <lb/>
            surely, said I, he at least, methinks, that is caught, is put to <lb/>
            death. Of necessity so. It is plain, then, that this president of <lb/>
            our state does not like a noble person, nobly lie,✝ but, after <lb/>
            hurling down many others, sits in his chair of office, a con­ <lb/>
            summate tyrant of the state,-and not a president. Of course. <lb/>
            he is likely to be so, rejoined he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—Shall we then examine the happiness both <lb/>
            of the man and the state, in which such a mortal as this is <lb/>
            engendered ? Let us do so by all means, said he. Does <lb/>
            he not, then, said I, in the first days, and for a brief season, <lb/>
            smile and salute every one he meets, and asserting himself to <lb/>
            be no tyrant, and promise many things, both in public and <lb/>
            private, and liberate men from debts, and distribute land both <lb/>
            to the public and those about him, and affect to be mild <lb/>
            and liberal towards all ? He must, replied he. But, me­ <lb/>
            thinks, when he becomes reconciled to some of his foreign <note type="footnote"> * The same oracular legend occurs in Herodotus, Clio, ch. 55. </note><note type="footnote"> t Camp. Horn. 11. xvi. 776 ; Odyss. xxiv. 39. </note> <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VIII. c. 18.˥ </note> <lb/>
            enemies, and has destroyed others, and there is quiet respecting <lb/>
            these, he first of all is ever exciting wars, that the people <lb/>
            may be in need of a leader. Aye, that is likely. Is'it not <lb/>
            also then, that, being rendered poor by contributing to the <lb/>
            public treasury, they may be compelled to be anxious for daily <lb/>
            sustenance, and so less readily conspire against him ? Plainly <lb/>
            so. And methinks, if he suspects that any of a free spirit will <lb/>
            not allow him to govern,—in order that he may have some <lb/>
            pretext for destroying them, he exposes them to the enemy; <lb/>
            for all these reasons a tyrant must necessarily be always rais­ <lb/>
            ing war. Necessarily so. And, while he is doing these things, <lb/>
            he will necessarily become more hateful to the citizens. Of <lb/>
            course. And, therefore, some of those who have been pro­ <lb/>
            moted along with him and are in power, use great plainness <lb/>
            of speech, towards him and among themselves, finding fault with <lb/>
            what is done,-such at least, as are of a more manly spirit. <lb/>
            Aye, probably so. The tyrant, therefore, if he means to govern, <lb/>
            must cut off all these, till he leave no one, either friend or foe, <lb/>
            worth anything. It is plain. He must carefully notice them, <lb/>
            -who is courageous, who is magnanimous, who wise, who rich ; <lb/>
            and in this manner is he happy, that, willing or unwilling, he <lb/>
            is under a necessity of being an enemy to all like these; and <lb/>
            to form plots against them, till he has purged the state. A <lb/>
            fine purging indeed ! said he. Yes, said I, the reverse of <lb/>
            what the physicians do with regard to animal bodies; for they <lb/>
            take away the worst and leave the best; but he does the con­ <lb/>
            trary. Because it seems, said he, if he is to govern, he must <lb/>
            necessarily do so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—By a blessed necessity, then truly, is he <lb/>
            bound, said I; which compels him either to live with a <lb/>
            depraved multitude, — hated by them too, or not live at <lb/>
            all. In such necessity he is, he replied. And the more he is <lb/>
            hated by the citizens whilst he does these things, will he not <lb/>
            so much the more require a greater number of guards, and <lb/>
            those more faithful ? It is impossible he should not. Who <lb/>
            then are the faithful, and whence shall he procure them ? <lb/>
            Many, said he, will come flying to him of their own accord, <lb/>
            if he give them pay. By the dog, said I, you seem again <lb/>
            to be talking of certain drones, both foreign and multiform. <lb/>
            Aye, you think right, replied he. But those of the state <lb/>
            itself,-would he not desire to have them also as guards ? <note type="footnote"> s </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. C 19. </note> <lb/>
            How? After he has taken away the slaves from the citi­ <lb/>
            zens, would he not give them their liberty, and make of them <lb/>
            guards about his person ? By all means, said lie ; for these <lb/>
            are the most faithful to him. What a blessed possession of <lb/>
            the tyrants, said I, is this which you mention, if he employ <lb/>
            such friends and faithful men, after having destroyed the <lb/>
            former ones! But at any rate, said he, such he surely does <lb/>
            employ. And then his companions, said I, admire him, and <lb/>
            the young citizens flock around him : but those that are <lb/>
            respectable men both hate and By from him. Of course they <lb/>
            would. It is not without reason, then, said I, that tragedy <lb/>
            is generally thought a wise thing, and that Euripides is <lb/>
            thought to excel in it. Why ? Because he uttered this, the <lb/>
            result of deep reflection, that tyrants are wise, by intercourse <lb/>
            with the wise ;-and he plainly said, those were wise with <lb/>
            whom they hold converse. And he commends tyranny too, <lb/>
            said he, as some divine thing, and says a great deal else about <lb/>
            it, as do the other poets. Those composers then of tragedy, <lb/>
            said I, as they are wise, will forgive both ourselves and others <lb/>
            who establish governments analogous to our own, for not <lb/>
            admitting them into our republic, as being panegyrists of <lb/>
            tyranny. Methinks, said he, such of them, at least, as are <lb/>
            well mannered, will forgive us. But they will go about <lb/>
            through other states, methinks, drawing together the crowds, <lb/>
            and put to sale their fine, magnificent, and persuasive words, <lb/>
            and so draw over governments to tyrannies and democracies. <lb/>
            Just so. And do they not further receive rewards and are <lb/>
            specially honoured, first by tyrants, as is natural, and next by <lb/>
            a democracy; but the higher they advance in the forms of <lb/>
            government, the more does honour forsake them, disabled as <lb/>
            it were by an asthma from pursuing its progress. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—Thus far, said I, have we digressed: and <lb/>
            now let us go back and talk about. the army of the tyrant, <lb/>
            beautiful as it is numerous, multiform, and ever the same,­ <lb/>
            how it is to be maintained. It is plain, said he, that whatever <lb/>
            sacred things there be in the state, these they will despoil, and <lb/>
            make the sale-proceeds therefrom to be such from time to <lb/>
            time as to cause the commons to pay lighter taxes. But <lb/>
            when these fail, what will they do ? It is plain, said he, <lb/>
            that he and his boon-companions, and associates, male and <lb/>
            female, will be maintained out of his paternal inheritance. <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="margin"> E. VIII. C. 19.] </note> <lb/>
            I understand, said I:—the party that made the tyrant is <lb/>
            to maintain him and his companions. Surely it must be so, <lb/>
            replied he. How, say you ? replied I:—if the people were <lb/>
            to be enraged, and say, that it is not just for a son arrived at <lb/>
            mature age to be maintained by the father, but on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, the father by the son, and that be did not beget and <lb/>
            bring him up for this purpose, to be himself a slave to his <lb/>
            slaves after they have grown up, and to maintain him and <lb/>
            his slaves with the rest of the riotous crew,*—but rather that <lb/>
            under his auspices he might be liberated from the rich in the <lb/>
            the state, [who are also called the good and worthy] :-and <lb/>
            now he orders him and his companions to leave the state as a <lb/>
            father drives from home his son and his rackety boon-fellows. <lb/>
            By Zeus, then, the people, said he, such as they are, will <lb/>
            know what sort of a creature they have begotten, embraced, <lb/>
            and nurtured, and that being themselves the weaker party, <lb/>
            they are still trying to drive out the stronger. How say you, <lb/>
            replied I;—will the tyrant dare to offer violence to his <lb/>
            father, and actually strike him if he will not yield? Yes, <lb/>
            said be, for he has stripped him of his armour. The tyrant, <lb/>
            said I, you call a parricide and a hard-hearted nourisher of <lb/>
            old age; and this, as it seems, would be an acknowledged <lb/>
            tyranny; and, as the saying is,—the common people, flying <lb/>
            from the smoke of slavery among freemen, have fallen into <lb/>
            the slavish fire of despotism, and instead of excessive and <lb/>
            unreasonable liberty, they embrace the most rigorous and <lb/>
            bitterest captivity of actual slaves. Aye,—this is very <lb/>
            much the case, rejoined he. What then, said I, may it <lb/>
            not be concluded with due consideration, that we have shown <lb/>
            in sufficient detail how tyranny arises out of democracy, <lb/>
            and its nature also, when it does arise ? Quite sufficiently, of <lb/>
            course, replied he. <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυγκλύδων ἄλλων</foreign>. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξύγκλυς</foreign> means the vilest and <lb/>

          <p>In the ninth book the discussion of tyranny is concluded with a view of <lb/>
            its origin and nature in the individual man, who, when thus affected, is <lb/>
            given up to all kinds of disordered passions that effectually exclude him <lb/>
            from all chance of happiness. Hence is it, that, as good and healthy <lb/>
            monarchical government is pre-eminently conducive to the highest hap­ <lb/>
            piness of the citizens,-so also tyranny is unfailingly productive of <lb/>
            the most intense and general misery. This is proved also from an <lb/>
            analysis of the mental faculties, and a pretty full account is here given <lb/>
            of the desires, pleasures, and indulgences by which they are affected, <lb/>
            and which must be kept in constant subjection by the dominance of <lb/>
            reason.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—We have yet, said I, to consider the tyrannical <lb/>
            man himself, how he arises out of the democratic,-and, when <lb/>
            he does arise, what is his nature, and what kind of life he <lb/>
            leads, whether wretched or happy. Yes, we have, said he. <lb/>
            Know you, said I, what I still want ? What ? We do not <lb/>
            seem to have sufficiently distinguished as regards the desires; <lb/>
            what is their nature and amount; and how many; and while <lb/>
            there is any defect in this, the inquiry we make will not be <lb/>
            very clear. Is it not good time for that yet ? I wish to know <lb/>
            about them ;—for it is this. Of pleasures and desires that <lb/>
            are not necessary, some seem to me contrary to law,—which <lb/>
            indeed seem engendered in all men :-though owing to the <lb/>
            correction of the laws, and of improved desires aided by <lb/>
            reason, they either forsake some men altogether, or are less <lb/>
            numerous and feeble, while in others they are more powerful <lb/>
            and more numerous. Will you inform me what these are ? <lb/>
            said he. Such, said I, as are excited in sleep, when the <lb/>
            rest of the soul—which is rational, mild, and its governing <lb/>
            principle, is asleep, and when that part which is savage and <lb/>
            rude, being sated with food and drink, frisks about, drives <lb/>
            away sleep, and seeks to go and accomplish its practices.;- <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            in such an one, you know, it dares to do everything, because <lb/>
            it is loosed and disengaged from all modesty and prudence: <lb/>
            for, if it pleases, it scruples not at the embraces, even of a <lb/>
            mother, or any one else, whether gods, men, or beasts ; nor to <lb/>
            commit murder, nor abstain from any sort of meat,-and in <lb/>
            one word, it is wanting neither in folly nor shamelessness. <lb/>
            You speak most truly, replied he. But when a man is in <lb/>
            good health, methinks, and lives temperately, and goes to <lb/>
            sleep, after exciting his reason, and feasting it with noble <lb/>
            reasonings and investigations, having thus attained to an <lb/>
            internal harmony, and given up the appetites neither to want <lb/>
            nor repletion, that they may be at rest, and not disturb that <lb/>
            part which is best, either by joy or grief, but suffer it by itself <lb/>
            alone without interruption to inquire and long to apprehend <lb/>
            what it knows not,--either something of what has existed, or <lb/>
            now exists, or will exist hereafter; and so also, having soothed <lb/>
            the spirited part of the soul, and not allowed it to be hurried <lb/>
            into transports of anger, or to fall asleep with agitated passion ; <lb/>
            -but after having quieted these two parts of the soul, and <lb/>
            roused to action that third part, in which wisdom dwells, he <lb/>
            will thus take his rest;—you know, that by such an one the <lb/>
            truth is best apprehended, and the visions of his dreams are <lb/>
            then least of all portrayed contrary to the law. I am quite <lb/>
            of this opinion, said he. We have digressed indeed a little <lb/>
            too far in talking of these things ;-but what we want to be <lb/>
            known is this, that in every one resides a certain species of <lb/>
            desires that are terrible, savage, and irregular, even in some <lb/>
            that we deem ever so moderate :--and this indeed becomes <lb/>
            manifest in sleep.-Now consider, if I seem to be speaking to <lb/>
            the purpose, and whether you agree with me. Aye, indeed, <lb/>
            I do.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—As for the people's man then, recollect how we <lb/>
            described him, as being brought up somehow from infancy <lb/>
            under a parsimonious father, who valued avaricious desires <lb/>
            only; and despised all such as were unnecessary, arising <lb/>
            only out of a love of amusement and finery.* Was he not ? <lb/>
            Yes. But getting acquainted with the more refined, who <lb/>
            are full of the desires just mentioned, running into all <lb/>
            sorts of insolence, and imbibing their manners through detes­ <note type="footnote"> * This refers to the description of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημοκρατικὸς</foreign> in book viii. <lb/>
            ch. 12. </note> <pb n="262"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 2 </note> <lb/>
            tation of his father's parsimony;—and yet having a better <lb/>
            natural temper than his corrupters, and being drawn opposite <lb/>
            ways, he at length settles down into a mode of life equi­ <lb/>
            distant from either, and so in his opinion, participating <lb/>
            moderately of each, leads a life neither illiberal nor lawless, <lb/>
            after having thus become a democrat instead of an oli­ <lb/>
            garchist. Yes,—this, said he, was and is our opinion of <lb/>
            such an one. Suppose now again, that, when such an one has <lb/>
            become old, he has a young son educated according to his <lb/>
            own habits. I suppose it. And suppose, too, that the same <lb/>
            happens to him as to his father;—that he is drawn into all <lb/>
            lawlessness, which his seducers call all freedom; and that his <lb/>
            father and his domestics are aiding those intermediate desires; <lb/>
            -and that others also lend their assistance (when these <lb/>
            clever conjurers and tyrant-makers have no hopes of other­ <lb/>
            wise keeping youth in their power), and so contrive to excite <lb/>
            in him a certain love which is to preside over the passive <lb/>
            desires, which distribute what may be at hand to all the rest, <lb/>
            —a certain large-winged drone ;*—or what else think yon, <lb/>
            is that kind of love ? For my part, said he, I think, it is no <lb/>
            other than this. Well,—when the rest of the desires buzz <lb/>
            about him, full of their odours and perfumes, and crowns <lb/>
            and wines, and the dissolute pleasures belonging to such <lb/>
            associations,-and at last by their increase and nurture, add <lb/>
            . to the drone a sting of desire, then truly he is sentinelled <lb/>
            by madness as a life-guard, and this president of the soul <lb/>
            becomes frenzied ; and even should he find in himself any <lb/>
            opinions or desires which are deemed good and modest, he <lb/>
            kills them and pushes them from him, till he has ridded him­ <lb/>
            self of temperance and has become brimful of madness. You <lb/>
            perfectly describe, said he, the formation of a tyrannical man <lb/>
            Is it not for some such reason as this, said I, that love has of <lb/>
            old been said to be a tyrant? It seems so, replied he. Well, <lb/>
            my friend, said I, and is not a drunken man likewise some­ <lb/>
            what of a tyrannical spirit ? He is indeed. And besides <lb/>
            that, he that is mad and disturbed in his mind, undertakes <lb/>
            and hopes to be able to govern not only men, but the gods <lb/>
            as well. Entirely so, said he. The tyrannical character <figure type="illustration">

              then, happy man ! becomes so in full perfection, when either <lb/>
              by temper or pursuits, or both, he becomes drunken and given <lb/>
              up to love and melancholy. Perfectly so, indeed.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Such an one, it seems, then, is thus engendered, <lb/>
            buthow does he pass his life?-Just as they say in their <lb/>
            games, replied he;—“ this you shall tell me too." I will tell <lb/>
            you then, said I;—for I think, that in the next place, they <lb/>
            have feastings and revellings and banquetings and mistresses, <lb/>
            and all such things as may be expected among those with whom <lb/>
            dwells the tyrant love, and governing all in the soul. Neces­ <lb/>
            sarily so, said he. Will there not then, each day and night, <lb/>
            blossom forth numerous fierce desires, eagerly in want of <lb/>
            many things ? Many indeed. And if they get any supplies <lb/>
            [of their wishes,] these are soon spent ? Of course. And <lb/>
            after this there are borrowings and forfeitures of property ? * <lb/>
            Of course. And when everything fails them, must it not <lb/>
            follow, that while the numerous and powerful desires nestled <lb/>
            in the mind, will on the one hand raise a clamour, the men, <lb/>
            on the other hand, who are driven and goaded by the rest of <lb/>
            the passions, but especially by love itself, which commands <lb/>
            all the others as its life-guards, will rage with phrensy, and <lb/>
            seek after peoples property, to see if they can plunder it <lb/>
            either by fraud or violence ? Quite so, said he. Of neces­ <lb/>
            sity, then, they must either plunder from all quarters, or else <lb/>
            be hampered with great pain and anguish. Necessarily so. <lb/>
            And as in such a man his new pleasures are greater than <lb/>
            those he had before, and depreciate the value of the others, <lb/>
            will he not similarly deem it right for himself, however young, <lb/>
            to have more than his father and mother, and to take away <lb/>
            from them, when he has spent his own portion, applying to <lb/>
            his own use what belongs to his parents ? Of course he will, <lb/>
            replied he. And if they will not give it up to him, will he <lb/>
            not at first try to pilfer or defraud his parents? By all <lb/>
            means. And should he be unable to do this, he will next <lb/>
            use rapine and violence ? I think so, replied he. But sup­ <lb/>
            posing, my fine fellow, that the old man and woman fall out <lb/>
            and fight, will he not be very cautious and wary of doing <lb/>
            what is tyrannical ? I, for my part, said he, am not quite sure <lb/>
            about the safety of such a person's parents. But by Zeus, <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δανεισμοὶ</foreign> icai <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς οὐσίας παραιρέσεις</foreign>, lit. the borrowing of <lb/>

            Adimantus, think you, that for the sake of a newly beloved <lb/>
            and unnecessary mistress, such a person would abandon his <lb/>
            long loved and closely connected mother; or for the sake of <lb/>
            a youth newly loved and with whom he has no ties, give up <lb/>
            to stripes his withered but time-honoured father, and the most <lb/>
            ancient of all his friends, suffering them to be the slaves of <lb/>
            these others, by bringing them into the same house ? Yes, <lb/>
            by Zeus, I do, said he. It seems indeed, said I, a vastly <lb/>
            blessed thing to be the father of a tyrannical son ! Not at <lb/>
            all so, said he. But what, when the father and mother's <lb/>
            riches are beginning to fail such an one, and when the great <lb/>
            swarm of pleasures has been already collected within him, <lb/>
            , will he not be the first to scale the wall of some house, or <lb/>
            strip some one of his coat late at night, and after that rifle <lb/>
            some temple ?-And in all these acts, as respects the opinions <lb/>
            which he formerly held from boyhood, and which guided his <lb/>
            decisions concerning good and evil, the passions, that are <lb/>
            newly loosed from slavery and placed as the body-guards of <lb/>
            Love, will prevail therewith;—and these indeed had only <lb/>
            just been loosed from their dreamy sleep, when he was him­ <lb/>
            self still under the law and governed by his father, as under <lb/>
            a democracy :-yet afterwards, when tyrannized over by love, <lb/>
            such as he rarely was when in his dreams, he will ever be <lb/>
            when awake, nor will he abstain from slaughter, however <lb/>
            horrid, or food, or any deed whatever :-but that tyrant love <lb/>
            within him, living without restraint of law or government, <lb/>
            as if it were sole monarch, will lead on the man it possesses, <lb/>
            as it would a state, to every act of madness, whereby he can <lb/>
            support himself and the mob of passions about him, which <lb/>
            partly entering from without, through evil company, and <lb/>
            partly through the manners of the man and his associates, <lb/>
            have been unchained. and set at liberty: now is not this the <lb/>
            life of such an one ? It is this truly, said be. And if, said I, <lb/>
            there be, only a few such in the state, and the rest of the people <lb/>
            are sober, they go out and serve as guards to other tyrants, or <lb/>
            assist them for hire in case of war: but remain at home <lb/>
            during peace and quiet, giving rise in the state to a great many <lb/>
            minor evils. What mean you ? Such as these : they steal, <lb/>
            break open houses, cut purses, strip people of their clothes, <lb/>
            rifle temples, make people slaves, and, where they can speak, <lb/>
            sometimes turn false informers, give false testimony, and take <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            bribes.* These then you call minor mischiefs, said he,—if <lb/>
            there be but a few such persons. What is small, said I, is <lb/>
            small in comparison to the great; and all these things with <lb/>
            regard to the tyrant, when compared with the wickedness <lb/>
            and misery of the state, do not, as the saying is, come near <lb/>
            the mark ; for when the state has many such, and others <lb/>
            for their companions, and when they perceive their own <lb/>
            number, then these are the persons who, led by the people's <lb/>
            folly, elevate to the tyranny the man among them who has <lb/>
            within his soul most of the tyrant, and in the greatest <lb/>
            strength. Probably so, indeed, said he; for he will be most <lb/>
            suited for a tyrant. Of course, if they voluntarily submit to <lb/>
            him:—but if the state will not allow him to use the violence <lb/>
            towards them, with which he formerly treated his father and <lb/>
            mother, so he will now again, if he can, chastise his country by <lb/>
            bringing in his youthful associates, and enslaving under them, <lb/>
            as the Cretans say, his once dear mother-land and father­ <lb/>
            land :-and this will of course be the issue of such a man's <lb/>
            desire. Entirely so, said he. Do not these then behave thus <lb/>
            in private life, said I;—even before becoming rulers; first <lb/>
            with the company they keep, either associating with their <lb/>
            own flatterers and those who are ready to supply their every <lb/>
            want; or if they ask one for anything, falling down as <lb/>
            suppliants, and deigning to assume the disguise of friends; <lb/>
            but after they have gained their own purposes, acting as foes? <lb/>
            Quite so. Throughout life then they live as real friends to <lb/>
            no one whatever, but always either as masters or slaves to <lb/>
            another ;-because for liberty and true friendship the tyrant's <lb/>
            nature has no relish whatever. Quite so. May we not <lb/>
            rightly call these men faithless? Of course. And as unjust, <lb/>
            moreover, as they possibly can be, if indeed we, in what we <lb/>
            said before were rightly agreed as to the nature of justice ? <lb/>
            Aye, we were quite right, said he. Let us then give a sum­ <lb/>
            mary account, said I, of this worst man of ours; he is the <lb/>
            same kind of person, awake perhaps, whom we just described <lb/>
            as asleep. Entirely so. And does not that man become such, <lb/>
            who with a tyrannical nature holds the sovereign sway, <lb/>
            and the longer he lives in tyrant-life become so more and <lb/>
            more ? Necessarily so, replied Glaucon, taking up the dis­ <lb/>
            course. <note type="footnote"> * These grave crimes are almost similarly enumerated in the Gorgias, <lb/>
            p. 508 e, and also by Xenophon, Mem. i. ch. 2, s. 62. </note></p><pb n="266"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 4. </note> CHAP. IV.—And will not the man, said I, who appears <lb/>
            the most wicked, appear likewise the most wretched ; and will <lb/>
            not he who holds the tyranny longest and exercises it most, be <lb/>
            really such in the greatest measure and for the longest time ? <lb/>
            but many as are men, so many are their minds. Of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity, said he, these things must be so. And would not the <lb/>
            tyrant man, said I, as closely resemble a state under tyranny, <lb/>
            at the democratic man resembles the state under democracy, <lb/>
            and so likewise as respects the others ? Of course. As state <lb/>
            then is to state with regard to virtue and happiness, so surely <lb/>
            will man be to man likewise ? Of course. What then is <lb/>
            the state governed by a tyrant as compared with one under <lb/>
            a kingly government,—such as we first described ? The exact <lb/>
            contrary, said he; for the one is best, and the other the <lb/>
            worst. I will not ask, said I, which you mean, for that is <lb/>
            plain; but do you judge is it thus or otherwise, that you <lb/>
            judge of their happiness and misery ?-and let us not be <lb/>
            struck with admiration when considering the tyrant himself, <lb/>
            or the few about him; but let us, as we ought, enter into the <lb/>
            whole state, and declare our opinion, after going through and <lb/>
            viewing every part. You propose what is right, said he:­ <lb/>
            and it is clear to all that no state is more wretched than one <lb/>
            under tyranny, and none more happy than that under regal <lb/>
            power. Well then, said I, in proposing these same things <lb/>
            with respect to individual men, should I rightly propose, if I <lb/>
            accounted that man a suitable judge of them, who can by in­ <lb/>
            tellectual power penetrate into and inspect a man's disposi­ <lb/>
            tion, and is not, as a child looking at exteriors, astounded <lb/>
            by the pomp, which tyrants exhibit to those without, but has <lb/>
            the power of looking properly through him? If then I <lb/>
            thought that we should all listen to the man, who from <lb/>
            having dwelt with him in the same house, and been joined in <lb/>
            his family transactions, is able to judge how he behaves to <lb/>
            each of his domestics, [in which most especially a man appears <lb/>
            stripped of his actor's finery,] and so also in public dangers; <lb/>
            and if when he has observed all this, I were to bid him de­ <lb/>
            clare how the tyrant stands, as regards happiness and misery, <lb/>
            in comparison with others.* You would be quite right in <note type="footnote"> * Euripides, Jon. v. 621—4, has a similar sentiment beautifully ex­ <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 5.1 </note> <lb/>
              proposing this, observed he. Are you willing then, said I, <lb/>
              that we should set up to be of the number of those who are <lb/>
              able to judge, and who have already fallen in with such cha­ <lb/>
              racters, so that we may have some one to answer our questions ? <lb/>
              By all means.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Come then, said I, thus consider it:—call to <lb/>
            mind the mutual resemblance of the state and individual <lb/>
            man ; and thus, considering each by turns, describe to us the <lb/>
            passions of each. What passions ? said he. To begin first, <lb/>
            said I, with the state ;-do you call the one under tyranny, <lb/>
            free or enslaved ? Enslaved, said he, in the greatest degree <lb/>
            possible. And moreover, you see in it some who are mas­ <lb/>
            ters and freemen ? I see some indeed, said he, but exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly few :-but the greatest and best part therein generally <lb/>
            is shamefully and wretchedly enslaved. If then, said I, the <lb/>
            individual man resembles the state, will he not necessarily <lb/>
            be placed under like circumstances, and his soul be filled with <lb/>
            slavery and illiberality, and those parts of it too be enslaved <lb/>
            which were the most noble, and that small part of it too <lb/>
            assume the mastery, which is the most wicked and insane of <lb/>
            all ? Quite so, said he. What then,-will you say, that such <lb/>
            a soul is slavish or free ? Slavish perhaps, I say. But is <lb/>
            not the state that is slavish, and governed by tyranny, least <lb/>
            of all able to do what it likes? Aye,—quite so. And <lb/>
            speaking of a soul generally, will it not, when governed by <lb/>
            tyranny, least of all do what it likes,-but being constantly <lb/>
            hurried by some stinging passion, be full of tumult and in­ <lb/>
            constancy? Of course it must be so. But will the state <lb/>
            governed by tyranny be necessarily rich or poor? Poor. <lb/>
            And must a soul under a tyranny then be ever penurious <lb/>
            and insatiable ? Just so, said he. But what,-must not <lb/>
            such a state and such an individual be necessarily full of <lb/>
            fear ? It must be so. As for lamentations, and groans, and <lb/>
            weepings, and torments, think you that you would find more <lb/>
            in any other kind of state ? By no means. And in a man, <lb/>
            think you that such things exist in any one to a greater ex­ <lb/>
            tent than in this tyrannical one who is maddened by his <lb/>
            desires and lusts ? How can they ? said he. It is with <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig51.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="268"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
              reference, I suppose, then to all these, and other such like <lb/>
              things, that you have deemed this the most wretched of all <lb/>
              states ? Was I not right then in doing so ? said he. Certainly, <lb/>
              said I. But what say you again as respects the tyrannical man, <lb/>
              with regard to these same things? That he is by far, said he, <lb/>
              the most wretched of all in the world. This, replied I, you are <lb/>
              not quite correct in saying. How? said he. He is not as <lb/>
              yet, methinks, said I, as unhappy as he can be. But who is so? <lb/>
              The following person probably you will deem even yet more <lb/>
              miserable than the other. Which ? That man, said I, who <lb/>
              being naturally tyrannical, remains not in private life, but is <lb/>
              unfortunate enough to be induced by his destiny to become a <lb/>
              tyrant. From what has been formerly observed, said he, <lb/>
              I presume that what you say is true. Yes, said I;—but we <lb/>
              ought not merely to conjecture about matters so important as <lb/>
              these, but to sift them to the bottom, in the way we are now <lb/>
              about to do; * for most momentous is the inquiry about a <lb/>
              good life and a bad one. Quite right, said he. Consider, <lb/>
              then, whether there be anything in what I say; for, in con­ <lb/>
              sidering this question, it is my opinion that we ought to per­ <lb/>
              ceive it from what follows. From what? From every indi­ <lb/>
              vidual private man, among such as are rich, and possess many <lb/>
              slaves; for these have at least this resemblance to tyrants, that <lb/>
              they rule over many,-the difference being in the multitude <lb/>
              of the latter. Aye,—there is some difference. Are you sure <lb/>
              then that these live securely, without dread of their domestics ? <lb/>
              Aye,—for what should they fear? Nothing, said I; but do <lb/>
              you understand the reason ? Yes ;-because the whole state <lb/>
              assists each particular individual. You say right, replied I: <lb/>
              -but what,—if one of the gods were to take a man who had <lb/>
              fifty slaves or upwards out of the state,-both himself, his <lb/>
              wife, and children,-and set them down in a desert with the <lb/>
              rest of his property, and his domestics, where no freemen <lb/>
              would be likely to lend him aid,-what kind of fear, think <lb/>
              you, he would entertain about himself, his children, and his <lb/>
              wife, of being destroyed by the domestics ? The greatest <lb/>
              possible, methinks, replied he. Would he not be obliged to <lb/>
              flatter some of his very slaves and make them many promises, <lb/>
              and set them at liberty without need, and so appear to be <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> B. IX. c. 6.] </note> <lb/>
              himself the flatterer of servants ? He must of course be com­ <lb/>
              pelled to do so, said he, or else be destroyed. But what, said <lb/>
              I;—if the god were to place round him many other neigh­ <lb/>
              bours who could not endure for any one to pretend to lord <lb/>
              it over another,-and, wherever they find such an one, <lb/>
              punished him with extreme rigour ? Methinks, he would be <lb/>
              still more distressed, said he, when thus beset by a whole <lb/>
              host of foes. And is not the tyrant bound in such a prison- <lb/>
              house, if he be of such disposition as we have described,­ <lb/>
              full of many and all kinds of aversions and desires; and <lb/>
              whilst he is most eager in his soul, he alone of all in the <lb/>
              state is not allowed to go abroad, or to see what others love <lb/>
              to see, but huddles himself at home, and lives mostly as a <lb/>
              woman, envying the other citizens, whenever they travel <lb/>
              abroad, and see what is good ? Wholly so, of course, re­ <lb/>
              plied he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Well, then, through such evils as these, <lb/>
            does not the man reap still more, who, being ill-governed <lb/>
            within himself, [a person whom you just now deemed to be <lb/>
            the most of all wretched,] remains not in private station, but <lb/>
            through some fortune or other is obliged to act the tyrant, <lb/>
            and, though unable to control himself, attempts to govern <lb/>
            others, as if with a body diseased, and unable to support itself, <lb/>
            one were compelled to live not in a state of privacy, but in <lb/>
            wrestling and fighting against other bodies ? What you say, <lb/>
            Socrates, replied he, is altogether most probable and true. <lb/>
            Is not this condition, then, dear Glaucon, said I, altogether <lb/>
            wretched ; and does not the tyrant live more wretchedly <lb/>
            even than the man that you conceive to live the most <lb/>
            wretchedly of all ? Quite so, replied he. True is it, then, <lb/>
            though one may fancy otherwise, that the really tyrannical <lb/>
            man is really a slave to the greatest flatteries and slaveries, and <lb/>
            a flatterer of the most abandoned men ; and without ever in <lb/>
            the smallest degree satisfying his desires, he is of all men <lb/>
            most in want of most things, and poor indeed, if one could <lb/>
            but look into his whole soul, and full of fear throughout life, <lb/>
            filled with terrors and griefs,—if, indeed, he resembles the <lb/>
            constitution of the state he rules :-and he does resemble it ; <lb/>
            does he not ? Extremely, said he.</p>
          <p>And in addition to this, shall we not ascribe also to the <lb/>
            tyrant-man what we formerly mentioned that he must ne- <pb n="270"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 7. </note> <lb/>
            cessarily be, and by governing become increasingly, envious, <lb/>
            faithless, unjust, unfriendly, impious,-the entertainer and <lb/>
            encourager of all vice; and from all these causes be specially <lb/>
            happy himself, and render all about him happy likewise ? <lb/>
            No one of understanding will, said he, contradict you. Come, <lb/>
            then, said I, as a judge who is examining the whole case ; <lb/>
            so tell me,—who, in your opinion, is first in happiness, and <lb/>
            who second, and the rest in order, five in all; namely, the <lb/>
            regal, the timocratic, the oligarchal, the democratic, and the <lb/>
            tyrannic. Easy, indeed, is this decision, said he :-for as <lb/>
            they came before us, I have judged of them as public actors, <lb/>
            by their virtue and vice,-happiness and its contrary. Shall <lb/>
            we then hire ourselves a herald ? said I; or shall I myself <lb/>
            declare, that the son of Ariston has judged the best and <lb/>
            justest man to be the happiest, [and that this is the man who <lb/>
            is fittest to be as king, and as king too over himself;] and <lb/>
            that the worst and the most unjust is the most wretched; and <lb/>
            that he is the most tyrannical, who in the greatest degree <lb/>
            tyrannizes over himself and the state ? So let it be pro­ <lb/>
            nounced by you, said he. Must I, then, state in addition, <lb/>
            said I, whether they be unknown to be such or not, to all <lb/>
            men, and the gods too ? Pray do so, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Well then, said I;—this would seem to be one <lb/>
            of our proofs; and this, if you please, must be the second. <lb/>
            Which is this ? Since the soul, said I, of every individual is <lb/>
            divided into three parts, just as we divided our state, it will, <lb/>
            in my opinion, admit of a second illustration. What is that ? <lb/>
            It is this :-of the parts of the soul there appear to me to be <lb/>
            three pleasures, one peculiar to each, with desires and govern­ <lb/>
            ments in like manner. How say you ? replied he. One part <lb/>
            we say, by which a man learns, another by which he is <lb/>
            roused to spirit; but as for the third, it is so multiform, that <lb/>
            we cannot express it by any one word peculiar to itself, but <lb/>
            have named it from the greatest and most impetuous part <lb/>
            thereof; calling it the desiderative, from the impetuosity of <lb/>
            the desires for eating and drinking, and sexual pleasures, and <lb/>
            such-like enjoyments, and calling it money-loving also, as it is <lb/>
            through wealth most especially that such desires are accom­ <lb/>
            plished. And we said rightly, replied he. Well, then, if we <lb/>
            are to call it the pleasure and delight in gain, shall we not do <lb/>
            best to reduce it under one head in our discourse, so that <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            we may have something quite clear to ourselves, when we <lb/>
            are speaking of this part of the soul ? And in calling it <lb/>
            money-loving, and profit-loving, shall we not be giving it its <lb/>
            proper term ? Yes, I think so, said he. But what; do not <lb/>
            we say, that the spirited principle ought to be wholly im­ <lb/>
            pelled to superiority, victory, and applause ? Especially so. <lb/>
            If, then, we term it the contentious and ambitious, shall we <lb/>
            not accurately express it? Most accurately. But [as regards <lb/>
            that part of the soul] by which we gain knowledge, it is <lb/>
            clear to every one, that it is wholly intent on always know­ <lb/>
            ing the truth, wherever it may be; and as to wealth and <lb/>
            glory, least of all does it care for these. Just so. By term­ <lb/>
            ing it, then, the love of learning, and philosophy, we shall be <lb/>
            defining it correctly ? Of course. And in these people's <lb/>
            souls, said I, one governs in some, and the other in others, <lb/>
            as it happens? Just so, said he. This was why we said <lb/>
            then, that of men also there were three original species; the <lb/>
            philosophic, the ambitious, and the avaricious ? Surely so. <lb/>
            And likewise three species of pleasures,—corresponding to <lb/>
            each of the others ? Yes, certainly. You know, then, said <lb/>
            I, that if you were to ask these three men, by turns, which <lb/>
            of these lives is the pleasantest, each would most commend <lb/>
            his own ; and the money-maker would say, that, compared <lb/>
            with the pleasures of acquiring wealth, those arising from <lb/>
            honour, or learning, are of no value, unless they bring in <lb/>
            money? True, said he. And what says the ambitious man ? <lb/>
            said I: docs not he deem the pleasure arising from money- <lb/>
            making a sort of burden ;-and again, that which arises from <lb/>
            learning, unless it bring him honour, mere smoke and trifling ? <lb/>
            So it is, said he. And as for the philosopher, said I, we may <lb/>
            suppose that he deems all other pleasures in comparison with <lb/>
            that of knowing the nature of truth as a mere nothing, and <lb/>
            that, while constantly employed in learning something of this <lb/>
            kind, he is not far off from pleasure,-and calls them really <lb/>
            necessary, because he wanted none else, except when com­ <lb/>
            pelled by necessity.* This, said he, you should well know. <note type="footnote"> * The real spiritual nature of this truth is beautifully expressed in the </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p><note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 8. </note> CHAP. VIII.—When these several lives then, said I, and <lb/>
            the pleasures peculiar to each, are at variance with each other, <lb/>
            not with reference to a mode of life, worthier or more base, <lb/>
            worse or better,-but merely with reference to living more <lb/>
            pleasantly or painfully;—how can we know which of the <lb/>
            two speaks most in accordance with truth ? I am not, said <lb/>
            he, quite able to tell. But consider it thus :-by what crite­ <lb/>
            rion ought we to judge about matters rightly presented for <lb/>
            our judgment ;-is it not by experience, prudence, and rea­ <lb/>
            son,—or can we find any better criterion than these ? How <lb/>
            can we ? said he. Consider now ;-of the three men, who is <lb/>
            the most experienced in all the pleasures ?-Think you that <lb/>
            the money-loving man, by learning the real nature of truth, <lb/>
            gains more experience in the pleasure arising from know­ <lb/>
            ledge, than the philosopher has in that resulting from the <lb/>
            acquisition of wealth ? There is a great difference, said he : <lb/>
            for the philosopher must necessarily from early childhood <lb/>
            taste the other pleasures ; but what it is to know real beings, <lb/>
            and how sweet is its pleasure, the money-getting man need <lb/>
            not taste, or become experienced therein;—nay, indeed, it is <lb/>
            no easy matter, even should he earnestly try to accomplish <lb/>
            it. The philosopher then, said I, far surpasses the money- <lb/>
            getting man, at least in experience of both the pleasures. <lb/>
            Far indeed. But what as regards the ambitious man—has <lb/>
            he any more experience in the pleasure arising from honour, <lb/>
            than the philosopher in that which arises from the exercise <lb/>
            of intellect ? Honour, indeed, said he, attends them all, if <lb/>
            each obtains his object: for the rich man is honoured by <lb/>
            many, and so is the brave, and the wise; so all of them have <lb/>
            experience, as to the kind of pleasure attending honour; <lb/>
            but in the contemplation of being itself, as to the pleasure <lb/>
            which it gives, it is impossible for any other than the <lb/>
            philosopher to have tasted it. On the ground of expe­ <lb/>
            rience then, said I, he of all men is the best judge. By <lb/>
            far. And surely, including prudence also, he alone has <lb/>
            experience. Of course. But the organ, by which these <lb/>
            pleasures must be judged, is not the organ of the money- <lb/>
            getter, nor of the ambitious man, but of the philosopher. <lb/>
            Which is that? We said somewhere, that they must be <lb/>
            judged of by reason,-did we not? Yes. But reasoning is <lb/>
            chiefly the organ of the philosopher ? Of course it is. If <pb n="273"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. c. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            then the things to be determined could be best determined <lb/>
            by riches and gain, what the money-getting man commended, <lb/>
            or despised, would necessarily be most agreeable to truth ? <lb/>
            Quite so. And if by honour, victory, and courage,-must it <lb/>
            not be as the ambitious and contentious man determined ? <lb/>
            It is evident. But since it is by experience, prudence, and <lb/>
            reason, it follows of course, said he, that what is praised by <lb/>
            the philosopher and the lover of reason must be the most <lb/>
            true.-Of the three pleasures, then, that which belongs to that <lb/>
            part of the soul by which we learn most is the most pleasant, <lb/>
            and that man in whom this part of us holds the chief sway lives <lb/>
            the pleasantest life. How can it be doubted ? said he :-for the <lb/>
            wise man, who has the supreme right to commend, commends <lb/>
            his own life. But which life, said I, does our judge pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the second, and which the second pleasure ? Plainly, <lb/>
            that of the warlike and ambitious man ; for this is nearer to <lb/>
            his own than that of the money-getter. And that of the <lb/>
            covetous, as it appears, is last of all ? Of course, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—These things then will succeed one another <lb/>
            in order; and the just man will twice prevail over the un­ <lb/>
            just :—the third victory now, as at the Olympic games, is <lb/>
            sacred to Olympian Zeus, the Saviour; for you must con­ <lb/>
            sider, that, with the exception of that of the wise man, the <lb/>
            pleasure of the others is by no means genuine nor pure, <lb/>
            but somehow shadowed over, as I think I have myself <lb/>
            heard from one of the wise men:—and this truly would be <lb/>
            the greatest and most complete downfal. Extremely so;— <lb/>
            but how mean you? I will thus trace it out, said I, whilst <lb/>
            in searching you answer my questions. Ask then, said he. <lb/>
            Tell me then, said I, do we not say that pain is contrary to <lb/>
            pleasure ? Quite so. And do we not say likewise, that to <lb/>
            feel neither pleasure nor pain is something? We say it is. <lb/>
            And that the state between both of these is a certain <lb/>
            tranquillity of the soul with reference to them ;-do you not <lb/>
            so understand it? Just so, he replied. Do you not remember, <lb/>
            said I, the speeches of the diseased, which they utter when <lb/>
            they are sick ? What are they ? That nothing is sweeter <lb/>
            than health, but that it escaped their notice before they <lb/>
            became sick, that it was the sweetest. I remember it, said <lb/>
            he. And are you not wont to hear those who are under <lb/>
            acute pain say, that there is nothing sweeter than a cessa- <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 9. </note> <lb/>
            tion from pain ? I do hear them. And you may perceive <lb/>
            the same thing in men, I think, when they are in other but <lb/>
            similar circumstances, where, if in pain, they extol a freedom <lb/>
            from pain and the tranquillity of such a state, as being <lb/>
            most sweet, though they do not extol that of feeling joy. <lb/>
            Because perhaps the latter, said he, becomes at that time <lb/>
            sweet and desirable,-namely, tranquillity. And when any <lb/>
            one ceases, said I, from feeling joy, the tranquillity of <lb/>
            pleasure will be painful. Perhaps so, said he. This tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, then, which we just now said was between the two, <lb/>
            will at times become both pain and pleasure. It seems <lb/>
            so. What,—is it possible, that what is neither of the two <lb/>
            should become both? I do not think so. And moreover, <lb/>
            when what is pleasant or painful is in the soul, both sensations <lb/>
            are a certain excitement; are they not ? Yes. But did not <lb/>
            that which is neither painful nor pleasant appear just now <lb/>
            to be tranquillity, and between these two ? It did appear <lb/>
            so. How is it right, then, to deem it sweet not to be in <lb/>
            pain, or painful not to enjoy pleasure ? It is by no means <lb/>
            right. In these cases, then, tranquillity is not really so, said <lb/>
            I; but it appears pleasant by comparison with the painful, <lb/>
            and painful compared with the pleasant; and there is no­ <lb/>
            thing genuine in these appearances as regards the truth of <lb/>
            pleasure, but a certain magical delusion. Aye,—just as our <lb/>
            argument proves, he replied. Consider the pleasures then, <lb/>
            said I, which do not arise from the cessation of pain, so as <lb/>
            not frequently during our discussion to hold the frequent <lb/>
            notion that these two naturally thus subsist; viz., that plea­ <lb/>
            sure is the cessation of pain, and pain the cessation of pleasure. <lb/>
            How, said he, and to what pleasures do you allude ? There <lb/>
            are many others, said I, particularly if you wish to consider the <lb/>
            pleasures that arise from smell; for these, without any pre­ <lb/>
            ceding pain, are on a sudden immensely great, and, when they <lb/>
            cease, they leave no pain behind them. Most true, said he. Let <lb/>
            us not then be persuaded that pure pleasure is the removal of <lb/>
            pain, or pain the removal of pleasure. No, we will not. But <lb/>
            yet, said I, those which extend through the body to the soul, <lb/>
            and which are called pleasures, the greatest part of them <lb/>
            almost, and the most considerable, are of this species,­ <lb/>
            certain cessations from pain? They are so. And are not <lb/>
            the preconceptions of pleasure and pain, which arise In <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 10.] </note> <lb/>
            the mind from their expectation, of the same kind ? Of the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Do you know then, said I, of what class they <lb/>
            are, and what they chiefly resemble? What? said he. Do <lb/>
            you conceive, said I, there is any such thing in nature as this, <lb/>
            the above, the below, and the middle ? I do. Do you think <lb/>
            then that any one, when brought from the below to the middle, <lb/>
            imagines anything else than that he is brought to the above; <lb/>
            and when he stands in the middle, and looks down whence <lb/>
            he was brought, will he imagine that he is anywhere else <lb/>
            than above, whilst yet he has not seen the true above ? By <lb/>
            Zeus, said he, I do not think that such an one will ima­ <lb/>
            gine otherwise. But if he should again, said I, be carried to <lb/>
            the below, he would conjecture he was carried to the below, <lb/>
            and conjecture rightly ? He would of course. Would he not <lb/>
            be thus affected from his want of experience in what is really <lb/>
            above, and in the middle, and below ? Plainly so. Would <lb/>
            you wonder then, that while men are inexperienced in the <lb/>
            truth, they have unsound opinions about many other things, <lb/>
            and that as to pleasure and pain, and what is between these, they <lb/>
            are likewise affected in the same manner; so that, even when <lb/>
            they are brought to what is painful, they conceive truly, and <lb/>
            are really pained ; but when from pain they are brought to the <lb/>
            middle, they strongly imagine that they have arrived at the <lb/>
            highest pitch of pleasure, in the same manner as those, who <lb/>
            along with the black colour look at the gray, through inex­ <lb/>
            perience of the white, and so are deceived ? and just so those <lb/>
            who consider pain along with the freedom from pain, are <lb/>
            deceived through inexperience of pleasure. By Zeus, said he, <lb/>
            I should not wonder, but much rather if it were not so. Con­ <lb/>
            eider the matter thus, said I; are not hunger and thirst, and <lb/>
            such-like things, certain emptinesses in the bodily habit ? Of <lb/>
            course. And are not ignorance and folly an emptiness in the <lb/>
            habit of the soul ? Quite so. And is not the one filled when it <lb/>
            receives food, and the other when it acquires intelligence ? <lb/>
            Surely. But which is the more real repletion, that of the <lb/>
            less, or the more truly real being? It is plain, that of the <lb/>
            more real. Which species, then, do you think, participate <lb/>
            most of a purer essence; those which partake of bread and <lb/>
            drink, and meat, and all such sort of nourishment; or that <lb/>
            species which partakes of true opinion and science, and intel- <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 10. </note> <lb/>
            ligence, and, in short, of all virtue?—And judge of it thus :— <lb/>
            That which is connected with what is always similar, and <lb/>
            immortal, and true, and is so of itself, and arises in what is <lb/>
            of the same character, think you that it has more of the <lb/>
            reality of being, than what is connected to what is never <lb/>
            similar and mortal, and is such itself, and is generated in a thing <lb/>
            of the same character ? Aye, said he, this differs greatly <lb/>
            from that which is always similar. Does then the essence of <lb/>
            that which is always similar participate more of essence than <lb/>
            of science ? By no means. But what as regards truth ? Nor <lb/>
            of this neither. If it participate less of truth, does it not <lb/>
            likewise do so of essence ? Of necessity. In short, then, do <lb/>
            not those species which relate to the care of the body partake <lb/>
            less of truth and essence, than those relating to the care of the <lb/>
            soul ? By far. And the body likewise less than the soul; do <lb/>
            you not think so ? I do. Is not that which is filled with more <lb/>
            real beings, and is itself a more real being, in reality more <lb/>
            truly filled than that which is filled with less real beings, and <lb/>
            is itself a less real being ? Of course it is. If then it be <lb/>
            pleasant to be filled with what is suitable to nature, that <lb/>
            which is in reality filled, and with more real being, must be <lb/>
            made both more really and more truly to enjoy true pleasure; <lb/>
            but that which participates of less real being, must be less truly <lb/>
            and solidly filled, and participates of a more uncertain and less <lb/>
            genuine pleasure. Most necessarily, said he. Such then as are <lb/>
            unacquainted with wisdom and virtue, and are always conver­ <lb/>
            sant in feastings and things of that kind, are carried, as it ap­ <lb/>
            pears, to the below, and back again to the middle ;-and there <lb/>
            they wander during life :-but as they never pass beyond this, <lb/>
            they do not look towards the true above, and are not carried <lb/>
            to it; nor are they ever really filled with real being; nor <lb/>
            have they ever tasted solid and pure pleasure ; but, after the <lb/>
            manner of brutes looking always downwards, bowed towards <lb/>
            earth and their tables, they live feeding and coupling; and <lb/>
            from a lust for such things, they kick and push at one another <lb/>
            as with iron horns and hoofs, and perish through their own <lb/>
            insatiety, just like those who are filling wth unreal being that <lb/>
            which is no real being, nor friendly to themselves. You are <lb/>
            describing, Socrates, with quite oracular perfection, rejoined <lb/>
            Glaucon, what is the life of the multitude. Must they not <lb/>
            then, of necessity be conversant with pleasures mixed with <pb n="277"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
            pains, images of the true pleasure, shadowed in outline, and <lb/>
            coloured by their position beside each other; so that both <lb/>
            their pleasures and pains will appear vehement, and engender <lb/>
            their mad passions in the foolish ? Hence also they must <lb/>
            fight about these things, as Stesichorus says those at Troy <lb/>
            fought about the image of Helen, through ignorance of the <lb/>
            true one. Of necessity, said he, something of this kind must <lb/>
            take place.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—But what ? must not the same things neces­ <lb/>
            sarily happen to the irascible part of the soul, whenever <lb/>
            any one gratifies it, either through envy from ambition, or <lb/>
            violence from contentiousness, or anger from moroseness, <lb/>
            pursuing a glut of honour, of conquest, and of anger, both <lb/>
            without reason, and without intelligence ? Such things as <lb/>
            these, said he, must necessarily happen with relation to this <lb/>
            part of the soul. What then, said I;—can we confidently <lb/>
            say concerning all the pleasures, both as respects the avari­ <lb/>
            cious and the ambitious part, that such of them as obey <lb/>
            science and reason, and, in conjunction therewith, pursue and <lb/>
            obtain the pleasures of which the prudent part of the soul is <lb/>
            the leader, that these will obtain the truest pleasures, as far <lb/>
            as it is possible for them to attain true pleasure, and in as <lb/>
            much as they follow truth, pleasures properly their own ; if <lb/>
            indeed what is best for each be most properly his own ? Aye, <lb/>
            it surely is most properly his own, said he. When then the <lb/>
            whole soul is obedient to the philosophic part, and there is no <lb/>
            sedition in it, then every part in other respects performs its <lb/>
            proper business, and is just, and also reaps its own pleasures, and <lb/>
            such as are the best, and as far as is possible the most genuine. <lb/>
            Certainly, indeed. But when any of the others governs, it <lb/>
            happens that it neither attains its own pleasures, and it com­ <lb/>
            pels the other parts to pursue a pleasure foreign to them, and <lb/>
            not at all genuine. It does so, said he. Will not then those <lb/>
            parts, which are most remote from philosophy and reason <lb/>
            most especially effect such things ? Very much so. And is <lb/>
            not that which is most remote from law and order, most re­ <lb/>
            mote likewise from reason ? It plainly is. And have not the <lb/>
            amorous and the tyrannical desires appeared to be most <lb/>
            remote from law and order ? Extremely so. And the royal <lb/>
            and the moderate ones, the least remote ? Yes. The tyrant <lb/>
            then, I think, will be the most remote from true pleasure, <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 11. </note> <lb/>
            and such as is most properly his own, and the other will be <lb/>
            the least. Of necessity. And the tyrant, said I, will lead <lb/>
            a life the most unpleasant, and the king the most pleasant. <lb/>
            Of great necessity. Do you know then, said I, how much <lb/>
            more unpleasant a life the tyrant leads than the king? If <lb/>
            you tell me, said he. As there are three pleasures, as it <lb/>
            seems, one legitimate, and two illegitimate; the tyrant in car­ <lb/>
            rying the illegitimate to extremity, and flying from law and <lb/>
            reason, dwells with slavish pleasures as his life-guardians, and <lb/>
            how far he is inferior cannot easily he told, unless it be done <lb/>
            in this manner. How ? said he. The tyrant is somehow in <lb/>
            the third degree remote from the oligarchic character ; for the <lb/>
            democratic was halfway between them. Yes. Will he <lb/>
            not then dwell in the third picture of pleasure, distant from <lb/>
            him as regards truth, if our former reasonings be true ? Just <lb/>
            so. But the oligarchic is the third again from the royal, if <lb/>
            we suppose the aristocratic and the royal the same ? He is <lb/>
            the third. The tyrant then, said I, is remote from true plea­ <lb/>
            sure, the third from the third ? So it seems. A plain sur­ <lb/>
            face then, said I, may be the image of tyrannical pleasure, as <lb/>
            to the computation of length. Certainly. But as to power, <lb/>
            and the third augment, it is manifest by how great a dis­ <lb/>
            tance it is remote. It is manifest, said he, to the computer <lb/>
            at least. If now, conversely, any one shall say the king is <lb/>
            distant from the tyrant as to truth of pleasure, as much as is <lb/>
            the distance 9, and 20, and 700, shall he not, on completing <lb/>
            the multiplication, find him leading the more pleasant life, <lb/>
            and the tyrant the more wretched one, by this same distance ?* <note type="footnote"> * The following numbers are employed by Plato in this place. He <lb/>
            considers the Royal character as analogous to unity, the Oligarchic to the <lb/>
            number 3, and the Tyrannic to the number 9. As 3 therefore is triple of <lb/>
            unity, the Oligarchic is the third from the Royal character ; and in a <lb/>
            similar manner the Tyrant is distant from the Oligarchist by the triple in <lb/>
            number ; for 9 is the triple of 3, just as 3 is the triple of 1. But 9 is a <lb/>
            plane number, the length of which is 3, and also its breadth. And a <lb/>
            tyrannic, says Plato, is the last image of a royal life. He also calls 3 a <lb/>
            power, because unity being multiplied by it, and itself by itself, and 9 by <lb/>
            it, there will be produced 3, 9, 27. But he calls the third augment 27, <lb/>
            arising from the multiplication of the power 3, and producing depth or a <lb/>
            solid number. Lastly, 27 multiplied into itself produces 729, which may <lb/>
            be considered as a perfect multiplication, this number being the 6th <lb/>
            power of 3 ; and 6 as is well known is a perfect number. Hence, as the <lb/>
            King is analogous to 1, he.is said, by Plato, to be 729 times distant from <lb/>
            the Tyrant. </note> <pb n="279"/>

            You have heaped up, said he, a prodigious account of the dif­ <lb/>
            ference between these two men, the just and the unjust, with <lb/>
            reference to pleasure and pain. Yet the numbers are true, <lb/>
            said I, and corresponding to their lives, if indeed days, and <lb/>
            nights, and months, and years, correspond to them. But <lb/>
            they do correspond, said he. If then the good and just man <lb/>
            surpasses so far the evil and unjust man in pleasure, in what <lb/>
            a prodigious degree further shall he surpass him in decorum <lb/>
            of life, in beauty, and in virtue! Prodigious, indeed, by Zeus, <lb/>
            he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Well then, said I, since we have reached <lb/>
            this part of our argument, let us recapitulate what we first <lb/>
            said, on account of which we came hither : now it was said, <lb/>
            if I mistake not, that it is advantageous to one who is <lb/>
            thoroughly unjust, but who has the character of being <lb/>
            just, to commit injustice. Was it not so said ? It was <lb/>
            indeed. Now then, said I, let us settle this point, since <lb/>
            we have now settled the other, with reference to acting <lb/>
            justly and unjustly, what power each of these possesses <lb/>
            in itself. How ? said he. Let us ideally fashion an image <lb/>
            of the soul, that the man who said those things may <lb/>
            know what he said. What kind of image ? said he. One <lb/>
            of those creatures, said I, which are fabled to have been of <lb/>
            old, as that of Chimæra, of Scylla, of Cerberus; and many <lb/>
            others are spoken of, where many particular natures existed <lb/>
            together in one. They are spoken of indeed, said he. Let <lb/>
            us form now the figure of a creature, various, and many- <lb/>
            headed,* having all around heads of tame creatures, and of <lb/>
            wild, and having power in itself of changing all these heads, <lb/>
            and of breeding them out of itself. This is the work, said <lb/>
            he, of a skilful modeller : however, as the formation is easier <lb/>
            in reasoning, than in wax and such-like, let it be formed. Let <lb/>
            there be now one other figure of a lion t and one of a man ; <lb/>
            but let the first be by far the greatest, and the second be the <lb/>
            second in bulk. These are easy, said he, and they are <lb/>
            formed. Unite now these three in one, so that they may <lb/>
            somehow coexist. They are united, said he. Form now <lb/>
            around them the external appearance of one of them, that of <note type="footnote"> * By this many-headed beast, desire is signified. </note><note type="footnote"> t The lion signifies anger, and the figure of a man reason; for the <lb/>
            whole soul is divided into reason, anger, and desire. </note> <pb n="280"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
            the man ; so that to one who is not able to see what is <lb/>
            within, but who perceives only the external covering, the <lb/>
            man may appear one creature. 'Itis formed all round, said <lb/>
            he. Let us now tell him who asserts that it is profitable to <lb/>
            this man to do injustice, but to do justice unprofitable, that <lb/>
            he asserts nothing else, than that it is profitable for him to <lb/>
            feast the multiform creature, and to make it strong; and <lb/>
            likewise the lion, and what respects the lion, whilst the man <lb/>
            he kills with famine, and renders weak, so as to be dragged <lb/>
            whichever way either of those drag him; and that he will <lb/>
            also find it advantageous never to accustom the one to live in <lb/>
            harmony with the other, nor to make them friends, but suffer <lb/>
            them to bite one another, and to fight and devour each <lb/>
            other. He, said he, who commends the doing injustice, <lb/>
            undoubtedly asserts these things. And does not he again, <lb/>
            who says it is advantageous to act justly, say that he ought <lb/>
            to do and to say such things by which the inner man shall <lb/>
            come to have the most entire command of the man, and, as a <lb/>
            tiller of the ground, shall take care of the many-headed crea­ <lb/>
            ture, cherishing the mild ones, and nourishing them, and <lb/>
            hindering the wild ones from growing up, taking the nature <lb/>
            of the lion as his ally, and, having a common care for all, <lb/>
            make them friendly to one another, and to himself, and so <lb/>
            nourish them? He who commends justice undoubtedly says <lb/>
            such things as these. In all respects, then, he who com­ <lb/>
            mends justice would seem to speak the truth, but he who <lb/>
            commends injustice, to speak what is false; for, as respects <lb/>
            pleasure, applause, and profit, he who commends justice <lb/>
            speaks the truth, and he who discommends it speaks nothing <lb/>
            genuine; nor does he discommend with understanding what <lb/>
            he discommends. Not at all, said he, as appears to me at <lb/>
            least. Let us then in a mild manner persuade him (for it is <lb/>
            not willingly he errs), asking him, 0 blessed man! do not <lb/>
            we say that the maxims of things beautiful and base become <lb/>
            so upon such accounts as these ? Those are good which make <lb/>
            the brutal part of our nature most subject to the man, or <lb/>
            rather perhaps to that which is divine; while those are evil <lb/>
            which enslave the mild part of our nature to the brutal :­ <lb/>
            will he agree with us,—or how ? He will, if he be advised <lb/>
            by me, said he. Is there then any one, said I, whom it avails. <lb/>
            from this reasoning, to take gold unjustly, supposing some- <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            thing of this kind to happen, if, while taking the money, he <lb/>
            at the same time subjects the best part of himself to the <lb/>
            worst ? Or, if, taking gold, he should enslave a son or <lb/>
            daughter, and that even to savage and wicked men, shall we <lb/>
            not say this would not avail him, not though he should receive <lb/>
            for it a prodigious sum ? But if he enslaves the most divine <lb/>
            part of himself to the most impious and most polluted part, <lb/>
            without any pity, is he not wretched ? and does he not take <lb/>
            a gift of gold to his far more dreadful ruin, than Eriphyle <lb/>
            did when she received the necklace for her husband's life ? <lb/>
            By far, said Glaucon; for I will answer you for him.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—Do you not, then, think that intemperance <lb/>
            has of old been blamed on these accounts, because in <lb/>
            such persons that terrible, great, and multiform beast was <lb/>
            indulged more than was decent ? Plainly so, said he. And <lb/>
            are not arrogance and moroseness blamed, when the lion­ <lb/>
            like and serpentine disposition increases and stretches beyond <lb/>
            measure ? Certainly. And are not luxury and effeminacy <lb/>
            blamed because of the remissness and looseness of this dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, when it engenders cowardice in the man? What else? <lb/>
            Are not flattery and illiberality blamed, when any one makes <lb/>
            this irascible part itself subject to the brutal crew, and, for the <lb/>
            sake of wealth and its insatiable lust, accustoms the irascible <lb/>
            to be affronted from its youth, and instead of a lion to become <lb/>
            an ape ? Entirely so, said he. But why is it, do you think, <lb/>
            that mechanical arts and handicrafts bring disgrace ? Shall <lb/>
            we say it is on any other account than this, that when a man <lb/>
            has the form of that which is best in his soul naturally weak, <lb/>
            so as not to be able to govern the creatures within himself, <lb/>
            but ministers to them, he is able only to learn what flatters <lb/>
            them ? It is likely, said he. In order then that such an one <lb/>
            may be governed in the same manner as the best man is, do <lb/>
            we not say that he must be the servant of one who is the best, <lb/>
            and who has within him the divine governing principle ? not at <lb/>
            all conceiving that he should be governed to the hurt of the sub­ <lb/>
            ject (as Thrasymachus imagined), but, as it is best for every <lb/>
            one to be governed, by one divine and wise, most especially pos­ <lb/>
            sessing it as his own within him, if not subjecting himself to <lb/>
            it externally; that as far as possible we may all resemble one <lb/>
            another and be friends, governed by one and the same ? <lb/>
            Rightly, indeed, said he. And law at least, said I, plainly <pb n="282"/>
            <note type="margin"> [r.. IX. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            shows it intends such a thing, being an ally to all in the city; <lb/>
            as does likewise the government of children, in not allowing <lb/>
            them to be free till we establish in them a proper government, <lb/>
            as in a city; and having cultivated that in them which is <lb/>
            best, by that which is best in ourselves, we establish a similar <lb/>
            guardian and governor for youth, and then at length we set it <lb/>
            free. It shows it indeed, said he. In what way then shall we <lb/>
            say, Glaucon, and according to what reasoning, that it is pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to do injustice, to be intemperate, or to do anything <lb/>
            base, by which a man shall indeed become more wicked, but <lb/>
            yet shall acquire more wealth, or any kind of power ? In no <lb/>
            way, said he. But how shall we say it is profitable for the <lb/>
            unjust to be concealed, and not to suffer punishment ? or does <lb/>
            he not indeed, who is concealed, still become more wicked ? <lb/>
            but he who is not concealed, and is punished, has the brutal <lb/>
            part quieted, and made mild, and the mild part set at liberty. <lb/>
            And the whole soul being settled in the best temper, in pos­ <lb/>
            sessing temperance and justice, with wisdom, acquires a more <lb/>
            valuable habit than the body does, in acquiring vigour and <lb/>
            beauty, with a sound constitution; in as far as the soul is <lb/>
            more valuable than the body. Entirely so, said he. Will <lb/>
            not everybody then, who possesses intellect, regulate his life, <lb/>
            first by extending hither the whole of his powers, honouring <lb/>
            those branches of science which will render his soul of this <lb/>
            kind, and despising all other things ? It is plain, said he. <lb/>
            And next, said I, with regard to a good habit of body and its <lb/>
            nourishment, he will spend his life in attention to these, <lb/>
            not that he may indulge the brutal and irrational pleasure; <lb/>
            nor yet with a view to health, nor principally with <lb/>
            reference to becoming strong, healthy, and beautiful, unless <lb/>
            by these means he is to become temperate likewise: but <lb/>
            he always appears to adjust the harmony of the body for the <lb/>
            sake of the symphony which is in the soul. By all means, <lb/>
            said he, if indeed he is to be truly musical. Will he not <lb/>
            then, in acquiring wealth, maintain accord and symphony ? <lb/>
            nor moved by the congratulations of the multitude will he <lb/>
            increase the bulk of his treasures to an infinite amount, occa­ <lb/>
            sioning thereby infinite evils ? I think not, said he. But <lb/>
            looking, said I, to the government of it himself, and taking <lb/>
            care that nothing there be moved out of its place, through the <lb/>
            greatness or smallness of his property, thus governing as far <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. C. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            as he is able, he will add to his property, and spend out of it. <lb/>
            Entirely so, said he. He will regard honours, likewise, in <lb/>
            the same manner; of some he will willingly take a share, <lb/>
            and taste of those which he judges will render him a better <lb/>
            man, but as for those which he thinks would dissolve that <lb/>
            habit of soul which subsists within him, he will fly from both <lb/>
            those privately and in public. He will not be willing, then, <lb/>
            said he, to act the politician, if he takes care of this. Yes, <lb/>
            truly, said I, in his own state, and greatly too; but not pro­ <lb/>
            bably in his country, unless some divine fortune befal him. I <lb/>
            understand, said he. You mean in the state we have now <lb/>
            established, which exists only in our reasoning, but I think <lb/>
            has no existence on earth. But in heaven, probably,-said <lb/>
            I, there is a model of it, for any one who inclines to contem­ <lb/>
            plate it, and on contemplating to regulate himself accord­ <lb/>
            ingly ; and to him it matters not whether it does exist any­ <lb/>
            where, or will ever exist here:-for he would perform the <lb/>
            duties of this city alone, and of no other. It is reasonable, <lb/>
            said he.</p>

          <p>The concluding boolc of the Republic comprises two main subjects of <lb/>
            inquiry. First, he explains more fully than he had done in the third <lb/>
            book, the reason for excluding from his pattern state the accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment of poetry, so highly prized by the Athenians, but nevertheless he <lb/>
            allows the admission of that chaste and harmless kind of it; such as <lb/>
            hymns to the gods and odes in honour of celebrated men ;-and, lastly, <lb/>
            he treats of the rewards both present and to come, resulting from the <lb/>
            practice of justice,-and of the punishments on the other which attend <lb/>
            on injustice, which is totally opposed to state-happiness.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—Moreover, remarked I, both in many other re­ <lb/>
            spects, I observe that we have been rightly establishing our <lb/>
            state, better indeed than all others; and not least so do I say, <lb/>
            as regards our sentiments concerning poetry. What are <lb/>
            they? said he. That no part of it which is imitative should <lb/>
            by any means be admitted ;—for that it must not be admitted <lb/>
            appears now, methinks, exceedingly clear, since the several <lb/>
            forms of the soul have been distinguished apart from one ano­ <lb/>
            ther. How do you mean ? That I may tell it to you,—(for <lb/>
            you will not denounce me to the composers of tragedy, and <lb/>
            the rest of the imitative class),—all such things as these seem <lb/>
            to be the ruin of the intellect of the hearers,-that is, of such <lb/>
            of them as have not a test to enable them to discern their <lb/>
            peculiar nature. What consideration, said he, leads you to <lb/>
            say this ? It must be stated, said I; although a certain <lb/>
            friendship, at least, and reverence for Homer, which I have <lb/>
            had from my childhood, almost restrains me from telling <lb/>
            it; for he seems truly both to have been the first leader and <lb/>
            teacher of all the good composers of tragedy; but still the <lb/>
            man must not be honoured in preference to truth. But what <lb/>
            I mean must be spoken. By all means, said he. Hear me <lb/>
            then, or rather answer me. Put your question then. Can you <lb/>
            tell me perfectly, what is the nature of imitation ?-for I do not <lb/>
            myself altogether understand its meaning. Is it possible then, <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            said he, that I shall any how understand it ? That would be <lb/>
            no way strange, said I; since those who are dim-sighted per­ <lb/>
            ceive many things sooner than those who see more clearly. <lb/>
            The case is so, said he ; but while you are present, I would <lb/>
            not venture to tell, even though I had some inkling of it, but <lb/>
            consider it yourself. Do you wish then, that we hence begin <lb/>
            our inquiry in our usual method ? for we used to suppose a <lb/>
            certain idea relating to many individuals, to which we give <lb/>
            the same name ;-do you not understand ? I do understand. <lb/>
            Let us suppose now any one you please among the many, as <lb/>
            for example, if you will, there are many beds and tables. <lb/>
            Of course. But the ideas, at least respecting these pieces of <lb/>
            furniture, are two, one of bed, and one of table. Yes. And <lb/>
            do we not usually say, that the workman of each of these <lb/>
            pieces of furniture, looking towards the idea, makes them <lb/>
            thus-one of them the beds, and the other the tables which <lb/>
            we use ;—.and all other things in like manner?-for surely <lb/>
            not one of the artificers makes the idea itself; for how can <lb/>
            he? By no means. See now then, what kind of an artificer <lb/>
            do you call this ? Which ? He who makes all things <lb/>
            which each several artificer makes. You are alluding to <lb/>
            some skilful and wonderful person. Not yet, at least; but <lb/>
            you will much more say so presently; for this same me­ <lb/>
            chanic is not only able to make all sorts of utensils, but <lb/>
            makes everything also which springs from the earth, and <lb/>
            he makes all sorts of animals, himself as well as others; <lb/>
            and besides these things, he makes the earth, the heaven <lb/>
            and the gods, and all things in heaven, and in Hades under <lb/>
            the earth. You are speaking, said he, of a perfectly wonderful <lb/>
            sophist. Do you disbelieve me ? said I; but tell me, do you <lb/>
            not think that there is such an artificer; or that in one re­ <lb/>
            spect, he is the maker of all these things, and in another not <lb/>
            so ?-or do you not perceive, that even you yourself might <lb/>
            be able to make all these things, in a certain manner at least ? <lb/>
            And what, said he, is this manner ? It is not difficult, said <lb/>
            I, but is done in many ways, and quickly too; but in the <lb/>
            quickest way of all, if I mistake not, if you please to make a <lb/>
            mirror, and carry it round everywhere ; for then you will <lb/>
            very quickly make the sun, and the heavenly bodies, the <lb/>
            earth, yourself, and the other animals and utensils and plants, <lb/>
            and all that we have just now mentioned. Yes, said he, <lb/>
            the appearances, but not surely the realities. You come in, <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
            said I, both well and sea,sonably, with your remark ; for the <lb/>
            painter too, methinks, is an artificer of this kind ;-is he not ? <lb/>
            He cannot possibly be otherwise. You will say then, I suppose, <lb/>
            that he does not make what he makes real and true, although <lb/>
            the painter too, in a certain manner at least, makes a bed, does <lb/>
            he not? Aye, said he ; but he too makes only the appearance.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—But what as to the bed-maker ?-did you not <lb/>
            just now say, that he does not make the idea which we say <lb/>
            exists, and is a bed, but only a particular bed? I did say so. <lb/>
            If then he does not make that which really exists, he does not <lb/>
            make real being, but something resembling being, though not <lb/>
            being itself: but if any one should say that the work of the <lb/>
            bed-maker, or any other craftsman, were real being, it seems <lb/>
            he would not say what is true. He would not, said he, as it <lb/>
            should seem to those who are acquainted with such discus­ <lb/>
            sions. We must not then be surprised if this likewise should <lb/>
            seem somewhat obscure compared with the truth. Certainly <lb/>
            not. Are you willing then, said I, that as regards these very <lb/>
            things we inquire concerning the real nature of their imitator ? <lb/>
            If you please, he replied. Are there not then these three sorts of <lb/>
            beds :-one existing in nature, and which we may say, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, God made, or who else? No one, I think. And another <lb/>
            which the joiner makes ? Yes, said he. And a third which <lb/>
            the painter makes:—is it not so ? Granted. Now the <lb/>
            painter, the bed-maker, God, these three are the masters of <lb/>
            three species of beds ? They are three indeed. But God, <lb/>
            whether it were that he was unwilling, or whether there was <lb/>
            some necessity that he should only make one bed in nature, <lb/>
            made this one only, which is really a bed; while two or more <lb/>
            of such other species have never been produced, nor ever will <lb/>
            be produced by God. How so ? said he. Because, said I, if he <lb/>
            had made but two, one again would have appeared, the idea <lb/>
            of which both these two would have possessed, and that idea <lb/>
            would be that of a bed, and not those two. Right, said he. <lb/>
            God then, methinks, being aware of these things, and willing <lb/>
            to be the maker of a bed really, and having real being, though <lb/>
            of no one particular bed, and not to be any particular bed- <lb/>
            maker, produced but one in nature? It seems so. Are <lb/>
            you willing then that we should call him the producer of this, <lb/>
            or of something of a similar nature ? It is just, said he, <lb/>
            since he has in their essential nature created this, as well <lb/>
            as all other things. But what as to the joiner?—is not he <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. x. c. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            the maker of a bed ? Yea. And is the painter, too, the <lb/>
            workman and maker of something similar ? By no means. <lb/>
            But what will you say he has to do with a bed ? This, as I <lb/>
            think, we may most reasonably call him, said he, an imitator <lb/>
            of what the others actually make and contrive. Be it so, <lb/>
            said I; then him you call the imitator who makes what is <lb/>
            generated the third from nature ? Quite so, he replied. <lb/>
            And this composer of tragedy will in like manner, as being <lb/>
            an imitator, rise as a sort of third from the king and <lb/>
            the truth ; and so likewise all other imitators ? Aye, so it <lb/>
            seems. We have agreed, then, as to the imitator ?-but tell <lb/>
            me this concerning the painter, whether you think he under­ <lb/>
            takes to imitate each particular thing in nature, or the works <lb/>
            of artificers? The works of artificers, said he. Whether, such as <lb/>
            they really are, or such only as they appear ? for this we must <lb/>
            define more correctly. How say you ? said he. Thus ; does <lb/>
            a bed differ at all in itself, whether a man view it obliquely <lb/>
            or directly opposite, or in any particular position ?-or, is it <lb/>
            not at all different, but only apparently different, and so on <lb/>
            as respects other things ? Thus it appears, said he, yet it does <lb/>
            not really differ. Consider this too, with reference to which <lb/>
            of the two does painting work, in each particular work; <lb/>
            whether with reference to real being, to imitate it as it really <lb/>
            is, or with reference to what is apparent, as it appears ; and <lb/>
            whether is it the imitation of appearance, or of truth ? Only <lb/>
            of appearance, said he. The imitative art, then, is far from <lb/>
            the truth: and on this account it seems, he is able to make <lb/>
            these things, because he is able to attain only to some small <lb/>
            part of each particular, and that but an image. Thus we <lb/>
            say that a painter will paint us a shoemaker, a joiner, and <lb/>
            other craftsmen, though having no acquaintance with any of <lb/>
            these arts; yet he will be able to deceive children and igno­ <lb/>
            rant people, if he be a good painter, when he paints a joiner, <lb/>
            and shows him at a distance, so far as to make them imagine <lb/>
            he is a real joiner. Of course. But this, I think, my friend, <lb/>
            we must take into consideration in connexion with all these <lb/>
            things; that when any one tells us of any one, that he has <lb/>
            met with a man skilled in all kinds of workmanship, and <lb/>
            everything else which each particular artist understands, and <lb/>
            that he knows everything whatever more accurately than <lb/>
            any one else, we ought to reply to such an one, that he is a <lb/>
            simpleton, and that it seems, he has been deceived by falling <pb n="288"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. X. c. 3. </note> <lb/>
            in with some conjurer, or imitator, so as to seem to himself, <lb/>
            to know everything owing to his very incapacity of distin­ <lb/>
            guishing between science and ignorance and imitation. Most <lb/>
            true, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Ought we not then next, said I, to consider <lb/>
            tragedy and its leader, Homer?—Since from some we hear <lb/>
            that these poets understand all arts, and all human affairs, <lb/>
            respecting virtue and vice, and likewise all divine things; <lb/>
            for a good poet must necessarily compose with knowledge, if <lb/>
            he means what he composes to compose well,-else he is not <lb/>
            able to compose. It is our business then to consider whe­ <lb/>
            ther those who have fallen in with these imitators have been <lb/>
            deceived, and on viewing their works have not perceived that <lb/>
            they are the third distant from real being, and their works <lb/>
            such as can easily be made by one not knowing the truth <lb/>
            (for they make phantasms, and not real beings) ; or whether <lb/>
            do they say something to the purpose, and do the good poets <lb/>
            really know the things about which the multitude think <lb/>
            they speak well. This, said he, is by all means to be <lb/>
            inquired into. Think you then, that if any one could <lb/>
            make both of these, that which is imitated, and likewise <lb/>
            the original idea, he would allow himself seriously to <lb/>
            apply to the workmanship of the images, and propose that <lb/>
            to himself as the best thing in life? I do not. But if <lb/>
            he were really intelligent in these things which he imi­ <lb/>
            tates, he would, I think, far more seriously study the things <lb/>
            themselves than the imitations, and would try to leave <lb/>
            behind him many and beautiful actions, as monuments of <lb/>
            himself, and rather study to be himself the person com­ <lb/>
            mended than the mere eulogist. I think so, said he; for <lb/>
            neither is the honour nor the profit equal. As to other <lb/>
            things, then, let us not call them to account,—asking Homer <lb/>
            or any other of the poets, whether they were skilled in medi­ <lb/>
            cine, and not mere imitators of medical discourses;—for <lb/>
            which of the ancient or more recent poets is said to have <lb/>
            restored any to health, as Æsculapius did ? or what disciples <lb/>
            of medical science has any of them left behind, such as he left <lb/>
            his descendants ?—Neither let us ask them about the other <lb/>
            arts, but leave them out of the question; and with reference <lb/>
            to those greatest and most beautiful things on which Homer <lb/>
            tries to discourse,-about wars and armies, and civic consti- <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            tutions, and human education, it is just, perhaps, to question <lb/>
            and inquire of him: Friend Homer, if you be not the third <lb/>
            from the truth with regard to virtue, as being the artificer of <lb/>
            an image (for thus we have defined an imitator), but rather <lb/>
            the second, and can discern what pursuits render men better <lb/>
            or worse, in private as well as public, tell us which of the <lb/>
            states has been better constituted by you, as Lacedaemon <lb/>
            was by Lycurgus, and great and small cities by many <lb/>
            others;-but as respects yourself, what state is it that ac­ <lb/>
            knowledges you to have been a good lawgiver, and to have <lb/>
            done them good service ? Italy and Sicily acknowledge <lb/>
            Charondas, and we Solon; but who acknowledges you ? <lb/>
            Will he be able to mention any one ? I think not, said <lb/>
            Glaucon. That is not pretended even by the Homeridæ <lb/>
            themselves. But what war in Homer's days is recorded to <lb/>
            have been conducted by him as general, or adviser? Not <lb/>
            one. What then are his discoveries ?-since among the <lb/>
            works of a wise man there are many discoveries and inven­ <lb/>
            tions mentioned, that concern the arts, and other affairs; as <lb/>
            of Thales the Milesian, and of Anacharsis the Scythian. <lb/>
            There is not any one such to be found. But if not in a <lb/>
            public manner, has Homer the repute of having lived as a <lb/>
            private instructor to any who delighted in his conversa­ <lb/>
            tion, and to have delivered down to posterity a certain <lb/>
            Homeric manner of life,—-just as Pythagoras was remarkably <lb/>
            beloved on this account, and, as even to this day, such as <lb/>
            denominate themselves Pythagoreans appear to be somehow <lb/>
            eminent beyond others in their manner of life ? Neither, said <lb/>
            he, is there anything of this kind related about Homer: <lb/>
            -for Creophilus,* Socrates, the friend of Homer, may <lb/>
            probably appear even still more ridiculous in his education, <lb/>
            than in his name, if what is said of Homer be true :-for <lb/>
            it is said that he was greatly neglected by him when he <lb/>
            lived.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—It is said so indeed, I replied :-but think <lb/>
            you, Glaucon, that if Homer had really been able to educate <lb/>
            men, and to make them better, as being capable not only of <note type="footnote"> * According to the Greek scholiast, Creophilus was an epic poet of <lb/>
            Chios. Homer, it is said, married his daughter, and dwelling in his <lb/>
            house, had from him the poem of the Iliad. His name, to which Socrates <lb/>
            alludes, signifies a lover of flesh. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <pb n="290"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 4. </note> <lb/>
            imitating in these matters, but of understanding them like­ <lb/>
            wise, he would not then have won many intimate friends, <lb/>
            and have been loved and honoured by them ? Whereas <lb/>
            on the other hand, Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus <lb/>
            of Ceos, and many others, have the power of persuading <lb/>
            the men of their day, by private conversation, that they will <lb/>
            neither be able to govern their family or the state, unless <lb/>
            they themselves direct their education ; and for this wis­ <lb/>
            dom of theirs, they are so exceedingly beloved, that their <lb/>
            friends almost carry them about on their heads. Would <lb/>
            then the men of Homer's time have left either him or Hesiod <lb/>
            to go about singing their songs, if he could have done men <lb/>
            service in the way of virtue, and not rather have kept him <lb/>
            with offers of gold, and so obliged him to stay with them ; or, <lb/>
            -had they been unable to prevail on him, would they not as <lb/>
            disciples have followed him everywhere, till they had gained <lb/>
            a sufficient education? Assuredly, Socrates, said he, you <lb/>
            appear to me to say what is true. Shall we not then <lb/>
            establish this point,-that all the poets, beginning from <lb/>
            Homer, are imitators of the images of virtue, and of other <lb/>
            things about which they compose, but yet do not attain <lb/>
            to the real truth; but, as we just now said, a painter, who <lb/>
            himself knows nothing about the making of shoes, will draw <lb/>
            a shoemaker, apparently real only to such as are not intelli­ <lb/>
            gent, but look at him only as to colour and figures ? Certainly. <lb/>
            In the same manner, I think, we shall say that the poet <lb/>
            colours over with his names and words certain colours of the <lb/>
            several arts, without understanding anything himself, but <lb/>
            merely imitating, so that to others such as himself who view <lb/>
            things in his compositions, he has the appearance of possess­ <lb/>
            ing knowledge: and if he says anything about shoemaking <lb/>
            in measure, rhythm, and harmony, he seems to speak per­ <lb/>
            fectly well, whether it be respecting the art of a general or <lb/>
            any other subject; so great is the enchantment which these <lb/>
            things naturally have, because you know, I think, in what <lb/>
            manner poetry appears when stript of the colour of music, and <lb/>
            expressed apart,-for you have somewhere beheld it. I have, <lb/>
            said he. Do they not, said I, resemble the faces of people <lb/>
            who are in the prime of their life, but yet not beautiful, such <lb/>
            as they appear when their bloom forsakes them ? Quite <lb/>
            so, said he. Come then, consider this :-the maker of the <pb n="291"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. x. c. 4.J </note> <lb/>
            image, whom we call the imitator, knows nothing of real <lb/>
            being, but only of that which is apparent :-is it not so ? <lb/>
            Yes. Let usnot then leave it expressed by halves, but <lb/>
            let us examine it fully. Say on, replied he. A painter, <lb/>
            we say, will paint reins and a bridle. Yes. And the <lb/>
            leather-cutter, and the smith, will make them. Certainly. <lb/>
            Does the painter then understand what kind of reins and <lb/>
            bridle there ought to be ;-or not even he who makes them, <lb/>
            the smith, nor the leather-cutter, but he who knows how to <lb/>
            use them, the horseman alone ? Most true. Shall we not say <lb/>
            that this is the case in everything else ? How ? That with <lb/>
            reference to each particular thing there are these three arts: <lb/>
            -that which is to use it, that which is to make it, and that <lb/>
            which is to imitate it? Yes. Are then the virtue, and the <lb/>
            beauty, and the rectitude of every utensil, and animal, and <lb/>
            action, for nothing else but for the use for which each parti­ <lb/>
            cular was made, or generated? Just so. Very necessarily, <lb/>
            then, must he who uses each particular, be the most skilful, <lb/>
            and most able to tell the maker what he makes good or bad, <lb/>
            with regard to the use in which he employs it: thus, for <lb/>
            example, a flute-player will tell the flute-maker concerning <lb/>
            flutes, what things are expedient for playing on the flute, and <lb/>
            will give orders how he ought to make them, but the latter will <lb/>
            attend to his directions. Of course. Will not the one then, <lb/>
            being intelligent, pronounce concerning good and bad flutes, <lb/>
            and the other, believing him, make them accordingly? Yes. <lb/>
            With reference then to one and the same instrument, the <lb/>
            maker will form a correct opinion concerning its beauty or <lb/>
            deformity, while he is conversant with one who is intelligent, <lb/>
            and is obliged to hear from the intelligent; but he who uses <lb/>
            it must have science. Certainly. But will the imitator have <lb/>
            science from using the things he paints, whether handsome and <lb/>
            correct, or otherwise ? or will he form a correct opinion from <lb/>
            being necessarily conversant with the intelligent, and from <lb/>
            being ordered how he ought to paint? Neither of the two. <lb/>
            The imitator then will neither know nor form a correct opinion <lb/>
            about what he imitates with reference to beauty or deformity ? <lb/>
            It seems not. The imitator then will be very skilful in <lb/>
            his imitation, with regard to wisdom, concerning what he <lb/>
            paints? Not wholly so. Nevertheless he will at least imi­ <lb/>
            tate, without knowing about each particular in what respect <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
            it is bad or good ; and he will probably imitate such as ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be beautiful to the multitude, and those who know <lb/>
            nothing? Of course. We have now, indeed, sufficiently, as <lb/>
            it appears, at least, settled these things ;-that the imitator <lb/>
            knows nothing worth mentioning in those things which he <lb/>
            imitates, but imitation is a sort of amusement, and no serious <lb/>
            business :-and likewise, that those who apply to tragic <lb/>
            poetry in iambics and epics, are all imitators in the highest <lb/>
            degree ? Certainly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—By Zeus, though, said I, this business of imi­ <lb/>
            tation is placed somehow in the third degree from the truth : <lb/>
            —is it not? Yes. To what part then of man does it <lb/>
            belong, having the power that it has ? What part do you <lb/>
            speak of ? Of such as this :-the same magnitude perceived <lb/>
            by sight, does not appear in the same manner, both near and <lb/>
            at a distance. It does not. And the same things appear <lb/>
            crooked and straight, when we look at them in water, and <lb/>
            out of the water, and concave and convex, through error of the <lb/>
            sight, as to colours. All this disturbance is manifest in the <lb/>
            soul; and it is this infirmity of our nature which painting <lb/>
            attacks, leaving nothing of magical seduction unattempted, as <lb/>
            well as the wonder-working art, and many other such-like <lb/>
            devices. True. And have not the arts of measure, number, <lb/>
            and weight been deemed in these matters most ingenious <lb/>
            helps, that so the apparent greater or less, the apparent more <lb/>
            or heavier, may not govern us, but that which numbers, <lb/>
            measures, and weighs ? It must be so. But this again is, <lb/>
            at least, the work of the rational part in the soul. It is so, <lb/>
            indeed. But while reason often measures and pronounces <lb/>
            some things to be greater or less than other things, or equal, <lb/>
            the contrary appears at the same time as regards these <lb/>
            things ? Yes. But did not we say that it was impossible <lb/>
            for the same person to have contrary opinions about the same <lb/>
            things at the same time ? Thus far indeed we said rightly. <lb/>
            That part of the soul, then, which judges contrary to the <lb/>
            measure, would seem not to be the same with that which <lb/>
            judges according to the measure. It would not. But surely <lb/>
            that, at least, which trusts to measure and computation would <lb/>
            seem to be the best part of the soul ? Of course. That then <lb/>
            which opposes itself to this will be one of our depraved parts. <lb/>
            Necessarily so. It was this then I wished should be agreed <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            upon, when I said that painting, and imitation, in general, <lb/>
            being far from the truth, delights in its own work, convers­ <lb/>
            ing with that part in us which is far from wisdom, and is <lb/>
            its companion and friend, to no sound nor genuine purpose. <lb/>
            Entirely so, said he. Imitation, then, being depraved in <lb/>
            itself, and joining with that which is depraved, generates <lb/>
            depraved things. It seems so. Whether, said I, is the <lb/>
            case thus, with reference to the imitation which is by the <lb/>
            sight only, or is it likewise so with reference to that by <lb/>
            hearing, which we call poetry ? Probably as to this also, said <lb/>
            he. We shall not therefore, said I, trust to the appear­ <lb/>
            ance in painting, but we shall proceed to the considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the intellectual part with which the imitation through <lb/>
            poetry is conversant, and see whether it is depraved or <lb/>
            worthy. It must be done. Let us proceed then thus: <lb/>
            Poetic imitation, we say, imitates men acting either volun­ <lb/>
            tarily or involuntarily; and imagining that in their acting <lb/>
            they have done either well or ill, and in all these cases <lb/>
            receiving either pain or pleasure: is the case any otherwise than <lb/>
            this ? Not at all. In all these, now, does the man agree <lb/>
            with himself ? or, as he disagreed with reference to sight, and <lb/>
            had contrary opinions in himself of the same things at one <lb/>
            and the same time, does he, in the same manner, disagree <lb/>
            likewise in his actions, and fight with himself? But I <lb/>
            recollect that there is no occasion for us to settle this at <lb/>
            least; for, in our previous discussion, we sufficiently deter­ <lb/>
            mined all this,-that our soul is full of a thousand such <lb/>
            internal contrarieties. Right, said he. Right indeed, said I, <lb/>
            but it appears to me necessary to discuss now, what was then <lb/>
            omitted. What is that? said he. We said somewhere formerly, <lb/>
            said I, that a good man, when he meets with such a misfortune <lb/>
            as the loss of a son, or of anything else which he values the <lb/>
            most, will bear it of all men the easiest. Certainly. But <lb/>
            let us now consider this further,-whether will he not <lb/>
            grieve at all, or is this indeed impossible, but will he <lb/>
            moderate his grief ? The truth, said he, is rather this last. <lb/>
            But tell me this now concerning him, whether do you think <lb/>
            that he will struggle more with grief and oppose it, when he <lb/>
            is observed by his equals, or when he is in solitude, alone by <lb/>
            himself ? Much more, said he, when he is observed. But <lb/>
            when alone, he will venture, I think, to utter many things, <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. X. c. 6. </note> <lb/>
            which, if any one heard him, he would be ashamed of, and lie <lb/>
            will do many things which he would not wish any one saw <lb/>
            him doing. Aye, such is the case, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Do not then reason and law command him to <lb/>
            restrain his grief,-while it is the passion itself that excites <lb/>
            grief? True. As then there is a twofold inducement for <lb/>
            man's conduct, with regard to the same thing, at one and <lb/>
            the same time, we must necessarily say that he has two con­ <lb/>
            ductors. Of course. And shall we not say that one of them <lb/>
            is ready to obey the law wherever law leads him ? How ? <lb/>
            Law in a manner says that it is best to maintain <lb/>
            the greatest possible tranquillity in misfortunes, and not <lb/>
            to bear them ill ; since the good or evil of such things as <lb/>
            these is not manifest, and since no advantage follows the <lb/>
            bearing these things ill; and as nothing of human affairs <lb/>
            deserves great interest; and, besides this, their grief proves <lb/>
            a hinderance to that within them which we ought to <lb/>
            have most at hand. What is it, said he, you here mean ? <lb/>
            Deliberating on the event, said I; and, as on the throw of <lb/>
            the dice, regulating our affairs according to what turns up, in <lb/>
            whatever way reason shall dictate as best; and not as chil­ <lb/>
            dren, when they fall, to lie still, and waste the time in crying; <lb/>
            but always to accustom the soul to apply in the speediest <lb/>
            manner to heal and raise up what was fallen and sick, putting an <lb/>
            end to lamentation by medicine. One would thus, said he, be­ <lb/>
            have in the best manner in every condition. And did not we say <lb/>
            that the best part is willing to follow this which is rational ? <lb/>
            Plainly so. And shall we not say that the part which leads <lb/>
            to the remembrance of affliction and to wailings, and is in­ <lb/>
            satiably given to these, is irrational, and idle, and a friend <lb/>
            to cowardice? We shall, indeed, say so. Is not the <lb/>
            grieving part then that which admits of much and various <lb/>
            Imitation ? But the prudent and tranquil part, which is ever <lb/>
            uniform with itself, is neither easily imitated, nor, when imi­ <lb/>
            tated, easily understood, especially by a popular assembly, <lb/>
            where all sorts of men are assembled together in a theatre. <lb/>
            For surely it is the imitation of a disposition which is foreign <lb/>
            to them. Entirely so. It is plain, then, that the imitative <lb/>
            poet is not made for such a part of the soul as this ;-nor is <lb/>
            his skill fitted to please it, if he means to gain the applause <lb/>
            of the multitude; but he applies to the passionate and the <pb n="295"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. Î.] </note> <lb/>
            multiform part, as it is easily imitated. It is plain. May we <lb/>
            not then, with justice, lay hold of the imitative poet, and place <lb/>
            him in correspondence with the painter? for he resembles him, <lb/>
            both because, as to truth, he effects but depraved things, and <lb/>
            resembles him too in this being conversant with a different <lb/>
            part of the soul from that which is best :-and thus we may, <lb/>
            with justice, not admit him into our city which is to be well <lb/>
            regulated, because he excites and nurtures this part of the <lb/>
            soul, and, by strengthening this, destroys the rational :-and <lb/>
            just as he, who in a state gives power to the wicked, betrays <lb/>
            the state, and ruins the best men, we may in like manner say <lb/>
            that the imitative poet establishes a bad republic in the soul <lb/>
            of each individual, gratifying the foolish part of it, which <lb/>
            neither discerns what is great, nor what is little, but deems <lb/>
            the same things sometimes great, and sometimes small, form­ <lb/>
            ing little images in its own imagination, altogether remote <lb/>
            from the truth ? Certainly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Still we have not yet brought the greatest <lb/>
            accusation against it: for that is, somehow, a very dreadful <lb/>
            one, that it has the power of corrupting even the good, except <lb/>
            only a very few. It must, if it acts in this manner. But <lb/>
            hear now, and consider ; for somehow, the best of us, when we <lb/>
            hear Homer, or any of the tragic writers, imitating some of <lb/>
            the heroes when in grief, pouring forth long speeches in their <lb/>
            sorrow, bewailing and beating their breasts, you know are de­ <lb/>
            lighted ; and, yielding ourselves, we follow along, and, sympa­ <lb/>
            thizing with them, seriously commend him as an able poet <lb/>
            whoever most affects us in this manner. I know it, of course. <lb/>
            But when any domestic grief befals any of us, you perceive, <lb/>
            on the other hand, that we value ourselves on the opposite <lb/>
            behaviour, if we can be quiet and endure, this being the part <lb/>
            of a man, but that of a woman, which in the other case we <lb/>
            commended. I perceive it, said he. Is this commendation <lb/>
            proper, then, said I, when we see such a man as one would <lb/>
            not deign to be oneself, but would be ashamed of, not to <lb/>
            abominate but to delight in and commend him? No, by <lb/>
            Zeus, said he ; it appears unreasonable. Certainly, said I, <lb/>
            if you consider the matter thus. How ? If you reflect that <lb/>
            the part of us, which in our private misfortunes is forcibly <lb/>
            restrained, and is kept from weeping and bewailing to the <lb/>
            full, being by nature of such a kind as desires these, is the <pb n="296"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 7. </note> <lb/>
            very part which by the poets is filled and gratified; but that <lb/>
            part in us, which is naturally the best, being not sufficiently <lb/>
            instructed, either by reason or habit, grows remiss in its <lb/>
            guardianship over the bewailing part, by attending to the <lb/>
            sufferings of others, and deems it no way disgraceful to itself, <lb/>
            to commend and pity one who grieves immoderately, whilst <lb/>
            he professes to be a good man ;-but this it thinks it gains, <lb/>
            even pleasure, which it would not choose to be deprived <lb/>
            of, by despising the whole of the poem :-for, methinks, <lb/>
            it falls to the share of few to be able to consider, that <lb/>
            what we feel for others' misfortunes must necessarily be felt <lb/>
            with respect to our own,-because it is no easy matter for a <lb/>
            man to bear up under his own troubles, who strongly che­ <lb/>
            rishes the bewailing disposition over those of others. Most <lb/>
            true, said he. And is not the reasoning the same with <lb/>
            reference to the ridiculous ?-For when you hear, by comic <lb/>
            imitation, or in private conversation, what you would be <lb/>
            ashamed to do yourself to excite laughter, and are delighted <lb/>
            with it, and imitate it, you do the same thing here as in <lb/>
            tragedy: for that part, which, when it wanted to excite <lb/>
            laughter, was formerly restrained by reason from a fear of <lb/>
            incurring the character of scurrility, by now letting loose, and <lb/>
            allowing there to grow vigorous, you are often impercep­ <lb/>
            tibly brought to be in your own conduct a buffoon. Ex­ <lb/>
            tremely so, said he. And with respect to venereal pleasures, <lb/>
            and anger, and the whole of the passions, as well the <lb/>
            sorrowful as the joyful in the soul, which truly, we have <lb/>
            said, attend us in every action; the poetical imitation of <lb/>
            these has the same effect upon us; for it nurtures and <lb/>
            irrigates them, whereas they ought to be dried up, and <lb/>
            makes them govern us, whereas they ought to be go­ <lb/>
            verned, in order to our becoming better and happier, <lb/>
            instead of being worse and more miserable. I can say no <lb/>
            otherwise, said he. When therefore, Glaucon, said I, you <lb/>
            find the eulogists of Homer saying that this poet in­ <lb/>
            structed Greece, and that he deserves to be taken as <lb/>
            a master to teach both the management and the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of human affairs, and that a man should regu­ <lb/>
            late the whole of his life by the rules of this poet, we should <lb/>
            indeed love and embrace such people, as being as good as <lb/>
            they can be ; and agree with them that Homer is a fine poet, <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="margin"> n. x. c. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            and the first of tragic writers:—yet they must know, that <lb/>
            hymns to the gods, and the praises of worthy actions, are <lb/>
            alone to he admitted into our state :-for if you were to admit <lb/>
            the pleasurable muse likewise, in songs, or verses, we should <lb/>
            have pleasure and pain reigning in our state instead of law, <lb/>
            and that reason which always appears best to the community. <lb/>
            Most true, said he.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Let these things now, said I, be our apo­ <lb/>
            logy, when we recollect what we have said with reference <lb/>
            to poetry, that we then very properly dismissed it from our <lb/>
            republic, since it is such as is now described: for reason <lb/>
            obliged us. And let us address it further, that it may not <lb/>
            accuse us of a certain roughness and rusticity, that there is <lb/>
            an ancient variance between philosophy and poetry; for such <lb/>
            verses as these, <lb/>
            That brawling whelp, which at her mistress barks, <lb/>
            And <lb/>
            He apes the great with empty eloquence, <lb/>
            And <lb/>
            On trifles still they plod, because they're poor ; <lb/>
            and a thousand such-like, are marks of an ancient opposition <lb/>
            between them. Notwithstanding, however, it may be said, <lb/>
            that if any one can assign a reason why the poetry and the <lb/>
            imitation which are calculated for pleasure ought to be in a <lb/>
            well-regulated city, we, for our part, shall gladly admit them, <lb/>
            as we are at least conscious to ourselves that we are charmed <lb/>
            by them. But to betray what appears to be truth, were an <lb/>
            unholy thing. For are not you yourself, my friend, charmed <lb/>
            by this imitation, and most especially when you see it per­ <lb/>
            formed by Homer? Very much so. Is it not just, then, <lb/>
            that we introduce it as speaking its own defence, either in <lb/>
            song, or in any other measure ? By all means. And we <lb/>
            may at least grant, even to its defenders, such as are not <lb/>
            poets, but lovers of poetry, to speak in its behalf, without <lb/>
            verse, and show that it is not only pleasant, but profitable for <lb/>
            states, and human life also; for surely we shall derive some <lb/>
            benefit if it shall be found to be not only pleasant but profitable. <lb/>
            How can we do otherwise than derive benefit from it ? said <pb n="298"/>
            <note type="margin"> [D. X. c. 0. </note> <lb/>
            lie. And if it happen otherwise, my friend, we shall do <lb/>
            as those who have been in love, when they deem their <lb/>
            love unprofitable,-they desist, though with violence; so <lb/>
            we in like manner, through this innate love of such poetry <lb/>
            that prevails in our best forms of government, shall be <lb/>
            well pleased to see it appear to be the best and truest; and <lb/>
            we shall hear it till it is able to make no further apology. <lb/>
            But we shall take along with us this discourse which we have <lb/>
            held, as a counter-charm, and incantation, being afraid to <lb/>
            fall back again into a childish and vulgar love. We may <lb/>
            perceive then that we are not to be much in earnest about <lb/>
            such poetry as this, as if it were a serious affair, and ap­ <lb/>
            proached to the truth ; but the hearer is to beware of it, and <lb/>
            to be afraid for the republic within himself, and to entertain <lb/>
            those opinions of poetry which we mentioned. I entirely <lb/>
            agree, said he. For great is the contest, friend Glaucon, <lb/>
            said I, great not such as it appears, to become a good or a <lb/>
            bad man : wherefore it is not right to be moved, either by <lb/>
            honour, or riches, or any magistracy whatever, or poetry, so <lb/>
            to neglect justice, and the other virtues. I agree with you, <lb/>
            from what we have argued, and so I think will any one else.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—However, we have not yet, said I, discussed <lb/>
            the greatest prize of virtue, and the rewards laid up for her. <lb/>
            You speak of some prodigious greatness, said he, if there be <lb/>
            other greater than those mentioned. But what is there, <lb/>
            said I, can be great in a little time ? for all this period from <lb/>
            infancy to old age is but little in respect of the whole. No­ <lb/>
            thing at all indeed, said he. What then ? Do you think an <lb/>
            immortal being ought to be much concerned about such a period, <lb/>
            and not about the whole of time ? I think, said he, about the <lb/>
            whole. Butwhy do you mention this? Have you not perceived, <lb/>
            said I, that our sOul is immortal, and never perishes ? On which <lb/>
            he, looking at me, and wondering, said, By Jupiter, not I indeed. <lb/>
            But are you able to show this ? I should otherwise act un­ <lb/>
            justly, said 1. And I think you yourself can show it, for it is <lb/>
            not at all difficult. To me at least, said he, it is difficult; but <lb/>
            I would willingly hear from you this which is not difficult. <lb/>
            You shall hear then, said I. Only speak, he replied. Is <lb/>
            there not something, said I, which you call good, and some­ <lb/>
            thing which you call evil ? I own it. Do you conceive of <pb n="299"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            them, then, just in the way that I do? How? That which <lb/>
            destroys and corrupts everything is the evil, and what pre­ <lb/>
            serves and profits it is the good. I do, said he. But what? <lb/>
            Do you say, that there is something which is good, and <lb/>
            something which is bad, to each particular ? as blindness to <lb/>
            the eyes, and disease to every animal body, blasting to corn, <lb/>
            rottenness to wood, rust to brass and iron, and, as I say <lb/>
            almost every thing to its connate evil and disease? I do, <lb/>
            he replied. And when anything of this kind befals any­ <lb/>
            thing, does it not render that which it befals base, and in <lb/>
            the end dissolve and destroy it ? How should it not ? Its <lb/>
            own connate evil then and baseness destroys each particular; <lb/>
            or, if this does not destroy it, nothing else can ever destroy <lb/>
            it :-because that which is good can never destroy anything, <lb/>
            nor yet that which is neither good nor evil. How can they ? <lb/>
            said he. If then we shall be able to find among beings, any <lb/>
            one which has indeed some evil which renders it base, but is <lb/>
            not however able to dissolve and destroy it, shall we not then <lb/>
            know that a being thus constituted cannot be destroyed at <lb/>
            all? So it seems, replied he. What then ? said I :—is there <lb/>
            not something which renders the soul evil? Certainly, he <lb/>
            replied ; all these things which we have now mentioned,-in­ <lb/>
            justice, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance. But does any of <lb/>
            these then dissolve and destroy it ?-And attend now, that we <lb/>
            may not be imposed on, in thinking that an unjust and foolish <lb/>
            man, when detected acting unjustly, is then destroyed through <lb/>
            his injustice, which is the baseness of his soul: but consider <lb/>
            it thus :-As disease, which is the baseness of animal body, <lb/>
            dissolves and destroys body, and reduces it to be no longer <lb/>
            that body; so all those things we mentioned, being de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by their own proper evil adhering to them and pos­ <lb/>
            sessing them, are reduced to non-existence. Is it not so ? <lb/>
            Yes. Consider now the soul in the same manner. Does in­ <lb/>
            justice, and the rest of vice, possessing it, by possessing, and <lb/>
            adhering to it, corrupt and deface it, till, bringing it to death, <lb/>
            it separates it from the body ? By no means, said he. But <lb/>
            it were absurd, said I, that anything should be destroyed by <lb/>
            the baseness of another, but not by its own. Absurd. For <lb/>
            you must reflect, Glaucon, said I, that neither by the baseness <lb/>
            of victuals, whether owing to mouldiness, or rottenness, or <pb n="300"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 10. </note> <lb/>
            whatever else, do we think our body can be destroyed; but <lb/>
            if this baseness in them create in the body a depravity of <lb/>
            the body, we may allege, that through their means, the body <lb/>
            is destroyed by its own evil, which is disease. But we will <lb/>
            never allow that by the baseness of food, which is one thing, <lb/>
            the body, which is another thing, can ever by this foreign <lb/>
            evil, without creating in it its own peculiar evil, be at any time <lb/>
            destroyed. You speak most correctly, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—According to the same reasoning, then, said I, <lb/>
            unless the baseness of the body create a baseness of the soul, let <lb/>
            us never allow that the soul can be destroyed by an evil which is <lb/>
            foreign, without its own peculiar evil, one thing by the evil of <lb/>
            another. There is reason for it, said he. Let us, then, either <lb/>
            refute these things as not good reasoning; or, so long as they <lb/>
            are unrefuted, let us at no time say, that the soul shall be <lb/>
            ever in any degree the more destroyed, either by burning <lb/>
            fever, or by any other disease, or by slaughter, not even <lb/>
            though a man should cut the whole body into the smallest <lb/>
            parts possible, till some one show that, through these suffer­ <lb/>
            ings of the body, the soul herself becomes more unjust and <lb/>
            unholy. But we will never allow it to be said, that when a <lb/>
            foreign evil befals anything, whilst its own proper evil is <lb/>
            not within it, either the soul or anything else is destroyed. <lb/>
            But this, at least, said he, no one can ever show, that the <lb/>
            souls of those who die are by death rendered more unjust. <lb/>
            But if any one, replied I, shall dare to contend with us in <lb/>
            reasoning; and, in order that he may not be obliged to own <lb/>
            that souls are immortal, should say, that when a man dies he <lb/>
            becomes more wicked and unjust, we shall surely require <lb/>
            if he who says this speaks truly, that injustice is deadly to <lb/>
            the possessor, as a disease; and that those who embrace it are <lb/>
            destroyed by it as by a disease destructive in its own nature, <lb/>
            -those most speedily who embrace it most, and those more <lb/>
            slowly who embrace it less. And not as at present, where the <lb/>
            unjust die having this punishment inflicted on them by others. <lb/>
            By Jupiter, said he, injustice would not appear perfectly <lb/>
            dreadful, if it were deadly to him who practises it (for that <lb/>
            were a deliverance from evil); but I rather think it will <lb/>
            appear to be altogether the reverse, destroying others as far <lb/>
            as it can, but rendering the unjust extremely alive, and, <lb/>
            in conjunction with being alive, wakeful likewise; so far, <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 11.] </note> <lb/>
            as it seems, does it dwell from being deadly. You say <lb/>
            well, replied I; for, when a man's own wickedness and <lb/>
            peculiar evil is not sufficient to kill and destroy the soul, <lb/>
            that evil, which aims at the destruction of another, can <lb/>
            scarcely destroy a soul, or anything else but that against <lb/>
            which it is aimed. Hardly, indeed, said he, as I think at <lb/>
            least. Since, therefore, it is destroyed by no one evil, nei­ <lb/>
            ther peculiar nor foreign, is it not plain that, of necessity, it <lb/>
            always is ? and, if it always is, it is immortal ? Necessarily <lb/>
            so, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—Let this then, said I, be so settled :-and if it <lb/>
            be, you will perceive that the same souls will always remain, <lb/>
            for their number will never become less, none being destroyed, <lb/>
            nor will it become greater; for if, anyhow, the number of <lb/>
            immortals was made greater, you know it would take from <lb/>
            the mortal, and in the end all would be immortal. You say <lb/>
            true. But let us not, said I, think that this will be the case <lb/>
            (for reason will not allow of it), nor yet that the soul in its <lb/>
            truest nature is of such a kind as to be full of much variety, <lb/>
            dissimilitude, and difference considered in itself. How mean <lb/>
            you ? said he. That cannot easily, said I, be eternal which <lb/>
            is compounded of many things, and which has not the most <lb/>
            beautiful composition, as bath now appeared to us to be <lb/>
            the case with reference to the soul. It is not likely. That <lb/>
            the soul then is something immortal, both our present reason­ <lb/>
            ings, and others too, may oblige us to own : but in order to <lb/>
            know what kind of being the soul is, in truth, one ought not <lb/>
            to contemplate it as it is damaged both by its conjunction with <lb/>
            the body and by other evils, as we now behold it, but such <lb/>
            as it is when become pure, such it must by reasoning be fully <lb/>
            contemplated; and he (who does this) will find it far more <lb/>
            beautiful at least, and will more plainly see through justice, and <lb/>
            injustice, and everything which we have now discussed. We <lb/>
            are now telling the truth concerning it, such as it appears at <lb/>
            present. We have seen it, indeed, in the same condition in <lb/>
            which they see the marine Glaucus,* where they cannot easily <note type="footnote"> * According to the Greek Scholiast, Glaucus is said to have been the <lb/>
            son of Sisyphus and Merope, and to have become a marine demon. For, <lb/>
            meeting with an immortal fountain, and descending into it, he became <lb/>
            immortal. Not being able, however, to point out this fountain to certain <lb/>
            persons, he threw himself into the sea; and once every year coursed <lb/>
            round all shores and islands in conjunction with whales. </note> <pb n="302"/>

            perceive his ancient nature, because the ancient members of <lb/>
            his body are partly broken off, and others are worn away; <lb/>
            and he is altogether damaged by the waves : and, besides <lb/>
            this, other things are grown to him, such as shellfish, set­ <lb/>
            weed, and stones : so that he in every respect resembles a <lb/>
            beast, rather than what he naturally was. In such a condi­ <lb/>
            tion do we behold the soul under a thousand evils. But we <lb/>
            ought to behold it there, Glaucon. Where ? said he. In <lb/>
            its philosophy; and to observe to what it applies, and what <lb/>
            intimacies it professes, as being allied to that which is divine, <lb/>
            immortal, and eternal; and what it would become, if it wholly <lb/>
            pursued a thing of this kind, and were by this pursuit brought <lb/>
            out of that sea in which it now is, and had the stones and <lb/>
            shellfish shaken off from it, which, at present, as it is fed on <lb/>
            earth, render its nature, to a great extent, earthy, stony, and <lb/>
            savage, through those aliments, which are said to procure <lb/>
            felicity: and then one might behold its true nature, whether <lb/>
            multiform, or uniform, and everything concerning it. But <lb/>
            we have, I think, sufficiently discussed its passions, and forms <lb/>
            in human life. Assuredly, he replied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Have we not now, said I, discussed every­ <lb/>
            thing else in our reasonings, though we have not produced <lb/>
            those rewards and honours of justice (as you say Hesiod and <lb/>
            Homer do) ? but we find justice itself to be the best reward <lb/>
            to the soul; and that it ought to do what is just, whether it <lb/>
            have or have not Gyges' ring, and, together with such a ring, <lb/>
            the helmet* likewise of Pluto. You say most true, said he. <lb/>
            Will it not now, then, Glaucon, said I, be attended with no <lb/>
            envy, if, besides these, we add those rewards to justice and <lb/>
            the other virtues, which are bestowed on the soul by men and <lb/>
            gods, both whilst the man is alive, and after he is dead ? By <lb/>
            all means, said he. Will you, then, restore me what you bor­ <lb/>
            rowed in the reasoning? What, chiefly? I granted you, <lb/>
            that the just man should be deemed unjust, and the unjust be <lb/>
            deemed to be just. For you were of opinion, that though it <lb/>
            were not possible that these things should be concealed from <note type="footnote"> * The helmet of Pluto is said to be an immortal and invisible cloud, <lb/>
            with which the gods are invested when they wish not to be known to each <lb/>
            other. And it is applied as a proverb to those that do anything secretly. <lb/>
            —Schol. Græc. in Plat. p. 197. </note> <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            gods and men, it should, however, be granted, for the sake of <lb/>
            the argument, that justice in itself might be compared with <lb/>
            injustice in itself; do you not remember it ? I should, indeed, <lb/>
            be unjust, said he, if I did not.</p>
          <p>Now after the judgment is over, I demand again, in behalf <lb/>
            of justice, that as you allow it to be indeed esteemed both by <lb/>
            gods and men, you likewise allow it to have the same good <lb/>
            reputation, that it may also receive those prizes of victory, <lb/>
            which it acquires from the reputation of justice, and bestows <lb/>
            on those who possess it; since it has already appeared to be­ <lb/>
            stow those good things which arise from really being just, and <lb/>
            that it does not deceive those who truly embrace it. You <lb/>
            demand what is just, said he. Will you not, then, said I, in <lb/>
            the first place, restore me this ? That it is not concealed from <lb/>
            the gods, what kind of man each of the two is. We will grant <lb/>
            it, said he. And if they be not concealed, one of them will <lb/>
            be beloved of the gods, and one of them hated,* as we agreed <lb/>
            in the beginning. Such is the case. And shall we not agree, <lb/>
            that as to the man who is beloved of the gods, whatever <lb/>
            comes to him from the gods, will all be the best possible, <lb/>
            unless he has some necessary ill from former miscarriage ? Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. We are then to think thus of the just man. That if <lb/>
            he happen to be in poverty, or in diseases, or in any other of <lb/>
            those seeming evils, these things to him issue in something <lb/>
            good, either whilst alive or dead. For never at any time is <lb/>
            lie neglected by the gods, who inclines earnestly to endeavour <lb/>
            to become just, and practises virtue as far as it is possible for <lb/>
            man to resemble God. It is reasonable, replied he, that such <lb/>
            an one should not be neglected by him whom he resembles. <lb/>
            And are we not to think the reverse of these things concern­ <lb/>
            ing the unjust man ? Certainly. Such, then, would seem to <lb/>
            be the prizes which the just man receives from the gods. Such <lb/>
            they are, indeed, in my opinion, said he. But what, said I, <lb/>
            do they receive from men ? Is not the case thus (if we are to <lb/>
            suppose the truth) ? Do not cunning and unjust men do the <lb/>
            same thing as those racers, who run well at the beginning, <lb/>
            but not so at the end ? for at the first they briskly leap for­ <lb/>
            ward, but in the end they become ridiculous, and, with their <note type="footnote"> * That is to say, one of these through aptitude will receive the illu­ <lb/>
            minations of divinity, and the other through inaptitude will subject him­ <lb/>
            self to the power of avenging demons. </note> <pb n="304"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. X. c. 13. </note> <lb/>
            ears on their neck, they run off without any reward. But <lb/>
            such as are true racers, arriving at the end, both receive the <lb/>
            prizes, and are crowned. Does it not happen thus, for the <lb/>
            most part, as to just men ; that at the end of every action and <lb/>
            intercourse of life they are both held in esteem, and receive <lb/>
            rewards from men ? Entirely so. You will then suffer me <lb/>
            to say of these what you yourself said of the unjust. For I <lb/>
            will aver now, that the just, when they are grown up, shall <lb/>
            arrive at power if they desire magistracies, they shall marry <lb/>
            where they incline, and shall settle their children in marriage <lb/>
            agreeably to their wishes ; and everything else you mentioned <lb/>
            concerning the others, I now say concerning these. And on <lb/>
            the other hand, I will say of the unjust, that the most of <lb/>
            them, though they may remain concealed while young, yet, <lb/>
            being caught at the end of the race, are ridiculous; and, when <lb/>
            they become old, are wretched and ridiculed, and shall be <lb/>
            scourged both by foreigners and citizens, and afterwards tor­ <lb/>
            tured and burnt; which you said were terrible things;—and <lb/>
            you spoke the truth. You may suppose that you hear from <lb/>
            me that they suffer all these things. But see if you will <lb/>
            admit what I say. Certainly, said he, for you say what is <lb/>
            just.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—These then, said I, are the prizes, the re­ <lb/>
            wards and gifts, which a just man receives during life, both <lb/>
            from gods and men; besides those good things which justice <lb/>
            contains in itself. And they are extremely beautiful, said <lb/>
            he, and permanent. But these now, said I, are nothing <lb/>
            in number or magnitude, when compared with those which <lb/>
            await each of the two at death. And these things must like­ <lb/>
            wise be heard, that each of them may completely have what <lb/>
            is their due in the reasoning. You may say on, he replied, <lb/>
            as to one who would not listen to many other things with <lb/>
            greater pleasure. But, however, I will not, said I, tell you <lb/>
            the apologue of Alcinous; but that, indeed, of a brave man, <lb/>
            Erus the son of Armenius, by descent a Pamphylian; who <lb/>
            happening on a time to die in battle, when the dead were <lb/>
            on the tenth day carried off, already corrupted, was taken <lb/>
            up sound; and being carried home, as he was about to be <lb/>
            buried on the twelfth day, when laid on the funeral pile, <lb/>
            revived; and being revived, he told what he saw in the other <lb/>
            state, and said, that after his soul left the body, it went with <pb n="305"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            many others, and that they came to a certain mysterious, <lb/>
            hallowed place, where there were two chasms in the earth, <lb/>
            near to each other, and two other openings in the heavens <lb/>
            opposite on them, and that the judges sat between these;­ <lb/>
            that when they gave judgment, they commanded the just to <lb/>
            go on the right hand, and upwards through the heaven, having <lb/>
            fitted marks on the front of those that had been judged; but <lb/>
            the unjust they commanded to the left, and downwards, and <lb/>
            these likewise had behind them marks of all that they had <lb/>
            done. But when he came before the judges, they said he <lb/>
            ought to be a messenger to men concerning things there, <lb/>
            and they commanded him to hear, and contemplate every­ <lb/>
            thing therein ;-and that he saw there, through two openings, <lb/>
            one of the heaven, and one of the earth, the souls departing, <lb/>
            after they were there judged; and through the other two <lb/>
            openings he saw, rising through the one out of the earth, souls <lb/>
            full of squalidness and dust; and through the other, he saw <lb/>
            other souls descending pure from heaven; and that on their <lb/>
            arrival from time to time they seemed as if they came from a <lb/>
            long journey, and that they gladly went to rest themselves in <lb/>
            the meadow, as in a public assembly, and such as were ac­ <lb/>
            quainted saluted one another, and those who rose out of the <lb/>
            earth asked the others concerning the things above, and those <lb/>
            from heaven asked them concerning the things below, and <lb/>
            that they told one another : those wailing and weeping whilst <lb/>
            they called to mind, what and how many things they suffered <lb/>
            and saw in their journey under the earth (for it was a jour­ <lb/>
            ney of a thousand years); and that these again from heaven <lb/>
            explained their enjoyments, and spectacles of amazing beauty. <lb/>
            -To narrate many of them, Glaucon, would occupy much <lb/>
            time; but this, he said, was the sum, that whatever unjust <lb/>
            actions a man had committed, and whatever injuries a man <lb/>
            had committed, they were punished for all these separately <lb/>
            tenfold, and that it was in each, according to the rate of a <lb/>
            hundred years (the life of man being considered as so long), that <lb/>
            they might suffer tenfold punishment for the injustice they <lb/>
            had done;-so that if any had been the cause of many deaths, <lb/>
            either by betraying cities or armies, or bringing men into <lb/>
            slavery, or being confederates in any other wickedness, for <lb/>
            each of all these they reaped tenfold sufferings; and if, again, <lb/>
            they had benefited any by good deeds, and had been just and <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 14. </note> <lb/>
            holy, they were rewarded according to their deserts. Of <lb/>
            those who died very young, and lived but a little time, he <lb/>
            related other things not worth mentioning ;-but of im­ <lb/>
            piety and piety towards the gods and parents, and of suicide, <lb/>
            he told the more remarkable retributions; for he said he <lb/>
            was present when one was asked by another, where the <lb/>
            great Aridæus was ? This Aridaeus had been tyrant in a <lb/>
            certain city of Pamphylia a thousand years before that time, <lb/>
            and had killed his aged father and elder brother, and had done <lb/>
            many other unhallowed deeds, as was reported : and he said, <lb/>
            that the one who was asked, replied : He neither comes, <lb/>
            nor ever will come hither.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—Well then we saw this likewise, among <lb/>
            other dreadful spectacles: When we were near the mouth <lb/>
            of the opening, and were about to ascend after having <lb/>
            suffered everything else, we on a sudden beheld both him, and <lb/>
            others likewise, most of whom were tyrants, and there were <lb/>
            some private persons who had committed great iniquity, whom, <lb/>
            when they thought they were to ascend, the mouth of the <lb/>
            opening did not admit, but bellowed when any of those who <lb/>
            were so polluted with wickedness, or who had not been suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently punished, attempted to ascend. And then, said he, <lb/>
            fierce men, and fiery to look on, standing by, and perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing the bellowing, took some of them and led them apart, <lb/>
            but Aridseus and the rest, having bound their hands and feet, <lb/>
            and head, they thrust down and flayed, and then dragged <lb/>
            them to an outer road, tearing them on thorns; declaring <lb/>
            always to those who passed by, on what accounts they suf­ <lb/>
            fered these things, and that they were carrying them to be <lb/>
            thrown into Tartarus. And hence, he said, that amidst all <lb/>
            their various terrors, this terror surpassed, lest the mouth <lb/>
            should bellow, and that when it was silent every one most <lb/>
            gladly ascended; and that the punishments and torments <lb/>
            were such as these, and their rewards were the reverse of <lb/>
            these. He also added, that every one arising thence, after <lb/>
            they had been seven days in the meadow, was required to <lb/>
            depart on the eighth day, and arrive at another place on the <lb/>
            fourth day after, whence they perceived from above through <lb/>
            the whole heaven and earth, a light extended as a pillar, <lb/>
            mostly resembling the rainbow, but more splendid and pure ; <lb/>
            at which they arrived in one days journey; and thence they <pb n="307"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. c. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            perceived, through the middle of the light from heaven, the <lb/>
            extremities of its ligatures extended; as this light was the <lb/>
            belt of heaven, like the transverse beams of ships keeping the <lb/>
            whole circumference united ;-that from the extremities the <lb/>
            distaff of Necessity is extended, by which all the revolutions <lb/>
            were turned round, whose spindle and point were both of <lb/>
            adamant, but its whirl commingled both with this and other <lb/>
            things; and that the nature of the whirl was of such a kind, <lb/>
            as to its figure, as is any one we see here. But you must <lb/>
            conceive it, from what he said, to be of such a kind as this: <lb/>
            as if in some great hollow whirl, carved throughout, there was <lb/>
            such another, but lesser, within it, adapted, to it, like casks <lb/>
            fitted one within another; and in the same manner a third, <lb/>
            and a fourth, and four others, for that the whirls were eight * <lb/>
            in all, as circles one within another, having their lips appear­ <lb/>
            ing upwards, and forming round the spindle one united con­ <lb/>
            vexity of one whirl; that the spindle was driven through the <lb/>
            middle of the eight; and that the first and outmost whirl <lb/>
            had the widest circumference in the lip, that the sixth had <lb/>
            the second wide, and that of the fourth the third wide, <lb/>
            and the fourth that of the eighth, and the fifth that of <lb/>
            the seventh, the sixth that of the fifth, and the seventh <lb/>
            that of the third, and the eighth that of the second. <lb/>
            Likewise that the circle of the largest is variegated, that of <lb/>
            the seventh is the brightest, and that of the eighth has its <lb/>
            colour from the shining of the seventh; those of the second <lb/>
            and fifth resemble each other, but are more yellow than the <lb/>
            rest. But the third is bright white, the fourth reddish, the <lb/>
            second in whiteness surpasses the sixth ; and the distaff must <lb/>
            turn round in a circle with the whole that it carries; and while <lb/>
            the whole is turning round, the seven inner circles are gently <lb/>
            turned round in a contrary motion to the whole ;-again, that <lb/>
            of these, the eighth moves the swiftest; and next to it, and <lb/>
            equal to one another, the seventh, the sixth, and the fifth; <lb/>
            and that the third went in a motion which as appeared to <lb/>
            them completed its circle in the same way as the fourth. The <lb/>
            fourth in swiftness was the third, and the fifth was the second, <lb/>
            and it was turned round on the knees of Necessity ;-and that <lb/>
            on each of its circles there was seated a Siren on the upper <note type="footnote"> * By the eight whirls, we must understand the eight starry spheres, <lb/>
            viz. the sphere of the fixed stars, and the spheres of the seven planets. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <pb n="308"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 15. </note> <lb/>
            side, carried round, and uttering one voice variegated by <lb/>
            diverse modulations; but that the whole of them, being eight, <lb/>
            composed one harmony;-that there were other three sitting <lb/>
            round at equal distance one from another, each on a throne, the <lb/>
            daughters of Necessity, the Fates, clothed in white vestments, <lb/>
            and having crowns on their heads; Lachesis, Clotho, and <lb/>
            Atropos, singing to the harmony of the Sirens; Lachesis sing­ <lb/>
            ing the past, Clotho the present, and Atropos the future. And <lb/>
            that Clotho, at certain intervals, with her right hand laid <lb/>
            hold of the spindle, and along with her mother turned about <lb/>
            the outer circle ;-and Atropos, in like manner, turned the <lb/>
            inner ones with her left hand,-and that Lachesis touched <lb/>
            both of these, severally, with either hand.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—After they arrive here, it is necessary for <lb/>
            them to go directly to Lachesis. That then a certain prophet <lb/>
            first of all ranges them in order, and afterwards taking the <lb/>
            lots, and the models of lives, from the knees of Lachesis, and <lb/>
            ascending a lofty tribunal, he says :-The speech of the virgin <lb/>
            Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity : Souls of a day ! The <lb/>
            beginning of another period of men of mortal race: — the <lb/>
            demon shall not receive you as his lot, but you shall choose <lb/>
            the demon : he who draws the first, let him first make choice <lb/>
            of a life, to which he must of necessity adhere : Virtue is in­ <lb/>
            dependent, of which every one shall partake, more or less, <lb/>
            according as he honours or dishonours her: the cause is in <lb/>
            him who makes the choice, and the Deity is blameless ;-that <lb/>
            when he had said these things, he threw the lots on all of <lb/>
            them, and that each took up the one which fell beside him, <lb/>
            except himself, for he was not permitted ; and that when each <lb/>
            had taken it, he knew what number he had drawn ;-that <lb/>
            after this he placed on the ground before them the models of <lb/>
            lives, many more than those we see at present;—and that <lb/>
            they were all various,-for there were lives of all sorts of <lb/>
            animals, and human lives of every kind ;-and that among <lb/>
            these there were tyrannies also, some of them perpetual, and <lb/>
            others destroyed in the midst of their greatness, and ending <lb/>
            in poverty, banishment, and want. That there were also <lb/>
            lives of renowned men, some for their appearance as to beauty, <lb/>
            strength, and agility; and others for their descent, and the <lb/>
            virtues of their ancestors. There were the lives of renowned <lb/>
            women in the same manner. But that there was no disposi- <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. C. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            tion of soul among these models, because of necessity, on <lb/>
            choosing a different life, it becomes different itself. As to <lb/>
            other things, riches and poverty, sickness and health, they <lb/>
            were mixed with one another, and some were in a middle <lb/>
            station between these.</p>
          <p>There then, as it seems, friend Glaucon, is the whole danger <lb/>
            of man. And hence this of all things is most to be attended <lb/>
            to, how each of us, omitting other studies, is to become an <lb/>
            inquirer and learner in this study, in order to be able to <lb/>
            learn and find out who will make him expert and intelligent <lb/>
            to discern a good life, and a bad; and to choose everywhere, <lb/>
            and at all times the best of what is possible, considering all <lb/>
            that we have mentioned, both compounded and separated <lb/>
            from one another, what they are with respect to the virtue of <lb/>
            life; and to understand what good or evil beauty produces <lb/>
            when mixed with poverty, or riches, and with this or the <lb/>
            other habit of soul; and what is effected by noble and <lb/>
            ignoble descent, by privacy, and by public station, by <lb/>
            strength and weakness, docility and indocility, and every­ <lb/>
            thing else of the kind which naturally pertains to the <lb/>
            soul, and likewise of what is acquired, when blended one <lb/>
            with another, so as to be able from all these things to com­ <lb/>
            pute, and, having an eye to the nature of the soul, to com­ <lb/>
            prehend both the worse and the better life, pronouncing that <lb/>
            to be the worse which shall lead the soul to become more <lb/>
            unjust, and that to be the better life which shall lead it to <lb/>
            become more just, and to dismiss every other consideration : <lb/>
            forwe have seen, that in life, and in death, this is the <lb/>
            best choice. It is necessary, therefore, that a man should <lb/>
            have this opinion firm as an adamant in him, when he <lb/>
            departs to Hades, that there also he may be unmoved by <lb/>
            riches, or any such evils, and may not, falling into tyrannies, <lb/>
            and other such practices, do many and incurable mischiefs, <lb/>
            and himself suffer still greater: but may know how to choose <lb/>
            always the middle life, as to these things, and to shun the <lb/>
            extremes on either hand, both in this life as far as is pos­ <lb/>
            sible, and in the whole future. For thus man becomes <lb/>
            happy.</p>
          <p>CHAp. XVI.—At that time, therefore, the messenger from <lb/>
            the other world further told how that the prophet spoke thus: <lb/>
            Even to him who comes last, if he chooses with judgment, <pb n="310"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. X. C. 16. </note> <lb/>
            and lives consistently, there is prepared a desirable life; <lb/>
            not bad. Let neither him who is first be negligent in his <lb/>
            choice, not let him who is last despair. He said, that when <lb/>
            the prophet had spoken these things, the first who drew a lot <lb/>
            ran instantly and chose the greatest tyranny, but through <lb/>
            folly and insatiableness had not sufficiently examined all <lb/>
            things on making his choice, but was ignorant that in this <lb/>
            life there was this destiny, the devouring of his own chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and other evils; and that afterwards, when he had <lb/>
            considered it at leisure, he wailed and lamented his choice, <lb/>
            not having observed the admonitions of the prophet above <lb/>
            mentioned ;-inasmuch as he did not accuse himself, as the <lb/>
            author of his misfortunes, but fortune and the demons, and <lb/>
            everything rather than himself. He added, that he was one of <lb/>
            those who came from heaven, who had in his former life lived <lb/>
            in a regulated republic, and had been virtuous by custom <lb/>
            without philosophy; and that, in short, among these there <lb/>
            were not a few who came from heaven, as being unexercised <lb/>
            in trials; but most of those who came from earth, as they <lb/>
            had endured hardships themselves, and had seen others in <lb/>
            hardships, did not precipitately make their choice. And <lb/>
            hence, and through the fortune of the lot, to most souls there <lb/>
            was an exchange of good and evil things. Since, if one <lb/>
            should always, whenever he comes into this life, soundly <lb/>
            philosophize, and the lot of election should not fall on him the <lb/>
            very last, it would seem, from what has been told us from <lb/>
            thence, that he shall be happy not only here, but when he goes <lb/>
            hence, and his journey hither back again shall not be earthy, <lb/>
            and rugged, but smooth and heavenly. This spectacle, he <lb/>
            said, was worthy to behold, in what manner the several souls <lb/>
            made choice of their lives; for it was pitiful and ridiculous <lb/>
            and wonderful to behold, as each for the most part chose <lb/>
            according to the habit of his former life; for he alleged, <lb/>
            that he saw the soul which was formerly the soul of Orpheus <lb/>
            making choice of the life of a swan, through hatred of woman­ <lb/>
            kind, being unwilling to be born of woman on account of the <lb/>
            death he suffered from them. He saw likewise the soul of <lb/>
            Thamyris making choice of the life of a nightingale. And <lb/>
            he saw also a swan turning to the choice of human life; and <lb/>
            other musical animals in a similar manner, as is likely;-and <lb/>
            he saw also one soul, while making its choice, choosing the life <pb n="311"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. X. c. 16.] </note> <lb/>
            of a lion ; and it was the soul of Telamonian Ajax, unwilling <lb/>
            to become a man, because it recollected the judgment given <lb/>
            with reference to the armour ;-that he then saw the soul of <lb/>
            Agamemnon, which, in hatred also of the human kind, through <lb/>
            his misfortunes, exchanged it for the life of an eagle : and <lb/>
            that the soul of Atalante, choosing her lot amidst the rest, <lb/>
            and, having attentively observed the great honours paid <lb/>
            to an athletic man, was unable to pass by this lot, but took it. <lb/>
            Next to this, he saw the soul of Epeus the Panopean going <lb/>
            into the nature of a skilful workwoman; and that far off, <lb/>
            among the last, he saw the soul of the buffoon Thersites <lb/>
            assuming the ape. And that by chance he saw the soul <lb/>
            of Ulysses, who had drawn its lot last of all, going to <lb/>
            make its choice : that in remembrance of its former toils, <lb/>
            and tired of ambition, it went about a long time seeking <lb/>
            the life of a private man of no business, and with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty found it lying somewhere, neglected by the rest. <lb/>
            And that on seeing this life, it said, that it would have made <lb/>
            the same choice even if it had obtained the first lot,—and <lb/>
            joyfully chose it. That in like manner the souls of wild <lb/>
            beasts went into men, and men again into beasts: the unjust <lb/>
            changing into wild beasts, and the just into tame; and that <lb/>
            they were blended by all sorts of mixtures. After, therefore, <lb/>
            all the souls had chosen their lives according as they drew <lb/>
            their lots, they all went in order to Lachesis, and that she <lb/>
            gave to every one the demon he chose, and sent him along <lb/>
            with him to be the guardian of his life, and the accomplisher <lb/>
            of what he had chosen.-That, first of all, he conducts the <lb/>
            soul to Clotho, to ratify under her hand, and by the whirl of <lb/>
            the vortex of her spindle, the destiny it had chosen by lot: <lb/>
            and, after being with her, he leads it back again to the spin­ <lb/>
            ning of Atropos, who makes the destinies irreversible. And that <lb/>
            from hence they proceed directly under the throne of Neces­ <lb/>
            sity ; and that, after he had passed by it, as all the others <lb/>
            passed, they all of them marched into the plain of Lethe <lb/>
            amidst dreadful heat and scorching, for he said that it is void <lb/>
            of trees and everything that the earth produces;—that when <lb/>
            night came on, they encamped beside the river Amelete, whose <lb/>
            water no vessel contains.-Of this water all of them must <lb/>
            necessarily drink a certain quantity, and such as are not kept <lb/>
            by prudence drink more than they ought, and that he who from <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. x. c. 16. </note> <lb/>
            time to time drinks forgets everything:—And, after they were <lb/>
            laid asleep, and midnight was approaching, there was thunder, <lb/>
            and an earthquake, and they were thence on a sudden carried <lb/>
            upwards, some one way, and some another, approaching to <lb/>
            generation like stars. And he himself was forbidden to drink <lb/>
            of the water. Where, however, and in what manner, he came <lb/>
            into his body, he was entirely ignorant; but, suddenly look­ <lb/>
            ing up in the morning, he saw himself already laid on the <lb/>
            funeral pile. And this fable, Glaucon, has been preserved, <lb/>
            and is not lost, and it will preserve us, too, if we be per­ <lb/>
            suaded thereby, for thus we shall happily pass over the river <lb/>
            Lethe, and shall not pollute our souls.</p>
          <p>But if the company will be persuaded by me ; considering <lb/>
            the soul to be immortal, and able to bear all evil and good, <lb/>
            we shall always persevere in the road which leads upwards, <lb/>
            and shall by all means pursue justice in unison with prudence, <lb/>
            that so we may be friends both to ourselves and the gods, <lb/>
            both whilst we remain here, and when we afterwards receive <lb/>
            its rewards, like victors assembled together; and so, both <lb/>
            here, and in that journey of a thousand years, which we have <lb/>
            described, we shall be happy.</p>

          </head>
          <p>THE following Dialogue, which comprises the detailed evolution <lb/>
            of the physical or cosmological doctrines of Plato, is supposed to <lb/>
            have taken place on the day following that on which Socrates had <lb/>
            been discussing with the same party the nature of an ideal or pat­ <lb/>
            tern Republic ; and there is so far an internal connexion between <lb/>
            the two dialogues, that both will be found to contain the same <lb/>
            doctrines of the Ideas (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἲδη</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέι</foreign>) and the Summum bonum (viz. <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒν</foreign> in contradistinction to TO yty<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμενον</foreign>. Comp. Tim. ch. IX.),, <lb/>
            though presented under different aspects,-the former treating <lb/>
            them in their relation to moral and political perfection, the latter <lb/>
            physically and cosmologically, displaying the beauty, perfection, <lb/>
            and benevolence of the Divine work in the formation of the <lb/>
            Universe and the organization of Man. The dialogue opens with <lb/>
            a lively conversation on the political notions set forth by Socrates <lb/>
            (or rather elicited by him from the rest) on the preceding day, <lb/>
            more especially with reference to their practicability in real life <lb/>
            (ch. i.-iii.) :-and Critias, to gratify Socrates, introduces the <lb/>
            narrative of a long interview between Solon and some Egyptian <lb/>
            priests, about the relative antiquity of the Grecian and Egyptian <lb/>
            annals, the object of which is to prove, that the state of Athens, <lb/>
            in very remote times, corresponded mainly with the picture of a <lb/>
            perfect republic, as exhibited by Socrates (ch. iv.-vii.). The <lb/>
            subject, however, is deemed worthy of still further investigation <lb/>
            by the different parties present; and the first turn is unani­ <lb/>
            mously conceded to Timæus, the Pythagorean, on account of his <lb/>
            profound knowledge of physics and astronomy, who accordingly <lb/>
            entertains them with a long and learned discourse on the origin <lb/>
            of the Universe and the formation of Man,—Critias following him <lb/>
            in the succeeding dialogue called by his name, wherein he tries to <lb/>
            show that the men here ideally created (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ λόγψγεγονότας</foreign>) by <lb/>
            Timaeus, and brought into civil training by Socrates in the <lb/>
            Republic, actually corresponded in character with the citizens of <lb/>
            primitive Athens (ch. vii., viii.).</p>
          <p>It is necessary to premise, however, before we enter into any <lb/>
            analysis of Timæus's discourse, that Plato, regarded as a phy­ <lb/>
            sical theorist, was not so much the propounder of new and <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            original views, as a critic and eclecticist, reviewing the various <lb/>
            systems that had preceded him, opposing what he deemed false <lb/>
            or vicious, and adopting what he thought good and solid in each. <lb/>
            Now all the earlier philosophers, whether of Ionia or Magna <lb/>
            Crania, had made it their first business to start different theories <lb/>
            more or less visionary, on the origin of the Universe. Thales <lb/>
            held the primary element to be water, Anaximenes and Diogenes <lb/>
            air, Anaximander a vast chaos, and Heraclitusfire,—to whom at <lb/>
            length succeeded Anaxagoras, the first to recognise a Supreme <lb/>
            Intelligence (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>) as the principle of life and arranger of the <lb/>
            primitive chaotic atoms (and from whom Plato undoubtedly <lb/>
            took some of his leading notions). Widely differing from the <lb/>
            above, Xenophanes maintained unity (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>)—the Universe, to be <lb/>
            God,-a notion, which elicited from Parmenides the atheistic <lb/>
            dogma, that, as existence is conceivable, and non-existence is not <lb/>
            so, creation is impossible, as it pre-supposes non-existence; and in <lb/>
            this view he was followed by Empedocles, who regarded all <lb/>
            things as alike uncreated and indestructible. When such notions <lb/>
            were current, it can scarcely be matter for surprise that Heraclitus <lb/>
            should have put forth the doctrine (equally atheistical) of a per­ <lb/>
            petual flux, and been followed by the sophist Protagoras, who <lb/>
            stated that all knowledge is sensation, and that man is the <lb/>
            measure of all existing thing? whatever. And lastly, it was the <lb/>
            notion of Pythagoras (with whose views Plato was beyond <lb/>
            all doubt deeply imbued), that numbers and music are the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of the entire universe, and that the world is regulated by <lb/>
            numerical harmony * With all these conflicting views before <lb/>
            him, and having at the same time a strong internal conviction <lb/>
            of one grand, comprehensive, and intelligent Unity,-in other <lb/>
            words, God,—Plato at once boldly impugned the doctrine of the <lb/>
            Eleatics, that the world around was an eternal, immutable <lb/>
            essence;—maintaining, on the other hand, that, as it was sen­ <lb/>
            sible, it must have been produced, and was in fact the necessary <lb/>
            result of an effective cause,—the work of a rational, intelligent, <lb/>
            and benevolent Architect.</p>
          <p>Timaeus, therefore, in this dialogue,-after stating in limine <lb/>
            that there are two classes of things, the one eternal, constant <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτόν</foreign>), and not subject to change ; the other mutable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θάτερον</foreign>), <lb/>
            generated, and liable to decay: the former of which is compre­ <lb/>
            bended by the intellect, the latter by the senses,-broadly sets <lb/>
            forth the grand doctrine of Theism, that whatever is generated <lb/>
            must proceed from some cause, namely God, who formed the <lb/>
            sensible universe, the most perfect of things generated, according <note type="footnote"> * The reader is referred for further information on the pre-Socratic <lb/>
            theories of nature, to Stallbaum's Prolegomena to the Timæus, pp. 48—54 ; <lb/>

             <pb n="315"/>
            to an eternal pattern existing in the Divine Mind (ch. ix.). The <lb/>
            whole, indeed, was the work of the Creator's goodness ; and the <lb/>
            universe itself likewise was very good,-as it were, an ensouled, <lb/>
            rational, living being,-perfect in unity, and composed of four <lb/>
            elements indissolubly united,-earth and fire, air and water,-its <lb/>
            shape being that of a perfect sphere moving in a circular orbit, <lb/>
            and its soul emanating from its abode in the centre to all the <lb/>
            other parts, including even the external surface,—in fine, it <lb/>
            came forth from its Maker deficient in no single respect, " a <lb/>
            blessed God" (ch. x.—xii.).</p>
          <p>He next proceeds to unfold the nature and structure of the <lb/>
            Universe in its several parts. And first, he assumes it to consist <lb/>
            of two parts,-one eternal and fixed, because related to the world <lb/>
            of intellect; the other corporeal, mutable, and capable of divi­ <lb/>
            sion,—both of which are so united on the principles of number <lb/>
            and music, as to produce a happy and well-settled harmony both <lb/>
            in structure and motion. This universal soul, moreover, per­ <lb/>
            vades even the distant orbits of the fixed stars and planets, all <lb/>
            of which depend for their life and circular motion on the eternal <lb/>
            and constant principles of number and harmony,-the fixed <lb/>
            stars moving westward on the eternal principle of sameness, the <lb/>
            planets eastward on that of mutability and difference (ch. xii.). <lb/>
            But in connexion with this soul, the universe possesses also a <lb/>
            material body, whereby it becomes cognizant of material things, <lb/>
            -the subjects of opinion and persuasion, as well as of the abs­ <lb/>
            tract truths that form the groundwork of reasoning and science <lb/>
            (ch. xiii.).* Next came the creation of time, which was effected <lb/>
            by the formation of the sun, moon, and five planets, whose <lb/>
            motion, particularly that of the first, creates, determines, and <lb/>
            watches over, the several divisions of days and nights, months <lb/>
            and perfect years (ch. xiv.). The form and motions of the <lb/>
            world thus once arranged, the Creator proceeds to people it with <lb/>
            living beings,—first, the heavenly gods (i. e. the stars and other <note type="footnote"> * Plato, in ch. xxiii. designates matter as the receptacle, and, as it were, <lb/>
            the nurse (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποδοχὴν, οῑον τιθήνην</foreign>) of all production ; while God, on the <lb/>
            other hand,-the sum of all ideas,-is the Father and fashioner of the <lb/>
            Universe. In ch. xxvi. also, it is described as one and the same with <lb/>
            space, which furnishes a place for all generated things. This principle of <lb/>
            nature, therefore, is without form,-without an idea; and it is only in the <lb/>
            productions of the creative energy and the all-susceptible nature,-that is, <lb/>
            in the son of the father and mother,-that there is form and determinate <lb/>
            idea. This is clearly laid down in ch. xxiv.; and Ritter accordingly very <lb/>
            rightly observes ;-" Matter is nothing more than the condition of all <lb/>
            human existence, which, however, is a necessary condition, and so causes <lb/>
            the natural itself to appear as necessary; whereas the shape received from <lb/>
            the good is that which under this condition comes into being and has its <lb/>
            actual existence in nature."—(Ritier, ii. p. 341, compared with ch. xliii. <lb/>
            of this Dialogue.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            celestial bodies) ; secondly, airy and winged creatures ; thirdly, <lb/>
            those living in the water; and lastly, those moving on the earth. <lb/>
            The stars, indeed, are termed a race of heavenly gods, yet gene­ <lb/>
            rated and visible, endowed with fiery, spherical bodies, and <lb/>
            called immortal, as not being subject to dissolution or decay <lb/>
            (ch. xv.) ; but whether the earth itself is, like the other bodies, <lb/>
            to be considered an ensouled, generated god, and whether at rest <lb/>
            or in motion, is not exactly certain.</p>
          <p>Next follows a narrative, almost purely mythical, of the for­ <lb/>
            mation of the mortal races of animals (ch. xvi.-xviii.), which <lb/>
            the Supreme himself does not deign personally to create, but <lb/>
            commits that task to the lower gods, reserving only the office of <lb/>
            imparting to these new creatures whatever was to be immortal <lb/>
            in their constitution. A like number of these perishable animals <lb/>
            is assigned to each of the stars ; and the first birth being the same <lb/>
            in all,-that of the human male ; nor was it till after a fixed <lb/>
            period, that the female and all other animals,-beasts, fishes, and <lb/>
            birds,-issued from this mortal form. Of this being, Man, con­ <lb/>
            sisting, like the universe, of body and soul mysteriously con­ <lb/>
            joined, Timæus next gives a detailed description, beginning with <lb/>
            the head, which contains the leading organs of sense (ch. xix., <lb/>
            xx.) ; and he then diverges into a long investigation of the <lb/>
            elements of earthly bodies, particularly as respects their geo­ <lb/>
            metric forms, as well also, as of their various affections, viz. <lb/>
            motion or rest, heat or cold, heaviness or lightness, smell, <lb/>
            colour, &amp;c., the discussion of which must necessarily precede <lb/>
            any satisfactory account of the intellectual and physical man <lb/>
            (ch. xxi.-xlii.). Man, he proceeds to observe, is composed of <lb/>
            a corruptible body enshrining an immortal soul; but besides <lb/>
            this, he possesses an inferior sort of soul, whereby he becomes <lb/>
            cognizant of the various passions and emotions, viz., pleasure <lb/>
            and pain, hope, fear, anger, desire, &amp;c.; and all the parts of <lb/>
            his body are composed with wonderful skill, and yet kept in <lb/>
            constant subjection to the dominance of reason and intel­ <lb/>
            lect :-and he now parenthetically intimates the existence of <lb/>
            two sets of causes,-the divine and necessary,—as constantly <lb/>
            operating together; of the former of which we can gain only a <lb/>
            very imperfect knowledge (though for our happiness' sake we <lb/>
            should ever aspire thereto), while the latter we should investigate <lb/>
            for the sake of getting at the former (ch. xliii.).</p>
          <p>Next succeed separate and particular (though somewhat <lb/>
            fanciful) descriptions of the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, spleen, <lb/>
            intestines, spinal marrow and brain, skull and bones, liga­ <lb/>
            ments and tendons, muscles and flesh, the nerves round the <lb/>
            head, teeth, tongue, lips, hair, skin, pores, &amp;c. &amp;c., all of <lb/>
            which are kept in healthy action by the united operation of <lb/>
            the alimentary and respiratory systems (ch. xliv.—lxii.),—the <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            object of the whole of these speculations being to show the <lb/>
            existence of design and the adaptation of means to ends through­ <lb/>
            out the work of creation. Now the regular, unimpeded, action <lb/>
            of all these organs and component parts constitutes bodily <lb/>
            health ; whereas the disorders and decay of the component <lb/>
            elements of life are either productive of disease or else slowly <lb/>
            bring on old age and bodily decay (ch. lxii.). Then follow <lb/>
            some curious details respecting the diseases of the body, which <lb/>
            are ascribed to many various causes, mostly fanciful,-some <lb/>
            few only real, formed on a knowledge of the human frame <lb/>
            (ch. lxiii.—lxviii.). Far more important, however, and far <lb/>
            more severe, are the diseases of the soul; and these are assigned <lb/>
            to two causes,—first, bodily infirmity, and secondly, improper <lb/>
            training, it being a vulgar error to suppose that any one is <lb/>
            willingly evil. The great, and indeed only disease of the soul, <lb/>
            is madness, which assumes two forms,-madness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μανία</foreign>), and <lb/>
            folly or idiocy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμαθία</foreign>), both caused by the unhealthy predomi­ <lb/>
            nance of the animal passions over the reason and conscience. <lb/>
            Great care must therefore be observed constantly to maintain <lb/>
            the mens sana in corpore sano, to attend diligently to both, with­ <lb/>
            out neglecting either,-to form the body by constant and suitable <lb/>
            exercise as well as strict temperance, and to cultivate the soul by <lb/>
            engaging the intellect in the contemplation of divine things and <lb/>
            eternal truth, including those heavenly revolutions with which <lb/>
            the human soul also has a close relation and harmony (ch. lxix. <lb/>
            —lxxi.).</p>
          <p>The concluding chapters of the dialogue comprise some ob­ <lb/>
            servations on the origin of the lower animals, from which <lb/>
            it appears that Plato entertained the Pythagorean doctrine of <lb/>
            the transmigration of souls; for he thinks it probable that <lb/>
            those who have lived unrighteously and effeminately will, at <lb/>
            their second birth, be changed into women,-those of both <lb/>
            sexes who have lived innocently but frivolously, foolishly be­ <lb/>
            lieving that heavenly things could be seen by mortal eye, being <lb/>
            changed into birds of the air; those, thirdly, who have been <lb/>
            totally estranged from philosophy, into beasts of the earth ; and <lb/>
            those, fourthly, who are to the last degree foolish and ignorant, <lb/>
            becoming mere fishes, creatures of the water, to whom the gods <lb/>
            that formed them have denied even the privilege of breathing <lb/>
            a thin and pure atmosphere (ch. lxxii., lxxiii., compared with <lb/>
            ch. xvii., where he touches, though more briefly, on the same <lb/>
            philosophic dogma). Lastly, the whole dialogue concludes with <lb/>
            a brief, but elegant summary of the great doctrine, of which the <lb/>
            philosopher has exhibited throughout it so many satisfactory <lb/>
            proofs,-that "this world, which comprises and is filled with <lb/>
            all kinds of living beings, both mortal and immortal, thus <lb/>
            becomes a visible animal embracing visible natures,-an image <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            of the great Intelligence,-a sensible god,—the greatest and best, <lb/>
            the fairest and most perfect,-this the one and only begotten <lb/>
            Universe."</p>
          <p>Such is a succinct account of the leading arguments of the <lb/>
            Timæus, which, both as respects language and deep philoso­ <lb/>
            phic matter, is by far the most difficult of any of Plato's <lb/>
            dialogues,-there being many passages in it, which still in fact <lb/>
            puzzle even the most ingenious of its commentators. The reader <lb/>
            who would seek further information than can be afforded within <lb/>
            the limits of a translation, is referred to Tiedemann's Introduc­ <lb/>
            tions to the Platonic Dialogues, to Stallbaum's Prolegomena and <lb/>

          <p>I.—Soc. One, two, three :-but where, dear Timæus, is that <lb/>
            fourth of us who yesterday were your guests, but are enter­ <lb/>
            tainers now ?</p>
          <p>TIM. Some illness has befallen him, Socrates; for he would <lb/>
            not willingly have missed such a meeting as the present.</p>
          <p>Soc. It is your business, then, of yourself, and [that of] <lb/>
            these present, to fill up the place of the absent guest.</p>
          <p>TIM. Quite so, Socrates; and, as far as we can, we will <lb/>
            not fail to do so : for it would be unjust for the rest of us, <lb/>
            whom you yesterday so handsomely entertained, not to treat <lb/>
            you with readiness in return.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you recollect, then, the magnitude and nature of <lb/>
            the things on which I charged you to speak ?</p>
          <p>TIM. Some, indeed, we do recollect; but what we do not, <lb/>
            you, who were present, can recal to our memory: or rather, <lb/>
            if it be not too much trouble, once more briefly run over the <lb/>
            whole from the beginning, that it may be the more firmly esta­ <lb/>
            blished in our minds.</p>
          <p>Soc. Be it so. The sum of yesterday's discussion re­ <lb/>
            specting a republic was, what form I thought the best, and of <lb/>
            what sort of men it should be composed.</p>
          <p>TIM. And indeed, Socrates, all that you said was quite <lb/>
            according to our mind.</p>
          <p>Soc. Did we not in the first place separate the class of <lb/>
            husbandmen, and ever so many other artificers, from that of <lb/>
            those who fight in defence of the state ?</p>
          <p>TIM. Yes.</p><pb n="320"/>
            
          <p>Soc. And when we had assigned to every one that single <lb/>
            employment which was suited to his own nature, and 'had <lb/>
            prescribed to each his particular art, we bade the military <lb/>
            caste confine themselves to the simple duty of protecting the <lb/>
            state from the hostile incursions both of internal and external <lb/>
            foes ;-mildly to administer justice to their subjects, as being <lb/>
            naturally friends, but fiercely to combat with such foes as <lb/>
            might fall in their way.</p>
          <p>TIM. Quite so, of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. We asserted, I think, that the souls of the guardians <lb/>
            should be naturally high-spirited, and at the same time <lb/>
            remarkably philosophic, so as to enable them towards either <lb/>
            friends or foes respectively to be gentle or severe.</p>
          <p>TIM. You did so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what about their training? Did we not say <lb/>
            that they ought to be instructed in gymnastic exercises, <lb/>
            music, and other suitable branches of science ?</p>
          <p>TIM. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. With respect at least to those thus trained, it was some­ <lb/>
            how said, that they should regard neither gold nor silver nor <lb/>
            any such property, as their own private possession, but rather, <lb/>
            like subordinates, should receive the wages of their guardian­ <lb/>
            ship from those whom they defend and preserve, their recom­ <lb/>
            pense being no more than sufficient for temperate men, and <lb/>
            that they should spend their income in common, with a view <lb/>
            only to mutual subsistence, bestowing their attention wholly <lb/>
            on virtue, in preference to every other pursuit.</p>
          <p>TIM. This too was so stated.</p>
          <p>II.—Soc. Respecting women, too, we asserted that their <lb/>
            nature should be aptly conformed to resemble that of men, <lb/>
            and that they should all engage in common with them, both <lb/>
            in the duties of war and the other employments of life.</p>
          <p>TIM. This too you alleged.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what about the procreation of children ? This <lb/>
            perhaps you easily remember, on account of the novelty of <lb/>
            the proposal; for we ordered that marriage-unions and chil­ <lb/>
            dren should be in common to all persons whatsoever, special <lb/>
            care being taken also that no one should be able to distinguish <lb/>
            his own children individually, but all consider all as their <lb/>
            kindred; regarding those of an equal age, and in the prime <lb/>
            of life, as their brothers and sisters,-those prior to them, <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            and yet further back, as parents and grandsires,—and those <lb/>
            below them, as their children and grandchildren.*</p>
          <p>TIM. Aye,—these things too, in the way you describe them, <lb/>
            are easily remembered.</p>
          <p>Soc. That they might at once acquire then the best pos­ <lb/>
            sible natural disposition, I recollect that we decreed that the <lb/>
            rulers, male and female, whom we placed over the mar­ <lb/>
            riage contract, should secretly contrive, through certain lots, <lb/>
            that the worthy should assort only with the worthy, the base <lb/>
            with the base,-and that no discord might arise from this <lb/>
            connexion, we should refer all the blame of the union to <lb/>
            fortune alone.</p>
          <p>TIM. This, too, we remember.</p>
          <p>Soc. We ordered, moreover, that the children of the good <lb/>
            should be properly trained, but those of the bad secretly sent <lb/>
            to the other part of the state, while of those who are con­ <lb/>
            stantly arriving at manhood, such as are found to be of a, <lb/>
            good disposition, should be recalled from exile; those, among <lb/>
            them, on the contrary, who have proved themselves unworthy, <lb/>
            being in their turn banished to the place occupied by those <lb/>
            just promoted.</p>
          <p>TIM. Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Have we, then, sufficiently summed up yesterdays <lb/>
            discussion; or do we need anything further, friend Timæus, <lb/>
            that has been omitted ?</p>
          <p>TIM. By no means, Socrates; for these were the very <lb/>
            things discussed.</p>
          <p>III.—SOC. You shall now hear some further details respect­ <lb/>
            ing the republic that we have described, and how I feel <lb/>
            towards it. The feeling, then, seems to me somewhat similar <lb/>
            to this,-as if some one, on beholding beautiful animals, <lb/>
            either wrought by the graver's art, or really alive, but in <lb/>
            a state of perfect rest, were to entertain a desire to behold <lb/>
            them in motion, struggling, as it were, in those exercises which <lb/>
            seem best suited to their bodies. Just the same do I feel <lb/>
            towards that form of state which we have described; for I <lb/>
            should gladly listen to any one who recited the story of <lb/>
            the contests that one state engages in with others, when it <lb/>
            ventures becomingly on war, and exhibits in the course of <note type="footnote"> * This subject is considered at some length in the third, fourth, and <lb/>
            fifth books of the Republic, as well as in the Laws, v. 739, b. </note> <note type="footnote"> r </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            it a conduct worthy of its nurture and training, as regards <lb/>
            both active encounters and verbal negotiations with indivi­ <lb/>
            dual states. On these points, indeed, Critias and Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates, I am conscious of my own inability to praise the men <lb/>
            and the state according to their desert; and that I should <lb/>
            be so incapable is no wonder, as I have formed the same <lb/>
            opinion respecting the poets both of the past and present <lb/>
            age ;-not that I despise the poet-tribe, but still every one <lb/>
            must see, that being an imitative race, they most easily and <lb/>
            in the best manner imitate those things in which they have <lb/>
            been trained; while, on the contrary, whatever is uncon­ <lb/>
            nected with their training, is hard for them to imitate well <lb/>
            even in actions, and in words even yet more difficult. And as <lb/>
            for the tribe of Sophists, I deem them indeed mighty clever, <lb/>
            both in multiplying words and many other fine accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments ; yet I fear, as they have no settled abode, but wander <lb/>
            through various cities, and dwell in no abode of their own, <lb/>
            they will form false conjectures respecting both philoso­ <lb/>
            phers and politicians, as to the magnitude and nature both of <lb/>
            the actions which they achieve in war, and of the words they <lb/>
            employ in their mutual intercourse. The only people remain­ <lb/>
            ing, then, to whom I can apply, are those of your character <lb/>
            and habit, versed both by nature and training in philosophy <lb/>
            and political science. For Timæus here of Locris, in Italy, <lb/>
            which is governed by the best of laws,* being withal not <lb/>
            inferior to any of his fellow-citizens in wealth and nobility, <lb/>
            has in his own state attained to the highest official honours, <lb/>
            and has likewise in my opinion reached the summit of all <lb/>
            philosophy. Critias, too, as we all know, is not ignorant of <lb/>
            the particulars that we are now mentioning ;—and respecting <lb/>
            Hermocrates also, we have ample testimony for the belief that <lb/>
            he is both by nature and education well suited to all these <lb/>
            pursuits.! Hence, when I perceived yesterday your great <note type="footnote"> * Its code was formed by Zaleucus, and it was said by the Syracusans <lb/>

            pleased at it, being well aware, that if you pleased, none could <lb/>
            better unfold the successive points for discussion; — inas­ <lb/>
            much as, by properly adapting the state for warlike purposes, <lb/>
            you would be the only person in the present age who could <lb/>

            spoken, then, in compliance with your request, I now require <lb/>
            you, in your turn, to comply with mine; and, as a matter of <lb/>
            course, you have agreed to carry on the discussion among <lb/>
            yourselves in common and so forthwith repay my hospitality <lb/>
            with the feast of reasoning. Here, therefore, am I arrayed <lb/>
            for the purpose, and readiest of all to partake of the promised <lb/>

          <p>—HERM. Aye, truly, Socrates, as Timæus here just <lb/>
            observed, neither will we lack zeal in fulfilling your desire ; nor <lb/>
            will we offer any excuse for neglecting it; since only yester­ <lb/>
            day, just after leaving this, when we went to the lodging <lb/>
            ofCritias, where both there and before that on the way <lb/>
            thither, we discussed this very subject. He here then un­ <lb/>
            folded to us a story from ancient tradition, which—prythee, <lb/>
            Critias, even now repeat to Socrates, that he may judge <lb/>
            whether or not it concerns his demand.</p>
          <p>CRI. This we must surely do, if agreeable to Timæus, our <lb/>
            third partner in this discussion.</p>
          <p>TIM. I, for my part, fully consent.</p>
          <p>CRI. Listen now then, Socrates, to a story very strange <lb/>
            indeed, yet in every respect true, as it was once related <lb/>
            by Solon, the wisest of the seven [sages of Greece]. He <lb/>
            was the kinsman and intimate friend of our great-grand­ <lb/>
            father Dropides, as he himself often tells us in his poems; <lb/>
            and he (Dropides) informed our grandfather Critias (as the <lb/>
            old man himself in turn told us), that this state had for­ <lb/>
            merly achieved great and admirable actions, the knowledge <lb/>
            of which nevertheless had been lost through lapse of time and <lb/>
            the decay of mankind,-one act in particular being more illus­ <lb/>
            trious than the rest,—in remembrance of which it were <lb/>
            fitting, that we should not only return you thanks, but also <lb/>
            in full assembly hymn forth to the godoess our true and just <lb/>
            acclaim of praise.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well observed:—but what is this achievement, <lb/>
            which Critias described as having been not only related <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            by Solon, but really accomplished by this state in days of <lb/>
            yore ?</p>
          <p>CRI. I will acquaint you with that ancient story, which I <lb/>
            indeed received from no mere youth; for at that time Critias, <lb/>
            as he himself said, was almost ninety years old, and I <lb/>
            myself about ten ; and it chanced then to be the time of the <lb/>
            Cureotis Apaturiorum.* The boys indeed were then going <lb/>
            through the ceremonies customary with them at this festi­ <lb/>
            val ;-for our parents proposed prizes for singing verses; <lb/>
            and therefore a multitude of verses of many poets were <lb/>
            recited, and many of us especially sang the poems of Solon, <lb/>
            as being at that time new. Then one of our tribe, whether <lb/>
            it was his real opinion or he wished to gratify Critias, said he <lb/>
            thought Solon not only the wisest of men in matters gene­ <lb/>
            rally, but as regards poetry the most noble of all poets. <lb/>
            On hearing this, the old man (for I well remember it) was <lb/>
            exceedingly pleased, and said, laughing —‘ If Solon, oh <lb/>
            Amynander, had not considered poetry as a mere amusement, <lb/>
            but made it, as others do, a serious employment, and so com­ <lb/>
            pleted the history which he had brought from Egypt; and, <lb/>
            had not been forced to relinquish it by the seditions and <lb/>
            numerous other troubles in which he found his country <lb/>
            involved, I do not think that either Hesiod, Homer, or any <lb/>
            other poet, would have acquired more distinguished renown: <lb/>
            ' And what was that story, Critias ?’ asked he. 'One about <lb/>
            an action,' replied he, ' the greatest and most celebrated, <lb/>
            which this state ever achieved ; although, through lapse of <lb/>
            time and the death of those by whom it was undertaken, its <lb/>
            fame has not descended to our own day: .‘ Tell it; said he, <note type="footnote"> * The Apaturia, according to Proclus and Suidas, were festivals in <lb/>
            honour of Dionysus, publicly celebrated for the space of three days ; and <lb/>
            they were assigned this name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπάτην</foreign>, that is, on account of the <lb/>
            deception through which Poseidon is reported to have vanquished Xanthus. <lb/>
            The first day of these festivals was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόρπεια</foreign>, in which, as the name <lb/>
            indicates, those of the same tribe feasted together ; and hence (says <lb/>
            Proclus) on this day <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐωχίαι καὶ δει̃να πολλά</foreign>, splendid banquets and <lb/>
            much feasting took place :-the second day was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάῤῥυσις</foreign>, a <lb/>
            sacrifice, because many victims were sacrificed in it; the victims being <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναῤῥύματα</foreign> :-the third day, of which Plato speaks in this place, <lb/>
            was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κουρεώτης</foreign>, because on this day <foreign xml:lang="grc">κου̃ϱοι</foreign>, that is, boys or girls, <lb/>
            were collected to have their names registered in their tribes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φϱατϱίαι</foreign> :)— <lb/>
            to these some add a fourth day, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίδα</foreign>, or the day after. </note> <lb/>

            I from the beginning; and say what that was, which Solon <lb/>
            asserted as true, as well as how and from whom he heard <lb/>
            it.'</p>
          <p>V.—‘ In Egypt,' said he, I in the Delta, about the summit <lb/>
            of which the streams of the Nile are divided, is the district <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νομός</foreign>) surnamed Saitical; the chief city of which is Sais, <lb/>
            whence also came the king Amasis; and it had a presiding <lb/>
            divinity, whose name is in the Egyptian tongue Neith, which <lb/>
            they say corresponds with the Greek Athena j and the <lb/>
            people profess to be great friends of the Athenians, and <lb/>
            united with them in a sort of close alliance. Solon said <lb/>
            that on his arrival thither, he was very honourably received; <lb/>
            and, especially, on his inquiring about ancient affairs of those <lb/>
            priests who possessed superior knowledge in such matters, he <lb/>
            perceived that neither himself nor any one of the Greeks (so <lb/>
            to speak) had any antiquarian knowledge at all. And once <lb/>
            on a time desirous of inducing them to narrate their ancient <lb/>
            stories, he undertook to describe those events which had for­ <lb/>
            merly happened among us in days of yore,-those about the <lb/>
            first Phoroneus and Niobe, and again after the deluge of <lb/>
            Deucalion and Pyrrha (as described by the mythologists), <lb/>
            together with their posterity, paying due attention to the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ages in which these events are said to have occurred : <lb/>
            -on which one of their extremely ancient priests exclaimed, <lb/>
            “ Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children, and aged <lb/>
            Greek there is none." Solon, on hearing this, replied, " How <lb/>
            can you say this ? " To whom the priest, " You are all youths <lb/>
            in intelligence; for you hold no ancient opinions derived <lb/>
            from remote tradition, nor any system of discipline that can <lb/>
            boast of a hoary old age :-and the cause of this is the mul­ <lb/>
            titude and variety of destructions that have been and will be <lb/>
            undergone by the human race, the greater indeed arising from <lb/>
            fire and water, others of less importance from ten thousand <lb/>
            other contingencies. The story, for instance, that is current <lb/>
            among you, that Phaeton, the offspring of the Sun, once <lb/>
            attempting to drive his father's chariot, and not being able to <lb/>
            keep the track observed by his parent, burnt up the surface <lb/>
            of the earth, and perished himself, blasted by lightning, is <lb/>
            generally regarded as fabulous, but in point of fact it refers <lb/>
            to a declination (or parallax) of the heavenly bodies revolving <lb/>
            round the earth, and indicates that, at certain long intervals <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            of time, the earth's surface is destroyed by mighty fires.* <lb/>
            When this occurs, then those who dwell either on moun­ <lb/>
            tains, or in lofty and dry places, perish in greater numbers <lb/>
            than those dwelling near rivers, or on the sea-shore;­ <lb/>
            whereas to us the Nile is not only our safeguard from all <lb/>
            other troubles, but liberates and preserves ns also from this <lb/>
            in particular ;-and again when the gods, to purify the earth, <lb/>
            deluge its surface with water, then the herdsmen and shep­ <lb/>
            herds on the mountains are preserved in safety, while the <lb/>
            inhabitants of your cities are hurried away to the sea, by the <lb/>
            impetuosity of the rivers. In this our country, on the other <lb/>
            hand, the waters neither then fell, nor ever have fallen from <lb/>
            above upon the plains, but on the contrary are naturally <lb/>
            driven upwards from the earth's interior :-and to these causes <lb/>
            it is owing, that the most ancient things are said to be here <lb/>
            preserved. The truth is, however, that in all places where <lb/>
            there is neither intense cold nor immoderate heat, the race of <lb/>
            man is always found to exist, sometimes in less, sometimes in <lb/>
            greater number. And all the noble, great, or otherwise dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished achievements, performed either by ourselves, or by <lb/>
            you, or elsewhere, of which we have heard the report,-all <lb/>
            these have been engraven in our temples in very remote times, <lb/>
            and preserved to the present day; while, on the contrary, <lb/>
            with you and all other nations, they are only just committed <lb/>
            to writing, and all other modes of transmission which states <lb/>
            require,when again, at the usual period, a current from <lb/>
            heaven rushes on them like a pestilence, and leaves the sur­ <lb/>
            vivors among you both destitute of literary attainments and <lb/>
            unacquainted with music; — and thus you become young <lb/>
            again, as at first, knowing nothing of the events of ancient <lb/>
            times, either in our country or yours. As for the transactions, <lb/>
            indeed, Solon, which you have just related from your anti­ <lb/>
            quities, they differ but little from puerile fables :-for in the <lb/>
            first place you only mention one deluge of the earth, whereas <lb/>
            there had been many before; and in the next place you are <lb/>
            unacquainted with that most noble and excellent race of men, <lb/>
            who once inhabited your country, from whom you and your <lb/>
            whole present state are descended, though only a small'rem­ <note type="footnote"> * It was the opinion of Heraclitus and many of the old philosophers, <lb/>
            that the earth would be periodically destroyed by fire or water. The notion <lb/>

            nant of this admirable people is now remaining,—your <lb/>
            ignorance in this matter resulting from the fact that their <lb/>
            posterity for many generations died without the power of speech <lb/>
            through the medium of letters ;* for long before the chief <lb/>
            deluge, a city of Athenians existed, regulated by the best laws <lb/>
            both in military and all other matters, whose noble deeds and <lb/>
            civil institutions are said to have been the most excellent of <lb/>
            all that we have heard to exist under heaven."</p>
          <p>VI.—‘ Solon, on hearing this, expressed his admiration, and <lb/>
            exhibited the most ardent desire, entreating the priests to <lb/>
            relate to him accurately and in order the whole history of his <lb/>
            ancient fellow-citizens. And then one of the priests replied, <lb/>
            " I have no objection, Solon; and for your sake, and that of <lb/>
            your city, I will relate the whole, and more particularly on <lb/>
            account of that goddess, to whom is assigned the guardian­ <lb/>
            ship both of your state and ours, and by whom both have <lb/>
            been founded and fostered; yours indeed having a priority <lb/>
            over ours of a thousand years, from having received its <lb/>
            origin from Hephaestus and the Earth; and the annals even <lb/>
            of our own city [Sais] have been preserved eight thousand <lb/>
            years in our sacred writings. I will briefly describe, then, <lb/>
            the laws and more illustrious actions of those states which <lb/>
            have existed nine thousand years; and when we are more at <lb/>
            leisure, we will take the sacred writings themselves, and re­ <lb/>
            count an exact history of every particular.</p>
          <p>' " Now, consider the laws of these people, as compared with <lb/>
            those prevailing here; for you will find here even at the <lb/>
            present day many examples of institutions that formerly <lb/>
            existed in your city. First of all, the priests passed their <lb/>
            life separate from all the rest; and next, the artificers so <lb/>
            exercised their crafts, that each followed his own employ­ <lb/>
            ment without mingling with any other class of workmen. <lb/>
            The same method was likewise adopted with shepherds, hun­ <lb/>
            ters, and husbandmen. The soldiers, too, you will find, were <lb/>
            separated from other kinds of men, and were enjoined by the <lb/>
            laws to engage in nothing but war. The armour, too, which <lb/>
            each employed, such as shields and darts, resembled that <lb/>
            which we used first of all the Asiatics,—the goddess in those <lb/>
            places, as she did to you, first pointing out their use. Again, <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράμμασι τελευτα̃νἀφώνους</foreign>, which can only be paraphrastically <lb/>
            rendered. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            with respect to wisdom, you may perceive what attention the <lb/>
            law paid to it even from the first, as likewise to all that <lb/>
            respects the universe, including even divination and medicine, <lb/>
            that conduces to the preservation of health; and from these, <lb/>
            which are divine things, the inquiry proceeds to human <lb/>
            affairs and all other branches of learning therewith connected. <lb/>
            Such then was the principle of distribution and arrangement <lb/>
            on which the goddess first founded and established your state, <lb/>
            choosing for that purpose the place in which you were born; <lb/>
            because she foresaw that from its excellent temperature, the <lb/>
            region would produce men of the most consummate wisdom; <lb/>
            and, the goddess, of course, being a lover both of wisdom <lb/>
            and war, selected a spot likely to produce men most resem­ <lb/>
            bling herself; and fixed on this first as their settled abode. <lb/>
            You proceeded to settle, then, under the protection of such <lb/>
            like laws, and what is more, under good government, sur­ <lb/>
            passing all men likewise in every virtue, as becomes the <lb/>
            descendants and disciples of the gods.</p>
          <p>' " Many and mighty deeds of your state, then, are here <lb/>
            recorded in writing [in our sacred records,] and call forth <lb/>
            our admiration ; nevertheless there is one in particular, which <lb/>
            in magnitude and valour surpasses them all ;-for these writ­ <lb/>
            ings relate what a prodigious force your city once overcame, <lb/>
            when a mighty warlike power, rushing from the Atlantic sea, <lb/>
            spread itself with hostile fury over all Europe and Asia. <lb/>
            That sea indeed was then navigable, and had an island <lb/>
            fronting that mouth which you in your tongue call the Pillars <lb/>
            of Hercules; and this island was larger than Libya and <lb/>
            Asia put together; and there was a passage hence for travellers <lb/>
            of that day to the rest of the islands, as well as from those <lb/>
            islands to the whole opposite continent that surrounds that <lb/>
            the real sea.For as respects what is within the mouth here <lb/>
            mentioned, it appears to be a bay with a kind of narrow <lb/>
            entrance; and that sea is indeed a true sea, and the land <lb/>
            that entirely surrounds it may truly and most correctly be <lb/>
            called a continent. In this Atlantic island, then, was formed <lb/>
            a powerful league of kings, who subdued the entire island, <lb/>
            together with many others, and parts also of the continent; <lb/>
            besides which they subjected to their rule the inland parts <lb/>
            of Libya, as far as Egypt, and Europe also, as far as <lb/>
            Tyrrhenia. The whole of this force, then, being collected in <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            a powerful league, undertook at one blow to enslave both your <lb/>
            country and ours, and all the land besides that lies within the <lb/>
            mouth. This was the period, Solon, when the power of your <lb/>
            state was universally celebrated for its virtue and strength ;— <lb/>
            for, surpassing all others both in magnanimity and military <lb/>
            skill, sometimes taking the lead of the Greek nation, at <lb/>
            others left to itself by the defection of the rest, and brought <lb/>
            into the most extreme danger, it still prevailed, raised the <lb/>
            trophy over its assailants, kept from slavery those not as yet <lb/>
            enslaved, insured likewise the most ample liberty for all of us <lb/>
            without exception who dwell within the Pillars of Hercules. <lb/>
            Subsequently, however, through violent earthquakes and <lb/>
            deluges which brought desolation in a single day and night, <lb/>
            the whole of your warlike race * was at once merged under <lb/>
            the earth; and the Atlantic island itself was plunged beneath <lb/>
            the sea, and entirely disappeared ;-whence even now that sea <lb/>
            is neither navigable nor to be traced out, being blocked <lb/>
            up by the great depth of mud t which the subsiding island <lb/>
            produced."' %</p>
          <p>VII.—The above, 0 Socrates, is the sum of what the elder <lb/>
            Critias repeated from the narration of Solon :-and when <lb/>
            yesterday you were discoursing about a republic and the <lb/>
            citizens composing it, I was reminded to my surprise of what <lb/>
            I have now mentioned; for I perceived how divinely, as it <lb/>
            were, by a kind of good luck, and without wandering from <lb/>
            the mark, you in most respects coincided with Solon's state­ <lb/>
            ment. Still I was unwilling to disclose these particulars <lb/>
            immediately; since, from the long lapse of time since I first <lb/>
            heard them, I did not remember them with sufficient accu­ <lb/>
            racy [for repetition]. I considered, therefore, that I ought, <lb/>
            before relating it, first of all to rehearse the whole diligently <lb/>
            to myself. And this was why I yesterday speedily complied <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> 7rap' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμι̃ν μάχιμον</foreign>. So reads Stallbaum, on the authority of <lb/>

            with your demands, conceiving, as is most important in such <lb/>
            matters, that we ought not to lack ability to present a dis­ <lb/>
            course suited to the object in view. Hence was it, as Her­ <lb/>
            mocrates here observed, that as soon as we left here yester­ <lb/>
            day, I brought up the subject before my friends here, in order <lb/>
            to refresh my memory; and by afterwards meditating on it <lb/>
            at night, I acquired nearly a complete recollection of the <lb/>
            whole story. According to the proverb, indeed, what we <lb/>
            learn in childhood takes a wonderful hold on the memory: <lb/>
            -for with respect to myself, for instance, I am not certain <lb/>
            that I could recall the whole of yesterday's discourse, though <lb/>
            I should be very much astonished if anything that I had <lb/>
            heard a very long time ago were to escape my remembrance. <lb/>
            What I then heard, indeed, was listened to with great pleasure <lb/>
            and delight; and the old man very readily recounted it, even <lb/>
            when I frequently asked for a repetition ; and thus the story <lb/>
            became like the brands of indelible writing fixed in my <lb/>
            memory. Well then, as soon as it was day I repeated the <lb/>
            narrative to my friends, that they might aid me in fairly <lb/>
            recounting my story. Now, therefore, as respects the object <lb/>
            of all that has been said, Socrates, I am prepared to relate, <lb/>
            not only the general heads, but the particulars also of all that <lb/>
            I heard. As for the citizens and state which you described <lb/>
            to us yesterday as in a fable, we will now convert it into a <lb/>
            reality, and consider the state established by you as no other <lb/>
            than this [of Athens,] and the citizens which you described <lb/>
            as no other than those real ancestors of ours, alluded to by <lb/>
            the Egyptian priests. Indeed they will harmonize in every <lb/>
            respect; and we shall not be far from the mark * in assert­ <lb/>
            ing that your citizens are the very people who existed at <lb/>
            that time. Each taking our share then in this discussion, <lb/>
            we will try our utmost to bestow suitable attention to the <lb/>
            task that you have assigned us. It is requisite therefore <lb/>
            to consider, 0 Socrates, whether this narrative answers our <lb/>
            purpose,t or we should seek some other in its stead.</p>
          <p>Soc. And what other, 0 Critias, can we receive in prefer­ <lb/>
            ence to this, which, from its affinity, is extremely suitable <lb/>
            to the festival of the goddess, and has the all-important merit <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἀπᾳσόμεθα</foreign>, lit. tee shall not sing out of tune. The old <lb/>

              of being not a cunningly devised fable, but a true history ? <lb/>
              It is impossible, therefore, to say, how and whence, if we <lb/>
              abandon your narrative, we should find another more suit­ <lb/>
              able. We cannot; but must acknowledge that you have <lb/>
              been happy in your narration; and, as for me, after my <lb/>
              discourse of yesterday, I will now rest, and be in my turn a <hi rend="underline"><lb/>
              <hi rend="italic">listener.</hi></hi> </p>
          <p><hi rend="overline">VIII.—CRI. </hi>Consider then, Socrates, the arrangement of <lb/>
            €€this banquet of yours, how we settled it. For we think it <lb/>
            right that Timæus, who is the most astronomical of us all, <lb/>
            and has bestowed much pains in acquainting himself with <lb/>
            the nature of the universe, should be the first to discourse <lb/>
            to us, beginning from the creation of the world, and ending <lb/>
            with the nature of men ;—and also that I after him, re­ <lb/>
            ceiving from him, as it were, the men which have been <lb/>
            ideally produced-and some of them, too, excellently educated <lb/>
            by you,—should introduce them among us here, according to <lb/>
            the word and law of Solon, as to proper judges, and make them <lb/>
            members of this city; as being really those very Athenians <lb/>
            of bygone days, which were described as unknown to us <lb/>
            in the report of the sacred writings;—and so, in future, we <lb/>
            will treat them in our discourse as citizens and Athenians.</p>
          <p>Soc. I am now, it seems, to be plentifully and splendidly <lb/>
            entertained in my turn with a banquet of arguments :-it is for <lb/>
            you, then, 0 Timæus, to begin the discourse, having first of <lb/>
            all invoked the gods according to the usual custom.</p>
          <p>TIM. Well, Socrates, this at any rate is true, — that <lb/>
            those who have even the least share of wisdom, always <lb/>
            invoke the deity on entering every undertaking, whether <lb/>
            small or great; and so we likewise (unless we be in every <lb/>
            respect unwise) who are now about to speak concerning the <lb/>
            universe, whether it be generated or without generation, shall <lb/>
            (if we be not very unwise) make it our first duty to invoke <lb/>
            the gods and goddesses, and pray that what we speak may be <lb/>
            first of all pleasing to them, and also in consistence with our­ <lb/>
            selves. And as respects the invocation of the gods, so have <lb/>
            I acted for myself; while as respects ourselves, we must <lb/>
            lead you by that way which you may most easily under­ <lb/>
            stand, and which will best enable me to explain my meaning <lb/>
            about the proposed subjects of discussion.</p>
          <p>IX.—I think we ought, in the first place, to define what <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            that is which is ever-existent, and has no generation; <lb/>
            and what that is which is in a state of generation or be­ <lb/>
            coming, but never really is. The former of these, indeed, <lb/>
            which is apprehended by reflection united with reason, always <lb/>
            subsists according to sameness ;*—while the latter is per­ <lb/>
            ceived by opinion united with irrational perception ; since <lb/>
            it subsists in a state of generation and corruption, and <lb/>
            never really is. And, again, whatever is generated is neces­ <lb/>
            sarily generated from a certain cause; for it is wholly impos­ <lb/>
            sible that anything should be generated without a cause. <lb/>
            An artificer, therefore, of anything, if he looks to that <lb/>
            which always subsists according to sameness, and from this <lb/>
            as a sort of pattern, works out the form and nature of his <lb/>
            work, he must thus, necessarily, produce something wholly <lb/>
            beautiful:—but where he employs for his pattern only what <lb/>
            is generated, it cannot be beautiful.</p>
          <p>Let this universe then be called heaven, or the world, or by <lb/>
            any other name that it usually receives; and let us, in the <lb/>
            first place, consider respecting it, what ought to be inves­ <lb/>
            tigated at the very outset of our proposed inquiry about the <lb/>
            universe,-whether it always existed, having no beginning, <lb/>
            or was generated, beginning from some certain commence­ <lb/>
            ment. It is generated ;-for this universe is palpable, and <lb/>
            has a body; and all such things are perceptible (i. e. are <lb/>
            to be apprehended by the senses) ; and things perceptible <lb/>
            being apprehended by opinion, in conjunction with perception, <lb/>
            appear to be in a state of becoming, and subject to genera­ <lb/>
            tion. Again, with reference to what exists, it must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily have arisen from some cause.</p>
          <p>To discover then the Creator and Father of this universe, <lb/>
            as well as his work, is indeed difficult; and when discovered, <lb/>
            it is impossible to reveal him to mankind at large. And this <lb/>
            too, we must consider respecting him, according to which of <lb/>
            two patterns he modelled the world ; whether with reference <lb/>
            to one subsisting ever in a state of sameness and similarly <lb/>
            affected, or with reference to one that is only generated. If <lb/>
            this world then is beautiful and its artificer good, he evi­ <note type="footnote"> * The terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐκόν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">θάτεϱον, ὅμοιον</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνόμιον</foreign>, so constantly met <lb/>
            with in this dialogue, express eternal constancy, as contrasted with muta­ <lb/>
            bility; and they are found among the ten pairs of opposites which, <lb/>
            according to the Pythagoreans, constituted the elements of the universe. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            dently looked to an eternal pattern; but if it be without <lb/>
            beauty, and what it is not lawful to mention, he must have <lb/>
            looked to one that is generated. It is evident, however, to <lb/>
            every one that he looked to one that was eternal ;—for the <lb/>
            universe is the most beautiful of generated things, and its <lb/>
            artificer the best of causes. Being thus generated, then, it <lb/>
            has been framed according to principles that can be compre­ <lb/>
            hended by reason and reflection, and ever abides in same­ <lb/>
            ness of being. This, then, being the case, this world must <lb/>
            necessarily be the resemblance of something ;-although to <lb/>
            describe its origin according to nature is the greatest of all <lb/>
            undertakings. We should distinguish between an image <lb/>
            and its pattern ; just as words are connected with the things <lb/>
            of which they are the interpreters :-and so when we speak <lb/>
            of that which is stable and firm, and mentally intelligible, <lb/>
            our language should be in like manner stable and immuta­ <lb/>
            ble, and as far as possible unrefutable and immovable, having <lb/>
            in this respect no deficiency; whereas, in speaking concerning <lb/>
            its image only, and as compared to it, we should use probable <lb/>
            arguments, that are in strict analogy thereto. Moreover, <lb/>
            precisely as essence (or true being) is to generation, so is <lb/>
            truth to faith (or mere conjecture). You must not won­ <lb/>
            der, then, 0 Socrates, since different people differ so <lb/>
            much in opinion about the gods and the formation of the <lb/>
            universe, if I should be unable to put forth generally ap­ <lb/>
            proved and scrupulously exact statements on so difficult a <lb/>
            subject; but even if we should only advance reasons not <lb/>
            less probable than those of others, you should still be content, <lb/>
            remembering that both I who am speaking, and you who are <lb/>
            my judges, possess a common human nature; and you must <lb/>
            be satisfied therefore, if my assertions are but probable state­ <lb/>
            ments, and should inquire no farther.</p>
          <p>Soc. Capitally well said, Timæus, and we must proceed <lb/>
            wholly as you recommend. As regards the prelude then of <lb/>
            your discourse, we wonderfully approve of it: and now pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to the strain (or main subject) itself.</p>
          <p>X.—TIM. Let us declare then on what account the framing <lb/>
            Artificer settled the formation of this universe.* He was <lb/>
            good; and in the good, envy is never engendered about any­ <lb/>
            thing whatever. Hence, being free from this (envy), he <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig55.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="334"/>
              desired that all things should as much as possible resemble <lb/>
              himself. Any one, therefore, who receives this as the leading <lb/>
              principle of generation and the universe from intelligent <lb/>
              men, will receive it most correctly. For as the deity desired, <lb/>
              as far as possible, that all things should be good, and nothing <lb/>
              evil,—he accordingly took everything that was visible and <lb/>
              not in a state of rest, but in excessive agitation and disorder, <lb/>
              and then reduced it from disorder into order, conceiving the <lb/>
              latter to be far better than the former. It is not, indeed, and <lb/>
              never was, lawful to do anything else but what is most <lb/>
              honourable; and accordingly, he found by reasoning that of <lb/>
              things naturally visible, nothing without intelligence could be <lb/>
              more beautiful than what is wholly endowed with intellect, <lb/>
              and besides this, that apart from the soul no one could pos­ <lb/>
              sess intelligence.* In pursuance of this reasoning, placing <lb/>
              intellect in soul and soul in body, he constructed the uni­ <lb/>
              verse ; that thus it might be a work naturally the most <lb/>
              beautiful and the best. Hence, therefore, we have a rea­ <lb/>
              sonable motive for calling the world an animal with a soul, <lb/>
              truly intellectual, and created through the providence of the <lb/>
              deity.</p>
          <p>XI.—This being the case, let us next consider, in the <lb/>
            likeness of what animals the composing artificer framed the <lb/>
            universe. We must by no means then think, that he would <lb/>
            deign to fashion it like animals subsisting as a part of any­ <lb/>
            thing (i. e. in an incomplete form) : for nothing resembling <lb/>
            an imperfect animal can possibly be beautiful. But we may <lb/>
            consider it on the other hand, as most nearly of all resembling <lb/>
            what contains the other animals both separately and collec­ <lb/>
            tively as parts [of a whole:]—for it (tlie universe) com­ <lb/>
            prises within itself all intelligible animals, just as this world <lb/>
            contains us and all other visible creatures. t The deity, in­ <note type="footnote"> * Plato seems, therefore, to regard the soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχή</foreign>) as an intermediate <lb/>
            sgent and uniting bond between perishable bodies and the eternal and <lb/>
            indestructible intellect, powerfully acting on matter; but yet, on the <lb/>
            other hand, closely and necessarily connected with intellect; though <lb/>
            not like the latter, naturally eternal and indestructible, but the best <lb/>
            of things generated and constituted eternal by the divine decrees. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig56.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> obscure: the above is Stallbaums interpretation. Compare also, ch. xv. <lb/>

              deed, desirous of making it in all respects resemble the <lb/>
              most beautiful and entirely perfect of intelligible objects, <lb/>
              formed it into one visible animal, containing within itself all <lb/>
              the other animals with which it is naturally allied. Are we <lb/>
              not, then, right in concluding that there is but one heaven <lb/>
              (or universe) ; or is it more correct to assert that there are <lb/>
              many and infinite ? One only, [I answer,] if it has been <lb/>
              fabricated according to the original pattern. For that which <lb/>
              comprehends all intelligible animals whatever, can never be <lb/>
              second to any other :-for there would be need of another <lb/>
              animal again to comprise these two, of which they would <lb/>
              both be partsj and it would be more proper to assert that <lb/>
              the universe resembles this comprehending third, rather than <lb/>
              the other two. In order, therefore, that the world may in its <lb/>
              substantive existence [<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν μόνωσιν</foreign>] resemble the all­ <lb/>
              perfect animal- on this account the framer of the worlds <lb/>
              produced neither two nor an infinite number; but this, <lb/>
              the solely-begotten heaven (or universe) having been gene­ <lb/>
              rated, now exists and ever will exist.</p>
          <p>Now, whatever has been generated, must necessarily <lb/>
            have bodily shape, and be visible as well as tangible. But <lb/>
            nothing can be visible without the aid of fire, and nothing <lb/>
            tangible without something solid, and nothing solid without <lb/>
            earth,-owing to which, the deity at the beginning of his <lb/>
            constructive labour composed the body of the universe from <lb/>
            fire and earth. But it is not possible for two things alone to <lb/>
            cohere, without the intervention of a third ; for a certain <lb/>
            bond is necessary between the two. And the best of all <lb/>
            bonds is that, which, as nearly as possible, unites into one <lb/>
            both itself and the natures bound with it. But propor­ <lb/>
            tion will naturally best show this effect ;*—for whenever, <lb/>
            either in three numbers, or solids, or powers, the middle <lb/>
            bears the same ratio to the last, as the first to the middle <lb/>
            -and again also, as the last is to the middle, so is the <lb/>
            middle to the first; then the middle (or mean) term becom­ <lb/>

            become means, they must thus all necessarily become the <lb/>
            same relatively to each other, and having become the same <lb/>
            with each other, will all be one. If then the body of the <lb/>
            universe had been a superficies only without thickness, one <lb/>
            medium alone would have sufficed, both for binding it and all <lb/>
            that belongs to it ;—but in the present case, as it was doomed <lb/>
            to be a solid-and solids are never one only, but always <lb/>
            jointed together by two media,-whence the deity placed <lb/>
            water and air between fire and earth ;—and by thus placing <lb/>
            them as far as possible in proportion to each other, so that <lb/>
            fire should be to air as air to water, and as air to water so <lb/>
            water to earth,-he thus bound and framed together the <lb/>
            world visible and tangible. On this account also, and from <lb/>
            such elements, which are four in number, the body of the <lb/>
            universe was confessedly generated by a certain proportion; <lb/>
            and hence has resulted such an intimacy, that all its parts <lb/>
            aptly cohere, and are indissoluble except by its uniting <lb/>
            artificer.</p>
          <p>Of these four elements, then, the composition of the world <lb/>
            received one whole of each :*—for its composing artificer con­ <lb/>
            stituted it from entire elements of fire, water, air, and earth; <lb/>
            leaving no part of any one of them, nor any extraneous power, <lb/>
            —considering that it would thus be a whole animal, in the <lb/>
            highest degree perfect and of perfect parts ; and besides this, <lb/>
            that it would be one, as nothing would be left, from which <lb/>
            any other such element could be produced; and lastly, that it <lb/>
            would be free from old age and disease,-and perceiving also <lb/>
            that the principles composing bodies, as heat and cold, and all <lb/>
            possess vigorous powers, when they surround bodies exter­ <lb/>
            nally and interefere with them unseasonably, dissolve their <lb/>
            union, and bring on diseases and old age, whereby they decay <lb/>
            and perish. Owing to such causes and reasonings, then, he <lb/>
            framed this universe, as one whole, an united series of perfect <lb/>
            wholes, perfect, undecaying, and without disease. He gave <lb/>
            it also a figure becoming and allied to its nature ;-and to <lb/>
            the animal destined to comprehend all others within itself, <lb/>
            that figure as the most becoming, which includes within <lb/>
            itself every sort of figure whatever. Hence he fashioned it <lb/>
            in the shape of a sphere, perfectly round, having its centre <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓν ὅλον ἑκἀστου</foreign>,—one whole, without deficiency or superfluity, <lb/>
            -the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλειον</foreign>, alluded to by Aristotle, Metaph. iv. § 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            everywhere equally distant from the bounding extremities, as <lb/>
            being the most perfect of all figures, and most resembling <lb/>
            himself; — and he did this, considering the similar to be infi­ <lb/>
            nitely more beautiful than the dissimilar.</p>
          <p>Next, he most carefully polished the external circumference <lb/>
            of this sphere, — and this for many reasons. It needed, in­ <lb/>
            deed, neither eyes, nor ears, as there was nothing externally <lb/>
            either visible or audible:—neither was it surrounded with <lb/>
            air, as if it required respiration ;—nor, again, did it require <lb/>
            any organ, through which it might receive its nutriment, <lb/>
            and discharge it again when digested: for nothing was <lb/>
            either added to or taken from it, that being impossible. In­ <lb/>
            deed the universe is artfully made to provide itself with <lb/>
            nutriment through its own decay, as well as to suffer and do <lb/>
            all things in itself, and by its own operations ;—because, indeed, <lb/>
            its creator conceived that it would be much more excellent, <lb/>
            if independent in action, than if it required extraneous aid. <lb/>
            And he did not think fit to give it hands either, as it had <lb/>
            nothing either to receive or reject; nor yet of feet, or any <lb/>
            other members suited to locomotion :—for he assigned to it <lb/>
            a motion peculiar to itself, being that of all the seven kinds <lb/>
            of motion,* which chiefly belongs to intellect and reflection. <lb/>
            Hence, making the. world to turn constantly on itself and <lb/>
            on the same point, he gave it a circular motion, and took <lb/>
            from it all the other six, without giving it any power of <lb/>
            progression: and as this revolution required no feet, he <lb/>
            created the world without legs and feet.</p>
          <p>XII.—Thus was it, that the intelligence of the eternal <lb/>
            Deity, after due reflection, conceived the form of the god <lb/>
            about to come into existence; and he made it smooth, <lb/>
            equable, and even from its centre in every direction,-a body <lb/>
            whole and perfect, wholly composed out of perfect bodies. <lb/>
            As for the soul, he fixed it in the middle, extended it throughout <lb/>
            the whole, and likewise surrounded with it its entire surface:­ <lb/>
            and so, causing a circle to revolve in a circle, he established the <lb/>
            world as one substantive, solitary object, self-sufficient through <lb/>
            its own excellence, requiring nothing external, but sufficiently <lb/>
            known and friendly to itself. By this procedure, then, he <lb/>
            produced the Universe, a blessed god. The Deity, however, <note type="footnote"> * On these seven kinds of motions, comp. ch. xviii. of this dialogue, <lb/>
            p. 348. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            did not, as we now undertake to say, form the soul posterior <lb/>
            and junior to the body : for he who conjoined these, would <lb/>
            never have allowed the more ancient nature to be governed <lb/>
            by the younger :-and yet we, who are exposed to the blind <lb/>
            chances of fortune, are apt to speak somehow in this silly <lb/>
            fashion ; whereas the Deity constituted the soul both in age <lb/>
            and excellence prior to and older than the body, as being <lb/>
            the proper mistress and ruler of its subject [the body ;] and <lb/>
            that, too, from the following sources, and in the following <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>From one essence indivisible, and always the same, and from <lb/>
            another again that is divisible and corporeal, he composed-by <lb/>
            admixture from both-a third form of essence intermediate <lb/>
            between the two; and again, between what is indivisi­ <lb/>
            ble and divisible as respects bodies, he placed the nature <lb/>
            of same and different (or mutable); — and taking these <lb/>
            three, he mingled them all into one idea, joining them <lb/>
            together by force, as the different would not freely mingle <lb/>
            with the same. And after mingling them with essence, and <lb/>
            producing one from the three, he again distributed this whole <lb/>
            into suitable parts; each composed of a mixture of same, <lb/>
            different, and essence. He next began to divide as follows :— . <lb/>
            In the first place, he took away one part from the whole; <lb/>
            then he separated a second part, double of the first: and <lb/>
            again, a third, one-and-a-half times as much as the second, but <lb/>
            triple of the first; then a fourth, double of the second; in <lb/>
            the next place a fifth, triple of the third : a sixth, octuple of <lb/>
            the first: and lastly a seventh, twenty-seven times greater <lb/>
            than the first. After this, he filled up the double and triple <lb/>
            intervals, still taking off parts therefrom, and so placed them <lb/>
            between the intervals, that there might be two media between <lb/>
            every interval; one of which might, in the same degree, ex­ <lb/>
            ceed one of the extremes, and be exceeded by the other, <lb/>
            while the other part might in an equal degree exceed one of <lb/>
            the extremes, and be exceeded by the other. But as by the <lb/>
            intermediate links between the above-mentioned spaces the <lb/>
            sesquialter, sesquitertian, and sesquioctave intervals were <lb/>
            produced, he filled with a sesquioctave all the sesquitertian <lb/>
            intervals,* leaving a part of each, the interval between which <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig57.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="339"/>
              and the following would have to each other the same ratio <lb/>
              as the numbers 256 and 243; and in truth he thus ex­ <lb/>
              hausted the whole mixture-from which these were sepa­ <lb/>
              rated. He split the whole of this composition, then, along <lb/>
              its entire length into two parts, joining them mutually across <lb/>
              like the letter X, afterwards bending them into a circle, and <lb/>
              connecting them both with themselves and each other, in <lb/>
              such a way that their extremities might meet directly <lb/>
              opposite the point of their mutual intersection, externally <lb/>
              comprehending them in an uniform motion around the same <lb/>
              centre; besides which, he made one of the circles external, <lb/>
              the other internal. * The motion of the exterior circle he <lb/>
              proclaimed to be that of sameness, and that of the interior <lb/>
              the motion of difference. - He caused also the circle of same­ <lb/>
              ness to revolve laterally towards the right, and that of differ­ <lb/>
              ence diagonally towards the left. And the superiority he <lb/>
              gave to the circulation of same and similar; for this alone <lb/>
              he suffered to remain undivided ;—while, as to that within, <lb/>
              after dividing into six parts, and forming therefrom seven <lb/>
              unequal circles, divided by double and triple intervals, three <lb/>
              of each, he bade these circles travel in contrary directions to <lb/>
              each other,-three of the seven to revolve at equal velocities, <lb/>
              the remaining four with a velocity unequal as respects either <lb/>
              of the former three, yet in a certain proportion as to their <lb/>
              respective periods.</p>
          <p>XIII.—After, therefore, the whole composition of the <lb/>
            [universal] soul had been completed according to the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of God who framed it, he in the next place formed <lb/>
            within it the whole of a corporeal nature ; and he aptly jointed <lb/>
            them, by uniting centre to centre. The former (the soul), <lb/>
            being interwoven throughout from the middle to the very <lb/>
            extremities of space, and covering it even all around exter­ <figure type="illustration">

              ing the nature of the ancient Harmonics. </note><note type="footnote"> * The whole of this Pythagorean-like speculation on Harmonics has <lb/>
              been variously explained by Cousin, Stallbaum, and Martin (as well as <lb/>
              Bockh, in many of his learned tracts). It may here simply be observed, <lb/>
              that the two harmonic scales, thus split down their length and crossed, <lb/>
              formed two circles or orbits, one (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θάτερον</foreign>) revolving within the other <lb/>
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτόν</foreign>), but in an opposite direction. These, according to many <lb/>
              commentators, correspond with the equatorial and zodiacal circles (?). </note> <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <lb/>

              nally, though at the same time herself revolving within <lb/>
              herself, originated the divine commencement of an unceasing <lb/>
              and wise life throughout all time. And indeed the body of <lb/>
              the universe was generated in visible shape; while the soul, <lb/>
              though invisible, was made to partake of reason and bar­ <lb/>
              mony, and rendered the best of created things by Him—the <lb/>
              best of eternal intelligences. The soul, then, being composed <lb/>
              from the admixture of the three parts, same, different, and <lb/>
              essence, classified as well as bound together in certain propor­ <lb/>
              tions, and itself revolving inwardly on itself, whenever it <lb/>
              comes in contact either with anything mutable or indivisible, <lb/>
              at once declares by its intrinsic energy with what anything <lb/>
              is identical, and from what it differs, and also with reference <lb/>
              to what, where, how, and when it happens, both as regards <lb/>
              its own separate essence and its external affections, either <lb/>
              in things generated, or such as possess an eternal sameness.* <lb/>
              When our talk, then, is about truth, and consistent with <lb/>
              itself,-whether, on the one hand, it be about things mutable <lb/>
              or things constant, and is silently and noiselessly borne <lb/>
              onward by its own motion, or when it is concerned about <lb/>
              things sensible, and the circle of difference reports on its <lb/>
              onward passage to every part of the soul, then arise fixed <lb/>
              and true opinions and persuasions: - but when, on the other <lb/>
              hand, it is concerned about the merely rational, and the <lb/>
              glibly-whirling circle of sameness makes its indications,— <lb/>
              then intellect and science are thus necessarily brought to full <lb/>
              perfection. - And as respects the real essence in which these <lb/>
              two qualities are engendered, if any one asserts that it is <lb/>
              any other than the soul, he will assert everything rather <lb/>
              than the truth.</p>
          <p>XIV.—When the parent Creator perceived that this <lb/>
            created image of the eternal gods had life and motion, he was <lb/>
            delighted with his work, and by this very delight he was led <lb/>
            to consider how he might make it still more to resemble its <lb/>
            exemplar. Hence, as the intelligible universe was an eternal <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig59.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> sentence is difficult,—not so much from its obscureness, as its pregnancy <lb/>
              of meaning, which all but defies translation. The same remark applies to <lb/>

              sentence. See Stallbaum and Martin ad locum. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="341"/>
              animal, he tried to make this [the sensible universe], as far as <lb/>
              he could, similarly perfect. The nature indeed of the animal <lb/>
              itself was eternal, and this nature could not be entirely adopted <lb/>
              into any thing subject to generation ;-hence God resolved to <lb/>
              form a certain moveable image of eternity; and thus, while <lb/>
              he was disposing the parts of the universe, he, out of that <lb/>
              eternity which rests in unity, formed an eternal image on <lb/>
              the principle of numbers ;-and to this we give the appel­ <lb/>
              lation of Time. But besides this, he contrived the days and <lb/>
              nights, months and years, which had no existence prior to <lb/>
              the universe, but rose into being contemporaneously with its <lb/>
              formation. All these are but the parts of time; and the <lb/>
              terms it was and it will be are generated [i. &lt;?., varying and <lb/>
              evanescent] forms of time, which we have wrongly and <lb/>
              unawares transferred to an eternal essence. For we say <lb/>
              that a thing was, is, and will be; while according to truth, <lb/>
              the term it is, is alone suitable,—was and will be being <lb/>
              expressions only suitable to generation, which proceeds <lb/>
              through time, — both of them being certain motions :— <lb/>
              whereas, what exists eternally, the same and immoveable, <lb/>
              neither becomes at any time older or younger; neither has <lb/>
              it been generated in the past, nor will be in the future, nor <lb/>
              is it subject to those accidents which generation imposes on <lb/>
              sensible objects,--all of which are nothing more than forms <lb/>
              of time imitating eternity, and moving in a circle measured <lb/>
              by number. And besides this, in making such assertions as <lb/>
              these,-that what has been generated is generated,-that <lb/>
              what is becoming, is in generation,-that what will be is to <lb/>
              be,--and that non-being is not —in all this we state what <lb/>
              is not accurately true. But this is perhaps not the place <lb/>
              for a minute discussion of these matters.</p>
          <p>Time, then, was generated with the universe, in order that, <lb/>
            being produced together, they might together be dissolved, if <lb/>
            their dissolution should ever happen :-and it was formed on <lb/>
            the model of an eternal nature, that it might as far as possible <lb/>
            resemble it; for this model exists through all eternity, while <lb/>
            the world, on the other hand, has been generated, now exists, <lb/>
            and will exist, throughout all time. With this design, then, <lb/>
            and after such reflection on the generation of time, the Deity, <lb/>
            in order that it might be produced in full operation, created <lb/>
            the sun, moon, and the five other stars, which are denominated <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            planets, to distinguish and guard over the numbers of time. <lb/>
            And as soon as he had produced the bodies of these stars, <lb/>
            God placed them, seven in number, in the seven orbits whose <lb/>
            revolutions are according to difference;*—the Moon, indeed, in <lb/>
            the first orbit nearest about the earth; the Sun in the second <lb/>
            beyond the earth; then Lucifer (i. e. Venus), and the star <lb/>
            sacred to Hermes (i. e. Mercury), revolving in their orbits as <lb/>
            swiftly as the sun, but on a different principle of motion, owing <lb/>
            to which these stars, the Sun, Lucifer, and Mercury, mutually <lb/>
            overtake and are overtaken by each other in their respective <lb/>
            courses. As respects the other stars, however, the labour of <lb/>
            investigating their revolutions, and the causes that gave them <lb/>
            origin, would surpass that of the discourse itself which caused <lb/>
            their mention. These subjects, then, may hereafter, perhaps, <lb/>
            when we have leisure, meet with the investigation they <lb/>
            deserve.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, each of the stars necessary for the con­ <lb/>
            stitution of time had obtained a motion adapted to its con­ <lb/>
            dition, and their bodies, bound by living chains, had be­ <lb/>
            come vital beings and learned their prescribed duty, they <lb/>
            pursued their course according to the movement of difference, <lb/>
            passing obliquely through the orbit of sameness, to which the <lb/>
            former is subordinate, one circle being larger and the other <lb/>
            smaller, one moving quicker and the other more slowly; <lb/>
            those that revolved the quickest on the principle of sameness <lb/>
            appearing ever to overtake and be overtaken by those that <lb/>
            travelled at slower velocities. And the revolutions of all these <lb/>
            circles in their orbits with a spiral motion,†proceeding at one <lb/>
            and the same time in two contrary directions, make it appear <lb/>
            that the one moving at the slowest pace from that which was <lb/>
            the most swift is the nearest of all. And in order that there <lb/>
            might be a certain apparent measure of slowness and swift­ <lb/>
            ness in the relative velocities of these spheres, and an evident <lb/>
            uniformity in all the eight movements, the Deity enkindled a <lb/>
            light, which we now denominate the sun, in the second of <lb/>
            these orbits, in order that it might fully display all things in <lb/>
            the universe, and that such animals as required it might have <lb/>
            their share in number,J becoming acquainted therewith from <figure type="illustration">

              the revolution of sameness and similarity. Thus, then, <lb/>
              and on these accounts, arose night and day; being the <lb/>
              period of the one and most skilfully-contrived movement.* <lb/>
              The month, too, was generated, when the moon had run <lb/>
              through her orbit, and passed into conjunction with the sun,— <lb/>
              and the year, when the sun had completely travelled through <lb/>
              his own orbit. As to the periods of the other stars, however, <lb/>
              they are not understood, except by a very few ; nor are they <lb/>
              distinguished by any peculiar name or relatively measured on <lb/>
              the principle of numbers :-and hence it may be said, they are <lb/>
              ignorant that these movements really constitute time, infinite <lb/>
              as they are in number and of wonderful variety. Still it is <lb/>
              by no means impossible to conceive, how the perfect number <lb/>
              of time completes a perfect year, when the courses of the <lb/>
              eight orbits return at their completion to the same place of <lb/>
              commencement, and have their revolution measured on the <lb/>
              principle of sameness. In this manner, indeed, and for this <lb/>
              purpose, were formed such of the stars as moved circularly <lb/>
              through the universe,-that this (the visible animal, i. e. the <lb/>
              universe) might resemble as nearly as possible the most per­ <lb/>
              fect intelligible animal, in the imitation of an eternal nature.</p>
          <p>XV.—The Creator constructed all the rest at the same <lb/>
            time as the generation of time,† according to the similitude <lb/>
            of that which has been portrayed; but still, as the universe <lb/>
            did not yet comprise within it the entire animal race, in <lb/>
            this respect there was a dissimilarity. This defect, therefore, <lb/>
            [the Creator] supplied by impressing it with forms corre­ <lb/>
            sponding with the nature of its pattern. Wherever, therefore, <lb/>
            the intellect beholds ideas of a certain quality, and quantity <lb/>
            in that which possesses life, such and so many lie con­ <lb/>
            ceived that this (the universe) should contain ; and these are <lb/>
            four :-One, the heavenly race of gods; another, winged and <lb/>
            air-wandering race ; a third, that which dwells in the water; <lb/>
            and a fourth, that which has feet and walks on the ground. <lb/>
            The chief idea, indeed, of deity, he formed from fire, that <note type="footnote"> required it, might gain a knowledge of number, i. e. of the principle on <lb/>
            which the world is formed and now moves. </note><note type="footnote"> * In the Timseus Locrus it is said (p. 432 of Stallbaum, vol. vii.), that <lb/>
            it is day, when the sun travels from east to west, and night when it <lb/>
            travels from west to east ;-and Plato must necessarily have thought <lb/>
            this, as he held the earth to be immoveable, without any motion even <lb/>
            round its own axis. Comp. Aristot. de Coelo, II. ch. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> t Gr. TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν ἄλλα ἤδη μέχρι χρόνου γενἐσεσεως</foreign>. The old edd. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            it might be as far as possible splendid and fair to behold; <lb/>
            and in adapting it to the universe, he rendered it circular; <lb/>
            made it to consist in the knowledge of that good which it is <lb/>
            to follow, and distributed it round the entire heavens, that it <lb/>
            might be a true world, fully adorned with that race in its <lb/>
            every part. To each of the divine bodies, also, he adapted <lb/>
            two motions oneof them taking place on the same spot <lb/>
            and on the principle of sameness, corresponding with that <lb/>
            intelligence which contemplates what is the same with itself; <lb/>
            the other, a progressive motion subordinate to the motion <lb/>
            that is constantly the same and similar :*—but as respects <lb/>
            the other five motions, it was fixed immoveable, that each of <lb/>
            them might become as far as possible the best. And for <lb/>
            this reason also the fixed stars were formed, as being <lb/>
            divine and eternal animals, ever abiding and revolving in <lb/>
            the same place and on the principle of sameness; and <lb/>
            the stars, which both revolve and have the kind of motion <lb/>
            above described, were formed on those principles, t Next, <lb/>
            he formed the earth our common nourisher, which, being <lb/>
            confined round the axis that extends through the universe, <lb/>
            is the guardian and artificer of night and day, as well as <lb/>
            the first and most ancient of the gods that have been gene­ <lb/>
            rated within the universe. With respect, however, to the <lb/>
            dances [or rhythmical motions] of these divinities, and the <lb/>
            mutual intersection of their circles, as well as their rela­ <lb/>
            tive revolutions and progressive motions in their conjunc­ <lb/>
            tions and oppositions, whether in progressive or retrograde <lb/>
            motion, at what times and in what manner they are in turn <lb/>
            eclipsed, and afterwards reappear to our view, causing terror <lb/>
            and presaging future events to such as are able to understand <lb/>
            them ;to attempt an explanation of all this, without having <lb/>
            a plan of them before us, would be a labour in vain. But of <lb/>
            this enough; and this is all that we shall say concerning the <lb/>
            nature of the visible and generated gods.</p>
          <p>XVI.Again, to speak concerning the other gods for <note type="footnote"> * Plato is here describing two motions of the universe,-one on the <lb/>
            principle of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτόν</foreign> (which is that of intelligence) round its own axis, the <lb/>
            other on that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάτεϱον</foreign> (that which the soul of the world is formed), <lb/>

              demons), and to know their generation, is more than we can <lb/>
              perform; and we must trust to the reports of those ancient <lb/>
              men, who being, as they said, the descendants of the gods, must <lb/>
              have a clear knowledge of their parents. It is impossible, <lb/>
              therefore, to discredit the children of the gods; and even <lb/>
              though they should speak without probable and cogent proofs, <lb/>
              yet as they declare that they are relating matters with which <lb/>
              they are familiarly acquainted, we ought, in compliance with <lb/>
              the law, to assent to their tradition. In this manner, then, <lb/>
              according to them, the generation of these gods took place, <lb/>
              and is described.</p>
          <p>Ocean and Tethys were the progeny of Heaven and Earth; <lb/>
            and from these sprang Phorcys, Kronos, and Rhea, and ever <lb/>
            so many more with them —and from Kronos and Rhea <lb/>
            sprang Zeus, Hera (Jupiter, Juno), and all that we know are <lb/>
            called their brethren, together with others still who were <lb/>
            their progeny.* When therefore all such gods as visibly <lb/>
            revolve, and show themselves when they please, were gene­ <lb/>
            rated, the Artificer of the universe thus addressed them: <lb/>
            " Gods of gods, of whom I am the creator and father, all <lb/>
            things formed by me are by my will indissoluble. Indeed, <lb/>
            what is bound is of course dissoluble; nevertheless, to desire <lb/>
            to dissolve what is beautifully harmonized and well disposed, <lb/>
            is the mark of an evil nature. Now, inasmuch as you have <lb/>
            been generated, you are hence not immortal, nor wholly <lb/>
            indissoluble; yet you shall never be dissolved, nor become <lb/>
            subject to the fatality of death; because you have got my will <lb/>
            [that it shall be so,] which is a much greater and more power­ <lb/>
            ful bond than those by which you were bound when first created. <lb/>
            Learn, therefore, what I now say to you by way of informa­ <lb/>
            tion. Three classes of mortals yet remain uncreated. Un­ <lb/>
            less these be created, then, the universe will be imperfect; <lb/>
            for it will not contain within it every kind of animal, though <lb/>
            it ought, in order to be quite perfect. Yet if these are gene­ <lb/>
            rated, and partake of life through me, they will become equal <lb/>
            to the gods. In order, then, that mortal natures may subsist, <lb/>
            and the universe may be truly all, turn yourselves, according <note type="footnote"> * A comparison of this statement with Hesiod's will show that Plato <lb/>
            was not much governed by the poet's authority. Comp. Theog. v. 132 <lb/>
            —156; 336—350; 453—460. Plato probably took his notion, as <lb/>
            Proclus suggests, from the Orphic hymns. </note> <lb/>

            to your nature, to the formation of animals, imitating the <lb/>
            power which I employed in the creation of yourselves. And <lb/>
            so far as any part of these is suited to have the same name <lb/>
            as immortals to be called divine, and destined to take the lead <lb/>
            among those who willingly pursue justice, and reverence you <lb/>
            -of these I myself will deliver the seeds and beginnings; <lb/>
            and for the rest do you weave together the mortal and im­ <lb/>
            mortal nature, constructing and generating animals, and pro­ <lb/>
            mote their growth too by supplying them with food, and <lb/>
            receive them back again [into your bosom] when fallen to <lb/>
            decay."*</p>
          <p>XVII.—Thus spoke the Creator; and again into the same <lb/>
            bowl, in which he had by mingling tempered the soul of the <lb/>
            universe, he poured into it likewise what was left of the <lb/>
            former mixture, somewhat indeed after the same manner, yet <lb/>
            not equally pure as at first, but less so by two or three degrees. <lb/>
            And after having thus framed the universe, he allotted to it <lb/>
            souls equal in number to the stars, inserting each in each; and <lb/>
            then, as it were, placing them on a vehicle [whereon to travel <lb/>
            through the heavens,] he pointed out the nature of the <lb/>
            universe, and announced to them the laws of fate; showing <lb/>
            them that the first generation would be allotted in common to <lb/>
            all, so that no particular soul should have less than its due <lb/>
            portion, and that after they had been distributed through the <lb/>
            several instruments of time adapted to each, † there would then <lb/>
            be produced that animal which is of all the most suited for <lb/>
            religious worship; and as human nature was of two kinds, <lb/>
            [male and female,] he showed them that the more excellent <lb/>
            was that which would afterwards be called man. As souls, <lb/>
            therefore, are from necessity engrafted in bodies that are <lb/>
            constantly gaining and losing their composing particles, he <lb/>
            declared to them that in the first place all persons must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily have one connate [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξύμφυτον</foreign>] sense produced by violent <lb/>
            emotions,-secondly, love mingled with pleasure and pain; and <lb/>
            besides these, fear and anger, together with all their conse­ <lb/>
            quences and natural opposites; and that such as subdued these <lb/>
            would live justly, those overcome by them unjustly. And he <lb/>
            declared also, that after living well for the time appointed to <note type="footnote"> * On this speech we must refer the reader to Stallbaum's long and <lb/>

              him, each one should once more return to the habitation of <lb/>
              his associate star, and spend a blessed and suitable exist­ <lb/>
              ence; but failing in these points, he should be changed in <lb/>
              his second generation into the nature of a woman ; and should <lb/>
              he not cease from evil even under these circumstances, <lb/>
              whatever the shape his wickedness had taken, so also the <lb/>
              soul should be changed into the nature of some brute <lb/>
              corresponding thereto, and when changed never cease from <lb/>
              labour, until, following the revolution of sameness and differ­ <lb/>
              ence peculiar to itself, and having overcome by reason its <lb/>
              turbulent and irrational part, which is a mass, as it were, <lb/>
              composed of fire, water, air, and earth, it should at length <lb/>
              return to the first and best disposition of its nature.*</p>
          <p>Having thus legislated for souls in all these particulars, in <lb/>
            order that he might be in no respect the cause of the future <lb/>
            wickedness of each, he planted some of them on the earth, <lb/>
            others in the moon, and others in the remaining different <lb/>
            instruments of time; and after this planting, he charged the <lb/>
            junior gods with the duty of constructing mortal bodies, as well <lb/>
            as everything additional that was required for the human <lb/>
            soul, giving them dominion also over these and all things <lb/>
            consequent thereon, and bidding them rule over the mortal <lb/>
            creature as nobly and honourably as they could, that it might <lb/>
            not become the cause of evil to itself.</p>
          <p>XVIII.—The Creator, after arranging all these particu­ <lb/>
            lars, then retired to his accustomed repose ; and while he thus <lb/>
            abode, his children forthwith obeyed their fathers order, and, <lb/>
            taking the immortal principle of a mortal animal, they, in imi­ <lb/>
            tation of. their own creator, borrowed + from the world portions <lb/>
            of fire and earth, water and air, as things which they should <lb/>
            one day restore ; and firmly united them together, not with <lb/>
            the same indissoluble bonds by which they themselves were <lb/>
            held together, but fixing them with thickly-set nails, invisible <lb/>

            elements each particular body, and placing the revolutions of <lb/>
            the immortal soul in a body subject both to renewal and <lb/>
            decay. These, however,-merged, as it were, in a deep river,­ <lb/>
            had no power of governing themselves, but violently hurried <lb/>
            forward both themselves and others, so that the whole animal <lb/>
            was movedconfusedly however, just as chance carried it <lb/>
            forward, and without any reason, according to the whole six <lb/>
            kinds of motion-backwards and forwards, to the right and <lb/>
            left, upwards and downwards, and so on, according to the six <lb/>
            differences of place. And great as was the advancing and <lb/>
            retiring wave which furnished nutrition, yet it was still more <lb/>
            agitated by the impulses which it received from without, <lb/>
            when the body came into collision with external and foreign <lb/>
            fire, or the solidity of earth, liquid waterfalls, or whirling <lb/>
            blasts of air; from all which the various movements fell <lb/>
            through the body on to the soul; which on this account were <lb/>
            afterwards, and are still, called perceptions [i. e. general sen­ <lb/>
            sations]. And these, moreover, instantly giving rise to an <lb/>
            exceedingly great and powerful motion, by moving with that <lb/>
            constantly flowing stream, and vehemently disturbing the re­ <lb/>
            volutions of the soul; wholly stopped the revolution according <lb/>
            to sameness by their contrary current, hindering it either from <lb/>
            commencing or continuing its course;*—and even the move­ <lb/>
            ment according to difference they so far disturbed, as to turn <lb/>
            from their circular orbits and throw into all possible disorder the <lb/>
            three intervals of double and triple, together with the mean <lb/>
            terms and conjoining links of the sesquitertian, sesquialter, <lb/>
            and sesquioctave ratios, which cannot be dissolved by any <lb/>
            one but the artificer by whom they were bound ;†—and thus, <lb/>
            though scarcely connected with each other, they are borne <lb/>

            at another obliquely, and then again upside down, just as if <note type="footnote"> * The general meaning of this rather involved sentence is,-that as <lb/>

            powers, clearly perceptible in their agitation and movements, so long as <lb/>
            the power of body and sense is not such as to destroy and impair them : <lb/>
            -but this of course must be the result of an union of body and soul. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            one were to fix his head on the earth and raise his feet on <lb/>
            high, in which case, both to the inverted person and the <lb/>
            spectators, the parts on the right would seem to be on the <lb/>
            left, and the left on the right. These circles likewise greatly <lb/>
            disturbed in these and similar ways, when they fall in ex­ <lb/>
            ternally with either sameness or difference, and call objects <lb/>
            either same or different, contrary to truth, become false and <lb/>
            unreasonable; nor is there any revolution among them which <lb/>
            has a controlling and directing power ;-and if, again, any of <lb/>
            the external sensations are hurried forward and join in doing <lb/>
            violence to the soul's whole receptacle, they then seem to <lb/>
            prevail, though in reality they are still in subjection.</p>
          <p>And it is owing to all these affections, that even now as in <lb/>
            the beginning, the soul, when first united to a mortal body, <lb/>
            is without intelligence; but when the stream of growth and <lb/>
            nutrition flows along with diminished speed, the circles of the <lb/>
            soul, restored to tranquillity, proceed in their proper path, <lb/>
            gaining steadiness as time goes on, and then the orbits of the <lb/>
            circles are regulated in their course agreeably to those that <lb/>
            travel according to nature; and they call both same and different <lb/>
            by their proper appellations, assigning wisdom to the person <lb/>
            by whom they are possessed. If any one, therefore, receives <lb/>
            both proper food and education, he must become perfectly <lb/>
            sound and healthy, escaping every important disease ; <lb/>
            whereas he who neglects his soul will pass lamely through <lb/>
            life's existence, and again pass into Hades aimless and un­ <lb/>
            serviceable.* Of these matters, however, more hereafter. It <lb/>
            is our business at present to treat more accurately of what we <lb/>
            before proposed,-namely, the generation of body in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with soul, and owing to what causes and divine fore­ <lb/>
            sight it has taken place, resting for our proofs chiefly on the <lb/>
            argument of analogy.</p>
          <p>XIX.—First, then, the gods, in imitation of the spherical <lb/>
            shape of the universe, bound the two divine circles of the <lb/>
            soul in a spherical body,-that, namely, which we now call <lb/>
            the head, which is man's most divine member, and the ruler <lb/>
            of our whole composition. And to this the gods who framed <lb/>
            it gave the whole body for its service, conceiving that it <lb/>
            would thus partake of every possible motion ; and moreover, <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰτελὴς καὶ ἀνόνητος</foreign>. Stephens proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνόητος</foreign> on the <lb/>
            authority of some MSS. —but no change is needed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            lest the head, in rolling over the various elevations and <lb/>
            depressions, should be unable to overcome the heights, or get <lb/>
            out of the cavities, the gods gave it the body to be its loco­ <lb/>
            motive vehicle. Hence the body was endued with length, <lb/>
            and furnished by Divine contrivance with four members, <lb/>
            naturally capable of extension and flexion, to enable it to <lb/>
            seize objects, to give it a stable support, and to allow it to <lb/>
            pass from place to place ; and above this body was placed the <lb/>
            head, the abode of our most divine and sacred portion. This <lb/>
            was why we were furnished with legs and hands ;-and as <lb/>
            the gods considered that the fore parts are more honourable <lb/>
            and fitter to rule than those behind, they gave us a motion <lb/>
            chiefly progressive.* Beside this, it was requisite, that man's <lb/>
            front should be distinct and dissimilarly formed from the <lb/>
            other side; and on this account they first placed about the <lb/>
            vessel of the head a face provided with organs to express all <lb/>
            the energies of the soul, and assigned to this anterior part <lb/>
            the natural government of man. And of these organs, the <lb/>
            first that they constructed were the light-bearing eyes, fixing <lb/>
            them in from some such cause as the following: The body <lb/>
            of these eyes they formed to consist of fire, not enough in­ <lb/>
            deed to burn, but to give a gentle light suitable to each <lb/>
            day; for the pure fire contained within us and related to it, <lb/>
            they caused to flow smoothly through the eyes, and in dense <lb/>
            quantities throughout, but condensing it more especially in <lb/>
            the middle of the eyes, so as to conceal all the grosser <lb/>
            part within, and allow the pure only to filter through. <lb/>
            When, therefore, the light of day surrounds the stream of <lb/>
            vision, then, by the mutual falling of similar bodies on each <lb/>
            other, one well-adapted body is constituted, according to the <lb/>
            direction of the eyes, wherever the light proceeding from <lb/>
            within resists that which falls on it from without. But the <lb/>
            whole becoming similarly affected through similitude, when <lb/>
            it either touches anything else or is itself touched by an­ <lb/>
            other, then the motion thus produced, diffusing itself through <lb/>
            the whole body even as far as the soul, causes that sensation <lb/>
            which we denominate sight. But when this kindred fire [ within <lb/>
            us] departs into night, the sight is cut off; for in this case, by <lb/>
            proceeding into a dissimilar nature, it becomes estranged, and <lb/>
            is extinguished: since it has no longer any relation to the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig63.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="351"/>
              proximate surrounding air, which is naturally destitute of <lb/>
              fire. Hence it ceases from seeing, and besides this, becomes <lb/>
              the introducer of sleep; for the gods constructed the eyelids <lb/>
              to be a preservative of the sight, and thus by their compres­ <lb/>
              sion restrain the power of its inward fire, and besides <lb/>
              that, scatter and smooth over its internal motions; and when <lb/>
              they are thus calmed, rest ensues; which rest, when pro­ <lb/>
              found, produces a sleep attended with few dreams ;—but on <lb/>
              the other hand, if certain unusually vehement motions remain, <lb/>
              then, according to their nature and the places in which they <lb/>
              occur, they will engender corresponding phantasms within, <lb/>
              which will come to our recollection as soon as we wake. <lb/>
              With respect, also, to the formation of images on mirrors, and <lb/>
              all lucid, smooth surfaces, there is nothing in these difficult of <lb/>
              solution; for all such phenomena necessarily result from the <lb/>
              mutual affinity of the external and internal fire, and again <lb/>
              from one in particular that subsists about smooth bodies <lb/>
              individually, and is many times reflected, because the fire <lb/>
              around the face gradually becomes united on the smooth and <lb/>
              shining surface with the fire coming from the eyes. The <lb/>
              parts on the right, too, appear to be on the left, because there <lb/>
              is a mutual contact of the contrary parts of the sight with the <lb/>
              contrary parts of the object, different from their accustomed <lb/>
              mode of approach. On the contrary, the parts on the right <lb/>
              appear on the right, and the left on the left, when there is a <lb/>
              reflexion of the light composed of the mingled fires, both <lb/>
              exterior and interior; and secondly, the smoothness of the <lb/>
              mirrors, which are convex, reflect that which is to the right on <lb/>
              the left, and the left to the right. But if the mirror be con­ <lb/>
              cave, it presents an image wholly inverted, by sending the <lb/>
              lower part of the image upwards, and again the upper part <lb/>
              downwards.* All these phenomena, therefore, are only some <lb/>
              of the concurring causes! which the divinity brings to his aid <lb/>
              in rendering the idea of that which is best as far as possible <lb/>
              complete,-whereas the multitude are of opinion that these <note type="footnote"> * This is a very obscure passage, but much light has been thrown <lb/>
              upon it by Prof. T. H. Martin (Etudes sur le Timée, 2 vols. Paris, <lb/>
              1841), who conceives that Plato is here referring to convex and concave <lb/>
              mirrors. Considerable light is thrown also on the meaning of the Greek <lb/>
              words by a passage in Euclid's Optics, p. 393. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              are not the concurring but the real causes of all things,­ <lb/>
              such, namely, as those producing cold and heat, freezing and <lb/>
              thawing, and such like, but which are wholly incapable of <lb/>
              exercising reason and intellect; for the soul may be said to be <lb/>
              the only one of all beings that can acquire intellect; and this <lb/>
              is invisible, whereas fire and water, air and earth, are all <lb/>
              visible bodies. As for the lover of intellect and science, <lb/>
              however, he should explore the first causes of intellectual <lb/>
              nature, and consider, respecting second causes, how many <lb/>
              arise from the motion of other bodies, and yet necessarily give <lb/>
              motion again to'others. This, then, is what we ought to do : <lb/>
              we should speak concerning both kinds of causes, but sepa­ <lb/>
              rately of such as engage the intellect in forming things fair <lb/>
              and good; and of such, also, as, abandoning wisdom, produce <lb/>
              the things they form just as it may chance, and without <lb/>
              any regard to order.</p>
          <p>XX.—Respecting the second causes of the eyes,* therefore, <lb/>
            so far as they possess the power which falls to their lot, let <lb/>
            what has been already said suffice; and we will next speak <lb/>
            of their greatest and most useful employment, for which, <lb/>
            indeed, they were expressly bestowed on us by the Deity. <lb/>
            The sight, indeed, is in my opinion the cause of the greatest <lb/>
            benefit to man,—since even in our present discussion about <lb/>
            the universe, not one argument could ever have been adduced <lb/>
            without surveying the stars, the sun, and the heavens. Now, <lb/>
            however, both day and night, months and periods of years, <lb/>
            have been seen and arithmetically calculated; and they give us <lb/>
            a conception of time, and means of investigating the nature of <lb/>
            the universe; from all which we have gained that kind of <lb/>
            learning termed philosophy, a better gift than which never <lb/>
            was nor ever will be conferred by the gods on our mortal <lb/>
            race. This, then, is what I call the greatest benefit of the <lb/>
            eyes; and as for the others that are of less consequence, why <lb/>
            should I celebrate them, to make those who are blind and <lb/>
            unphilosophic mourn and regret them in vain ? This, how­ <lb/>
            ever, we may assert, that God invented and bestowed sight <lb/>
            on us for this express purpose, that on surveying the circles of <lb/>
            intelligence in the heavens, we might properly employ those of <lb/>
            our own minds, which, though disturbed when compared with <lb/>
            the -others that are uniform, are still allied to their circula­ <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig65.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="353"/>
              tions; and that having thus learned and being naturally pos­ <lb/>
              sessed of a correct reasoning faculty, we might by imitating the <lb/>
              uniform revolutions of divinity set right our own silly wan­ <lb/>
              derings and blunders.</p>
          <p>As respects voice and hearing, we may say again, that they <lb/>
            were bestowed on us by the gods for the same objects and on <lb/>
            the same account; for speech was ordained for the very same <lb/>
            purpose as the sight, which it greatly aids in its office ;—and it <lb/>
            is with a view also to harmony that the hearing has an aptitude <lb/>
            for musical sounds. That harmony, moreover, which consists <lb/>
            in motions analogous to the revolutions of our soul, does not <lb/>
            seem advantageous to him who wisely devotes himself to the <lb/>
            Muses* on the mere ground of its being pleasurable without <lb/>
            reason, as it seems at present; but it was given us by the <lb/>
            Muses to aid us in reducing the disturbed circulation of our <lb/>
            soul to mutual order and accordance ;—and again, they gave <lb/>
            us rhythm for the same purpose, as the means of reforming the <lb/>
            irregular and ungracious habits that prevail in the majority <lb/>
            of our race.</p>
          <p>XXI.—Thus far, with only a few exceptions, our past <lb/>
            remarks have had reference to the creations of intellect; and <lb/>
            we ought to speak likewise of things that come of necessity; <lb/>
            for the generation of this world results wholly from the <lb/>
            co-operation of intellect and necessity. Intellect, indeed, <lb/>
            ruling over necessity, persuaded it to bring to the highest <lb/>
            perfection the majority of created things; and in this way, <lb/>
            by the persuasive power of wisdom over necessity, this universe <lb/>
            was first created. Now, correctly to explain in what way it <lb/>
            was created, we must refer in our explanation to the form of <lb/>
            a variable cause,t as the nature of the case requires. Let <lb/>
            us then recall our steps, and take up the subject afresh, <lb/>
            ,going back to first principles, as we did before. Let us <lb/>
            investigate then the nature and affections of fire and water, <lb/>
            air and earth, prior to the generation of the heavens ; <lb/>
            for up to the present time no one has yet unfolded their <lb/>
            generation :-and yet we speak of fire and other things as <lb/>
            principles and elements of the universe, just as if the nature <lb/>
            of each was known ;—whereas at the same time any one with <note type="footnote"> * That is, philosophy, which likewise is signified by the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μον­ <lb/>

              the least intelligence must be aware that they cannot be com­ <lb/>
              pared even to letters or parts of which syllables are formed. <lb/>
              As respects ourselves, this is what we propose :—we will not <lb/>
              speak of the principle or principles, or whatever other deno­ <lb/>
              mination they may receive, of all things;—and this for no <lb/>
              other reason than the difficulty of stating what are my senti­ <lb/>
              ments according to our present method of discussion.* Do <lb/>
              not expect me then to speak thus, for I cannot persuade <lb/>
              myself that I have the ability to undertake so difficult a sub­ <lb/>
              ject. Keeping, therefore, to the line of argument laid down <lb/>
              at the beginning, on the force of probability,† I will endea­ <lb/>
              vour to make statements not less probable than those of <lb/>
              others, and beginning the subject once more from its com­ <lb/>
              mencement ‡ to discourse on the matter both in detail and <lb/>
              as a whole. First, then, invoking the divinity who has now <lb/>
              from the first been the guardian of our discourse, to defend us <lb/>
              from an absurd and unusual exposition and lead us to a doc­ <lb/>
              trine founded on probability-let us again begin to speak.</p>
          <p>XXII. — This fresh commencement then, of our present <lb/>
            discussion requires a more ample division than the former. <lb/>
            For then we distinguished only two species ; but we must now <lb/>
            admit a third. In the former discussion two were sufficient; <lb/>
            -one set forth as a species of model, apprehensible by the <lb/>
            intellect, and always subsisting on the principle of sameness, <lb/>
            -the second an imitation of the model, generated and <lb/>
            visible; and we did not then distinguish a third, because we <lb/>
            deemed these two sufficient. But now the subject of dis­ <lb/>
            course seems to compel me to introduce and explain a new <lb/>
            species which is both difficult and obscure.§ Of what <lb/>
            natural power, then, are we to conceive it possessed? It <lb/>
            is indeed in some sort the special receptacle, and, as it <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ</foreign> rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρόντα τϱόπον τη̃ς διεξόἰου</foreign>.Stallbaum considers <lb/>

              were, the nurse of all generation. Such indeed is the truth :— <lb/>
              but we must speak more clearly concerning it. And this will <lb/>
              certainly be an arduous undertaking on many accounts, but <lb/>
              principally on account of the questions that must previously <lb/>
              be settled concerning fire and the rest of the elements,-why <lb/>
              one should be called water rather than fire, or air rather than <lb/>
              earth, or why any one of them should bear one name in par­ <lb/>
              ticular rather than all the rest; thus rendering it a difficult <lb/>
              matter to use a language about it that is fixed and stable. <lb/>
              How then, and by what means, are we to arrive at a pro­ <lb/>
              bable conclusion in this dilemma ?</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, what we now denominate water, <lb/>
            on becoming condensed, seems to take the form of stones and <lb/>
            earth,-and when melted and dispersed, that of vapour and <lb/>
            air ;-air also, when burnt up, becomes fire, while the latter <lb/>
            again, on becoming condensed and extinct, resumes the form <lb/>
            of air ; and again air, when collected and condensed, produces <lb/>
            mists and clouds, from which, when still more compressed, <lb/>
            rain descends; and from water again are formed earth and <lb/>
            stones; —[the whole of them,] as it seems, exchanging all <lb/>
            round their mutual generation.*</p>
          <p>XXIII.—As these, then, never maintain any constancy of <lb/>
            existence, who will have the assurance to maintain that any <lb/>
            one of them is this rather than that ? No one :-and it would <lb/>
            be far the safest plan to speak about them as follows:- <lb/>
            When we see anything constantly passing from one state of <lb/>
            existence to another, as fire for instance, we should not say <lb/>
            that it is fire absolutely, but something fiery,-and again, that <lb/>
            what we call water is not absolutely so, but something <lb/>
            watery; without assigning to them any names that would <lb/>
            give the idea of stability, as we think people do, when they <lb/>
            express it by this and that (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόδε καὶ</foreign> TOVTO) ;—for not being of <lb/>
            an abiding nature, it cannot endure to have applied to it such <lb/>
            terms as, this thing, of this nature, belonging to this ; and <lb/>
            any such others as would show it to have a substantive exist­ <lb/>
            ence. Hence we should not give any one of them an indi­ <lb/>
            vidual name, but call it something such-like, but ever fluctu­ <lb/>
            ating ; and especially with respect to fire, [we should assert] <lb/>
            that it is wholly such-like, and similarly likewise, every- <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="356"/>
              thing endued with generation. [That receptacle,] however, <lb/>
              in which each of these appears successively to grow up and <lb/>
              , decay, that alone is entitled to be termed this and that;— <lb/>
              whereas anything of any kind soever, as hot, white, or their <lb/>
              contraries, and all therefrom proceeding, cannot be so deno­ <lb/>
              minated. But let us again try more clearly to explain our <lb/>
              meaning. If any one, in modelling all kinds of figures out <lb/>
              of gold, were unceasingly to transform them one by one into <lb/>
              all the others, and some one present were to point to one of <lb/>
              them and inquire what it was, it would be by far the safest <lb/>
              and most correct to say that is gold; but as for its being a <lb/>
              triangle, or any other figure that might be given to it, not to <lb/>
              speak of them as being so in reality, inasmuch as they are <lb/>
              in process of change, even while we make such assertion; <lb/>
              but to be content if it may safely be denominated such-like, <lb/>
              [or of such a nature]. The same remark applies to that which <lb/>
              receives all bodies ;-and we should ever call it by the same <lb/>
              name, as it never abandons its own proper power, but per­ <lb/>
              petually receives all things, and never anywhere or in any <lb/>
              way assumes any of those shapes that enter into it,- being <lb/>
              in fact a natural receptacle for everything,* receiving both <lb/>
              motion and form from what enters therein; and this is why <lb/>
              it exhibits a different aspect at different times. But as for <lb/>
              the representations of the objects that enter and depart hence, <lb/>
              they are modelled after them in a manner wonderful and <lb/>
              difficult to describe, as we shall hereafter relate.</p>
          <p>XXIV.—For the present, then, we must consider three <lb/>
            things:—first, that which is produced,-the second, that in <lb/>
            which it is produced,-and the third, that of which the thing <lb/>
            produced is the natural resemblance. And especially is it <lb/>
            proper to compare that which receives to the mother (i. e. <lb/>
            which supplies the model), that from which it receives to the <lb/>
            father, and the nature intermediate between these to the <lb/>
            child ;t and to consider, also, that as the image should <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκμαγει̃ον</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει πάντι κει̃ται</foreign>. This unusual meaning of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εκμαγει̃ον</foreign> is well explained by a passage in the opening of the Timæus <lb/>
            Locrus, p. 94, a.—rav <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλαν ἐκμαγει̃ον καὶ ματέρα τιθάναν τε καὶ <lb/>
            γεννατικὰν εἶμεν τὰςτρίτας ουσίας</foreign>. The words and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕδρα</foreign> are <lb/>
            sometimes used in this dialogue to express a similar notion; viz. the <lb/>
            primitive matter of things created, infinite in extent but capable of re­ <lb/>
            ceiving shapes. </note><note type="footnote"> t This passage is alluded to by Aristotle, Metaph. I. ch. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            present every possible variety of forms, that in which the <lb/>
            model is formed cannot well be prepared for the purpose, <lb/>
            unless those forms have been erased from it which it used to <lb/>
            receive from other quarters. Indeed, if it were like any of <lb/>
            the objects that enter into it, if aught were to present itself <lb/>
            of a nature contrary and wholly different, it would produce a <lb/>
            bad likeness thereof. And hence from presenting at the same <lb/>
            time its own image, that which is destined to receive within <lb/>
            itself all the different species possible, should itself be desti­ <lb/>
            tute of all form whatever ;-just as those preparing sweet­ <lb/>
            smelling unguents take all pains to render wholly inodorous <lb/>
            the liquids that are to receive the perfume,-and as those also <lb/>
            who wish to impress figures on a soft substance carefully <lb/>
            remove from it any previous impression, and make it, as <lb/>
            far as they can, exquisitely smooth and well-polished. In <lb/>
            the same way, then, that which is intended properly to <lb/>
            receive through its entire extent the resemblances of eternal <lb/>
            beings, should be naturally without any form whatever of its <lb/>
            own. Hence, as to this mother and receptacle of things <lb/>
            created, which is visible and every way perceptible, we cannot <lb/>
            term it either earth, air, fire, or water,-nor again, any one of <lb/>
            their compounds, or any of the elements from which they <lb/>
            were produced; but we should not be at all wrong in calling <lb/>
            it a certain invisible and shapeless essence, which receives all <lb/>
            things and has a certain share of intelligence,—though how it <lb/>
            has it, is a matter very obscure and difficult of apprehension. <lb/>
            So far, however, as it is possible to arrive at its nature from <lb/>
            what has been previously said, we may very correctly say <lb/>
            that fire appears to be something inflamed,* water something <lb/>
            moist,-and so in like manner, earth and air, so far as it <lb/>
            receives the images of these bodies.</p>
          <p>XXV.—Let us, then, be somewhat more minute in re­ <lb/>
            solving the following question, †—whether there is a certain <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig69.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> t The question now proposed is, whether the elementary bodies have a <lb/>
              separate existence and eternal ideas, or whether those only are certain <lb/>
              that are cognizable by the senses. On this point he says, that just as <lb/>
              science and opinion widely differ, so also do the ideas of things and the <lb/>
              things submitted to the senses. Different, however, from both these is <lb/>
              the xwpa or receptacle of that infinite matter, which can only be con­ <lb/>
              ceived by a bastard sort of reason ; because the infinite is not the subject </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="358"/>
              fire subsisting in itself,-and so also, as respects other things <lb/>
              which we always say have a separate existence in themselves, <lb/>
              whether the objects alone that we see, and which are per­ <lb/>
              ceived through the bodily organs, possess reality of being, <lb/>
              and nothing besides these has any existence at all,-or <lb/>
              whether we are wrong in asserting that each of them has its <lb/>
              corresponding idea, when after all it is nothing but idle talk. <lb/>
              The present question, therefore, we must not decide without <lb/>
              much judicious examination; neither should we add to our <lb/>
              present discourse any great length of matter not strictly <lb/>
              belonging to the subject :-but if there should appear to be any <lb/>
              limit, by which it can be contained within a small compass, <lb/>
              that would of all things be the most opportune to our present <lb/>
              design.</p>
          <p>Thus, then, will I state my opinion. If intellect and true <lb/>
            opinion are two separate kinds of things, there must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily be self-existing ideas not perceptible by the senses, and <lb/>
            to be apprehended only by the intellect; but if, as appears to <lb/>
            some, true opinion differs in no respect from intellect, every­ <lb/>
            thing perceived through the body should be considered perfectly <lb/>
            real. We must consider them, then, as two distinct things, <lb/>
            because they both have a separate origin and character, one <lb/>
            of them produced in us by learning, the other through <lb/>
            persuasion,-one always based on true reason, the other irra­ <lb/>
            tional,—the one not to be moved by persuasion, the other <lb/>
            subject to such mutation :-and lastly, of true opinion every <lb/>
            man has a share; but of intellect only the gods, and some <lb/>
            small portion of mankind.</p>
          <p>XXVI.—Such being the case, we must acknowledge that <lb/>
            there is an idea which subsists according to sameness, un­ <lb/>
            produced and not subject to decay; receiving nothing into <lb/>
            itself from elsewhere, and itself never entering into any <lb/>
            other nature, but invisible and imperceptible by senses, <lb/>
            and to be apprehended only by pure intellect; while the <lb/>
            second, on the other hand, which is like it, and bears the <lb/>
            same name, is perceptible by the senses, the effect of pro­ <lb/>
            duction, ever in motion, coming into being in a certain spot, <lb/>
            and then again hastening to decay, being apprehended by <lb/>
            opinion united with perception. Again, there is a third <note type="footnote"> of mental intelligence, but is, as it were hypothetically, considered by an <lb/>
            inferior reasoning faculty. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            class -of being,-that of eternal place; which isis. never de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, but becomes a seat (or receptacle) for everything <lb/>
            created, being perceptible of itself without the interference of <lb/>
            the senses, by a sort of bastard reason, though scarcely <lb/>
            to be relied on; and hence seeing it, as in a dream, we <lb/>
            assert that every being must necessarily be somewhere, <lb/>
            and in a certain place, and that nothing can exist which is <lb/>
            neither on earth or in the heavens. With regard to all <lb/>
            these, and such like opinions and the ideas which are enter­ <lb/>
            tained in a waking state and have a positive existence, we <lb/>
            cannot, owing to this dreaminess, clearly distinguish the one <lb/>
            from the other, and state what is the fact,-that the image, <lb/>
            which cannot claim as its own that even for which it is <lb/>
            formed, but is ever borne along as the spectre of something <lb/>
            else, must consequently be formed in something else, and <lb/>
            somehow vindicate to itself a separate essence, if it has any <lb/>
            existence at all ;-whereas, with regard to real being, true <lb/>
            and accurate reason aids it by affirming, that as longias two <lb/>
            things differ from each other, they cannot so exist one in <lb/>
            another, as to be at the same time two things and one only.*</p>
          <p>XXVII.—This, then, is a summary of my opinion,-that <lb/>
            there are three distinct things which existed before the for­ <lb/>
            mation of the universe, being, place, and generation ;—that <lb/>
            the nurse of generation, moistened and inflamed, receiving the <lb/>
            forms of earth and air, and experiencing all the other acci­ <lb/>
            dents thereon consequent, appeared under many various <lb/>
            aspects ; but as it was contained by powers neither similar <lb/>
            nor equally balanced, it could not possibly be balanced itself, <lb/>
            and through the want of such balance, became itself im­ <lb/>
            pelled by these forces, to which it again in turn gave im­ <lb/>
            pulse ;† while the parts in motion were separately hurried <lb/>
            along in different directions, like things shaken and winnowed <note type="footnote"> * This passage is somewhat difficult and involved; but Plato's meaning <lb/>
            seems to be, that the things falling under the senses are conformed <lb/>
            according to the example of the ideas, and are, as it were, representations <lb/>
            thereof, though different from the ideas themselves:—and hence there <lb/>
            must necessarily be some matter in which they have been moulded, <lb/>
            or else they can have no permanent existence ; though nevertheless sound <lb/>
            reason shows us that there is a wide difference between them and the <lb/>
            ideas properly so called. </note><note type="footnote"> t On the full meaning of this passage, see Stallbaum's long note ad <lb/>

            by sieves (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλοκάνων</foreign>) and machines used for the cleansing of <lb/>
            corn, the dense and heavy particles in one direction, those <lb/>
            that are light settling in another quite different. Thus <lb/>
            when these four classes were agitated by their receptacle, <lb/>
            which was itself moved as by the shaking of the [above-men­ <lb/>
            tioned] instrument, there was a separation of the dissimilar <lb/>
            parts, and a crowding together of those most alike; in <lb/>
            consequence of which these other things also occupied a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent position, before the universe was created and from such <lb/>
            materials reduced to order. Before this, indeed, they all <lb/>
            subsisted irrationally, and without measure ;-but when the <lb/>
            Creator undertook to arrange the universe, he first gave <lb/>
            shapes with forms and numbers to fire and earth, water and <lb/>
            air, which possessed indeed certain traces of their true essence, <lb/>
            though, nevertheless, wholly so situated, as everything would <lb/>
            probably be, in the absence of its god.* And let us above <lb/>
            all things hold, and ever bold, that the Deity made them as <lb/>
            far as possible the most beautiful and the best, when before <lb/>
            they were in a totally different condition. Now, then, I will <lb/>
            try to show you the distribution and generation of these things <lb/>
            individually by a somewhat unusual mode of proof; but yet, as <lb/>
            you have trodden the paths of mathematical learning, through <lb/>
            which we must necessarily make our demonstration, you will <lb/>
            not fail to follow me.</p>
          <p>XXVIII.—First, then, that fire and earth, water and air, <lb/>
            are bodies, is evident surely to every one. But every species <lb/>
            of body possesses solidity; and every solid must necessarily <lb/>
            be contained by planes. Again, a base formed of a perfectly <lb/>
            plane surface is composed from triangles.t But all triangles <lb/>
            are originally of two kinds, each of them having one angle a <lb/>
            right angle, and the two others acute :-and one of these has <note type="footnote"> * What Plato here means is, that the elements before the creation, <lb/>
            although infinite, shapeless, and soulless, contained within them certain <lb/>
            traces of their true essence, and were afterwards made finite and of fixed <lb/>
            shape by being clothed, as it were, with forms and numbers. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              an equal part of a right angle divided by the equal sides; <lb/>
              while in the other, two unequal parts of a right angle are <lb/>
              divided by the unequal sides. This, then, we lay down, ac­ <lb/>
              cording both to probability and necessity, as the origin and <lb/>
              principle of fire and all other bodies ;—but as for the heavenly <lb/>
              principles thereof, these indeed are known only to the Deity, <lb/>
              and to those among men who enjoy God's favour.</p>
          <p>We must relate, then, of what kind those four most beau­ <lb/>
            tiful .bodies were that thus came into being, and which, how­ <lb/>
            ever unlike each other, may yet be produced from each other <lb/>
            by dissolution. By accomplishing this, indeed, we shall ascer­ <lb/>
            tain the truth about the generation of earth and fire, as well <lb/>
            those elements (i. e. water and air) which in their just pro­ <lb/>
            portion hold an intermediate position; for then we shall <lb/>
            allow no one to assert that there are visible bodies more <lb/>
            beautiful than these, each of which belongs to a separate <lb/>
            class. It must be our endeavour, therefore, to unite together <lb/>
            these four kinds of bodies so excellent in beauty, and so <lb/>
            prove to you that we have sufficiently apprehended their <lb/>
            nature. Of the two triangles, indeed, the isosceles has, but <lb/>
            one form, while the oblong or scalene admits of infinite variety. <lb/>
            We must select, therefore, the most beautiful among the in­ <lb/>
            finites, if we would begin and proceed in due order :-still if <lb/>
            any one can prove that he has found any form yet better and <lb/>
            more suitable for the composition of these bodies, he shall be <lb/>
            treated not as an enemy but a friend, and his opinion shall <lb/>
            prevail. As for us, however, we fix on one only as the most <lb/>
            beautiful of all the many triangles, passing over all the rest ;­ <lb/>
            that out of which is formed a third, the equilateral triangle.* <lb/>
            To explain the reason of this would indeed require a somewhat <lb/>
            lengthened proof: — nevertheless we propose a handsome <lb/>
            reward for him who by a diligent investigation finds this not <lb/>
            to be the case. We select, therefore, two triangles out of <lb/>
            many, from which the bodies of fire and the other elements <lb/>
            have been constructed,-one being an isosceles, the other one <lb/>
            always having the square of its longer side the triple of that <lb/>
            of the shorter.</p>
          <p>But what we formerly asserted rather obscurely, we must <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐἔ</foreign> ov TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰϭόπλευρον τρίγωνον ἐκ τρίτου ϭυνέϭτηκε</foreign>. The sense of <lb/>
            the whole passage is explained geometrically in Stallbaum's note. We <lb/>

             <pb n="362"/>
            now more accurately define. For all the four kinds [of ele­ <lb/>
            ments] seemed to be mutually generated among each other <lb/>
            from not being correctly represented; for there are generated <lb/>
            from the triangles which we have just chosen, four kinds <lb/>
            [of solid figures ]-three of them, indeed, from one having <lb/>
            unequal sides, and the fourth alone constructed from the <lb/>
            isosceles triangle.* All of them, therefore, cannot, by disso­ <lb/>
            lution into each other, produce from many small things a <lb/>
            few that are large,-this being effected only by three of <lb/>
            them ; for all things whatever naturally arise from one only, <lb/>
            and when the greater parts are dissolved, many small parts <lb/>
            will be formed out of them, receiving figures suitable to each ; <lb/>
            and again, when the numerous small parts are dispersed into <lb/>
            triangles, a single number is formed, and the entire bulk <lb/>
            constitutes one separate body of large size.t Thus much then <lb/>
            may suffice concerning their mutual generation.</p>
          <p>XXIX.—We must speak next in order concerning the <lb/>
            quality of each class individually, and show from what <lb/>
            composition of numbers each was formed. The first, then, <lb/>
            indeed, is that composed from the smallest triangles, its <lb/>
            element being that which has its subtending side twice the <lb/>
            length of the shorter. Now, two of these triangles being <lb/>
            mutually brought together to form a diagonal diameter, and <lb/>
            this being thrice repeated, so that the diagonals and shorter <lb/>
            sides shall meet in the same point, as in a centre, the result <lb/>
            will be one equilateral triangle composed of six triangles. <lb/>
            But four equilateral triangles form by the union of three <lb/>
            plane angles one solid angle, the size of which exceeds that <lb/>
            of the most obtuse plane angle; and thus by forming a figure <lb/>
            that comprises four of these angles, we constitute that first <lb/>
            species of solid, [the tetrahedron,] which divides into equal and <lb/>
            similar parts the entire sphere in which it is inscribed. The <lb/>
            second species of solid, [the octahedron,] is formed from the <lb/>
            same triangles, which unite to form eight equilateral triangles, <lb/>
            and form one solid angle from four plane angles, six solid <note type="footnote"> * Namely, the tetrahedron or pyramid, octahedron, and icosahedron, <lb/>
            which are generated from six equal-sided triangles, and fourthly, the cube, <lb/>
            generated from an equilateral triangle. See Stallbaum, ad locum. </note> <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="363"/>
              angles being requisite to constitute this second class of solids. <lb/>
              The third, [the icosahedron,] is formed from the union of one <lb/>
              hundred and twenty elements, so united as to form twelve solid <lb/>
              angles, each formed by five plane equilateral triangles, and it <lb/>
              has for its bases (or faces) twenty equilateral triangles. These <lb/>
              are the only solids that can be formed from this element, [viz. <lb/>
              the scalene triangle]. It was the isosceles triangle, however, <lb/>
              that produced the fourth elementary figure,—four of them <lb/>
              being so united with their right angles at the centre, as to <lb/>
              form one equilateral four-sided plane ; and six of these again <lb/>
              united forming eight solid angles, each of which is formed by <lb/>
              the combination of three plane right angles ;-the figure of <lb/>
              the body thus composed being cubical, having six plane <lb/>
              quadrangular equilateral bases. There was yet a certain <lb/>
              fifth combination, [the regular dodecahedron ;] and this the <lb/>
              Deity employed in tracing the plan of the universe.*</p>
          <p>XXX.-Should any one then, after careful consideration <lb/>
            of all these points, be at a loss to determine whether <lb/>
            the number of worlds is infinite or unite,! let him con­ <lb/>
            sider that to admit an infinite number thereof, would be <lb/>
            the notion only of one who is ignorant of all that he should <lb/>
            best know. Still it may with much propriety be questioned <lb/>
            whether there is in reality only one world, or whether there <lb/>
            are five. According to our opinion, indeed, which is founded <lb/>
            on probable reasoning, there is but one world; though others <lb/>
            perhaps, regarding the question in another point of view, may <lb/>
            be of a different opinion. Let us now leave alone further <lb/>
            speculations of this kind, and returning to the elementary forms <lb/>
            that have now been created in our discussion, let us assign <lb/>
            them respectively to fire, earth, water, and air. To earth, <lb/>
            indeed, let us assign a cubical form ; for of all the four kinds <lb/>
            earth is the most immoveable, and is of all bodies the most <lb/>
            easy to model,-such being necessarily the case with that <lb/>
            which has the most secure bases. Among the triangles, <lb/>
            then, that we originally mentioned, that which has equal <note type="footnote"> * On these geometric forms or elementary particles, we must refer the <lb/>
            reader to Martin's .tudes sur le Timée, notes 66—69, ii. pp. 234—250, <lb/>
            where the whole subject is exceedingly well explained and illustrated. </note><note type="footnote"> t It was the opinion of Democritus that the worlds are infinite; and <lb/>
            the same notion was afterwards entertained by Epicurus. Comp. Diog. <lb/>

            sides possesses firmer bases than one having unequal sides; <lb/>
            and of the two equilateral plane figures thus formed, the <lb/>
            square has necessarily a firmer base than the triangle, <lb/>
            whether considered with reference to its parts or the whole. <lb/>
            On this account, in assigning this figure to the earth, we <lb/>
            still preserve probability ;—and we shall do this also by <lb/>
            assigning to water that figure which is the least moveable <lb/>
            of the whole, to fire that which is most so, and to air <lb/>
            that which is intermediate between the two, — assigning <lb/>
            also the smallest body to fire, the greatest to water, and <lb/>
            to air one of a size intermediate between fire and water;­ <lb/>
            and again, the most subtile body to fire, the next in this respect <lb/>
            to air, and the third to water. Among all these then, that <lb/>
            body which possesses the fewest bases must necessarily be <lb/>
            the most easily moveable, as well as most penetrating, and in <lb/>
            every way most acute, being also exceedingly light, from <lb/>
            being composed of the smallest possible number of elements : <lb/>
            -and so also the second has these properties in a secondary <lb/>
            degree, and the third in the third degree. Let it be agreed <lb/>
            then, that, according both to strict and probable reasoning, the <lb/>
            solid form of the pyramid is the element and germ of fire; <lb/>
            that the second form described is air; and the third water. <lb/>
            All these elements then, we must conceive to be so minutely <lb/>
            small, that the individual parts of each kind may from their <lb/>
            smallness escape notice, and yet when many of them are col­ <lb/>
            lected together, they become from their bulk the objects of <lb/>
            our perception.* Moreover, as respects their relative pro­ <lb/>
            portions, numbers, motions, and other properties, the Deity, <lb/>
            so far as the nature of necessity has willingly and obediently <lb/>
            given way, has firmly established and united them together <lb/>
            in just proportion.t</p>
          <p>XXXI.—From all then that we have before said about the <lb/>
            nature of these bodies, the following account seems to be the <lb/>
            most probable :-Earth, when it meets with fire, and is dis­ <lb/>
            solved by its subtility, is borne along hither and thither in a <lb/>
            dissolved state either in the fire itself, or in the air, or in the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig73.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόϭθαι</foreign> ravra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνἁ λόγον</foreign>. Here is an awkward anacoluthon from the <lb/>

              water,-till its parts, meeting together, and again mutually <lb/>
              harmonizing, once more become earth; for they can never <lb/>
              take any other form. But water, when divided by fire or <lb/>
              air, may, by the re-composition of its parts, become either <lb/>
              one body of fire, or two bodies of air .;-and as for the air, <lb/>
              when it is decomposed, one only of its particles will produce <lb/>
              two of fire. And again, likewise, when fire receives into <lb/>
              itself either air or water or earth, though in small quantities <lb/>
              relatively to the mass which contains it, if it be dragged along <lb/>
              by the movements of these bodies and overcome in spite of all <lb/>
              resistance, and at last be decomposed and broken in pieces, <lb/>
              these two bodies of fire will coalesce into one of air; and if <lb/>
              again the air is overcome and separated into parts, then from <lb/>
              two wholes and a half there will be formed one whole body <lb/>
              of water. Again, let us consider this matter as follows:- <lb/>
              When any one of the other forms is enclosed by fire, and is <lb/>
              cut by the acuteness of its angles and sides, it escapes fur­ <lb/>
              ther division by passing into the nature of fire :-for among <lb/>
              bodies that are uniform and similar to each other, no one <lb/>
              by itself can cause any change in one of the same class, or <lb/>
              experience any itself, with respect to that which it resembles ; <lb/>
              whereas, when one class of bodies is contained within <lb/>
              another, and the weak one contends with the stronger, <lb/>
              it will not fail to be destroyed. And again, when the <lb/>
              smaller, being comprehended in the greater, and the few <lb/>
              by the many, are broken in pieces and extinguished, if they <lb/>
              be disposed to adopt the form of the prevailing nature, they <lb/>
              cease to be extinguished; and air becomes generated from <lb/>
              fire, -water from air: — but if they attack and fall into <lb/>
              contention with any of the rest that they may meet, the <lb/>
              agitated parts continue to be dissolved, till being every way <lb/>
              repulsed and dissolved, they fly to their kindred nature; or <lb/>
              else, being overcome, and joined into one out of many similar <lb/>
              to the prevailing power, they abide there in familiar union. <lb/>
              And especially, as the result of these affections, all things <lb/>
              whatever are mutually changing their positions ;-for the nu­ <lb/>
              merous individuals of each class are distinguished accord­ <lb/>
              ing to their respective places through the motion of their <lb/>
              receptacle, while those that are mutually dissimilar, but yet <lb/>
              resemble others, are hurried on by the concussion [of other <lb/>
              bodies] to the place occupied by the bodies they resemble. <lb/>
               <pb n="366"/>
              All unmixed and primary bodies then are generated from <lb/>
              such causes as these :-but that other classes of bodies are <lb/>
              naturally inherent in these forms, is owing to the composition <lb/>
              of each rudimental part (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτοιχει̃ον</foreign>) ; which not only at first <lb/>
              produces one triangle, possessed of a certain magnitude, but <lb/>
              others also, both greater and smaller, equal in number to the <lb/>
              various classes existing in the forms themselves ;—and hence, <lb/>
              these being mingled with themselves and each other, are <lb/>
              infinite in their variety, — a fact which every one should <lb/>
              consider, who means to argue with probability respecting the <lb/>
              nature of things.</p>
          <p>XXXII.—Concerning motion, then, and position, unless a <lb/>
            person can clearly understand in what manner and in con­ <lb/>
            junction with what these two take place, he will meet with <lb/>
            many hindrances in the subsequent part of this discourse. <lb/>
            This matter indeed we have already partly discussed; but <lb/>
            besides this, we must still inquire whether it be true, that <lb/>
            motion never willingly resides in smoothness, inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            difficult, or rather impossible, to conceive the existence of any­ <lb/>
            thing moving without a mover, or of a mover without some­ <lb/>
            thing in motion ;-motion being impossible while these are <lb/>
            away, and it being equally impossible that these should be <lb/>
            equable and smooth. Thus, then, we must assign a state of rest <lb/>
            to smoothness, and motion to that which is unequal and rough ; <lb/>
            inequality indeed being the cause again of a rough uneven <lb/>
            nature. Now, as regards the generation of inequality, that <lb/>
            we have already discussed; but how the several bodies, <lb/>
            when divided according to their classes, do not cease from <lb/>
            their mutual courses and motions, this we did not explain: <lb/>
            -and so we will once more make it the subject of inquiry. <lb/>
            The revolution of the universe, since it comprehends the <lb/>
            various classes of things, and is of circular shape and naturally <lb/>
            desirous of uniting with itself, compresses all things together, <lb/>
            and suffers no place to remain void. On this account is <lb/>
            it, that fire most of all penetrates through everything; <lb/>
            and air, in the next degree, being second to the former in <lb/>
            subtility and tenuity;—and the rest in the same way [ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their degree —forsuch as are composed of very <lb/>
            large parts have a very large vacuity in their composition,— <lb/>
            those, on the contrary, that are very small, a very small <lb/>
            vacuity. The union, then, resulting from compression drives <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            together the small parts into the intervals of the larger; and <lb/>
            thus, the small parts being placed side by side with the large, <lb/>
            the smaller dividing the greater, while the latter compress <lb/>
            the smaller, they are all borne upwards and downwards to <lb/>
            the places respectively suitable to each foreach, on chang­ <lb/>
            ing its magnitude, changes its position likewise: and so, <lb/>
            from these causes the production of diversity is constantly <lb/>
            maintained, giving that perpetual motion to these bodies, <lb/>
            which both now subsists and ever will continue.</p>
          <p>XXXIII.—In the next place, we must understand that <lb/>
            there are many kinds of fire ;-as for instance, flame,—that <lb/>
            which emanates from flame,* which without burning furnishes <lb/>
            light to the eyes,-and that which abides in ignited bodies, even <lb/>
            after the flame has been extinguished. In like manner, with <lb/>
            respect to air, one kind is of the greatest purity, that denomi­ <lb/>
            nated œther,—a second most turbulent, cloudy, and dark; and <lb/>
            besides these, there are other nameless kinds formed by the <lb/>
            inequality of the triangles. As respects water, again, it <lb/>
            admits of a twofold division, one kind being liquid, the other <lb/>
            fusible. The liquid kind, therefore, being composed of very <lb/>
            small and unequal parts of water, becomes moveable, both of <lb/>
            itself and by other bodies, through the inequality of its com­ <lb/>
            position and peculiar shape of its figure ; whereas the fusible <lb/>
            kind, which is composed of large and smooth parts, is more <lb/>
            stable than the former, as well as heavier and more compact, <lb/>
            owing to its smoothness ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign>—and when fire enters into and dis­ <lb/>
            solves its substance, it becomes more moveable, from losing its <lb/>
            uniformity ; and when it is thus rendered easily moveable, and <lb/>
            is repelled by the surrounding air, and extended on the earth, <lb/>
            it is said to be liquefied, by way of expressing the division of <lb/>
            its masses, and is said to flow also, in order to show its exten­ <lb/>
            sion over the earth :-and these two words express both the <lb/>
            changes which it undergoes. Again, when fire escapes from <lb/>
            this body, it does not retire into a vacuum, but the surround­ <lb/>
            ing air repelled [by the fire] drives the easily-moveable mass <lb/>
            of moisture into the place before occupied by the fire <note type="footnote"> Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότε ἀπὸ τη̃ς ἀπιόν</foreign>.

            latter, a mass of greater density and less elasticity, such as jelly, syrup, <lb/>
            or oil. We nave rendered itfused, because in the next page the term is <lb/>
            used respecting metals. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            with which at the same time it becomes mingled ;-but when <lb/>
            the mass by close compression once more becomes equable <lb/>
            and smooth, it then resumes its smoothness and consistency, <lb/>
            because fire, the artificer of inequality, has taken its depar­ <lb/>
            ture ;—and this departure of fire we denominate cooling, <lb/>
            while the union that takes place without the presence of fire <lb/>
            is termed a condensation [or hardening]. But among all <lb/>
            those which we term fusible fluids, there is one that becomes <lb/>
            most dense, though formed from the most subtile and equable <lb/>
            parts, and is of an uniform character, and partaking <lb/>
            of a lustrous yellow colour :—it is that most highly prized <lb/>
            possession,-gold, which is produced by filtration through a <lb/>
            rock. And a node (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄξος</foreign>) of gold, rendered by its density <lb/>
            very hard and turned black, is called adamant. But that <lb/>
            which consists of parts greatly resembling gold, and has <lb/>
            more than one species, which surpasses gold in density, and <lb/>
            that it may become the harder, contains but a small and insig­ <lb/>
            nificant portion of earth, though at the same time it is lighter, <lb/>
            owing to the great intervals between its internal atoms;­ <lb/>
            this is a separate kind of lustrous and dense fluids, termed <lb/>
            brass. But an earthy nature is therewith mingled, which, <lb/>
            when tnrough age the two parts become separated soon <lb/>
            becomes visible of itself, and is denominated rust. All other <lb/>
            such matters also, it would be no hard task further to dis­ <lb/>
            cuss by pursuing the plan of probable arguments ;-and any <lb/>
            one, who by way of recreation interrupts for a while his <lb/>
            reasonings on eternal being, and enters into probable specu­ <lb/>
            lations about the generation of material things, will by these <lb/>
            means acquire a pleasure of which he need not repent, and <lb/>
            establish for himself a moderate and wise recreation during <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>XXXIV.—Thus indulging ourselves, let us next recount <lb/>
            certain probable reasons concerning what next follows of the <lb/>
            same subject. Water that is mingled with fire, which being <lb/>
            very thin and moist, takes its name * (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑγρὸν</foreign>) from its motion <lb/>
            and the manner in which it rolls on the earth, and which is <note type="footnote"> * The Greek text is evidently corrupt. It stands as follows : — <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign>— </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig74.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">μενον ἐπὶ γη̃ς</foreign> vypov <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγεται</foreign>, &amp;c. Stallbaum suggests the removal of <lb/>
              the last <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑγρόν</foreign>, and the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϭτί</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυλινδοὐμενον</foreign>. This sug­ <lb/>
              gestion has been followed in our translation. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="369"/>
              also called soft and yielding, because its bases are less stable <lb/>
              than those of earth,-this, when separated from fire and <lb/>
              bereft of air, acquires more uniformity, and through their <lb/>
              departure (i. e. of air and fire) is compressed into itself ;— <lb/>
              and when it is thus condensed above the earth, it becomes hail, <lb/>
              if on the earth, ice; but when there is less of it and only <lb/>
              half the amount of freezing, [the water so condensed] above <lb/>
              the earth becomes snow, and that on the earth, which is <lb/>
              formed from dew, is called boar-frost. When again the numer­ <lb/>
              ous kinds of water are mingled together, the entire liquid thus <lb/>
              formed, which is filtered from the earth through plants, takes <lb/>
              the name of juices or saps. Owing, however, to their mode <lb/>
              of admixture, these individual fluids present through their <lb/>
              dissimilarity many different undescribed varieties, although <lb/>
              four of them, which are of a fiery character, and particularly <lb/>
              transparent, have obtained appropriate appellations ;-that <lb/>
              which heats the soul as well as the body being called wine,­ <lb/>
              secondly, that which is smooth, and dazzling to the sight,* <lb/>
              and hence bright, glittering, and apparently of an oily nature, <lb/>
              such as pitch, the gum of the kiki-plant, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign> oil, and other <lb/>
              things having similar properties ;-again, that which possesses <lb/>
              a power, as far as nature permits, of diffusing the substances <lb/>
              of nutrition over the palate, and by this property presents the <lb/>
              idea of sweetness, has obtained the general name of honey ;­ <lb/>
              and lastly, that frothy fluid, which dissolves the flesh by <lb/>
              burning, has been distinguished from all the other juices by <lb/>
              the name of opium (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπόδ</foreign>).</p>
          <p>XXXV.—As respects the different kinds of earth, one of <lb/>
            them, stone, is produced by the filtration of water in the <lb/>
            manner following. The commingled water, when it loses its <lb/>
            coherence, passes into the form of air, but, on becoming air, <lb/>
            rises to its appropriate place. As, however, there is no <lb/>
            vacuum, it presses on the surrounding air; and this, being <lb/>
            weighty, and impelled against the mass of earth that it sur­ <lb/>
            rounds, violently compresses it, driving it into the vacant <lb/>
            spaces whence the new air had before ascended. The earth, <lb/>
            also, by the compression of the air into indissoluble union <lb/>
            with water, is formed into stones ; the more beautiful sorts of <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διακριτικὸν ὄψεως</foreign>, lit. having the power of separating sight. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the same as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭιλλικὐπριον</foreign> or Palma Christi. Comp. <lb/>
            Herod. ii. 94, and D. Turner's note thereon. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            which acquire a lustre from the equality and smoothness of <lb/>
            their parts, the opposite being the case with those that are <lb/>
            ugly and valueless. But when all the moisture is thrown off <lb/>
            by the violence of fire, and the body is thus unusually dried <lb/>
            up, then is formed the kind ot earth that we call clay. <lb/>
            Sometimes also, even without losing its moisture, the <lb/>
            earth is fused by the fire, and on cooling becomes a stone <lb/>
            of a black colour.* In the same manner, when this earth <lb/>
            is deprived of the water it holds in mixture, but yet has <lb/>
            small particles and is of a saline nature, it forms a half­ <lb/>
            solid body, still capable of solution in water,-either nitre, <lb/>
            which purifies both oil and earth, or else salt, a substance so <lb/>
            well adapted to give flavours pleasing to the palate, and <lb/>
            deemed by the law as agreeable to the gods. The compounds <lb/>
            of these two substances are not soluble by water, but yet can <lb/>
            be melted by fire, for the following reasons. Neither fire nor <lb/>
            air liquefies masses of earth; because, being naturally composed <lb/>
            of elements smaller than the interstices ( or pores) of earth, <lb/>
            they easily penetrate through these capacious pores without <lb/>
            subjecting it either to dissolution or liquefaction. The parts <lb/>
            of water, on the other hand, as they are larger, strive to force <lb/>
            a passage, and so dissolve and liquefy the earthy mass:­ <lb/>
            and hence, when the earth has no strong consistency, water <lb/>
            alone will dissolve it, whereas if in a compact state, nothing <lb/>
            will affect it but fire, which is the only body that can find an <lb/>
            entrance. As for water, again, its strong cohesiveness of <lb/>
            parts, [when frozen], can be overcome only by fire, whereas, <lb/>
            when the cohesion is less strong, it can be equally decomposed <lb/>
            by fire and air, the latter entering its interstices and the for­ <lb/>
            mer separating even its constituent triangles. Nothing, how­ <lb/>
            ever, can dissolve air strongly condensed, without attack­ <lb/>
            ing its composing elements; though when it coheres less <lb/>
            strongly, it may be dissolved, though only by fire. Again, in <lb/>
            bodies composed of water and earth, while the water occupies <lb/>
            all the interstices in its state of compression, the particles of <lb/>
            water from without, not finding egress, flow round the entire <lb/>
            mass without suffering decomposition; whereas the particles <note type="footnote"> * Lindau conjectures this to be basalt. It is probably lava, or some <lb/>
            similar volcanic product. The same commentator conceives the Xirpov <lb/>
            mentioned in the succeeding sentence to be potash or some alkali suitable <lb/>
            for mingling with oil to form soap. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            of fire that enter into the interstices of water, as water into <lb/>
            those of earth, and have the same effect on water that fire has on <lb/>
            air, alone possess the power of dissolving and liquefying the <lb/>
            compound body. And among these, some contain less water <lb/>
            than earth ; such as all kinds of glass, and such stones as are <lb/>
            termed fusible ; while others, on the contrary, contain more <lb/>
            water, such as wax and aromatic substances.</p>
          <p>XXXVI.—Having thus then enumerated the several <lb/>
            figures and classes of bodies variously formed by admix­ <lb/>
            tures and mutual changes, we must now try to explain the <lb/>
            causes of the feelings with which they impress us. First, <lb/>
            then, the bodies here spoken of must be always perceptible. <lb/>
            As yet, however, we have not discoursed on the generation of <lb/>
            flesh, and what belongs to flesh, nor on that part of the soul <lb/>
            which is mortal. This nevertheless cannot be suitably ex­ <lb/>
            plained without at the same time explaining the sensations <lb/>
            and impressions produced by external objects; and although <lb/>
            one subject cannot be unfolded without a knowledge of the <lb/>
            other, yet the two cannot be explained together. We must <lb/>
            settle one first, and then proceed to the other. In order, <lb/>
            then, in speaking of impressions, to observe the same order <lb/>
            as in speaking of the bodies producing them, let our first in­ <lb/>
            quiry be into those that concern the body and soul.</p>
          <p>First, then, let us inquire why fire is called hot, the <lb/>
            reason of which we shall perceive by considering its pene­ <lb/>
            trating and cutting power about our bodies. Now, that this <lb/>
            affection is a certain sharpness * is nearly evident to all; and <lb/>
            as regards the tenuity of its sides, the sharpness of its angles, <lb/>
            the smallness of its particles, and the velocity of its motion, <lb/>
            through all which it becomes violent, penetrating and capable <lb/>
            of instantly dividing whatever it meets ; this we should care­ <lb/>
            fully consider, recalling to mind the generation of its figure ; <lb/>
            -inasmuch as it is this, and no other nature, which separates <lb/>
            and parcels out our bodies into small portions, and produces <lb/>
            in us that affection which is very properly denominated heat. <lb/>
            Now the contrary to this is sufficiently manifest; but still we <lb/>
            must not pass it without explanation :-for in truth, among <lb/>
            the humid particles surrounding the body, those that have the <lb/>
            largest elementary parts enter and drive out the smaller; <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξὐ τι τὸ πἀθος</foreign>,—meaning, that the affection resembles the <lb/>
            impression formed by an acute angular body. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            but being unable to occupy their places, they compress our <lb/>
            bodily humours, and from being uneven and in a state of <lb/>
            agitation, fix them and render them motionless through their <lb/>
            evenness and density ;—whereas things brought into contact <lb/>
            against nature are naturally opposed and mutually repel each <lb/>
            other. From this contest and agitation then there resulted a <lb/>
            certain trembling and numbness ; and the whole of this affec­ <lb/>
            tion, as well as the cause that produces it, has the name of <lb/>
            cold. Again we call those bodies hard to which our flesh <lb/>
            yields; and those soft, which yield to the pressure of our <lb/>
            flesh ;-thus using the terms comparatively, with reference to <lb/>
            each other. Bodies also yield to pressure when placed on a <lb/>
            small base, while those resting on quadrangular bases are the <lb/>
            least impressible, owing to their very firm position, and be­ <lb/>
            cause from their own extreme density they strongly resist all <lb/>
            opposing pressure.</p>
          <p>XXXVII.—Again, the nature of heavy and light will <lb/>
            become most evident, if investigated with that of up and <lb/>
            down ; — for it is by no means right to assert that there <lb/>
            are naturally two distinct places opposite one to the other; <lb/>
            -one termed down, to which all bodies tend that are endued <lb/>
            with bulk, but the other up, to which bodies ascend con­ <lb/>
            trary to their inclination. The whole universe, indeed, <lb/>
            being spherical, all such things as are at the extremities (or <lb/>
            circumference) and equally distant from the centre must all <lb/>
            in like manner naturally belong to the extremities, while the <lb/>
            centre, being in the same proportion distant from all these <lb/>
            extremities, must be said to occupy quite an opposite position. <lb/>
            Such then being the nature of the world, would not any one <lb/>
            who reversed the position of the above-mentioned objects be <lb/>
            fairly thought to apply names to them that are quite unsuit­ <lb/>
            able ? For the middle place in it cannot be fairly said to be <lb/>
            either naturally down or up, but only the centre itself; and the <lb/>
            circumference is neither the middle, nor does it contain within <lb/>
            it any parts more distant than the rest either from the centre, or <lb/>
            any of the opposite extremities. But when all the parts are <lb/>
            naturally so similar, how can any one with propriety assign to <lb/>
            them contrary names ?-For supposing there were any regular <lb/>
            solid body in the centre of the universe, it would never be <lb/>
            carried to any of the extremities, owing to their entire uni­ <lb/>
            formity ;—but on the other hand, if any one were to move <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            in a circle round this solid, he would often stand with <lb/>
            his feet opposite to where they before were, and so call the <lb/>
            same part of himself both the upside and down. Since the <lb/>
            universe, therefore, as we have just observed, is of a spherical <lb/>
            figure, no prudent man should assert that it has any part <lb/>
            which is [absolutely] either up or down ;-yet, as regards <lb/>
            the origin and usual application of these terms which we <lb/>
            thus transfer to the universe, this we agree to be a proper <lb/>
            subject of investigation. If, in that spot of the universe <lb/>
            which specially belongs to fire, and where the principal mass <lb/>
            is collected with which it has a tendency to unite, any one <lb/>
            were to ascend thither and being possessed of the requisite <lb/>
            power, were to take up the particles, place them in a balance, <lb/>
            and raising the scale, were forcibly to draw the fire towards <lb/>
            the air, with which it has no affinity, it is clear that in this <lb/>
            case the smaller mass would be more easily impelled than the <lb/>
            larger. Indeed, when two things are simultaneously raised <lb/>
            by one and the same power, the smaller quantity must of <lb/>
            course yield more readily than the greater to the impulsive <lb/>
            force by which they are constrained ; and hence, the one is <lb/>
            called heavy and gravitating downwards, the other light and <lb/>
            tending upwards. The same thing also is observable in what <lb/>
            we ourselves do, who inhabit this place [the earth]. For <lb/>
            when, in walking on the earth, we separate particles of an <lb/>
            earthy nature, and sometimes even portions of the earth <lb/>
            itself, forcibly and unnaturally drawing them towards the air <lb/>
            which is dissimilar,-then that which is smaller yielding more <lb/>
            readily to our impulse is sooner attracted towards the foreign <lb/>
            element :-this then we call light and the place towards <lb/>
            which it is drawn, up (or above), giving to their contraries <lb/>
            the terms heavy and down (or below) respectively. Hence <lb/>
            these must mutually differ from each other, owing to the con­ <lb/>
            trary positions that the several elements occupy :-for that <lb/>
            which is light in one place is contrary to one corresponding <lb/>
            with it in an opposite position, and so also to a heavy body <lb/>
            another that is heavy, and to bodies placed above or below <lb/>
            others, opposed to them in their respective positions;—and <lb/>
            they will all be found, whether in a state of becoming or <lb/>
            actually existing, to be contrary, transverse, and every way <lb/>
            from each other. This one thing, moreover, is to be <lb/>
            understood Concerning all these matters, that the tendency of <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            each towards a body of similar nature gives to the body so <lb/>
            attracted the name heavy, and the place to which it tends, <lb/>
            down (or below); and thus to contrary things are assigned <lb/>
            contrary appellations. Such are the causes that we assign to <lb/>
            these phenomena. And again, as to the cause of the impres­ <lb/>
            sion of smoothness and roughness, every one who has investi­ <lb/>
            gated it will be able to disclose it to others; for roughness <lb/>
            conies from hardness joined with unevenness, while smooth­ <lb/>
            ness is the united effect of uniformity and density.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII.—It remains for us now to consider what is <lb/>
            most important in those affections common to the whole <lb/>
            body, which are the chief causes of pleasure and pain, and <lb/>
            to inquire how it is that certain impressions excite through the <lb/>
            parts of the body certain sensations invariably attended by <lb/>
            pleasure and pain. Thus then let us examine all our impres­ <lb/>
            sions, whether sensible or not, calling to mind the distinc­ <lb/>
            tions that we before made between bodies moved with ease <lb/>
            and those with difficulty; — for this is the way to arrive <lb/>
            at the point that we wish to determine. When a body by <lb/>
            nature easily moveable has received an impression ever so <lb/>
            slight, the several parts communicate it to the parts placed <lb/>
            around them, producing on these parts the same effect, until <lb/>
            at length they reach the intellect itself, to which they announce <lb/>
            the power of the agents producing such impression ;-whereas <lb/>
            a body, which on the contrary is firm and stable and has <lb/>
            no circular motion, is simply affected by itself without moving <lb/>
            any of the surrounding bodies; and hence, as their com­ <lb/>
            ponents do not mutually communicate the first received <lb/>
            impression, the entire animal remains unmoved, and expe­ <lb/>
            riences no sensation. This is the case indeed as respects the <lb/>
            bones and hair, and such other parts of the body as are <lb/>
            chiefly of an earthy nature; whereas the phenomena above <lb/>
            described principally refer to the organs of sight and hearing, <lb/>
            which contain an abundance of fire and air. This is what we <lb/>
            should hold then concerning pleasure and pain :-an impres­ <lb/>
            sion produced in us contrary to nature, and with violence, <lb/>
            causes pain,-one that is conformable to our nature, however <lb/>
            strong, pleasure ;-whereas an impression that is gentle and <lb/>
            gradual is unperceived, while the contrary to these produces <lb/>
            contrary effects. An impression, again, the whole of which <lb/>
            is easily produced, is pre-eminently an object of <unclear>sersati</unclear> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            but is not affected by pleasure and pain :-and of this kind <lb/>
            are the affections belonging to the sight; which indeed, as we <lb/>
            have above asserted, is a body of a nature daily becoming <lb/>
            allied to ourselves.* For in this way the impressions caused <lb/>
            by cuttings and burnings, and other similar accidents, do not <lb/>
            cause pain to the sight; nor again, does it experience pleasure, <lb/>
            from returning to its previous condition :-whereas the sen­ <lb/>
            sations that are strongest and most clear do this, so far as any <lb/>
            one is affected by any object; and this is the reason why <lb/>
            there is no violence whatever either in its expansion or con­ <lb/>
            traction. But bodies composed from larger parts, which <lb/>
            yield with difficulty to impelling agents, and distribute their <lb/>
            motion over the whole body, do experience pleasure and pain ; <lb/>
            pain indeed, when they are often alienated from their own <lb/>
            nature, but pleasure when restored to their former condition. <lb/>
            Again, all bodies that admit of very gradual withdrawals, <lb/>
            and, as it were, emptyings of their own nature, and at the same <lb/>
            time receive supplies on a large scale, have no perception of <lb/>
            loss, though they have of what accrues to them; and hence, they <lb/>
            do not give pain to the mortal part of the soul, but on the con­ <lb/>
            trary the greatest delight :-and the truth of this is manifest <lb/>
            from the sensation of pleasant odours. But such bodies, on the <lb/>
            other hand, as suffer excessive variation, and can scarcely be <lb/>
            restored even gradually to their pristine condition, are affected <lb/>
            in a manner quite the reverse of those we have just described ; <lb/>
            the truth of which is manifest in the case of burnings and <lb/>
            wounds inflicted on the body.</p>
          <p>XXXIX.—Having thus then pretty fully discussed the <lb/>
            common affections of the whole body, and the appellations <lb/>
            assigned to their effective causes, we must now endeavour to <lb/>
            explain, as far as we can, the affections that arise in parti­ <lb/>
            cular parts of us, as well as the causes by which they are <lb/>
            induced. In the first place then, let us if possible complete <lb/>
            the explanation of what we before left unfinished about those <lb/>
            of the juices,-namely, the particular affections subsisting <lb/>
            about the tongue.t And these, as well as most others, appear <note type="footnote"> . * Allusion is here made to ch. xix. p. 350 of this translation. </note><note type="footnote"> t Plato was not aware that the palate is the chief organ of taste, and <lb/>
            that these sensations are transmitted to the sensorium by means of nerves <lb/>
            (i. e. minute tubes filled with cerebral matter), all of which communicate <lb/>
            either with the spinal marrow or the brain itself,-the centre of all sensa­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            to be produced by certain expansions and contractions, the <lb/>
            impressions formed thereby depending more on smoothness and <lb/>
            roughness than all other circumstances; because, whenever <lb/>
            anything falls on the small veins round the tongue (which are <lb/>
            the arbiters, as it were, of the taste stretching to the heart), in <lb/>
            such a way as to penetrate the moist and delicate texture of the <lb/>
            flesh, which through its earthy nature is in a melting state, it <lb/>
            contracts and dries up the veins :-and where these pene­ <lb/>
            trating substances are rougher than usual, they have an acrid <lb/>
            taste (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτρυΦνἀ</foreign>), if less so, only one of sourness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐϭτηρἀ</foreign>). <lb/>
            Those on the contrary which purge, and wash away what­ <lb/>
            ever adheres to the tongue, if they do this to such an <lb/>
            immoderate degree, as somewhat to liquefy its nature, as <lb/>
            nitre does ;-all such as these are termed bitter; while sub­ <lb/>
            stances of inferior power to nitre, which purge only mode­ <lb/>
            rately, we conceive to be salt, without that rough bitterness, <lb/>
            and to be more friendly to our nature. Again, things heated <lb/>
            by the temperature of the mouth, and thereby softened- <lb/>
            which reciprocally heat and are heated by it—and which <lb/>
            through their lightness are elevated towards the senses of the <lb/>
            head, dividing at the same time whatever comes in their way; <lb/>
            -all these, owing to such properties, are termed pungent <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δριμέα</foreign>). But when these same particles, thinned by <lb/>
            putrefaction, enter into the narrow veins, and there come <lb/>
            into contact with earthy and airy particles of a suitable <lb/>
            size, and by making them mutually revolve, so mix them <lb/>
            together as to cause a confusion of their elements, and <lb/>
            thus by entering other veins form interstices in which the <lb/>
            liquid, sometimes earthy, sometimes quite pure, forms, as <lb/>
            it were, certain air-cavities enclosed by water, some of which <lb/>
            formed of pure liquid are transparent, and called bubbles, <lb/>
            while those composed of earthy liquid and in a state of agi­ <lb/>
            tation have received the name of seething (or boiling), and <lb/>
            yeast (or leven) ;-the effective cause of all this being termed <lb/>
            acid (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξύ</foreign>). And an affection contrary to all that has been <note type="footnote"> tion, as Herophilus and Erasistratus held long prior to Galen. Plato, on <lb/>
            the contrary, maintained that these sensations were carried by certain <lb/>
            small veins (or arteries,-for he makes no distinction between them), to <lb/>
            the liver-regarded by him as the seat (comp. ch. xliv.) of the lower <lb/>
            mortal soul. The heart was regarded by Aristotle as the centre of the <lb/>
            sensations. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            asserted about these, proceeds from a contrary cause; for, <lb/>
            when the liquid compounds that enter the mouth are natu­ <lb/>
            rally suited to the quality of the tongue, they lubricate its <lb/>
            asperities, as well as contract or relax such parts as were <lb/>
            before unnaturally dilated or compressed, and restore them, as <lb/>
            far as possible, to their proper and natural habit. Hence <lb/>
            all such substances are pleasant and friendly to every one, <lb/>
            become the remedies of violent passions, and are denominated <lb/>
            sweet. And thus much may suffice concerning particulars <lb/>
            of this kind.</p>
          <p>XL.—As respects the faculty of the nostrils, it admits of <lb/>
            no classification: for all odours whatever are but half­ <lb/>
            begotten,-there being no substances so proportioned, as to <lb/>
            give forth any particular smell. Besides, our veins sur­ <lb/>
            rounding the nose are too narrow to admit the various kinds <lb/>
            of earth and water, and too broad for those of fire and air ; <lb/>
            and hence no one ever perceives an odour from any of these, <lb/>
            -odours being produced from bodies that are damp, putre­ <lb/>
            fying, liquid, or vaporous ; — for odours are generated by <lb/>
            the change of water into air, or air into water; and all these <lb/>
            are either smoke or vapour. And of these, that which passes <lb/>
            from air into water is vapour,—that which is changed from <lb/>
            water into air, smoke ;—whence it comes to pass that all <lb/>
            odours are more subtile than water, and denser than air. And <lb/>
            these facts are clearly shown, when any one, owing to any <lb/>
            obstruction of the respiration, draws his breath inwards; for <lb/>
            then no odour filters through, but breath only-unattended by <lb/>
            any odours. This is why these two varieties of them are <lb/>
            without a name, being formed neither from many nor from a <lb/>
            simple species, the only two distinct terms respecting them, <lb/>
            being pleasant or unpleasant; the latter of which irritate <lb/>
            and violently disturb the whole cavity lying between the top <lb/>
            of the head and the navel, while the former soothe the same <lb/>
            part, and kindly restore it to its natural condition.</p>
          <p>XLI.—Let us next speak of and investigate the third kind <lb/>
            of sense,-the hearing, and the causes giving rise to the <lb/>
            affections peculiar thereto. Now we may generally define <lb/>
            voice as a certain pulsation of the air, penetrating through <lb/>
            the ears, brain, and blood, as far as the soul; and the motion <lb/>
            hence arising, which commences from the head and ends in <lb/>
            the seat of the liver, hearing ;—and that when this motion is <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            swift, it emits a sharp sound, when slow, a flat one,—the <lb/>
            former being uniform and smooth, the latter quite the re­ <lb/>
            verse and rough :-likewise, that when the motion is on a <lb/>
            large scale it will produce a loud sound, and when on a small <lb/>
            scale only a low one. But respecting the harmony of <lb/>
            these sounds we must speak in the subsequent part of this <lb/>
            discourse.</p>
          <p>XLII.—The fourth kind of sense, which is still left for <lb/>
            us to discuss, comprises a very large variety of what we gene­ <lb/>
            rally term colours, which consist of a flame emanating from <lb/>
            individual bodies, and having parts proportioned to the sight <lb/>
            for producing sensation. But we have already considered <lb/>
            the effective causes of sight.* Here then we ought to speak <lb/>
            of colours, and what seems to us the most probable theory <lb/>
            respecting them.</p>
          <p>Among the particles that fall from other bodies on the <lb/>
            sight, some are greater, others less than, and others equal to, <lb/>
            those of the visual fire. Such as are equal, then, are imper­ <lb/>
            ceptible, and are termed transparent; while, as for those that <lb/>
            are larger or smaller, the former contract, the latter dilate the <lb/>
            sight, having a power resembling that of heat and cold on the <lb/>
            flesh, or of things acrid, heating and pungent, on the tongue. <lb/>
            Particles affecting the sight in this manner are called black <lb/>
            and white ;-having the property, indeed, of producing the <lb/>
            same modifications in bodies, though, being produced in dif­ <lb/>
            ferent parts of the organ, they still appear to produce differ­ <lb/>
            ent impressions. It is thus, then, that we ought to term <lb/>
            them,—white, that which dilates the sight; and that which is <lb/>
            opp osite in its effect, black ;—whereas, when a sharper motion, <lb/>
            and that, too, from a foreign fire, falls on and divides the sight <lb/>
            even as far as the eyes themselves, and both separates and <lb/>
            moistens the openings of the eyes, so as to force from them <lb/>
            that united flow of fire and water that we call tears, and which <lb/>
            are of a fiery nature coming from without,-these two fires <lb/>
            meeting together with a force like that of lightning, and then <lb/>
            saturated and extinguished by moisture, produce a great <lb/>
            variety of colours, the impressions from which we term flash­ <lb/>
            ings (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρμρυγάς</foreign>), and the objects producing them bright and <lb/>
            lustrous. Another kind of fire, intermediate between those <lb/>
            just mentioned, and which reaches the moisture of the eyes, and <note type="footnote"> * Comp. ch. xix. p. 350—352 of this volume.. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            mingles with it, though by no means lustrous, and in which <lb/>
            the rays of fire are mingled with moisture, and form a <lb/>
            bloody colour; this we denominate red. A bright hue <lb/>
            mingled with red and white forms the colour called yellow ; <lb/>
            but as regards the measure in which they mingle respectively, <lb/>
            even a wise and thinking person could not explain it, were <lb/>
            he ever so well informed on the matter, as he could not adduce <lb/>
            concerning them any satisfactory reason, either necessary or <lb/>
            probable. Again, red, when mingled with black and white, <lb/>
            produces a purple colour; and a very deep colour is the <lb/>
            result of their being mingled and burnt together, with a <lb/>
            further addition of black. A tawny red is produced from <lb/>
            the mixture of yellow and brown, and brown from the mix­ <lb/>
            ture of black and white; and a pale colour from the mingling <lb/>
            of white and yellow. A brilliant white, falling on a large <lb/>
            quantity of black, constitutes a dark blue (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κυανου̃ν</foreign>) ; a deep <lb/>
            blue mingled with white, a grey colour; and a tawny red <lb/>
            mingled with black forms a green. All the other tints it <lb/>
            will be easy to conjecture from the above examples, if one <lb/>
            only reasons fairly from analogy. Nevertheless, any one <lb/>
            who would prove them by the test of experiment evinces <lb/>
            great ignorance of the difference between a divine and human <lb/>
            nature; for a god indeed may be able to mingle many things <lb/>
            into one, and again dissolve the one into many, through his <lb/>
            united power and intelligence ; but no man living can accom­ <lb/>
            plish either of these tasks, nor will any one in time to come.</p>
          <p>XLIII.—All these things which thus naturally subsist from <lb/>
            necessity, the artificer of what is most beautiful and best took <lb/>
            for his elements of creation, in producing a self-sufficient <lb/>
            and most perfect god; employing secondary causes indeed, <lb/>
            but at the same time performing his work well on all created <lb/>
            beings. For this reason we must distinguish two species of <lb/>
            causes; the one necessary, the other divine. And in all <lb/>
            things we should inquire after the divine cause, with the view <lb/>
            of obtaining a blessed life in the highest degree of which our <lb/>
            nature admits, for the sake of which also we should inves­ <lb/>
            tigate the necessary cause as well,-convinced, that without <lb/>
            these two closes of causes, we can neither understand nor <lb/>
            nor<unclear>wise</unclear> engagoin the several objects of our <lb/>
            anxious pursuit. Since, then, we have now before us the <lb/>
            various classes of causes, laid out like materials for <unclear>our</unclear>'hour, <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            and which will serve as the matter from which we are to in­ <lb/>
            terweave the remainder of our discourse, let us again briefly <lb/>
            recur to our first observations, and thence pass rapidly on to <lb/>
            the place at which we are now arrived; thus endeavouring to <lb/>
            annex such an end and close to our discourse, as may harmo­ <lb/>
            nize with its beginning.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Just as we stated in the opening of our discourse, I <lb/>
            -when all sensible things were in disorder, the Deity made t <lb/>
            each individually to harmonize with itself and mutually with <lb/>
            all the rest, so far as things could possibly be brought into <lb/>
            symmetry and proportion ; because formerly, nothing had any <lb/>
            order except by accident, nor did anything whatever deserve <lb/>
            the names that things receive at present; such, for instance, as <lb/>
            fire, water, and the rest of the elements. All these, however, <lb/>
            the Creator put in order first of all, and then out of these con­ <lb/>
            structed the universe, as a single animal, containing within <lb/>
            itself different kinds of animals, mortal and immortal,*—he <lb/>
            himself being the artificer of Divine natures, but committing <lb/>
            to his offspring (the junior gods) the charge of producing <lb/>
            those that are mortal. The latter, in imitation of their <lb/>
            father, receiving the immortal principle of the soul, next <lb/>
            fashioned! the mortal body, making it entirely to be a vehicle <lb/>
            thereto, and forming within it a separate mortal kind of <lb/>
            soul, possessed of certain dire and necessary passions: first, <lb/>
            pleasure, the chief lure to evil; next, pain, the desertion of <lb/>
            what is good ;—after these again, temerity and fear, both mad <lb/>
            advisers; anger, hard to be appeased; hope, which is easily <lb/>
            misled both by irrational sense, and all-daring love. By <lb/>
            mingling these together, they [the junior gods] necessarily <lb/>
            composed the mortal race. And on this account, fearing to <lb/>
            defile the Divine nature more than was absolutely necessary <lb/>
            they lodged man's mortal portion separately from the Divine, <lb/>
            in a different receptacle of the body; forming the head and <lb/>
            breast, and placing the neck between, as an isthmus and limit <lb/>
            to separate the two extremes. J <note type="footnote"> * Comp. ch. xi. p. 335 of this translation, and also the concluding <lb/>

          <p>In the breast, indeed, and what is called the thorax [or <lb/>
            trunk],* they seated the mortal part of the soul. And as one <lb/>
            part of it was naturally better, and another worse, they formed <lb/>
            the cavity of the thorax into two divisions (resembling the <lb/>
            separate dwellings of our men and women), placing the midriff <lb/>
            as a partition between them. That part of the soul, therefore, <lb/>
            i which partakes of fortitude and spirit, and loves contention, <lb/>
            they seated nearer the head, between the midriff and the <lb/>
            neck; as it is the business of the reason to unite with <lb/>
            it in forcibly repressing the desires, whenever they will <lb/>
            not obey the mandate and word issuing from the citadel <lb/>
            above.</p>
          <p>XLV.—The heart, which is the head and principlet of the <lb/>
            veins, as well as the fountain of the blood that impetuously <lb/>
            circulates through all the members, they placed in a kind of <lb/>
            sentry-house, that, in case of any outburst of anger, being <lb/>
            informed by the reason of any evil committed in its mem­ <lb/>
            bers, owing either to some foreign cause, or else internal pas­ <lb/>
            sions, it (the heart) might transmit through all its channels the <lb/>
            threaten ings and exhortations of reason, so as once more to <lb/>

            the collar-bone down to the pelvis. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοιλία</foreign> in ch. xlvi. has a <lb/>
            similar latitude of signification. </note><note type="footnote"> t Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴν</foreign>. This reading is introduced by Stallbaum (and followed <lb/>
            by Cousin) from three of the best MSS. The old editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμα</foreign>, <lb/>
            which Stephens altered into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμμα</foreign> (a knot or ganglion), and Toup into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νἇμα</foreign>, both on mere conjecture. Plato clearly thought that the heart was <lb/>
            the source of the blood and the centre of union for the veins, which he <lb/>
            regards as messengers transmitting to the whole body the orders coming <lb/>
            from the male part of the mortal soul; but he runs into the error of <lb/>
            attributing to them the function of nerves, as well of motion as sensation. <lb/>
            We may remark further, that he considers the veins to have two centres­ <lb/>
            the heart and the liver, which are the two seats of the mortal soul, and <lb/>
            makes no distinction whatever between veins and arteries. See Martin's <lb/>

          <p>But as the gods foreknew, with respect to the palpitation <lb/>
            of the heart under the dread of danger and the excitements <lb/>
            of passion, that all such swellings of the inflamed spirit would <lb/>
            be produced by fire, they formed the lungs to be a sort of <lb/>
            protection thereto; first, of all, soft and bloodless,* and next, <lb/>
            internally provided with cavities perforated like a sponge, in <lb/>
            order to cool the breath which they receive, and give the heart <lb/>
            easy respiration and repose in its excessive heat. On this <lb/>
            account then, they led the channels of the windpipe into the <lb/>
            lungs, which they placed like a soft cushion round the heart, <lb/>
            in order that when anger rises in it to an extreme height, <lb/>
            it might fall on some yielding substance, and so getting cool, <lb/>
            yield cheerfully and with less trouble to the authority of reason.</p>
          <p>XLVI. That part of the soul next, which has a desire for <lb/>
            meats, drinks, and all else that is necessary for the natural <lb/>
            supplies of the body, they placed between the midriff and <lb/>
            the region of the navel; forming, as it were, in all this place <lb/>
            a sort of manger for the nutriment of the body; and then they <lb/>
            bound it on to it, like some savage animal, annexed as <lb/>
            necessary to nourish the mortal race afterwards to be brought <lb/>
            into existence. This place of course the gods assigned it, in <lb/>
            order that ever feeding at its manger, and dwelling as far off <lb/>
            as possible from the deliberative part of the soul, it might <lb/>
            make the least possible degree of tumult and noise, and permit <lb/>
            the best portion of our nature to consult in quiet for the com­ <lb/>
            mon benefit of the whole. Knowing also that this part would <lb/>
            not acquiesce with the reason, and, even if it had any faculty <lb/>
            of sense, yet would not regard the processes of reasoning, <lb/>
            but be chiefly lured away, both day and night, by images <lb/>
            and phantasms,—reflecting on this, the Deity formed the <lb/>
            liver, assigning it the place it occupies. And he made it com­ <lb/>
            pact and smooth, shiny and sweet, and yet somewhat bitter, <lb/>
            -in order that the multitude of thoughts falling on it from <lb/>
            the intellect as on a mirror that receives and presents images <lb/>
            to the view, might on the one side terrify it by employing a <lb/>
            bitterness akin to its nature; and proceeding to dreadful <note type="footnote"> * Plato is quite wrong in stating this forall the blood passes through <lb/>
            them, in order to be supplied with oxygen by the air contained in the <lb/>
            cells. This, however, is not nearly so great an error as his statement in <lb/>
            ch. lxxiii. (speaking of generation), that the fluids we drink pass through <lb/>
            the lungs into the bladder! </note> <lb/>

            threats, gradually mingle this bitterness with the whole liver <lb/>
            so as to present the dark hues of bile, and by contracting it, <lb/>
            render it throughout rough and wrinkled ;—or on the other, <lb/>
            partly by removing the liver from its right place and con­ <lb/>
            tracting it, partly by obstructing and closing its ventricles and <lb/>
            gates, cause impressions of pain and disgust :-whereas, on <lb/>
            the contrary, when a gentle inspiration-the result of intelli­ <lb/>
            gence—depicts on it images of quite an opposite character, <lb/>
            softens its bitterness by avoiding to agitate or touch anything <lb/>
            contrary to its own nature,—it then gives it a softness <lb/>
            peculiarly its own, and makes all its parts regular, polished, <lb/>
            and free,-giving joy and peace to that part of the soul which <lb/>
            resides near the liver, and making it enjoy a suitable repose <lb/>
            at night, with the power of divination during sleep, to make <lb/>
            up for its want both of reason and wisdom.*</p>
          <p>XLVII. Those, forsooth, who created us, calling to mind <lb/>
            their father's command, when he bid them make the mortal <lb/>
            race as good as they possibly could, formed even the inferior <lb/>
            part of us to have some connexion with truth, by esta­ <lb/>
            blishing within it the faculty of divination. And a sum­ <lb/>
            ciently clear proof, that the Deity assigned prophetic power t <lb/>
            to human madness, is found in the fact that no one in his right <lb/>
            senses has any concern with divinely inspired and true pro­ <lb/>
            phecy, which takes place only when the reasoning faculty is <lb/>
            fettered by sleep, or alienated by disease or enthusiasm; <lb/>
            while, on the other hand, it requires a person of considerable <lb/>
            wisdom to understand the recorded sayings, whether sleeping <lb/>
            or waking, of a prophetic and divinely-inspired nature, and <lb/>
            so to distinguish all the phenomena it beholds as to be able <lb/>
            to explain in what way and to whom they portend any future, <lb/>
            past, or present good or evil; it being by no means the office <note type="footnote"> * Plato, in this purely fanciful description of the liver and spleen, <lb/>
            seems to have been ignorant of the great use of the bile in promoting the <lb/>
            digestion of the food during its passage through the duodenum ; for in <lb/>
            ch. lxiv. he considers it wholly in the light of a vicious secretion, though <lb/>
            he acknowledges its presence in the healthy body as exercising a great <lb/>
            influence over dreams and divination. Aristotle, while refuting Plato, is <lb/>
            not a whit more correct as to this question in the animal economy. Hist. <lb/>

            the divine oracles; but the words, as Plato observes, have often been <lb/>

            of one who either has been, or is still mad, to judge respecting I <lb/>
            things seen or spoken by himself :—and it has been well ob­ <lb/>
            served by the ancients, that to transact and know one's own <lb/>
            concerns and oneself is alone the province of a prudent man ;— <lb/>
            whence, indeed, the law directs that the race of prophets (or <lb/>
            interpreters) should preside as judges over divine predictions, <lb/>
            -whom some indeed call diviners, through entire ignorance <lb/>
            that they are only the representers of enigmas and visions, <lb/>
            and not at all entitled to be called diviners,-being, strictly <lb/>
            speaking, interpreters of prophecies.</p>
          <p>The liver then was constructed for this purpose, and seated <lb/>
            where we have mentioned, for the sake of prediction. And <lb/>
            besides, in every living individual, this organ gives forth <lb/>
            unusually clear indications; but in those deprived of life, <lb/>
            it becomes blind and delivers oracles too obscure for their <lb/>
            meaning to be made intelligible. The nature and position <lb/>
            of the intestines, again, which is next to it [the liver], is <lb/>
            on the left side, for the purpose of always, like a sponge,* <lb/>
            keeping it clean and bright, ready to reflect images; on which <lb/>
            account, therefore, when certain impurities are produced in <lb/>
            the liver by bodily disease, then the spleen, by its rarity, <lb/>
            receives and purifies them all, from being of a hollow and <lb/>
            bloodless texture ;-and hence, is it, that when filled with <lb/>
            unclean matter, it grows to a large size and becomes wholly <lb/>
            unsound. And again, when the body is purified, it subsides <lb/>
            into its natural condition, as before.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. As respects the soul, then, including both its <lb/>
            mortal and divine portion, in what way it existed, and in what <lb/>
            way and why it was consigned to a separate habitation, the <lb/>
            truth can be firmly established only by the consent of the Deity: <lb/>
            -still, that we have stated what is near the truth, we will now, <lb/>
            quite open to investigation, venture the assertion; and here <lb/>
            accordingly it is made.t And what next follows we must <lb/>
            treat in a. similar manner; and this is no other, than how the <lb/>
            rest of the body was produced. It is, therefore, in the most <lb/>
            eminent degree becoming that they should be composed as fol­ <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκμαγει̃ον</foreign>,—very wrongly rendered by some, a mirror,—the <lb/>

              lows :-Those who formed our race were aware, that we should <lb/>
              be intemperate in eating and drinking, and that through <lb/>
              madness we should use far more than is either necessary or <lb/>
              moderate. For fear then of rapid destruction induced by <lb/>
              disease, and lest our mortal race should perish without ful­ <lb/>
              filling its end,-to provide against this, the gods formed for <lb/>
              the reception of the superfluous food a receptacle beneath, <lb/>
              called a belly, and formed in it the convolutions of the intes­ <lb/>
              tines to prevent the food from passing so quickly as to require <lb/>
              fresh and rapid supplies of nutriment for the body, and so by <lb/>
              insatiable gluttony making our whole race unphilosophical <lb/>
              and unmusical, insubordinate to the most godlike part of our <lb/>
              composition.*</p>
          <p>XLIX. The nature of the bones and flesh, and other <lb/>
            parts of this kind, was constituted as follows:—The first <lb/>
            principle of all these is the generation of the marrow; for the <lb/>
            life-bonds of the soul that united it with the body being <lb/>
            herein woven together, constitute the foundation of the mortal <lb/>
            race. The marrow itself, however, has a different origin; <lb/>
            for among the triangles, those of the first order, that are <lb/>
            unbent and smooth, were specially adapted by their accuracy <lb/>
            for producing fire and water, air and earth: t- these the <lb/>
            Deity, separating each apart from its own class, and min­ <lb/>
            gling them together in fixed proportions, composed by these <lb/>
            means an all-varying mixture of seeds for the whole mortal <lb/>
            race, and from these produced the marrow ;—and he after­ <lb/>
            wards implanted this marrow, binding therein the various <lb/>
            classes of souls ; and as respects the number of figures and <lb/>
            what individual forms the marrow was to receive, he divided <lb/>
            it, both as regards the quality and quantity of the particles, <lb/>
            at the original distribution,-giving to that part of it which <lb/>
            was to be the field for containing the divine seed a completely <lb/>
            globular shape ; and this he called the brain, because in every <note type="footnote"> * The intestines are not, as Plato seems to think, solely destined <lb/>
            to receive the excess of food. It is in the stomach that digestion com­ <lb/>
            mences, and it ends in the intestines, from which the chyle produced from <lb/>
            the food is sent to the lungs to form blood. Aristotle's ideas on this <lb/>
            point are more correct. Hist. Anim. iii. 14. <lb/>
            t Respecting these triangles, see ch. xxviii., and further on at ch. Ixii. <lb/>
            They are in fact the primary atoms, of which the body is composed, and <lb/>
            are of different classes, according to the parts or organs of which they are <lb/>
            the components. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <lb/>

            animal that has arrived at its perfect form, the vessel contain­ <lb/>
            ing this substance is called the head* But as respects the <lb/>
            part destined to contain the remaining and mortal part of the <lb/>
            soul, to this he gave both round and oblong shapes, giving to <lb/>
            the whole the name of marrow ; and from these, as from <lb/>
            anchors, casting the bonds of the entire soul, he built around <lb/>
            it our whole body, after first fixing round it a complete cover­ <lb/>
            ing of bones.</p>
          <p>L. The bones he composed as follows :-Having sifted <lb/>
            pure and smooth earth, he mingled and moistened it with <lb/>
            marrow; and after this he placed it in fire, then plunged it <lb/>
            in water, once more placed it in fire, and after this dipped <lb/>
            it in water : and thus by frequent transfers of each, he made <lb/>
            it insoluble by either. With this bone, then, he fashioned <lb/>
            a sphere, as on a lathe, placing it round the brain, and <lb/>
            only leaving a narrow hole therein. At the same time <lb/>
            also he formed of the same substance certain vertebræ <lb/>
            about the marrow of the neck and back, extending them like <lb/>
            hinges, from the head downwards through the whole trunk;­ <lb/>
            and thus he preserved all its seed, by fortifying it round with <lb/>
            a stony covering,-forming in it joints also, for motion and <lb/>
            flexion, employing the power of difference in their formation, <lb/>
            as being possessed of a certain middle quality. t Then, con­ <lb/>
            sidering that the bone would have a tendency to become dry <lb/>
            and inflexible, and that when heated and again cooled, it <lb/>
            would become carious, and quickly corrupt the seed it con­ <lb/>
            tained, he on this account formed the sinews and flesh; that <lb/>
            the former, by binding all the parts of the body, and being <lb/>
            stretched and loosened about the vertebrae, might give the <lb/>
            body a facility for either flexion or extension, as occasion <lb/>
            required; while the flesh would serve as a covering from the <lb/>
            heat and defence from the cold ;—as likewise for a pro­ <lb/>
            tection against falls, in the same manner as cushions do it, <lb/>
            by gently and easily yielding to external bodies ‡and he <lb/>

              the whole body,-and again in winter, gently keeps out by <lb/>
              its own fire the cold brought from without.</p>
          <p>LI.—Our plastic Creator, reflecting on all this then, min­ <lb/>
            gled and united water, fire, and earth, gradually mixing <lb/>
            therewith a ferment of acid and salt ;*—and thus he com­ <lb/>
            posed a pulpy, soft flesh :-And as for the tendons, he formed <lb/>
            them of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh, so as to <lb/>
            have the properties of both, tinging them also with a yellow <lb/>
            colour. And on this account is it, that the tendons are firmer <lb/>
            and more viscous than the flesh, but softer and moister <lb/>
            than the bones. With these God bound together the bones <lb/>
            and marrow, afterwards enshrouding the whole of them with <lb/>
            the covering of the flesh. Such of the bones, then, as wore <lb/>
            most ensouled, he covered with the smallest quantity of flesh, <lb/>
            —such as were least so, with the most and the densest flesh. <lb/>
            And besides this, except where reason evinced the need of <lb/>
            the contrary, he placed only a small quantity of flesh on the <lb/>
            joints of the bones; lest they should make the body uneasy <lb/>
            by impeding its flexions and motion ; or else, from being <lb/>
            many and frequent, and strongly pressed together, cause <lb/>
            by their solidity a dulness of perception, imperfection of <lb/>
            memory, and a sort of intellectual blindness. On this <lb/>
            account then, the bones of the groin, legs, loins, the shoulders <lb/>
            and the arms from the elbow to the wrist, and such other parts <lb/>
            of our bodies as have no joints, and such inward bones as <lb/>
            have no thought, owing to the scarcity of soul in the marrow, <lb/>
            are fully provided with flesh ;—whereas those that have <lb/>
            thought, he covered with less, except the flesh were for <lb/>
            perception, as in the case of the tongue. In other respects, <lb/>
            the case is as we have described. For a being born and nur­ <lb/>
            tured under necessity,t does not receive a hard bone united <lb/>
            with plenty of flesh, and with it also a quickness of sensa­ <figure type="illustration">

              tion. And yet the head would have been thus constructed, if <lb/>
              the two had exercised any will in thus coalescing; and the <lb/>
              human race, having a fleshy, tendinous, and robust head, <lb/>
              would enjoy healthy and unmolested a life twice as long <lb/>
              as the present, or even yet longer than that: but the artificers <lb/>
              of our race, after thoroughly considering whether they had <lb/>
              better make it more lasting and of worse condition, or shorter <lb/>
              but of a more excellent character, were agreed that a shorter <lb/>
              but better life was wholly preferable to one longer, but in­ <lb/>
              ferior :-and this was why they covered the head with a <lb/>
              thin bone, and not with flesh and fibre,—because it had no <lb/>
              joints. On all these accounts, then, the body was provided <lb/>
              with a head, which was the more perceptive and reflecting, <lb/>
              in proportion as it was [physically] weaker than all the rest <lb/>
              of man's structure. From these causes, then, and in this <lb/>
              manner,* the Deity placing tendons round the lower ex­ <lb/>
              tremity of the head, glued them, as it were, round the neck, <lb/>
              and bound with them the lofty cheek-bones placed under the <lb/>
              forehead ;-and as for all the rest, he scattered them through <lb/>
              all the members, connecting joint with joint.</p>
          <p>LII.—We were next provided by those who formed us <lb/>
            with the organs of the mouth, teeth, tongue, and lips,­ <lb/>
            arranged as they now are for purposes both necessary and <lb/>
            the best ;giving ingress for necessaries, and egress to what is <lb/>
            best,-everything, indeed, that enters to feed the body being <lb/>
            necessary-while the stream of words flowing outwards, if <lb/>
            guided by wisdom, is by far the fairest and best of all streams <lb/>
            whatever.</p>
          <p>LIII.—Again, it was not possible that the bead could bear a <lb/>
            mere covering of thin bone, owing to the extremes of the differ­ <lb/>
            ent seasons ; nor again, could it be allowed to become clouded, <lb/>
            blind, and unperceptive, through the overcrowding of flesh. <lb/>
            Hence a fleshy membrane, not dried, was left separate from <lb/>
            the rest,-that now termed cuticle (or scalp). This, then, <lb/>
            being brought into union with itself by the moisture about <lb/>
            the brain, grows around and circularly invests the head. <lb/>
            And it is the moisture flowing under the sutures that moistens <lb/>
            this membrane, and causes it to close at the crown, connect­ <lb/>
            ing it as in a knot. But as for the ever-varying classes of <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig78.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="389"/>
              sutures, these are generated through the power of the periodic <lb/>
              changes caused by nutriment in the flesh ;* the variety be­ <lb/>
              coming greater, when they struggle with each other more <lb/>
              violently-less so, when less violently. All this membrane <lb/>
              the Divine Being pierced all round with fire :-and hence, <lb/>
              as it was wounded, and the moisture externally flowed <lb/>
              through it, all that was pure of the moisture and heat was car­ <lb/>
              ried off, while that which was mixed, and of a nature allied <lb/>
              to that of the membrane itself, being raised by the motion, <lb/>
              was stretched outwards to a great size, having also a tenuity <lb/>
              equal to the amount of puncture,-whereas, on the other hand, <lb/>
              when continually thrust back through the slowness of its mo­ <lb/>
              tion by the spirit surrounding it externally, it again revolves <lb/>
              under the membrane and there becomes firmly rooted. And <lb/>
              owing to these affections is it, that the hair springs up on the <lb/>
              membrane of the head, being naturally allied, and serving as <lb/>
              a rein to this membrane, but at the same time becoming <lb/>
              harder and denser through the pressure of the cold, which <lb/>
              hardens each hair, as it proceeds beyond the skin.t Thus, <lb/>
              then, by the means above mentioned, did our Creator plant <lb/>
              the head with hairs, reflecting at the same time that in­ <lb/>
              stead of flesh a light covering was needed to guard the <lb/>
              brain, and give it shade and protection from the extremes <lb/>
              of heat and cold without hindering its acuteness of sensation.</p>
          <p>LI V.—But the mass of tendon, skin, and bone that is inter­ <lb/>
            woven about the fingers, being a mixture of three substances, <lb/>
            becomes, when dried, one common hard membrane composed <lb/>
            of all in common-fashioned indeed with these as instru­ <lb/>
            mental causes, but effectively produced by that reflection <lb/>
            which ever has an eye to the future :-for those who formed <lb/>

            into fibre, as they rose above the skin and encountered the pressure of <lb/>

            greatest use in several respects to many of the animals :—and <lb/>
            this was the reason, why they stamped in men the pattern of <lb/>
            the nails at their first birth. It was from these causes, then, <lb/>
            and with these intentions, that they implanted skin, hairs, <lb/>
            and nails at the extremities of the limbs.</p>
          <p>LV.—As the parts and members of the mortal animal <lb/>
            however were all allied in nature, and their life necessarily <lb/>
            resulted from fire and spirit, the decay and exhaustion of <lb/>
            which would cause it to perish quickly, the gods provided <lb/>
            for it the following remedy :-Intermingling a nature re­ <lb/>
            sembling that of man with other forms and senses, they <lb/>
            planted as it were other animals,-such as kindly-disposed <lb/>
            trees, plants, and seeds, which are made useful to us by the <lb/>
            nurture and training of agriculture ; though before there were <lb/>
            only those of a rustic kind, which are more ancient than <lb/>
            those that are cultivated.* Everything indeed that partakes <lb/>
            of life we may justly and most correctly call an animal; <lb/>
            -but that in particular, of which we are now speaking, is <lb/>
            possessed of the third species of soul,t which we place be­ <lb/>
            tween the midriff and the navel: and which has no share <lb/>
            either in opinion, reason, or intellect, though possessing a <lb/>
            sense of pleasure and pain, as well as desire. It effects all <lb/>
            things indeed by passion (or appetite) ; and it does this by <lb/>
            the evolution of its internal power and the employment of its <lb/>
            own motion to the exclusion of every other, as it has not been <lb/>
            formed with a nature capable of reasoning on its own con­ <lb/>
            cerns.‡ It thus lives in no way different from an animal, <lb/>
            except in being firmly rooted in a fixed position and deprived <lb/>
            of original motion. <note type="footnote"> * The question, whether plants are a distinct kind of animals, which <lb/>
            was held by all the Platonic philosophers, is touched on by Plutarch, <lb/>
            De Plac. Philos. v. 26, sect. 10, and by Cicero, Tusc. i. 26, where he re­ <lb/>
            marks :—" tarn naturæ putarem hominis vitam sustentari, quam vitis aut <lb/>

              somewhat difficult, but is explained by a sentence in the Thesetetus <lb/>

          <p>LVI.—Now after the directing artificers of our structure <lb/>
            had implanted all these organs for giving nutriment to our <lb/>
            inferior nature, they directed various channels through our <lb/>
            body, so as to water it like a garden, by the constant accession <lb/>
            of flowing moisture.* And first, they cut two hidden channels <lb/>
            beneath the juncture of the skin and flesh, viz. two veins <lb/>
            going down the back to correspond with the double figure of <lb/>
            the body, both on the right and left sides. These they <lb/>
            placed close to the back-bone, so as to receive between them <lb/>
            the marrow, the growth of which might be thus promoted, <lb/>
            and that the flood supplied thence to other parts, might <lb/>
            give an equable irrigation ;-and then, dividing the veins <lb/>
            about the head, and mutually interweaving them, they dis­ <lb/>
            tributed them in opposite directions,-inclining some from the <lb/>
            right to the left of the body, and some from the left to the <lb/>
            right, that there might be a chain formed by the skin to <lb/>
            unite the head to the body, there being no interlacing of ten­ <lb/>
            dons round the head,-and besides this, that the affection of <lb/>
            sensation might from each of these parts pass round and <lb/>
            through the body. It was in some such way as this, then, <lb/>
            that they prepared the channel, of which we speak; and its <lb/>
            truth we shall easily perceive by assenting to our previous <lb/>
            position,—that all things composed of greater parts may <lb/>
            envelop such as are less, while those consisting of less cannot <lb/>
            envelop the greater. But fire is, of all classes of things, <lb/>
            composed of the smallest parts; and hence it penetrates <lb/>
            through water, earth, and air, and their several compounds, <lb/>
            -and this to such an extent that nothing can retain it. The <lb/>
            same remark is true of our belly, which is able to retain any <lb/>
            food that has been introduced, but cannot hold spirit and <lb/>
            fire, because they consist of smaller particles than those com­ <lb/>
            posing the belly.</p>
          <p>LVII.—These channels therefore the Deity employed for <lb/>
            the purpose of distributing moisture from the belly into the <lb/>
            veins, by weaving with fire and air a network resembling <note type="footnote"> * This passage is well illustrated by Longinus, xxxii. sect. 5, where he <lb/>

              basket-nets (or weeds), with two curved passages of entrance, <lb/>
              -one of which he again twisted and divided into two <lb/>
              branches, winding the continuations of these curved passages <lb/>
              like coils of rope in every direction as far as the ends of the <lb/>
              net. Now all the inner parts of the network he composed <lb/>
              of fire, but the great flexures and the receptacle itself of <lb/>
              air ;—and lastly, he took and placed them in the new-formed <lb/>
              animal, as follows. One of the curved passages he placed in <lb/>
              the mouth ; but, as this part has two flexures, he caused one <lb/>
              (i. e. the trachea) to pass along the arteries into the lungs, the <lb/>
              other (i. e. the oesophagus) by the side of the arteries into <lb/>
              the belly. The other curved part he divided into two separate <lb/>
              passages, making them pass in common to the channels of the <lb/>
              nose, so that when the one does not reach the mouth, all the <lb/>
              streams of the other might still be filled from this. But as for <lb/>
              the remaining part of the hollow network, he made it extend <lb/>
              all over the concavity of the body, and the whole of it flow <lb/>
              gently together into the curved passages, as being of an airy <lb/>
              texture, and at another time to flow through them backwards. <lb/>
              But the net, which is of a thin structure, he so disposed as <lb/>
              to make it penetrate through and again emerge.* Besides <lb/>
              this, he ordered that the interior rays of fire should follow <lb/>
              in constant succession, the air at the same time passing into <lb/>
              each, and that this should never cease to be the case, as <lb/>
              long as the mortal animal's life continued. And as respects <lb/>
              the name of this kind of motion, we call it expiration and <lb/>
              inspiration. Now this whole action and affection that it pro­ <lb/>
              duces in our nature, is caused by certain bodily moistenings <lb/>
              and coolings, alike conducive to our nutriment and life :—for <lb/>
              as the breath passes in and out, an interior fire attends it in <lb/>
              its course; and when it is diffused through the belly and <lb/>
              meets with solid and liquid food, it reduces them both to a <note type="footnote"> * The whole of this description refers to the oesophagus, which enters <lb/>
              the upper part of the stomach, and runs side by side with the trachea, <lb/>
              which divides to form the entrance to the two great cells of the lungs. <lb/>
              This division is no doubt that of one of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκύρτια</foreign>, which, it is said, <lb/>
              God <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέπλεξε δίκρουν</foreign>, and then subdivided it into the numerous bronchial <lb/>
              tubes that ramify in all directions over the surface of the lungs, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ <lb/>
              παντὸς πρὸς</foreign> TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσχατα</foreign> rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλέγματος</foreign>. It may also be added that in ' <lb/>
              the mouth are two passages leading up to the channels of the nose. The <lb/>
              meaning is exceedingly obscure; but the reader is referred to Stallbaum <lb/>
              and Martin for several long explanatory notes on this curious account. </note> <lb/>

              state of moisture, and by dividing them into very small parts, <lb/>
              carries them along in its course; pouring them, as from a <lb/>
              fountain, into the veins, and so cutting channels through the <lb/>
              body as through an aqueduct.</p>
          <p>LVIII.—But again let us consider the affection of breath­ <lb/>
            ing, and investigate the causes which gave it its present nature. <lb/>
            We should reason on it, therefore, as follows :-As there is no <lb/>
            such thing in nature as a vacuum into which a moving body <lb/>
            can enter, and as breath passes from us outwards, every one <lb/>
            is aware that it cannot escape into void space, but must thrust <lb/>
            out whatever is nearest; again, that the body must always <lb/>
            repel that ever nearest, and that from a necessity of this kind, <lb/>
            everything impelled into the place vacated by the emitted <lb/>
            breath must, after entering and filling up this space, attend on <lb/>
            the breath as it travels. And all this must take place like <lb/>
            the revolution of a wheel, through the impossibility of a <lb/>
            vacuum. Hence, the breast and lungs, after dismissing the <lb/>
            breath outwards, are again inflated by the entrance of the air <lb/>
            surrounding the body into and around the cavities of the <lb/>
            flesh. And when the air is again sent outwards and flows <lb/>
            round the body, it drives the breath inwards through the <lb/>
            mouth and nostrils.</p>
          <p>LIX.—And as regards the cause from which they derive <lb/>
            their origin, we may propose the following. In every animal <lb/>
            in the universe those of its internal parts are the hottest which <lb/>
            surround the veins and blood, just as if they contained a <lb/>
            fountain of fire;* and this heat we compared to a bow-net, <lb/>
            extending through the middle of the body, and woven wholly of <lb/>
            fire; all outside of it being composed of air. Yet heat, it <lb/>
            must be agreed, naturally proceeds outward into a region <lb/>
            with which it is allied. But as there are two passages for the <lb/>
            heat,-one through the body outwards, the other again <lb/>
            through the mouth and nostrils; hence, when the breath is <lb/>
            impelled towards the latter, it in turn repels that latter. But <lb/>
            that which is drawn into the fire becomes heated by so falling, <lb/>
            while what is exhaled becomes cooled ;-and so, owing to the <lb/>
            change of temperature, they pass again into their former con­ <lb/>
            dition, whether hot or cold, through the mutual repulsion of <figure type="illustration">

              each other ; and as the same influence is constant and mutually <lb/>
              operating, its circular agitation gives birth to the expiration <lb/>
              and inspiration of the breath.</p>
          <p>LX. To the same causes may we ascribe the impressions <lb/>
            produced by medical cupping-glasses, by swallowing drink, by <lb/>
            the violent hurlings of bodies, whether upwards or on the <lb/>
            ground, together with such sounds as appear swift or slow, <lb/>
            sharp or flat,—and which at one time are discordant, owing to <lb/>
            the dissimilitude of the motion which they cause within us, <lb/>
            and at another harmonize, through the similitude of that <lb/>
            motion. For the slower sounds catch up those antecedent <lb/>
            and swifter, because the latter slacken their pace to one like <lb/>
            their own; and by so following the swifter, they still urge <lb/>
            them onward,-though without disturbing the motion by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing another, but making their slower rate to approach <lb/>
            gradually to that of the swifter ;-and this mixed impres­ <lb/>
            sion from the sharp and flat (i. e. the quick and slow) forms a <lb/>
            single note; whence results the pleasure felt even by the <lb/>
            unwise, but really entertained by the wise, which is owing to <lb/>
            the imitation of Divine harmony that exists in mortal motions.* <lb/>
            And, indeed, with respect to all the motions of water, the <lb/>
            fallings of thunder, and the wonderful circumstances observed <lb/>
            in the attraction of amber, and the Herculean stone,<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign>—in <lb/>
            all these, no real attraction takes place at all; but as a <lb/>
            vacuum can nowhere be found, the particles are mutually <lb/>
            impelled by each other; hence, as they all individually, both <lb/>
            in a separate and mingled state, have an attraction for their <lb/>
            own proper seats, it is by the mutual intermingling of these <lb/>
            affections, that such admirable effects present themselves to <lb/>
            the view of the accurate investigator.</p>
          <p>LXI.—It is specially owing to this cause, that respiration <lb/>
            (whence our discourse originated) is generated; and after <lb/>
            the manner that we have before shown ;-namely, that as fire <lb/>
            divides the food and rises internally to attend on the breath, <note type="footnote"> * Comp. ch. xviii. and xx. with Republ. vii. ch.12, where the harmony <lb/>
            of the soul is treated more at length. See also Martin, ii. p. 339. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is a very memorable passage, and clearly shows that Plato was <lb/>
            not only well acquainted with the doctrine of attraction and repulsion, <lb/>
            but was of opinion also that the law of repulsion depended on the congre­ <lb/>
            gation of similar elements throughout all nature. The whole matter, <lb/>
            however, is largely treated by Plutarch in his sixth Platonic Dissertation, <lb/>
            vol. ii. p. 1004, ed. Par. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            the veins from the belly become filled by this joint elevation, <lb/>
            in consequence of drawing thence the divided portions of the <lb/>
            food; so that by these means, through every animal body the <lb/>
            streams of nutriment are abundantly diffused. But the parts <lb/>
            which are recently cut apart and separated from their kindred <lb/>
            natures,—some of them fruits and others grasses, and produced <lb/>
            by the Deity for bodily food, acquiie varieties of colour <lb/>
            through their mutual admixture; though for the most part <lb/>
            the red predominates,* as its nature consists of fire combined <lb/>
            with a lump of moist mud. Hence also the colour of that <lb/>
            which flows about the body is just what it seems, and is also <lb/>
            called blood, being the nurturing principle of the flesh and <lb/>
            whole body; and so by everywhere diffusing its moisture, it <lb/>
            copiously replenishes all the exhausted parts.</p>
          <p>As for the manner of impletion and depletion, it is produced <lb/>
            in the same way as the change of everything in the universe; <lb/>
            viz. from the circumstance of all kindred natures having a <lb/>
            common attraction :-for the natures with which we are clothed <lb/>
            externally, are perpetually melting and being distributed, each <lb/>
            form of matter departing to that with which it is allied. But <lb/>
            the particles of blood which are contained in, and distributed <lb/>
            throughout our bodies, as is the case with every animal created <lb/>
            under heaven, necessarily imitate the motion of the universe. <lb/>
            Each, therefore, of the divided parts within us, being borne <lb/>
            along to its kindred nature, again replenishes what is void. <lb/>
            But when the decretions exceed the accessions, the whole <lb/>
            animal falls into decay; but in the contrary case, it acquires <lb/>
            growth.</p>
          <p>LXII.—The new composition therefore of every animal, <lb/>
            as it has new triangles, [i.e. elementary principles,] formed as it <lb/>
            were from fresh timbers, causes them to lock closely within each <lb/>
            other,-the whole of its bulk being of a delicate structure, <lb/>
            formed of fresh marrow and fed on milk. Those triangles, <lb/>
            therefore, that compose the bodily aliment, having entered <lb/>
            it from without and been received into the animal, from being <lb/>
            older and weaker than the simple original triangles therewith <lb/>
            agreeing, are overpowered and destroyed by the new tri­ <lb/>
            angles; and the animal grows to a large size, because it is <note type="footnote"> * Respecting the origin of the colour red, comp. ch. xlii. Galen thus <lb/>
            speaks of this opinion about the blood (vii. ch. 159)—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἐρυθρὰν χρόαν</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig82.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="396"/>
              supplied from a multitude of similar parts. But when the <lb/>
              root of these triangles is relaxed by fatigue and dulness, <lb/>
              brought on by the repulsion of many particles during a long <lb/>
              period of time, then the food received can no longer cut into <lb/>
              its own similitude; but they are themselves easily separated <lb/>
              by the bodies that enter from without. Overcome by this, <lb/>
              the whole animal at length decays; and this state is what we <lb/>
              call old age :-and at last, when the jointed chains of the <lb/>
              triangles about the marrow can no longer hold, but through <lb/>
              long employment get unfastened and set free the bonds of <lb/>
              the soul,-the soul thus loosened naturally flies off with plea­ <lb/>
              sure and delight; for everything contrary to nature is painful, <lb/>
              while the natural is pleasant. Hence the death caused by <lb/>
              wounds and disease is painful and violent,-while that which <lb/>
              follows old age, as the end agreeable to nature, is of all deaths <lb/>
              the least irksome, and attended rather by pleasure than pain.*</p>
          <p>LXIII.—As to the origin of diseases, that must be obvious <lb/>
            to every one :-for as there are four component elements of <lb/>
            the body, viz. earth, fire, water, and air, the unnatural over­ <lb/>
            abundance or defect of these, and their removal from their own <lb/>
            to a different position,-those of fire, we mean, and the other <lb/>
            classes, for there are more than one,-these are the causes <lb/>
            why they do not each receive what suits their peculiar na­ <lb/>
            ture, and they necessarily produce disturbances and diseases : <lb/>
            for as these are severally generated and transferred in a way <lb/>
            contrary to nature, such things as were formerly heated be­ <lb/>
            come cold, what were once dry moist, the light heavy-all <lb/>
            things, in short, undergo all possible mutations. For we <lb/>
            assert that it is only when the same thing approaches to and <lb/>
            departs from the same in the same manner and according to <lb/>
            analogy, that it will allow what is the same with itself to <lb/>
            abide in health and safety : and should any of them be in <lb/>
            discordance, whether approaching or departing, it will cause <lb/>
            all varieties of alienations, as well as unnumbered diseases and <lb/>
            corruptions. But having now found the second set of conditions <lb/>
            suitable to nature, the second mode of considering diseases also <note type="footnote"> * It is this kind of death of which he speaks in the Georgics (p. 524}— </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig83.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχη̃ς καὶ του̃ σώματος ἀπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλήλων</foreign>. Comp. also Plutarch, De Plac. <lb/>

              the same topic. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="397"/>
              is now open to any one desirous of so doing.* For as the <lb/>
              marrow, bone, flesh, and sinew are composed of those [ele­ <lb/>
              ments,] as likewise the blood in another way, though from a <lb/>
              similar origin, so also most other diseases owe their severity <lb/>
              to the causes we have mentioned ; though the greatest of <lb/>
              them are to be traced to the following cause:—When the <lb/>
              generation of these various [bodily substances] takes place <lb/>
              inversely, then they become subject to corruption :-for the <lb/>
              flesh and sinews are naturally formed from blood,-the sinews <lb/>
              indeed from fibres, through the connexion between these, but <lb/>
              the flesh from its union with that which when in a separate <lb/>
              state becomes solid :— while the glutinous and fatty sub­ <lb/>
              stance again which is formed from sinews and flesh, at once <lb/>
              unites t the flesh to the bone, and itself feeds the growth of <lb/>
              the bone itself, with which the marrow is surrounded. And <lb/>
              again, that which filters through the solid part of the bones, <lb/>
              being the purest kind of the triangles, as well as most smooth <lb/>
              and unctuous, moistens the marrow by falling drop by drop <lb/>
              from the bones.</p>
          <p>LXIV.—When these several things are the case, health <lb/>
            mostly ensues ; but when the contrary happens-disease. For <lb/>
            when the flesh becomes liquefied and sends back what it loses <lb/>
            into the veins, then the blood mingled with spirit flows abun­ <lb/>
            dantly, and of all kinds, through the veins, with different <lb/>
            degrees of colours and bitterness; ‡ and yet further, from its <lb/>
            acid and salt qualities, it generates all kinds of bile, lymph, <lb/>
            and phlegm;—for as they are all generated and corrupted in <lb/>
            an opposite way, they first of all destroy the blood itself ;§ <lb/>
            and the fluids that can no longer afford nutriment to the <lb/>
            body, are borne along the veins without any natural order <note type="footnote"> * He now proceeds to consider the second cause of diseases-from the <lb/>
            deprivation of the compound substances of the body,-blood, bile, flesh, <lb/>
            marrow, &amp;c., which can easily be comprehended, says he, by those <lb/>
            who have followed him in his speculations on the first. </note><note type="footnote"> t The old reading was <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλά</foreign> ; but the best MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολλᾳ̃</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πικρότητι</foreign>.

            on the state of the blood ; and on this principle chiefly he explains the <lb/>
            causes of diseases, which arise from the corruption of the humours caused <lb/>
            by the disturbed state of the body, bringing also a taint on the blood ;— <lb/>
            and hence it must follow that the general health becomes impaired, <lb/>
            because the blood runs through the veins, diffusing through the body its <lb/>
            vital nutriment. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            of circulation ; at variance, indeed, with each other, because <lb/>
            they derive no mutual advantages from the properties of each, <lb/>
            but [positively] hostile to the constitution of the body, and <lb/>
            its maintenance in health,—in short, destroying it and bringing <lb/>
            it to putrefaction.</p>
          <p>Such, therefore, of the flesh as becomes liquefied by its <lb/>
            great age, being indisposed to putrefy, grows black from <lb/>
            long burning; and from having been entirely macerated it <lb/>
            becomes bitter, and falls into discontent with the other parts of <lb/>
            the body not yet infected with corruption. And then, indeed, <lb/>
            instead of bitterness, the black part assumes an acidity, if the <lb/>
            bitter becomes more attenuated : but when the bitterness is <lb/>
            tinged with blood, it becomes still redder; and when mixed <lb/>
            with black, it assumes the nature of bile :-and yet further, <lb/>
            to the bitterness is added a yellow colour through the melt­ <lb/>
            ing of new flesh on the fire surrounding the flame. And this <lb/>
            common name for all these some of the physicians assigned <lb/>
            them,-or at any rate some who were able to consider many <lb/>
            things dissimilar, and to detect in a single class a great <lb/>
            number of particulars all deserving a special name. But all <lb/>
            else that may be called kinds of bile, receive, according to <lb/>
            colour, a name peculiar to each. As for lymph (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴχωρ</foreign>), the <lb/>
            whey of the blood, it is gentle and mild: while the sediment <lb/>
            of black, acid bile, is fierce and wild ;-and when mingled <lb/>
            by heat with anything of a saline quality, it is called acid <lb/>
            phlegm. Again, the moisture running from new and tender <lb/>
            flesh mingled with the air, which is afterwards inflated and <lb/>
            enclosed by moisture, produces bubbles, which separately are <lb/>
            invisible, owing to their small size, but when collected in a <lb/>
            large bulk become visible, and acquire a white colour from <lb/>
            the generation of froth. And all this liquefaction of delicate <lb/>
            flesh, when woven together with spirit, we term white phlegm, <lb/>
            -the sediment of recent phlegm, tears and sweat; together <lb/>
            with all such secretions that the body sends forth for its puri­ <lb/>
            fication.</p>
          <p>LXV. — All these indeed become the instruments of <lb/>
            disease, when the blood is not supplied naturally from liquid <lb/>
            and solid food, but gains bulk from contraries in violation of <lb/>
            the laws of nature. When any part of the flesh therefore <lb/>
            becomes separated by disease,* letting its first principles <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ νόσων</foreign>, omitted in the old editions, has been restored on the <lb/>
            authority of several of the best MSS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            remain, half the trouble is removed ; for it admits of an <lb/>
            easy recovery. But when that which binds the flesh to the <lb/>
            bones becomes diseased, and the blood flowing from the <lb/>
            fibres and sinews no longer serves as food to the bones and <lb/>
            a bond to the flesh, but, instead of being fat, smooth and <lb/>
            glutinous, becomes rough and salt from being parched by <lb/>
            bad diet ; then, in consequence of suffering all this and <lb/>
            being separated from the bones, it is itself crumbled down* <lb/>
            under the flesh and sinews; -while the flesh falling at <lb/>
            the same time from its roots, leaves the sinews bare and <lb/>
            saturated with salt; and thus, entering once more the <lb/>
            circulation of the blood, it increases the number of the <lb/>
            aforesaid maladies. And if these bodily ailments be severe, <lb/>
            still more afflicting and troublesome are those that precede <lb/>
            them ; when the bone, owing to the density of the flesh, does <lb/>
            not allow sufficient respiration, but becoming heated through <lb/>
            rottenness, falls into decay, and will receive no nutriment, but <lb/>
            on the contrary gradually crumble away,-bone falling on <lb/>
            flesh, and flesh again on blood, diseases being by these means <lb/>
            produced that are of a severer character than the former. <lb/>
            By far the worst of all maladies however is,-when the mar­ <lb/>
            row becomes diseased through some defect or excess;­ <lb/>
            because it is then productive of the most vehement and fatal <lb/>
            diseases, the whole nature of the body being necessarily <lb/>
            reversed and destroyed.</p>
          <p>LXVI.—Again, as to the third species of diseases, we ought <lb/>
            to consider them as divided into three classes,-one pro­ <lb/>
            duced by spirit, a second by phlegm, and a third by bile. <lb/>
            For when the lungs, the great guardian of the breath, <lb/>
            through being obstructed by defluxions,t will not allow a <lb/>
            free passage to the breath, which thus has no egress one way, <lb/>
            and in another enters in larger supplies than it ought, those <lb/>
            parts which are not cooled by it become putrid, while those that <lb/>
            receive too much of it, passing violently through the veins, <lb/>
            distort them and become liquefied, being shut out with the <lb/>
            diaphragm in the middle of the body: and thus ten thousand <lb/>
            severe ailments hence arise, together with an abundance of <lb/>
            sweat. And frequently, when the flesh becomes separated <lb/>
            within the body, breath is produced, which not finding <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταψήχεται</foreign>. The old editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταψήχεται</foreign>. The same <lb/>
            observation applies to <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταψήχόμενον</foreign>, a few lines lower down. </note><note type="footnote"> t Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ ῥευμάτων φράχθεις</foreign>, obstructed by discharges of phlegm. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            escape externally, causes the same torments as the breath <lb/>
            entering from without. The greatest pains that it produces, <lb/>
            however, are, when it surrounds and swells out the sinews <lb/>
            and neighbouring veins, stretching and distorting the tendons <lb/>
            and sinews continued from the back. Now these diseases, <lb/>
            from their disposition to extension, are termed tensions <lb/>
            and contortions from behind,* — the cure of which it is <lb/>
            difficult to find ; because fevers supervene and generally bring <lb/>
            them to a close. But the white phlegm, when it becomes <lb/>
            troublesome through the formation of air-bubbles, being shut <lb/>
            out by having breathing-vents outside the body, is of a <lb/>
            milder kind, and variegates the body with white spots, gene­ <lb/>
            rating other diseases also of a similar character. But when <lb/>
            mingled with black bile, and dispersed about the most divine <lb/>
            circulations of the head, it acts as a disturbing agent, though <lb/>
            with less violence during sleep; but if it come to those who <lb/>
            are awake, it cannot be expelled without difficulty; and as <lb/>
            this is a disease of a sacred nature (or organ, i. e. the head), <lb/>
            it is most justly called sacred. t An acid and salt phlegm <lb/>
            again is the source of all those diseases which are produced <lb/>
            by a defluxion of humours: and because the places into <lb/>
            which this phlegm flows are of infinite variety, it produces <lb/>
            all kinds of diseases. But whatever parts of the body are <lb/>
            said to be inflamed, all become so from being burnt and <lb/>
            inflamed by bile.</p>
          <p>LXVII. Now this bile, whenever it makes an expiration, <lb/>
            boils and sends up all kinds of tumours, and when inwardly <lb/>
            restrained, generates many inflammatory diseases,—but the <lb/>
            greatest of all, when mingled with pure blood it disturbs the <lb/>
            order of the fibres, which are scattered in the blood for this <lb/>
            purpose,-namely, of giving it certain measures of tenuity and <figure type="illustration">

              as a distension or convulsion extending equally over a considerable part of <lb/>
              the body ;-but it appears to be a generic term also, of which <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁπισθό­ <lb/>

              vorum rigor;—and it seems, in fact, to be an involuntary retraction, in <lb/>
              a contrary direction to the muscles. </note><note type="footnote"> t Epilepsy, however, was what the ancients usually termed the sacred <lb/>

              density, and that it may neither through heat (as being moist) <lb/>
              flow from the thin body, nor from its density become una­ <lb/>
              dapted to motion, and so experience difficulty in flowing back <lb/>
              in the veins. The just temperament, then, of these things is <lb/>
              under the natural guardianship of the fibres; because if any <lb/>
              one collects them together in the blood when dead and in a <lb/>
              state of coldness, all the remaining blood becomes diffused ; <lb/>
              and when let out quickly, it coagulates in consequence of the <lb/>
              cold surrounding it. The fibres possessing this influence over <lb/>
              the blood, the bile, which is of the nature of ancient blood, <lb/>
              and again changed into it from flesh by liquefaction, first <lb/>
              gradually falls in a warm, moist state, and becomes coagulated <lb/>
              through the power of the fibres; though when coagulated <lb/>
              and violently extinguished, it causes a tempest and tremor <lb/>
              within. When it flows with still greater force, it over­ <lb/>
              comes the fibres by its own proper heat, and by its ebulli­ <lb/>
              tion drives them into disorder;* and if it retains its pre­ <lb/>
              valence to the end, it penetrates into the marrow, and <lb/>
              burning the bonds of the soul, as if they were the cables of a <lb/>
              ship, dissolves their union, and sets it wholly free; but, on <lb/>
              the other hand, when it flows less abundantly, and the <lb/>
              body on becoming liquefied opposes its passage, it then, on <lb/>
              finding itself overcome, either escapes through the whole body, <lb/>
              or being driven through the veins into the upper or lower <lb/>
              belly, escapes from the body like a fugitive from a seditious <lb/>
              city, and introduces defluxions, dysenteries, or gripings of <lb/>
              the intestines, and all diseases of a similar kind. When the <lb/>
              body, therefore, is unusually diseased by an excess of fire, it <lb/>
              then labours under continued burnings and fever; but when <lb/>
              through excess of air, under quotidian fevers : under tertian <lb/>
              through water, because water is less active than fire and air ; <lb/>
              and under quartaM, through excess of earth ;-for earth, being <lb/>
              of all of them the least active, becomes purified in quadruple <lb/>
              periods of time, and hence introduces quartan fevers, which <lb/>
              are with difficulty dispelled.!</p>
          <p>LXVIII. In the above manner are the diseases of the body <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἀταξίαν ζέσασα διέσεισε</foreign>. The old editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέσωσε</foreign>, <lb/>
            which makes against the context. </note><note type="footnote"> t Martin has taken great and successful pains to point out the surprising <lb/>
            sagacity of Plato's conjectures on the causes of disease. His notes on the <lb/>
            subject are well worthy of on attentive perusal. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            produced ; but the diseases of the soul, resulting from the <lb/>
            habit of the body, are as follows. We must admit that the <lb/>
            disease of the soul is foIl!, or. a privation of intellect; and <lb/>
            that there are two kinds of folly; the one madness, the other <lb/>
            ignorance. Whatever passion, therefore, a person experiences <lb/>
            that induces either of them, must be called a disease. Exces­ <lb/>
            sive pleasures and pains, however, are what we should deem the <lb/>
            greatest diseases of the soul :-for when a man is over-elevated <lb/>
            with joy or unduly depressed with grief, and so hastens immo­ <lb/>
            derately either to retain the one or fly from the other, he can <lb/>
            neither perceive nor hear anything properly, but is agitated <lb/>
            with fury, and very little capable of exercising the reasoning <lb/>
            power. But he who possesses a great quantity of fluid-seed <lb/>
            about the marrow, and is by nature like a tree over-laden <lb/>
            with fruit, such a one having many throes,* and also many <lb/>
            pleasures in his desires and their attendant offspring,­ <lb/>
            being maddened too during most of his life by the greatest <lb/>
            pleasures and pains, having a soul also rendered morbid and <lb/>
            unwise by the body, is wrongly deemed to be-not diseased, but <lb/>
            voluntarily bad.t In truth, however, sexual intemperance <lb/>
            generally becomes a disease of the soul, through a particular <lb/>
            state of fluidity and moisture caused by the tenuity of the <lb/>
            bones. And indeed it may almost be asserted, that all intem­ <lb/>
            perance in any kind of pleasure, and all disgraceful conduct, <lb/>
            is not properly blamed as the consequence of voluntary guilt. <lb/>
            For no one is voluntary bad: but he who is depraved be­ <lb/>
            comes so through a certain bad habit of body and an ill- <lb/>
            governed education; and to every one these are inimical, as <lb/>
            they result in a certain evil. And again, in the matter of pain, <lb/>
            the soul suffers much depravity through the body. For where <lb/>
            acid and salt phlegm, and likewise bitter and bilious humours, <lb/>
            wandering through the body, get no external vent, but revolve <lb/>
            inwardly, and mingle their exhalations with the circulation of <lb/>
            the soul; they in this case produce within it aninfinite vari­ <lb/>
            ety of diseases, greater or less in degree,-more or less in <lb/>
            numbers. They are introduced, indeed, to three seats of the <lb/>
            soul; and according to the diversity of the place, each begets <note type="footnote"> * The old editions read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀδύνας</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠδι̃νας</foreign>, </note><note type="footnote"> t This is quite according to Plato's well-known doctrine—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺδεὶς <lb/>
            έκὠν κακός</foreign>, as. he explains it below, and in the Republ. ix. p. 589, c.; <lb/>
            Protagoras, p. 345, e. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            every variety of difficulty and sorrow, rashness and timidity, <lb/>
            and still further of oblivion and indocility. Besides this also, <lb/>
            the vicious manners of cities, and discourses both private and <lb/>
            public, often contribute to increase this malady; nor are any <lb/>
            branches of learning taught in early life which tend to serve <lb/>
            as remedies for such mighty ills;—and thus all the vicious are <lb/>
            vicious through two most involuntary causes, which we <lb/>
            should always ascribe rather to the planters than the things <lb/>
            planted, and to the trainers rather than those trained; but <lb/>
            still it should be our anxious endeavour, as far as we can, by <lb/>
            education, studies, and learning, to By from vice, and acquire <lb/>
            its contrary-virtue. These particulars, however, require <lb/>
            another mode of argument.</p>
          <p>LXIX. Again, as respects the contrary of these, it is quite <lb/>
            fit and proper to explain concerning the cultivation both <lb/>
            of the body and the intellect, by what means each is to <lb/>
            be healthfully preserved. For it is more just to take ac­ <lb/>
            count of good things, rather than of the evil. Now every <lb/>
            thing good is beautiful; and the beautiful is not without <lb/>
            measure:—an animal therefore destined to be such, must <lb/>
            possess symmetry. Of symmetries, however, we perceive <lb/>
            and understand those which are small; but as for the <lb/>
            greatest and most important, of these we are quite igno­ <lb/>
            rant. For indeed, no symmetry or want of measure is of <lb/>
            more importance with respect to health and disease, virtue <lb/>
            and vice, than that of the soul towards the body:-and yet <lb/>
            into these we make no inquiry, nor do we reflect that when <lb/>
            a weaker and inferior form is the vehicle of a strong and <lb/>
            every way mighty soul, and when on the contrary these two <lb/>
            pass into a state of compact union, then the animal is not <lb/>
            wholly beautiful; for it is without symmetry in the most <lb/>
            important points of symmetry, while an animal of opposite <lb/>
            character is the fairest of all sights that can be beheld. <lb/>
            Just therefore, as a body has immoderately long legs, or <lb/>
            indeed any other superfluity of parts that hinders its in­ <lb/>
            ternal symmetry, it at once becomes base, in the participation <lb/>
            of labour suffers many afflictions and many convulsions, and <lb/>
            through suffering an aggregation of accidents, becomes the <lb/>
            cause to itself of innumerable ills. The same too must be <lb/>
            understood concerning that compound essence [of body and <lb/>
            soul,] which we term an animal ;-as, for instance, when the <note type="footnote"> 2 D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            soul in this compound is stronger than the body, and greatly <lb/>
            prevails over it, then [the soul,] agitating the whole of <lb/>
            it inwardly, fills it with diseases ; and, by ardent application <lb/>
            to learned pursuits and investigations, causes it to waste <lb/>
            away. Lastly, when the soul employs itself in didactic pur­ <lb/>
            suits and logomachies, publicly as well as in private, through <lb/>
            a certain ambitious strife, it then inflames the body and <lb/>
            dissolves its constitution, and by introducing distillations of <lb/>
            humours, deceives the great part of those who are called <lb/>
            physicians, inducing them to consider these effects as proceed­ <lb/>
            in-, from contrary causes.</p>
          <p>Also, when a body that is large and superior to the soul in <lb/>
            power is joined with a small and weak intellect,—there being <lb/>
            naturally two classes of desires in man, one of aliment on <lb/>
            account of the body, the other of wisdom for the sake of <lb/>
            our most divine part;—in this case, the motions of the more <lb/>
            powerful prevailing and enlarging what is their own, but <lb/>
            making the reflective part of the soul deaf, indocile, and <lb/>
            oblivious, thus induce ignorance—the greatest of all diseases. <lb/>
            There is one safety then for both-neither to move the soul <lb/>
            without the body, nor the body without the soul; in order <lb/>
            that by mutually resisting each other they may be equally <lb/>
            balanced and in perfect health. The mathematician then, <lb/>
            or any one else who ardently devotes himself to any intel­ <lb/>
            lectual pursuit, should at the same time engage the body in <lb/>
            gymnastic exercises;—and the man, again, who is careful in <lb/>
            rightly forming his body, should at the same time therewith <lb/>
            unite the motions of the soul in the exercises of music and <lb/>
            all philosophy; if at least he intends to be one, that may <lb/>
            justly be called beautiful and at the same time right good.</p>
          <p>LXX.—In this very same manner we ought to attend <lb/>
            even to the parts of the body, that they may imitate the form <lb/>
            of the whole :-for when the body is inwardly burnt and <lb/>
            cooled by the things that enter it, and again, is moistened by <lb/>
            things external, and suffers all the consequences of these <lb/>
            affections; then if any one gives up his body when quies­ <lb/>
            cent to these kinds of motions, he is overcome and perishes.* <lb/>
            But if any one will imitate what we called the tutor and nurse <lb/>
            of the universe, and never allow the body to be at rest, but <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig85.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="405"/>
              perpetually move it and assist its natural motions both within <lb/>
              and without, by ever implanting in it certain agitations, and also <lb/>
              by moderate agitation bring into order according to their mu­ <lb/>
              tual relations the wandering passions and parts of the body, <lb/>
              he will not, as we said in our former discourse about the <lb/>
              universe, place foe against foe, and suffer war and disease to <lb/>
              be produced in the body,-but, on the other hand, combining <lb/>
              friend with friend, will contrive to induce a state of sound <lb/>
              health. Of all motions, again, that is the best which takes <lb/>
              place in itself from itself: for this is particularly allied to <lb/>
              intellect and the motion of the universe,-that produced by <lb/>
              another being inferior :-whereas that is the worst of all mo­ <lb/>
              tions, which, when the body is recumbent and at ease, moves it <lb/>
              by means of others and only partially. Hence, therefore, of <lb/>
              all modes of cleansing and giving consistence to the body, the <lb/>
              best is that effected by gymnastics, — the second is that <lb/>
              caused by easy conveyance, either in a ship or other suitable <lb/>
              vehicle ; but the third kind of motion, however useful perhaps <lb/>
              to one in extreme need, must on no account be otherwise <lb/>
              used by any one endued with intellect; and this is that <lb/>
              medical kind of motion produced by pharmaceutical purga­ <lb/>
              tion :-for diseases, unless they are extremely dangerous, must <lb/>
              not be irritated by medicines. Indeed, every form of disease <lb/>
              in some respect resembles the nature of animals ;-for the <lb/>
              condition of the latter has allotted to it stated periods of life, <lb/>
              both as respects individuals and entire races, and each animal <lb/>
              separately of itself has its fated life apart from the affection <lb/>
              arising from necessity:—because the triangles, which from the <lb/>
              very first have power over each, are so composed, as to <lb/>
              suffice only for a certain time : beyond which period no animal <lb/>
              can extend its life. The same condition of things also takes <lb/>
              place in the case of diseases; for if any one destroys them by <lb/>
              medicine before the fated time, he will only produce great <lb/>
              diseases out of small, and many out of few. On this account <lb/>
              we must discipline all such maladies by proper diet, according <lb/>
              as each has leisure, and not irritate by medicines an obstinate <lb/>
              complaint.-And thus much may suffice to have been said <lb/>
              concerning the common animal and its corporeal part,-how <lb/>
              each governing himself and governed by himself, may pursue <lb/>
              a life regulated by reason.</p>
          <p>LXXI.—That part, however, which is to have the govern­ <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            ment of the animal, should, as far as possible, be better pro­ <lb/>
            vided, and earlier also, with the power of being the fairest <lb/>
            and best in the art of ruling. To treat accurately indeed of <lb/>
            these matters, would require a separate work of itself: but <lb/>
            even pursuing it by way of mere by-work (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν παρέργῳ</foreign>), in <lb/>
            accordance with what has preceded, we shall not be inconsis­ <lb/>
            tent, nor fail in the end of our inquiries. We have often <lb/>
            then before asserted that there are three kinds of soul within <lb/>
            us, in three parts of the body, each having its peculiar mo­ <lb/>
            tions ; and so in the same way we must now briefly affirm, <lb/>
            that when any one of them is in a torpid state and rests from <lb/>
            its own proper motions, it must necessarily become extremely <lb/>
            weak, and only by constant exercise attains the highest degree <lb/>
            of strength :—we should be careful therefore that each may <lb/>
            preserve its own motions in symmetry with all the rest.</p>
          <p>But with respect to the highest and most leading part of our <lb/>
            soul, [i. e. the human soul,] we should conceive as follows :— <lb/>
            that the Deity assigned this to each as a daemon ;—that, <lb/>
            namely, which we say, and say correctly too, resides at the <lb/>
            summit of the body and raises us from earth to our cognate <lb/>
            place in heaven :-for we are plants, not of earth, but heaven; <lb/>
            and from the same source whence the soul first arose, a divine <lb/>
            nature, raising aloft our head and root, directs our whole <lb/>
            corporeal frame. In him, therefore, who has eagerly striven <lb/>
            to satisfy the cravings of desire and ambition, all the concep­ <lb/>
            tions engendered in his soul must necessarily be mortal; and he <lb/>
            will necessarily, as much as possible, become entirely mortal, <lb/>
            omitting no effort to improve such a nature. For one, how­ <lb/>
            ever, whois sedulously employed in the acquisition of knowledge <lb/>
            and true wisdom, and is chiefly practised in this one pursuit, it <lb/>
            is altogether necessary, if he would touch on the truth, that he <lb/>
            should be endued with wisdom about immortal and divine <lb/>
            concerns; and as far as human nature is capable of immor­ <lb/>
            tality, he should leave no part neglected; and thus, as he <lb/>
            ever cultivates that which is divine, and has a daemon most <lb/>
            excellently adorned residing within him, he will be exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly happy. But the culture of all the parts is one only,­ <lb/>
            that of assigning to each their proper nutriment and motion. <lb/>
            But the motions allied to the divine part of our nature, are <lb/>
            the reflective energies and circulations of the universe. These, <lb/>
            then, each of us should pursue; restoring the revolutions in <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            our head that have been corrupted through being employed <lb/>
            on generation, by a diligent investigation of the harmonies and <lb/>
            circulations of the universe, with the view of assimilating <lb/>
            the reflective power to the object of reflection according to its <lb/>
            ancient nature; * for, by this assimilation, we shall obtain the <lb/>
            end of the best life proposed by the gods to men, both present <lb/>
            and future.</p>
          <p>LXXII.—And now the discussion which we announced <lb/>
            at the beginning concerning the universe, as far at least as <lb/>
            concerns the generation of man, is very nearly completed; <lb/>
            for as to the rest of the animals, how they were generated, <lb/>
            we will only briefly describe them, except where necessity bids <lb/>
            us enlarge: for a person may think that he is thus more in <lb/>
            measure as concerns such an inquiry. On this subject, then, <lb/>
            let us speak as follows :-Of the men that were born, such as <lb/>
            are timid, and have passed through life unjustly, are, we sup­ <lb/>
            pose, changed into women in their second generation. At <lb/>
            that time, then, and for that reason, the gods devised the love <lb/>
            of copulation; constructing an animated substance, and <lb/>
            placing one in us men, another in the women,-forming each <lb/>
            in the following manner :-That passage for the drink, by <lb/>
            which these liquids run through the lungs under the reins <lb/>
            into the bladder, and which sends them forth as it receives <lb/>
            them, by the pressure of the breath,†—this [the gods] made to <lb/>
            pass into the condensed marrow, from the head, along the <lb/>
            neck, and through the back-bone; and this we called seed in <lb/>
            a former part of this discourse:—and this [the marrow], in <lb/>
            consequence of being animated and endued with respiration, <lb/>
            produces in the part where it respires a lively desire of emis­ <lb/>
            sion,—thus perfecting in us the love of procreation. On <lb/>
            this account, the nature of men, as respects their private <lb/>
            parts, becoming insubordinate and imperious, like an animal <lb/>
            not obedient to reason, tries through raging desire to gain <lb/>
            absolute sway. The same is the case with the wombs, and <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig86.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσιν</foreign>, &amp;c. The meaning is, that where the reflective powers are employed <lb/>
              in meditating on the universe, they are necessarily brought into harmony <lb/>
              with the only true objects of intellect,-and which existed indeed from the <lb/>
              first creation. </note><note type="footnote"> t This very erroneous view has been before alluded to in a note on <lb/>
              ch. xlv. speaking of the lungs. Plato had evidently no knowledge of the <lb/>
              action of the kidneys. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="408"/>
              other connected parts of women,-so called, as forming an <lb/>
              animal desirous of procreating children. This, when it re­ <lb/>
              mains without fruit long beyond its proper time, becomes <lb/>
              discontented and indignant; and wandering every way <lb/>
              through the body, it obstructs the passage of the breath, and <lb/>
              throws women into extreme difficulties, causing all varieties <lb/>
              of diseases, till at length the desire and love of both parties <lb/>
              [i. e. the man and woman] cause the emission of seed, like <lb/>
              fruit from a tree ; by which emission, they sow in the womb, <lb/>
              as in a field, animals invisible from their minute size, and <lb/>
              yet unformed, which, as they become larger, they nourish <lb/>
              within ; and lastly, by bringing them to light, perfect the <lb/>
              generation of animals.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. Such is the process of generation in women and <lb/>
            every female. Next succeeded the tribe of birds having <lb/>
            feathers instead of hair, which were fashioned from men with­ <lb/>
            out vice indeed, but light-minded and curious about things on <lb/>
            high, yet conceiving in their folly that the strongest proofs <lb/>
            of these things are received through the sight [i. e. the senses]. <lb/>
            Again, the race of wild animals with feet was generated from <lb/>
            men, who made no use of philosophy, nor ever inquired into <lb/>
            anything that concerned the nature of the universe,-and <lb/>
            this, because they no longer employed the circulations in the <lb/>
            head, but followed the guidance of those parts of the soul that <lb/>
            reside about the breast. Owing to these pursuits, therefore, <lb/>
            they fixed their fore-legs and head earthwards, as suited their <lb/>
            nature,-having also long and variously-shaped heads, where <lb/>
            the circulations of each were compressed by inactivity :-and <lb/>
            hence their race became quadruped and multiped, the Deity <lb/>
            giving a greater number of feet to those more than usually <lb/>
            unwise, that they might be the more drawn towards the earth. <lb/>
            But as regards the most unwise of these, which extend all their <lb/>
            body along the ground, as if they had no longer any need for <lb/>
            feet, the gods formed them without feet to creep on the earth. <lb/>
            The fourth class is that living in the water, which was pro­ <lb/>
            duced from such men as were to the last degree unthinking <lb/>
            and ignorant, and whom those transformers of our nature did <lb/>
            not think deserving of a pure medium of respiration, because <lb/>
            they possessed a soul rendered impure by extreme trans­ <lb/>
            gression,—but drove them from the attenuated and pure <lb/>
            atmosphere into the turbid and deep breathing-medium of <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            water :-and hence arose the tribe of fishes and oysters, and <lb/>
            all other aquatic animals, which have received the most remote <lb/>
            habitations, as a punishment of their extreme ignorance. After <lb/>
            this manner then, both formerly and now, animals migrate into <lb/>
            each other; experiencing their changes through either the loss <lb/>
            or acquisition of intellect and folly. We are now at length to <lb/>
            say, that our discourse about the universe has reached its con­ <lb/>
            clusion ;-for not only containing, but full of mortal and <lb/>
            immortal animals, it has thus been formed a visible animal <lb/>
            embracing things visible, a sensible god of the intelligible, <lb/>
            the greatest, best, and most perfect,—this one only-begotten <lb/>
            UNIVERSE.</p>

          </head>
          <p>THIS Dialogue may be considered as an appendix to that pre­ <lb/>
            ceding, and the fulfilment of a promise which Critias had made <lb/>
            in the opening of the Timaeus, to give some account of the pri­ <lb/>
            mæval history of the Athenians, whose early manners he sup­ <lb/>
            posed to correspond with those of the citizens in Socrates's ideal <lb/>
            republic. The Athenians were a people so boastful of their <lb/>
            antiquity, as to arrogate to themselves the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόχθονες</foreign>; <lb/>
            and therefore any narrative or legend was likely to be agreeable <lb/>
            to their feelings, which assigned to them even a higher antiquity <lb/>
            than they really possessed. This may probably have been a <lb/>
            leading motive with Plato for constructing this amusing dialogue ; <lb/>
            more than half of which, however, is taken up with the descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of the Atlantic islands, its kings and its inhabitants, who all <lb/>
            existed in the time of the primitive Athenians, though in Plato's <lb/>
            time they were extinct, and their islands submerged in the sea. <lb/>
            Many curious speculations have been put forth respecting the <lb/>
            geography of the Atlantic isles, and some have gone so far as to <lb/>
            conjecture them to have been a portion of the modern America. <lb/>
            The whole story, however, has so much the appearance of a <lb/>
            myth, that it seems useless to apply to it any of the laws of <lb/>
            historical or geographical criticism. The Dialogue, moreover, is <lb/>
            so short as scarcely to require any abbreviated account of its con­ <lb/>
            tents.</p>

          <p>SECT. I.—TIM. I am just as pleased, Socrates, as one at <lb/>
            rest after a long journey, that I have now at length been <lb/>
            happily released from my protracted discourse !* And now I <lb/>
            implore that God [the universe,] long, long ago created in <lb/>
            fact, though on y just recently in our discussion, to establish in <lb/>
            security what we have properly stated, but as respects aught <lb/>
            that we have even involuntarily stated that is not to the pur­ <lb/>
            pose, to inflict on us a suitable punishment :-and the right <lb/>
            punishment for one out of tune is to make him play in tune.t <lb/>
            In order then, that for the future we may speak correctly <lb/>
            respecting the generation of the gods, we beseech him who is <lb/>
            the best and most perfect to give us a scientific knowledge of <lb/>
            medicine; and having thus prayed, we hand over to Critias, <lb/>
            as we agreed, the succeeding discourse.</p>
          <p>CRIT. Yes, Tiimeus, I receive it :-and as you acted at <lb/>
            first, in requesting indulgence as one about to speak on mo­ <lb/>
            mentous matters, the same also do I now entreat; and I <lb/>
            think that I ought the more to obtain it for what I am about <lb/>
            to say. Yet I know full well that I am making a very am­ <lb/>
            bitious request, and of a more rustic kind than is proper; still <lb/>
            we must proceed. That what you have now said has not <lb/>
            been well said, who in his senses will pretend to say ? I must <lb/>
            try to show then, that what I am about to say needs greater <lb/>
            indulgence on account of its greater difficulty :-for it is easier, <lb/>
            Timæus, to speak and appear to speak rightly about the gods <lb/>
            to men, than about mortals to us [men] ; inasmuch as the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig87.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="414"/>
              inexperience and extraordinary ignorance of the hearers about <lb/>
              things of this nature, both furnish great facilities to one in­ <lb/>
              tending to speak concerning them; but as respects the gods, <lb/>
              we know how we are situated. In order, however, that I <lb/>
              may clearly show my meaning, follow me in what I am about <lb/>
              to say. What has been said by the whole of us was neces­ <lb/>
              sarily only imitation and resemblance; and now, as regards <lb/>
              the representation by painters of divine and heavenly* objects, <lb/>
              we see with what facility or difficulty they contrive that they <lb/>
              shall seem to the spectators to be apt imitations; and we shall <lb/>
              see also, that with respect to earth, mountains, rivers, woods, <lb/>
              and the whole of heaven, and all therein, as well as what <lb/>
              moves about it, we are satisfied if a person is able to produce <lb/>
              even a slight resemblance of them;—but beyond this, as we <lb/>
              have no accurate knowledge concerning such matters, we <lb/>
              neither examine nor find fault with the paintings, but use a <lb/>
              mere obscure and deceitful sketch of them. But when on the <lb/>
              other hand any one attempts to represent our bodies, we <lb/>
              quickly perceive any omissions, through our familiar appre­ <lb/>
              hension of them, and become severe critics on any one who <lb/>
              does not perfectly exhibit their resemblances. The same also <lb/>
              we see, to be the case in arguments,-that we are content with <lb/>
              even slightly resembling statements about heavenly and divine <lb/>
              things, while we accurately examine things mortal and <lb/>
              human. As regards then what we are now immediately <lb/>
              saying, if we cannot fully exhibit what is desired, you ought <lb/>
              to forgive us, because you must reflect that to form ap­ <lb/>
              proved resemblances of mortal things is no easy task, but very <lb/>
              difficult. Now I have said all this, Socrates, wishing to re­ <lb/>
              mind you of these things, and asking not for less, but more <lb/>
              indulgence respecting what is about to be said. If then I seem <lb/>
              to be fairly asking the favour, grant it with all cheerfulness.</p>
          <p>SECT. II.—SOCR. Why should we hesitate to grant it, <lb/>
            Critias ?-And besides, we must grant this same indulgence <lb/>
            to our third friend, Hermocrates:—for it is evident, as we <lb/>
            shall see presently, that when he has to speak, he will make <lb/>
            the same request as you. That he then may furnish with a <lb/>
            different commencement and not be compelled to say the <lb/>
            same, let him at once speak, as if this indulgence were <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐράνις</foreign>, which Stallbaum has adopted on Cornarius's conjecture, <lb/>
            instead of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθώπινα</foreign>, the readings both of the editions and MSS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            granted him. I must inform you, however, of the sense of <lb/>
            the audience,* that the former poet [Timæus] has obtained a <lb/>
            wonderful deal of applause;—so that you will need a vast <lb/>
            quantity of indulgence if you intend to be an able successor <lb/>
            to him.</p>
          <p>HERM. You are making the same announcement to me, <lb/>
            Socrates, as to him. Faint-hearted men, however, never yet <lb/>
            erected a trophy, Critias :-so you must proceed manfully to <lb/>
            your discourse, and, invoking Paean and the Muses, exhibit <lb/>
            and celebrate these primitive and best of citizens.</p>
          <p>CRIT. Ah, friend Hermocrates, you are to speak after­ <lb/>
            wards t and have another before you ;-and so you are vastly <lb/>
            courageous. What the nature of the task is, however, the fact <lb/>
            itself will speedily declare :-and we will therefore be per­ <lb/>
            suaded by your encouragement and exhortation, and in <lb/>
            addition to the gods that you have mentioned, will call on <lb/>
            others besides, and most of all on Memory: for all the <lb/>
            most important points of our discourse concern that goddess, <lb/>
            —inasmuch as it is by suitably calling to mind and relating <lb/>
            the narratives of the [Egyptian] priests brought hither by <lb/>
            Solon, that I feel satisfied of our being thought by this <lb/>
            auditory to have fairly accomplished our part. This therefore <lb/>
            we must now do, and without further delay.</p>
          <p>SECT. III.—First of all then let us recollect, that it is <lb/>
            about nine thousand years, since war was proclaimed between <lb/>
            those dwelling outside the Pillars of Hercules and all those <lb/>
            within them,-which war we must now describe. Of the <lb/>
            latter party, then, this city was the leader, and conducted the <lb/>
            whole war; and of the former the kings of the Atlantic <lb/>
            Island, which we said was once larger than Libya and Asia, <lb/>
            but now, sunk by earthquakes, a mass of impervious mud, ‡ <lb/>
            which hinders all those sailing on the vast sea from effecting <lb/>
            a passage hither;—and then our story will, as it were, unfold <lb/>
            [to your view] the many barbarous tribes, and such of the <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν</foreign> rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεάτρου διανοίαν</foreign>. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέατρον</foreign> is frequently <lb/>
            used to mean the audience only. This was no doubt unknown to those <lb/>
            critics, who very unnecessarily conjectured from the use of this term, that <lb/>
            Critias had brought out scenic representations. </note><note type="footnote"> t The old editions read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑστεραίας</foreign>; but Bekker and Stallbaum have <lb/>

            Greek nations as then existed, as each may happen to pre­ <lb/>
            sent itself:—but the wars of the then Athenians and their <lb/>
            adversaries we must first describe, as well as the power and <lb/>
            government of each. Of these [our own] people, however, we <lb/>
            must be anxious first to speak.</p>
          <p>SECT. IV.—To the gods was once locally allotted the whole <lb/>
            earth, and that, too, without contention;—for it would not <lb/>
            be reasonable to suppose that the gods are ignorant of what <lb/>
            suits each of themselves, or that, fully aware of what is rather <lb/>
            the property of others, they would try to get possession of it <lb/>
            through strife. Obtaining then a country agreeable to them <lb/>
            by just allotment, they chose these regions for their habitation ; <lb/>
            and, after settling, they like shepherds reared us, as their <lb/>
            possessions, flocks and herds,-not however by forcing body <lb/>
            against body, as shepherds in grazing drive their cattle with <lb/>
            blows; but [they treated us] as an easily-governed animal, <lb/>
            and piloting, as it were, with persuasions for a rudder, and <lb/>
            working on the soul, they governed the entire mortal by <lb/>
            leading him according to their own mind. Different gods, <lb/>
            therefore, having received by lot different regions, proceeded <lb/>
            to cultivate (or set in order) those [that they had received <lb/>
            -but Hephæstus and Athéné having a common nature, not <lb/>
            only related by brotherhood from having the same father, <lb/>
            but united also in philosophy and love of art,* both received <lb/>
            this one region as their common allotment, as being naturally <lb/>
            familiar with and well adapted to virtue and wisdom; and <lb/>
            after producing worthy men,—natives of the soil (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόχθονες</foreign>), <lb/>
            arranged to their mind the order of their government :-of <lb/>
            which men, indeed, the names are preserved; though their deeds <lb/>
            have become extinct through the death of those that handed <lb/>
            them down and the long lapse of time. The race, indeed, <lb/>
            that survived, as it has been before observed, were a set of <lb/>
            unlettered mountaineers, who had heard the names only of the <lb/>
            ruling people in the land, and very little about their deeds. <lb/>
            The names they out of affection gave to their children, though <lb/>
            unacquainted with the virtues and laws of those before them, <lb/>
            except through certain dark rumours concerning them; and <lb/>
            being themselves and their children for many generations in <lb/>
            want of necessaries, with which, with all their wit, they were <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτεχνίᾳ</foreign>. The old editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτεκνίᾳ</foreign>, which is an <lb/>

            unprovided, they bestowed their chief attention on this, to the <lb/>
            neglect of events that had taken place in times long gone by : <lb/>
            -for mythology and the inquiry into ancient affairs both visit <lb/>
            states at a t'me of leisure, when they see that the necessaries <lb/>
            of life have been procured, but not before. In this way, then, <lb/>
            the names of the ancients have been preserved without their <lb/>
            deeds -and I infer this to be the case, as Solon said, that the <lb/>
            priests in describing the war then waged gave those engaged in <lb/>
            them many names-such as Cecrops, Erectheus, Ericthonius, <lb/>
            Erysichthon, and most of the other names which are recorded <lb/>
            prior to the time of Theseus;—and they gave the names of <lb/>
            women likewise. Besides, the figure and image of the goddess <lb/>
            shows that at that time both men and women entered in com­ <lb/>
            mon on the pursuits of war; as in compliance with that custom <lb/>
            an armed statue was dedicated to the goddess by the people of <lb/>
            that day,-a proof that all animals that consort together, <lb/>
            females as well as males, have a natural ability to pursue in <lb/>
            common every suitable virtue.</p>
          <p>SECT. V.—At that time, indeed, there dwelt in this <lb/>
            country many other tribes of citizens engaged in crafts and <lb/>
            the culture of the soil; but the warrior-tribe, being set <lb/>
            apart from the first by divine men, lived separately, having <lb/>
            all the requisites for food and training, none of them possess­ <lb/>
            ing anything in private, but considering all their possessions <lb/>
            as common, and not deigning to receive anything from the <lb/>
            rest of the citizens beyond a sufficiency of food, occupying <lb/>
            themselves moreover in all the pursuits that we yesterday <lb/>
            described as those of appointed state-guardians. Moreover, <lb/>
            as respects this country of ours, it was stated with probability <lb/>
            and truth, that in early times it had boundaries fixed at the <lb/>
            Isthmus and on the side of the other continent as far as the <lb/>
            heights of Cithæron and Parnes, these boundaries coming <lb/>
            down, with Oropia on the right, and with the Asopus as a <lb/>
            seaward limit on the left :-and by the valour of this region <lb/>
            it was said that the whole earth was vanquished, because it <lb/>
            was then able to support the numerous army raised from the <lb/>
            surrounding people. A great proof of their virtue also was <lb/>
            this,-that what now remains of it may vie with any other <lb/>
            whatever in the general productiveness of the soil, in the <lb/>
            excellence of its fruits, and in pastures suited to every kind <lb/>
            of animals. Then, however, it produced all these not only <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            excellent in quality, but in the greatest possible abundance. <lb/>
            How then can we believe this ;-and in what way can it <lb/>
            [the present country] rightly be termed a remnant of the <lb/>
            former land ? The whole from the other continent [i. e. the <lb/>
            western side] extends seaward like a long promontory, and <lb/>
            is wholly surrounded by the steep-shored basin of the sea. <lb/>
            As therefore many and extensive deluges happened in that <lb/>
            period of nine thousand years,-for so many years have <lb/>
            elapsed from that to the present time,-the earth, that was <lb/>
            loosened and fell from the heights at these times and under <lb/>
            these circumstances, did not, as elsewhere, aggregate to form <lb/>
            any elevation worth mentioning, but ever eddying round, at <lb/>
            length vanished in the deep; and the heights have been left, <lb/>
            as is the case in small islands, like the bones of a diseased <lb/>
            body, compared with those of former times, all the earth that <lb/>
            was soft and fat being washed away, leaving only a thin body <lb/>
            of soil. At that time, however, being undisturbed, it comprised <lb/>
            mountains which are now only high hills; and the country, <lb/>
            now termed the plains of Phelleus, was then full of fat earth. <lb/>
            The mountains also abounded with woods, of which even <lb/>
            now there are evident signs :-for there are some of the <lb/>
            mountains, which now furnish food for bees only, though at <lb/>
            no very distant period the houses were still standing, and in <lb/>
            good preservation, that were constructed of the timber cut <lb/>
            from the trees thereon, and suitable for the largest buildings. <lb/>
            There were many lofty trees also, raised by cultivation <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥμερα</foreign>), and an incalculable amount of pasture for cattle. <lb/>
            Prolific rain especially this land yearly enjoyed, not, as now, <lb/>
            losing it by its quick passage over the bare earth down to <lb/>
            the sea; but received an abundance of it, which it could <lb/>
            keep within itself to dispense over the clayey soil which holds <lb/>
            it :-and thus sending down the absorbed water from the <lb/>
            heights into the hollows, it diffused over all these regions <lb/>
            abundant streams of springs and rivers,-the truth of which is <lb/>
            even now attested by the sacred remains observable in the <lb/>
            ancient fountains.*</p>
          <p>SECT. VI.—Such was once the natural state of this coun­ <note type="footnote"> * This is an extremely involved and most probably a corrupt passage. <lb/>
            We have nearly followed Stallbaum's interpretation ; though it was ab­ <lb/>

            try;—and it was cultivated, as it was likely it would be, by <lb/>
            real husbandmen, actually practising their calling-lovers of <lb/>
            honour and generous-minded, having a most excellent soil, <lb/>
            great abundance of water, and an admirably attempered <lb/>
            climate. It was at this time that the city was founded here <lb/>
            as follows :-The form of the Acropolis was not then, as it <lb/>
            is now;-for in later times [lit. now] a single rainy night <lb/>
            softened it, and to a great degree bared it of soil,-there <lb/>
            being earthquakes at the same time, and a fatal deluge-the <lb/>
            third before that of Deucalion. Before this, in primitive <lb/>
            times, it extended in size to the Eridanus* and Ilissus, and <lb/>
            comprised the Pnyx, having the Lycabetus as its limit oppo­ <lb/>
            site the Pnyx,—the whole being well covered with soil, <lb/>
            except some level spots in the higher part. Its outer parts <lb/>
            down the flanks were inhabited by craftsmen and husband­ <lb/>
            men who tilled the neighbouring land,-the warrior-classes <lb/>
            living separately by themselves in the more elevated parts <lb/>
            around the temple of Athéné and Hephæstus, which they <lb/>
            had formed, as it were, into the garden of a single dwell­ <lb/>
            ing by encircling it with one enclosure :-for on the northern <lb/>
            side lived those, who erected public buildings and common <lb/>
            banquets for the winter, and whatever else was suited to a <lb/>
            common polity, buildings as well as temples being unadorned <lb/>
            with gold or silver; (for they never at any time used these <lb/>
            metals, but pursuing a middle course between extravagance <lb/>
            and meanness, built neat dwellings, in which both they and <lb/>
            their children's children grew old, and then left them to <lb/>
            others like themselves,)—while as regards the south side, <lb/>
            they removed thither their gardens, gymnasia, and common <lb/>
            rooms of entertainment, which they fixed here during the <lb/>
            summer. There was also one single fountain on the spot now <lb/>
            occupied by the Acropolis, since the extinction of which by <lb/>
            earthquakes only a few small streams have been left round <lb/>
            it; although at that time it furnished to every part an <lb/>
            abundant supply of water, well attempered both for winter <lb/>
            and summer. Such was the way of life pursued by the <lb/>
            guardians of their own state, who also were leaders of the <lb/>
            rest of the Greeks-such at least as required them; and as <lb/>
            to their number they paid special attention, that they should <note type="footnote"> * The Eridanus here mentioned was in Attica :-it is not the Eridanus <lb/>

            always have the same number of men and women that might <lb/>
            both then and in future* be able to serve in war,—the whole <lb/>
            being about twenty thousand. These men then, being per­ <lb/>
            sonally such as I have described, and ever in some such way <lb/>
            justly administering both their own affairs and those of Greece, <lb/>
            were the most noted and renowned of all the people of that day <lb/>
            over all Europe and Asia, both for the beauty of their bodies <lb/>
            and the general virtue of their souls.</p>
          <p>SECT. VII.—In the next place then, as respects the adver­ <lb/>
            saries of these men, what was their character, and how they <lb/>
            first arose, we will now impart this in common to you our <lb/>
            friends, if at least we have not lost the recollection of what <lb/>
            we heard in our childhood. Yet before we narrate this, we <lb/>
            must briefly warn you not to be surprised at hearing Hellenic <lb/>
            names given to barbarians :-and the cause of this you shall <lb/>
            now hear. Solon, intending to make use of this story in his <lb/>
            poetry, made an investigation into the power of names, and <lb/>
            found that the early Egyptians who committed these facts <lb/>
            to writing transferred these names into their own language; <lb/>
            and he again receiving the meaning of each name, introduced <lb/>
            it by writing into our language. These very writings, indeed, <lb/>
            were in the possession of my grandfather, and are now in <lb/>
            mine, having been made the subject of much study during my <lb/>
            boyhood. If therefore you hear such names as these in this <lb/>
            narrative, be not surprised ;-for you know the reason. Of <lb/>
            a long story, then, let such be the introduction.</p>
          <p>SECT. VIII.—As we remarked at first concerning the allot­ <lb/>
            ment of the gods, that they distributed the whole earth here <lb/>
            into larger and there into smaller portions, t procuring for <lb/>
            themselves temples and public sacrifices,—so, Poseidon in par­ <lb/>
            ticular, taking as his lot the Atlantic island, begot children <lb/>
            by a mortal woman, and settled in some such spot of the <lb/>
            island as we are about to describe. Towards the sea, but in <lb/>
            the centre of the whole island, was a plain, which is said to <lb/>
            have been the fairest of all plains, and distinguished for the <lb/>
            excellence [of its soil]. Near this plain, and at its centre, <lb/>
            about fifty stadia distant, was a mountain with short accli­ <note type="footnote"> * Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥδη</foreign> fat TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι</foreign>.

            vities on every side. On this dwelt one of those men who <lb/>
            in primitive times sprang from the earth, by name Evenor, <lb/>
            who lived with a wife, Leucippe; and they had an only <lb/>
            daughter, Clito. Now when this girl arrived at marriage­ <lb/>
            able age, and her mother and father were dead, Poseidon <lb/>
            becoming enamoured, made her his mistress, and circularly <lb/>
            enclosed the hill on which she dwelt, forming the sea and <lb/>
            land into alternate zones, greater and less,-turning, as <lb/>
            it were, two out of land and three out of sea, from the <lb/>
            centre of the island, all equally distant, so as to be inacces­ <lb/>
            sible to men :-for at that time ships and navigation were <lb/>
            not known. And he himself, with his divine power, agreeably <lb/>
            adorned the centre of the island, causing two fountains of <lb/>
            water to shoot upwards from beneath the earth, one cold and <lb/>
            the other hot, and making every variety of food to spring <lb/>
            abundantly from the earth. He also begat and brought up <lb/>
            five twin-male children ; and after distributing all the Atlantic <lb/>
            island into ten parts, he bestowed on the first-born of the <lb/>
            eldest pair his mother's dwelling and the allotment about it,­ <lb/>
            this being the largest and best; and he appointed him king <lb/>
            of all the rest, making the others governors, and giving to <lb/>
            each the dominion over many people and an extensive terri­ <lb/>
            tory. He likewise gave all of them names,-to the eldest, <lb/>
            who was the king, the name of Atlas, from whom, as the <lb/>
            first sovereign, both the island and sea were termed aAtlantic;— <lb/>
            and to the twin born after him, who had received for his share <lb/>
            the extreme parts of the island towards the Pillars of Her­ <lb/>
            cules, as far as the region which now in that country is called <lb/>
            Gadeirica, he gave the titular name, which we Greeks call <lb/>
            Eumelus, but which the people of that country term Gadeirus. <lb/>
            Of the second-born twins lie called the first Ampheres, the <lb/>
            second, Euæmon ;-of the third, he called the first-born, <lb/>
            Musæus, and the second, Autochthon ;-of the fourth, the <lb/>
            first, Elasippus, and the younger, Mestor;—and among the <lb/>
            fifth, to the former was given the name Azaes, and to the <lb/>
            latter, Diaprepes.</p>
          <p>SECT. IX.—All these, then, and their descendants, dwelt for <lb/>
            many generations, as rulers in the sea of islands, and as we <lb/>
            before said, yet further extended their empire to all the <lb/>
            country as far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia. By far the most <lb/>
            distinguished, however, was the race of Atlas; and among <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            these the oldest king in succession always handed down the <lb/>
            power to his eldest son, all of them successively possessing <lb/>
            wealth in such abundance as never was before found among <lb/>
            regal dynasties, nor will easily be found hereafter; and all <lb/>
            things were provided for them, which in a city, or elsewhere, <lb/>
            are worth such provision. Many possessions, indeed, accrued <lb/>
            to them through their power from foreign countries; but <lb/>
            the greatest part of what they stood in need was provided <lb/>
            for them by the island itself,—first, such ores as are dug out <lb/>
            of mines in a solid [i.e. virgin] state, or require smelting ;­ <lb/>
            and especially that metal orichalcum, which is now known <lb/>
            only by name, but formerly of high celebrity, was dug out <lb/>
            of the earth in many parts of the island, being considered <lb/>
            the most valuable of all the metals then known, except gold ;— <lb/>
            and it produced an abundance of wood for builders, and fur­ <lb/>
            nished food also for tame and wild animals. Moreover, there <lb/>
            were comprised within it vast numbers of elephants:-for there <lb/>
            were abundant means of support for all animals that feed <lb/>
            in marshes and lakes, on mountains and plains, and so like­ <lb/>
            wise for this animal, which by nature is the largest and most <lb/>
            voracious of all. Besides these, whatever odorous plants the <lb/>
            earth now bears, whether roots or grass, or woods or distilling <lb/>
            gums, or flowers or fruits,-these it bore and produced them <lb/>
            to perfection. And yet, further, it bore cultivated fruits, and <lb/>
            dry edible fruits, such as we use for food ;—all these kinds of <lb/>
            food we call vegetables,-together with all that trees bear, as <lb/>
            drinks, meats, and ointments ; and those also, whose fruits, <lb/>
            such as acorns, being used in sport and pleasure, are with <lb/>
            difficulty hoarded up, together with certain dainty fruits for <lb/>
            dessert that might provoke the satiated palate, or please the <lb/>
            sick ;-all these that once existing and warmly-acclimated <lb/>
            island bore, sacred, beautiful, wonderful, and infinite in quan­ <lb/>
            tity. Receiving all these, then, from the earth, the inhabitants <lb/>
            employed themselves also in erecting temples, royal habita- <lb/>
            Lions, ports and docks over the whole region, disposing them <lb/>
            in the following manner :-</p>
          <p>SECT. X.—First of all, those residing about that ancient <lb/>
            metropolis bridged over those zones of the sea [before men­ <lb/>
            tioned], making a passage both outwards and to the royal <lb/>
            palace. And the palace they constructed immediately from <lb/>
            the first in this habitation of the god and their ancestors; <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            and each in turn receiving it from his predecessor, and fur­ <lb/>
            ther embellishing the ornamental parts, continually surpassed <lb/>
            the one before him, until they made the building quite <lb/>
            admirable to the sight for the size and beauty of its works. <lb/>
            They dug a trench indeed, beginning from the sea, three <lb/>
            plethra broad, a hundred feet deep, and fifty stadia in length, <lb/>
            as far as the outermost zone, and thus made a passage thither <lb/>
            from the sea, as into a harbour, by enlarging its mouth sum­ <lb/>
            ciently to admit the largest vessels. Besides this, they sepa­ <lb/>
            rated by bridges those zones of land which separated those of <lb/>
            the sea, so that with one trireme a passage could be effected <lb/>
            from one zone to another, covering the zones above, so as <lb/>
            to allow a water-way beneath them ;-for the banks of the <lb/>
            zones of earth rose to a height considerably above the sea. <lb/>
            And the greatest of these zones into which the sea penetrated <lb/>
            was three stadia in breadth, and the zone of land next in <lb/>
            order equal to the first ;-of the second pair, the watery <lb/>
            circle was two stadia in breadth, and that of earth again, <lb/>
            equal to the preceding one of water ; lastly, the zone running <lb/>
            round the centre of the island had the breadth only of <lb/>
            one stadium, and the island in which the king's palace <lb/>
            stood had a diameter of five stadia. This island, as well as <lb/>
            the zones, and the bridge (which was a plethrum in breadth), <lb/>
            they enclosed on both sides with a stone wall, raising towers <lb/>
            and gates at intervals on the bridges at the places where the <lb/>
            sea passes through them [i. e. the zones]. The stone for it <lb/>
            they quarried beneath the circuit of the island, both in the <lb/>
            centre and also within and without the zones, one kind of it <lb/>
            white, a second black, and a third red ; and by thus quarrying <lb/>
            they at the same time made cavities that served for two docks, <lb/>
            having likewise a covering of rock. Of the buildings, some <lb/>
            were of simple structure ;-others they put together in a <lb/>
            variegated style, by mixing the different kinds of stone by <lb/>
            way of amusement, thus realizing a pleasure suitable to their <lb/>
            natures :-and they surrounded with brass the whole circuit <lb/>
            of the wall round the extreme outer zone, applying it like <lb/>
            plaster; that of the next inside they covered with melted <lb/>
            tin, and the wall round the citadel itself with orichalcum that <lb/>
            has a fiery resplendence.</p>
          <p>SECT. XI.—Next, the royal palace within the citadel was <lb/>
            constructed as follows :-In its centre was planted a temple, <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            difficult of access, sacred to Clito and Poseidon, surrounded <lb/>
            with an enclosure of gold ;-and it was that, in which they <lb/>
            first generated and produced the race of the ten kings; <lb/>
            where also, making annual collections from all the ten allot­ <lb/>
            ments, they celebrated seasonable sacrifices to each. The <lb/>
            temple of Poseidon himself was a stadium in length, three <lb/>
            plethra in breadth, and of a height to correspond, having <lb/>
            something of a barbaric appearance. All the outside of the <lb/>
            temple, except the pinnacles, they lined with silver, but the <lb/>
            pinnacles with gold :-and as to the interior, the roof was <lb/>
            formed wholly of ivory variegated with gold and orichal­ <lb/>
            cum ; and as to all the parts-the walls, pillars, and pave­ <lb/>
            ments, they lined them with orichalcum. They also placed <lb/>
            in it golden statues, the god himself [being represented] as <lb/>
            standing on a chariot holding the reins of six winged horses, <lb/>
            of such size as to touch the roof with his head, and round <lb/>
            him a hundred nereids on dolphins ;-for those of that day <lb/>
            thought that such was their number; and it contained also <lb/>
            many other statues dedicated to private individuals. Round <lb/>
            the outside of the temple likewise golden images were placed <lb/>
            of all the men and women that were descended from the <lb/>
            ten kings, and many other large statues both of kings and <lb/>
            private people, both from the city itself, and the foreign <lb/>
            countries over which they had dominion. There was an <lb/>
            altar, too, of corresponding size and workmanship with these <lb/>
            ornaments; and the excellence of the palace was proportioned <lb/>
            to the magnitude of the government and also to the order <lb/>
            observed in the sacred ceremonies.</p>
          <p>SECT. XII.—Next, they used fountains both from the <lb/>
            cold and hot springs, of which there was a great abundance, <lb/>
            either of which was wonderfully well adapted for use from <lb/>
            its sweetness and excellence ;* and round them they fixed <lb/>
            their habitations and excellently-watered plantations, together <lb/>
            with their water-tanks, some open to the heaven, but others <lb/>
            for winter use roofed over for warm baths, the kings' baths <lb/>
            and those of private persons being apart, with separate baths <figure type="illustration">

              for women, and others for horses and other draught-cattle, <lb/>
              providing each with the requisite means of cleanliness. The <lb/>
              stream hence flowing they led to the grove of Poseidon, <lb/>
              where there were all varieties of trees, reaching a wonderful <lb/>
              height, owing to the excellence of the soil, and then con­ <lb/>
              ducted it by channels over the bridges to the external <lb/>
              circles. And here, indeed, there had been constructed nume­ <lb/>
              rous temples dedicated to many different gods, and many <lb/>
              gardens and gymnasia, one for men, and others separately <lb/>
              for horses in either island of the zones;—and for the latter, <lb/>
              in particular, there was a race-course plotted out in the <lb/>
              centre of the largest island, a stadium in breadth, and ex­ <lb/>
              tending in length through the whole circumference for a con­ <lb/>
              test of speed between the horses. And around it on all <lb/>
              sides were barracks for the household troops corresponding <lb/>
              with their number ;-to the more faithful of whom were <lb/>
              assigned quarters in the smaller zone closer to the citadel, <lb/>
              while those who excelled all in loyal faithfulness had dwell­ <lb/>
              ings given them inside the citadel near the kings themselves. <lb/>
              The docks likewise were filled with triremes and the fittings <lb/>
              requisite for triremes ; and they were all satisfactorily pro­ <lb/>
              vided. Such were the arrangements for the provision of the <lb/>
              kings' dwelling :-but on crossing the three exterior har­ <lb/>
              bours, one was met by a wall which went completely round, <lb/>
              beginning from the sea, everywhere fifty stadia distant from <lb/>
              the greatest [ or outermost] zone and harbour, and enclosed <lb/>
              in one the entrance to the canal and the entrance to the sea. <lb/>
              The whole of this part indeed was covered with many and <lb/>
              densely-crowded dwellings ;-and the canal and largest har­ <lb/>
              bour were full of vessels and merchants coming from all <lb/>
              parts, causing from their multitude all kinds of shouting, <lb/>
              tumult, and din all day long and the night through.</p>
          <p>SECT. XIII.—We have now related from memory a <lb/>
            description of the city and its ancient habitations ; and now <lb/>
            we must try to describe the nature of the rest of the country, <lb/>
            and its mode of employment. First, then, the whole region <lb/>
            was said to be exceedingly lofty and precipitous towards the <lb/>
            sea, and the plain about the city, which encircles it, is itself <lb/>
            surrounded by mountains sloping down to the sea, being level <lb/>
            and smooth, all much extended, three thousand stadia in one <lb/>
            direction, and the central part from the sea above two <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            thousand. And this district of the whole island was turned <lb/>
            towards the south, in an opposite direction from the north. <lb/>
            The mountains around it, too, were at that time celebrated, as <lb/>
            exceeding in number, size, and beauty all those of the present <lb/>
            time,-having in them many hamlets enriched with villages, <lb/>
            as well as rivers, lakes, and marshes, furnishing ample supplies <lb/>
            of food for all cattle both tame and wild, with timber of <lb/>
            various descriptions, and in abundant quantity for every <lb/>
            individual purpose. The plain then being thus by nature, <lb/>
            was improved as follows by many kings in a long course of <lb/>
            time. It was of square shape, mostly straight and oblong; <lb/>
            and where it ended, they bounded it by a trench dug round <lb/>
            it,—the depth, breadth, and length of which, for a work of <lb/>
            man's making, besides the other connected undertakings, we <lb/>
            can scarcely believe, though still we must report what we <lb/>
            heard. It was excavated to the depth of a plethrum, and <lb/>
            the breadth was a stadium in every part,—the whole excava­ <lb/>
            tion made round the plain being ten thousand stadia in <lb/>
            length. This, receiving the streams coming down from the <lb/>
            mountains, and conducted all round the plain, approached <lb/>
            the city in some parts, and in this way was allowed to flow <lb/>
            out to the sea. From above, likewise, straight canals were <lb/>
            cut about a hundred feet broad along the plain, back into the <lb/>
            ditch near the sea, distant from one another about one hun­ <lb/>
            dred stadia :-and it was by this that they brought down the <lb/>
            timber from the mountains to the city, and carried on the <lb/>
            rest of their shipping-traffic, cutting transverse canals of com­ <lb/>
            munication into each other, and towards the city. Their <lb/>
            harvest, also, they gathered twice in the year; in winter <lb/>
            availing themselves of the rains, and in summer introducing <lb/>
            on the land the streams from the trenches.</p>
          <p>SECT. XIV.—As to the quantity [of land,] it was ordered, <lb/>
            that of the men on the plain fit for service, each individual <lb/>
            leader should have his allotment, each allotment amounting <lb/>
            in extent to a hundred stadia, and the total of the lots being <lb/>
            sixty thousand ;-and of those from the mountains and the <lb/>
            rest of the country there was said to be an incalculable num­ <lb/>
            ber of men, to all of whom, according to their dwellings and <lb/>
            villages, were assigned certain lots by their respective leaders. <lb/>
            To each leader, likewise, the task was appointed of furnishing <lb/>
            for war the sixth portion of a war-chariot (to make up a total <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            of ten thousand), two riding horses, and a two-horse car with­ <lb/>
            out a driver's seat, having a mounted charioteer to direct the <lb/>
            horses,* with another to dismount and fight at the side,-also <lb/>
            two heavy-armed soldiers, two archers, two slingers, three <lb/>
            each of light-armed men, stone-shooters and javelin-men, with <lb/>
            four sailors to make up a complement of one thousand two <lb/>
            hundred ships. Thus were the military affairs of this city <lb/>
            arranged. And as respects the nine others, there were different <lb/>
            other arrangements, which it would be tedious to narrate.</p>
          <p>SECT. XV.—And as respects official situations and honours, <lb/>
            the following were the arrangements made from the com­ <lb/>
            mencement :-Of the ten kings, each individually in his own <lb/>
            district and over his own city ruled supreme over the people <lb/>
            and the laws, constraining and punishing whomever he <lb/>
            pleased :-and the government and commonwealth in each <lb/>
            was regulated by the injunctions of Poseidon, as the law <lb/>
            handed them down; and inscriptions were made by the first <lb/>
            [kings] on a column of orichalcum, which was deposited in <lb/>
            the centre of the island in the temple of Poseidon, where <lb/>
            they assembled every fifth year, (which they afterwards <lb/>
            changed to every sixth year), taking an equal part both <lb/>
            for the entire state and its supernumeraries; and thus col­ <lb/>
            lected they consulted concerning the common weal, and <lb/>
            inquired what transgressions each had committed, judging <lb/>
            them accordingly. And when they were about to judge, <lb/>
            they previously gave each other pledges, according to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing fashion :-As there were bulls grazing at liberty in <lb/>
            the temple of Poseidon, ten men only of the whole num­ <lb/>
            ber, after invoking the god to receive their sacrifice propi­ <lb/>
            tiously, went out to hunt swordless, with staves and chains, <lb/>
            and whichever of the bulls they took, they brought it to the <lb/>
            column and slaughtered it at its head under the inscrip­ <lb/>
            tions :-and on the column, besides the laws, there was an <lb/>
            oath written, invoking curses on the disobedient. When, <lb/>
            therefore, in compliance with their laws, they sacrificed and <lb/>
            burnt all the limbs of the bull, they filled a goblet with clots <lb/>
            of blood, and threw the rest into the fire, by way of purifying <lb/>
            the column :-and after this, dipping out of the goblet with <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig89.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="428"/>
              golden cups, they poured libations down on the fire, and <lb/>
              swore to do justice according to the laws on the column, to <lb/>
              punish any one who had previously transgressed them, and <lb/>
              besides that, never afterwards willingly to transgress the <lb/>
              inscribed laws, nor ever to rule or obey any ruler governing <lb/>
              otherwise than according to his father's laws. Then after <lb/>
              invoking these curses on themselves and their descendants, <lb/>
              and after drinking and depositing the cup in the temple of the <lb/>
              Clod, and abiding a necessary time at supper, as soon as it <lb/>
              was dark, and the fire round the sacrifice had been cooled, <lb/>
              all of them dressed themselves in beautiful dark-blue robes, <lb/>
              and sitting on the ground near the embers of the sacrifice on <lb/>
              which they had sworn, extinguished during the night all <lb/>
              the fire about the temple, and then mutually judged each <lb/>
              other as respects any accusations of transgressing the laws ;— <lb/>
              and after their acts of judgment were over, when day came, <lb/>
              they inscribed their decisions on a golden tablet and depo­ <lb/>
              sited them as memorials, together with their dresses. There <lb/>
              were many other individual laws also respecting the pri­ <lb/>
              vileges of the kings,—the chief being, that they should never <lb/>
              wage war on each other, and that all should lend their aid, <lb/>
              in case that any one in any of their cities should try to <lb/>
              destroy the royal race,-consulting in common, as their an­ <lb/>
              cestors did before them, as to the right course both in war <lb/>
              and other concerns, and assigning the empire to the Atlantic <lb/>
              race. They did not allow the king, however, any authority <lb/>
              to put to death any of his kinsmen, unless approved of by <lb/>
              more than half of the ten.</p>
          <p>SECT. XVI.—Such then, and so great being the power at <lb/>
            that time in those places, the Deity transferred it to these <lb/>
            regions, as report goes, on the following pretexts :-For <lb/>
            many generations, as long as the natural power of the god <lb/>
            sufficed them, they remained obedient to the laws and kindly <lb/>
            affected towards the divine nature to which they were al­ <lb/>
            lied :-for they possessed true and altogether lofty ideas, and <lb/>
            practised mildness united with wisdom, in reference to the <lb/>
            casual occurrences of life and towards each other. Hence, <lb/>
            looking above everything except virtue, they considered things <lb/>
            present as of small importance, and contentedly bore, as a <lb/>
            burden, the mass of gold and other property; nor were they <lb/>
            deceived by the intoxication of luxury, or rendered intern­ <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            perate through wealth ;-but on the other hand being sober, <lb/>
            they acutely perceived that all these things are increased <lb/>
            through common friendship mingled with virtue, and that <lb/>
            by too anxiously pursuing and honouring them, these goods <lb/>
            themselves are corrupted, and with them [friendship] itself <lb/>
            likewise perishes. To such a mode of reasoning then, and <lb/>
            the abiding of such a nature, was it owing that they made all <lb/>
            the progress that we before described. But when the divine <lb/>
            portion within them became extinct through much and fre­ <lb/>
            quent admixture of the mortal nature, and the manners of <lb/>
            men began to hold sway, then, through inability to bear pre­ <lb/>
            sent events, they began to exhibit unbecoming conduct and <lb/>
            to the intelligent beholder appeared base, destroying the <lb/>
            fairest among their most valuable possessions,-though all <lb/>
            the while held by those who were unable to see a true life of <lb/>
            happiness based on truth, to be in the highest degree worthy <lb/>
            and blessed, though filled with avarice and unjust power. <lb/>
            Zeus, however, the god of gods, who rules according to the <lb/>
            laws, and is able to see into such things, perceiving an <lb/>
            honourable race in a condition of wretchedness, and wishing <lb/>
            to inflict punishment on them, that they might become more <lb/>
            diligent in the practice of temperance, collected all the gods <lb/>
            into their own most ancient habitation, which indeed, being <lb/>
            situated in the centre of the whole world, beholds all things <lb/>
            that have had a share in generation :-and having assembled <lb/>
            them, he said, * * * * * * <lb/>

          <p>THE difficulty of the passage here alluded to, which has baffled the <lb/>
            efforts of every critic, from Proclus and lamblichus downwards, gave <lb/>
            rise in ancient times to the trite proverb—Numeris Platonicis nihil <lb/>
            obscurius;—nor has the ingenuity of modern speculators thrown much light <lb/>
            on its obscurity. Baroccius, however, a Venetian nobleman, in 1566, gave <lb/>
            to the world with more pretence than merit, a wordy dissertation pro­ <lb/>
            fessing to solve this knotty problem. The words of Plato are—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔστι δὲ θείῳ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig90.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              part, he says that Plato is alluding to ratios of greater or less inequality,­ <lb/>
              to which respectively belong multiples and submultiples, superparticulars <lb/>
              and subsuperparticulars, &amp;c., following the language of the schoolmen. <lb/>
              Then again, as to the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτος πυθμήν</foreign> which had been variously <lb/>
              rendered by the Latin radix, propago,fundus, and solidum, he conceives <lb/>
              it to be a root or prime number, and fixes on the number seven as its <lb/>
              representative (4 + 3 = 7). Further, by the two harmonics, he supposes <lb/>
              Plato to mean the connexion between the square and the cube of TWELVE, <lb/>
              which is itself made up of seven and five (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτος πυθμὴν πεμπάδι <lb/>
              συζυγείς</foreign>),—i. e. 144 and 1728,—twelve being a number often mentioned <lb/>
              by Plato, as not only perfect, but the type of perfection,-the dodecahe. <lb/>
              dron having given origin to the sphere, and being the type of the world, <lb/>
              -as he has expressly stated in the Timseus. If this be granted, the <lb/>

              geometric or mathematical-perfect or fatal-number may be considered <lb/>
              to be the cube of 12=1728. This opinion, however, is strongly im­ <lb/>
              pugned by Schneider, who conceives it to be 216, i. e. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig91.jpg"/></figure>,—which is <lb/>
              made up of three other cubes; 27, 64, and 125, i. e. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig92.jpg"/></figure>, and <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_22_fig93.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              Others again have considered the root to be 9,—the cube-root of 729. <lb/>
              So much for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτος πυθμήν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>As to the elucidation, however, of the principal difficulties herein in­ <lb/>
            volved, we are still as far afield as ever;—nor has the united learning <lb/>
            of Schneider, Trendelenburg, Böckh, Schleiermacher, or Cousin, re­ <lb/>
            moved any obstacle to their successful solution. To state their theories <lb/>
            at length would take up much space without any adequate benefit;­ <lb/>
            and this must be our apology for substituting so short a notice for what <lb/>
            we intended to be a lengthened statement. Many details however on <lb/>
            this vexata quastio may be gathered by the patient reader from Schneider's <lb/>
            preface to vol. iii. of his edition of Plato,—Cousin’s note in his translation <lb/>
            ad locum,—and his translation of Proclus, with notes ad locum. It must <lb/>
            be confessed, however, that the question still remains open and un­ <lb/>
            solved—still, dignus vindice nodus.</p>
