          <p>THE following pages contain a literal translation of all the <lb/>
            existing works of Marcus Accius Plautus (or, as he is called <lb/>
            by Ritschel and Fleckeisen, T. Maccius Plautus), the Roman <lb/>
            Comic writer. It is believed that this version will be found <lb/>
            strictly faithful, and to convey to the English reader much of <lb/>
            that spirit which rendered the Dramas of this rugged but <lb/>
            interesting author such especial favourites with a Roman <lb/>
            audience.</p>
          <p>The text of Ritschel has been adopted in the six plays to <lb/>
            which his invaluable labours have as yet extended-the <lb/>
            Trinummus, Miles Gloriosus, Bacchides, Stichus, Pseudolus, <lb/>
            and Menæchmi. Hildyard's Edition has been used in the <lb/>
            Aulularia, with the exception of the Supplement by Codrus <lb/>
            Urceus, which has been translated from Richter'a Edition. <lb/>
            The text of Lindemann has been adopted in the Captivi; <lb/>
            in the Asinaria, that of Richter; and in the Curculio, that <lb/>
            of Fleckeisen.</p>
          <p>Some account of the Translations of Plautus which have <lb/>
            previously appeared in the English language will be prefixed <lb/>
            to the Second Volume.</p>

          </head>
          <p>CHARMIDES, a wealthy Athenian, his property having been much diminished <lb/>
            by the reckless conduct of his son, goes abroad. His dissolute son, Lesbonicus. <lb/>
            being left behind at Athens, consumes the little resources left him, and then <lb/>
            puts up his father's house for sale. At his departure, Charmides has entrusted <lb/>
            his interests and the care of his son and daughter to his friend Collides, and <lb/>
            has also informed him that in his house there is a treasure buried as a re­ <lb/>
            serve against future contingencies. In order that this may not be lost, <lb/>
            Callicles buys the house of Lesbonicus for a small sum. Ignorant of his <lb/>
            reason for doing so, his fellow-citizens censure him for his conduct, and <lb/>
            accuse him of a breach of good faith in ministering to the extravagance of <lb/>
            Lesbonicus by supplying him with money. For this reason Megaronides ex­ <lb/>
            postulates with his friend Callicles, and greatly censures him; on which, <lb/>
            Callicles, in self-defence, entrusts him with the secret of the treasure. Char­ <lb/>
            mides having left behind him a grown-up daughter in the care of Callicles, <lb/>
            Lysiteles, a young man of rank and character, falls in love with her, and <lb/>
            through his father, Philto, asks her in marriage. Her brother, Lesbonicus, is <lb/>
            not averse to the match, but refuses to let her marry without giving her a <lb/>
            portion; and he offers her to Lysiteles, on condition that he will receive as <lb/>
            her marriage-portion a piece of land near the city, the sole remnant of his for­ <lb/>
            tune. This, however, Lysiteles refuses to accept. In the mean time, Callicles, at <lb/>
            the suggestion of Megaronides, determines to give the young woman a dowry <lb/>
            out of the treasure buried in the house which he has bought; but that Les­ <lb/>
            bonicus may not suspect whence the money really comes, a Sharper is hired, <lb/>
            with instructions to pretend that he brings letters from Charmides with a <lb/>
            thousand gold pieces as a portion for his daughter when she should marry. <lb/>
            It happens, that while the Sharper is on his way with his pretended errand to <lb/>
            the abode of Callicles, Charmides, having unexpectedly returned to Athens, <lb/>
            is going towards his house. He meets the Sharper, who discloses his errand <lb/>
            and attempts to impose upon Charmides, who thereupon discovers himself. <lb/>
            Charmides then meets his servant Stasimus, who tells him of the purchase <lb/>
            of his house by Callicles, whereon he conceives himself to have been betrayed <lb/>
            by his friend. Afterwards, on discovering the truth, he praises the fidelity <lb/>
            of Callicles, and bestows his daughter on Lysiteles, with a portion of a <lb/>
            thousand gold pieces, and, at the intercession of Lysiteles, he forgives his son <lb/>
            Lesbonicus, and informs him that lie is to be married to the daughter of Cal­ <lb/>

            and Callicles makes purchase of it. His sister, a maiden ( Virgo) without a <lb/>
            dowry, is asked in marriage. That in a less degree (Minus), with censure, <lb/>
            Callicles may bestow on her a dowry, he commissions one (Mandat) to say <lb/>
            that lie has brought the gold from her father. When (Ut) the Counterfeit has <lb/>
            reached the house, the old man (Senex), Charmides, as he has just returned, <lb/>
            disappoints him; his children then are married.</p>

          <p>Lux. (to the AUDIENCE). Now, that no one of you may <lb/>
            be mistaken, in a few words I will conduct you into the right <lb/>
            path, if, indeed, you promise to listen to me. First, then, I <lb/>
            will now tell you who I am, and who she is who has gone in <lb/>
            here (pointing to the house), if you give your attention. In <note type="footnote"> 1 The Prologue) This Prologue is one of the few figurative ones to be found in <lb/>
            the Comedies of Plautus. He appropriately represents Luxury as introducing <lb/>
            her daughter Poverty to the abode of the dissipated Lesbonicus. Claudian has <lb/>
            a somewhat similar passage in his poem to Rufinus: <lb/>
            Et Luxus, populator opum, cui, semper adhærens, <lb/>
            Infelix: humili gressu comitatur Egestas.. <lb/>
            " And Luxury, the waster of wealth, whom, ever attending, wretched Poverty ac­ <lb/>
            companies with humble step." It has been justly observed, that Plautus her, <lb/>
            voids a fault which he often falls into, of acquainting the audience with tw <lb/>
            much of the plot. </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act 1. </note> <lb/>
            the first place, Plautus has given me the name of Luxury, and <lb/>
            then he has willed that this Poverty should be my daughter. <lb/>
            But why, at my suggestion, she has just entered here, listen <lb/>
            and give attentive ear while I inform you. There is a certain <lb/>
            young man who is living in this house; by my assistance he <lb/>
            has squandered away his paternal estate. Since I see that <lb/>
            there is nothing left for him to support me, I have given him <lb/>
            ray daughter, together with whom to pass his life. But ex­ <lb/>
            pect nothing about the plot of this play: the old men who <lb/>
            will come hither will disclose the matter to you. The name <lb/>
            of this play in the Greek is " The Treasure" [Thesaurus] ; <lb/>
            Philemon wrote itl: Plautus translated it into Latin2, and <lb/>
            gave it the name of" The Three Pieces of Money" [Trinum­ <lb/>
            mus]. Now, be begs this of you, that it may be allowed the <lb/>
            play to keep that name. Thus much have I to say. Fare. <lb/>

          <p>MEG. To reprove one's friend for a fault that de­ <lb/>
            serves it, is a thankless task; but sometimes 'tis useful and <lb/>
            'tis profitable. Therefore, this day will I soundly reprove <lb/>
            my friend for a fault that much deserves it. Unwilling am <lb/>
            I, did not my friendship bid me do it. For this faultiness <lb/>
            has encroached too much upon good morals, so drooping now <lb/>
            are nearly all of them. But while they are in this distempered <lb/>
            state, bad morals, in the mean time, have sprung up most <lb/>
            plenteously, like well-watered plants ; nor is there now any­ <lb/>
            thing abundant here but these same bad morals. Of them <lb/>
            you may now reap a most plenteous harvest: and here a set <lb/>
            of men are making the favour of a few of much more value <lb/>
            than that in which they may benefit the many. Thus private <lb/>
            interests outdo that which is to the public advantage-interests <lb/>
            which in many points are a hindrance, and a nuisance, and <lb/>
            cause an obstruction both to private and to public welfare. <note type="footnote"> 1 Philemon wrote it)—Ver.19. Not only Philemon, but Menander also, wrote <lb/>
            a play, entitled the " Treasure." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In Latin)-Ver. 19. " Barbare." We learn from Festus, and other authois, <lb/>
            that the Greeks were in the habit of calling all nations, without exception, but <lb/>
            themselves, "barbarians." Hence the present expression, which literally means <lb/>
            into barbarous language." </note> <pb n="5"/>

            hold Gods, or tutelary Deities of each family. The figures of them were kept, <lb/>
            among the Romans, near the hearth, in the Lararium," which was a recess <lb/>
            formed for that purpose, and in which prayers were offered up on rising in the <lb/>
            morning. There were both public and private Lares. The latter were by some <lb/>
            thought to have been identical with the " Manes," or " shades,'' of the ancestors <lb/>
            of the family occupying the house. The public Lares were the " Urbani," pre­ <lb/>
            siding over the cities; " Rustici," over the country; " Compitales," over cross- <lb/>
            roads; and " Marini," over the sea. Varro tells us that there were 263 stations <lb/>
            for the statues of the Lares at the corner of the streets of Rome. " Lar" was an <lb/>
            Etrurian word, signifying " noble," or "lord." The Greeks adorned their house­ <lb/>
            hold Gods with the leaves of the plane-tree, the Romans with ears of corn. This <lb/>

            dramatic precision; though the plot of the play is derived from the Greek, and <lb/>
            the scene laid at Athens, he makes frequent reference to Roman localities and <lb/>
            manners. It is probable that the expression here employed was proverbial at <lb/>
            Rome, to signify a deed of daring and unscrupulous character. From ancient <lb/>
            writers we learn that there was a statue of Jupiter seated in a chariot, placed on <lb/>
            the roof of the Capitoline Temple. Tarquinius Priscus employed Etrurian artists <lb/>
            to make a statue of pottery for this purpose; and the original chariot, with its <lb/>
            four horses, was made of baked clay. In later and more opulent times, the crown <lb/>
            placed on the statue was of great value, so much so as to act as a temptation <lb/>
            to one Petilius, who attempted to steal it, and being caught in the fact, was after­ <lb/>

            their ranks together with them; who have been the swallower <lb/>
            of the false tales of those who pretend that they know every­ <lb/>
            thing, and yet know nothing. They know,forsooth, what each <lb/>
            person either has in his mind, or is likely to have ; they know <lb/>
            what the king whispered in the ear of the queen ; they know <lb/>
            what Juno talked about in conversation with Jupiter; that <lb/>
            which neither is nor is likely to be, do these fellows know. <lb/>
            Whether they praise or dispraise any one they please, falsely <lb/>
            or truly, they care not a straw, so they know that which they <note type="footnote"> 1 The back part)- Ver. 194. " Posticulum" probably means detached buildings <lb/>

            cum" or " posticula," the " back door" or " garden-gate." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Call Busybodies)—Ver. 202. The word " Scurra," which is here rendered <lb/>
            "busybody," originally meant " a fellow-townsman," well to do in life, and a <lb/>
            pleasant companion. In time, however, the word came to have a bad signification <lb/>
            attached to it, and to mean an idle fellow, who did nothing but go about cracking <lb/>
            his jokes at the expense of others, gossiping, and mischief-making, and at last to <lb/>
            signify " a clown," " buffoon," or "mimic" on the stage. These men are most <lb/>
            probably termed here " assidui," " everlasting gossipers,"from a habit which many <lb/>
            people have of making frequent calls on their neighbours, sitting down, and never <lb/>
            thinking of taking their departure till they have exhausted all their stock of evil­ <lb/>
            speaking, lying, and slandering. Gossiping was notoriously the propensity of the <lb/>
            Athenians. Numbers did nothing but saunter about the city, and go from spot <lb/>
            to spot, with the question <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι καινου</foreign>, " Any news ?" Few will fail to remem­ <lb/>
            ber r the censure of them in the Seventeenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, <lb/>
            v. 21: .. For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time <unclear/> <lb/>
            nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing." </note> <pb n="13"/>

            this Callicles was unworthy of this state, and, himself, to <lb/>
            exist, who had despoiled this young man of his property. <lb/>
            From the reports of these tale-bearers, in my ignorance I <lb/>
            rushed forward to rebuke my guiltless friend. But if the <lb/>
            authority was always required from the foundation, upon <lb/>
            which they speak of anything they have heard, unless that <lb/>
            clearly appeared, the matter ought to be to the peril and <lb/>
            loss of the tale-bearer. If this were so, it would be for the <lb/>
            public benefit. I would cause those to be but few, who <lb/>
            know that which they do not know1, and I would make them <lb/>
            have their silly chattering more restricted. (Exit.</p>

          <p>LYS. I am revolving many things in my mind at once, <lb/>
            and much uneasiness do I find in thinking upon them. I <lb/>
            tease, and fret, and wear myself out; a mind that enjoins a <lb/>
            hard task2 is now my master. But this thing is not clear to <lb/>
            me, nor has it been enough studied by me, which pursuit of <lb/>
            these two I should rather follow for myself; which of the <lb/>
            two I should think of the greater stability for passing my life <lb/>
            therein : whether it were preferable for me to devote myself <lb/>
            to love or to aggrandisement; in which alternative there is <lb/>
            more enjoyment of life in passing one's days. On this point <lb/>
            I am not fully satisfied. But this I think I'll do, that I may <lb/>
            weigh both the points together, I must be both judge and <lb/>
            culprit in this trial: I'll do so—I like it much. First of all, <lb/>
            I will enlarge upon the pursuits of love, how they conduce <lb/>
            to one's welfare. Love never expects any but the willing man <lb/>
            to throw himself in his toils; these he seeks for, these he <lb/>
            follows up, and craftily counsels against their interests. HE <lb/>
            is a fawning flatterer, a rapacious grappler3, a deceiver, a <note type="footnote"> <unclear>1</unclear> They do not know)-Ver. 221. That is, " who only pretend to know." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That enjoins a hard task)—Ver. 226. " Exercitor" means the “ instructor ” <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> Act II </note> <lb/>
            sweet-tooth, a spoiler, a corrupter of men who court retire­ <lb/>
            ment, a pryer into secrets. For he that is in love, soon as <lb/>
            ever he has been smitten with the kisses of the object that <lb/>
            he loves, forthwith his substance vanishes out of doors and <lb/>
            melts away. " Give me this thing1, my honey, if you love me, <lb/>
            if you possibly can." And then this gudgeon says: " 0 apple <lb/>
            of my eye, be it so: both that shall be given you, and still <lb/>
            more, if you wish it to be given." Then does she strike while <lb/>
            he is wavering2; and now she begs for more. Not enough <lb/>
            is this evil, unless there is still something more-what to <lb/>
            eat, what to drink. A thing that creates3 afurther expense, <lb/>
            the favour of a night is granted; a whole family is then <lb/>
            introduced for her—a wardrobe-woman4, a perfume-keeper5, <lb/>

            sidious approaches, and the difficulty which his victims have in shaking him off </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Give me this thing)—Ver. 244. This is supposed to be pronounced in a <lb/>

            Lindemann seems to think that there is a play upon the word “ pendentem," <lb/>
            which would apply either to the slave, who, according to the barbarous custom of <lb/>
            the Romans, was lashed as he hung from the hook to which he was fastened by <lb/>
            the hands, or to the lover who is hesitating between assent and refusal; on <lb/>
            which she, by her artfulness—" ferit.”-“ strikes the decisive blow." Terence has <lb/>
            the expression “ ferior munere," “ to strike with a present." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A thing that creates)—Ver. 250. This passage is here read with a period after <lb/>
            “ comest," and not after " sumpti,” as Ritschel's edition has it. This seems more <lb/>
            agreeable to the sense of the passage, which is, however, probably in a corrupt <lb/>
            state. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Wardrobe-woman)—Ver. 252. The duty of the “ vestiplica” would be to fold <lb/>
            up and try the clothes of her mistress. These slaves were also called “ vestispicæ,” <lb/>
            and servants “ a veste,” </note><note type="footnote"> 5 A perfume-keeper)—Ver. 252. The " unctor " was probably a male slave, <lb/>
            whose duty it was to procure and keep the perfumes and unguents for his <lb/>
            mistress. </note><note type="footnote"> 6Fan-bearers)—Ver. 252. Both male and female slaves, and eunuchs, were <lb/>
            employed to fan their mistresses. The fans were of elegant form and beautiful <lb/>
            colours, and were frequently made of peacocks' feathers, being of a stiff shape, <lb/>
            and not pliable, like ours. They were used both for the purpose of cooling the air <lb/>
            and driving away flies and gnats. </note><note type="footnote"> 7Sandal-bearers)—Ver. 252. The sandal was often one of the most costly <lb/>
            articles of the female dress, being much adorned with embroidery and gold. <lb/>
            Originally it was worn by both sexes, and consisted of a wooden sole, fastened with </note> <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. I. </note> <lb/>
            keepersl, messengers, news-carriers, so many wasters of his <lb/>
            bread and substance. The lover himself, while to them he <lb/>
            is complaisant, becomes a beggar. When I revolve these <lb/>
            things in my mind, and when I reflect how little one is valued <lb/>
            when he is in need; away with you, Love—I like you not <lb/>
            -no converse do I hold with you. Although 'tis sweet to <lb/>
            feast and to carouse, Love still gives bitters enough to be <lb/>
            distasteful. He avoids the Courts2 of justice, he drives <lb/>
            away your relations, and drives yourself away from your own <lb/>
            contemplation. Nor do men wish that he should be called <lb/>
            their friend. In a thousand ways is Love to be held a stranger, <lb/>
            to be kept at a distance, and to be wholly abstained from. <lb/>
            For he who plunges into love, perishes more dreadfully than <lb/>
            if he leapt from a rock. Away with you, Love, if you please ; <lb/>
            keep your owns property to yourself. Love, never be you <lb/>
            a friend of mine ; some there are, however, whom, in their <lb/>
            misery, you may keep miserable and wretched-those whom <lb/>
            you have easily rendered submissive to yourself. My fixed <lb/>
            determination is to apply my mind to my advancement in life, <lb/>
            although, in that, great labour is undergone by the mind. <lb/>
            Good men wish these things for themselves, gain, credit, and <lb/>
            honour, glory, and esteem; these are the rewards of the up­ <lb/>
            right. It delights me, then, the more, to live together with the <lb/>

            take charge of sandals. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 Casket-Keepers)—Ver. 253. The " cistellatrix” probably had charge of the <lb/>
            jewel casket of her mistress. The present passage shows in what affluence and <lb/>
            splendour some of the courtesans lived in those days. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Avoids the Courts)—Ver. 261. Shakspeare has a somewhat similar passage <lb/>
            in Romeo and Juliet: <lb/>
            " But all so soon as the all-cheering sun <lb/>
            Should in the furthest East begin to draw <lb/>
            The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, <lb/>
            Away from light steals home my heavy son, <lb/>
            And private in his chamber pens himself, <lb/>
            Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, <lb/>
            And makes himself an artificial night." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Keep your own)—Ver. 266. This is as much as to say, " I divorce myself <lb/>
            from you, and utterly repudiate you." The words " tuas res tibi habeto" were <lb/>
            the formula solemnly pronounced among the Romans by the husband in cases <lb/>
            of divorce, when he delivered back to the wife her own separate pnperty. </note> <pb n="16"/>

            verse with profligate men, either in the street or in the <lb/>
            Forum. I know this age-what its manners are. The bad <lb/>
            man wishes the good man to be bad, that he may be like <lb/>
            himself. The wicked, the. rapacious, the covetous, and the <lb/>
            envious, disorder and confound the morals of the age: a crew <lb/>
            gaping for gain, they hold the sacred thing as profane-the <lb/>
            public advantage as the private emolument. At these things <lb/>
            do I grieve, these are the matters that torment me. These <lb/>
            things am I constantly repeating both day and night, that <lb/>
            you may use due precaution against them. They only deem <lb/>
            it right to keep their hands off that which they cannot touch <lb/>
            with their hands ; as to the rest, seize it, carry it off, keep <lb/>
            it, be off and go hide, that is the word with them. These <lb/>
            things, when I behold them, draw tears from me, because I <lb/>
            have survived to see such a race of men. Why have I not <lb/>
            rather descended to the dead1 ere this ? For these men praise <lb/>
            the manners of our ancestors, and defile those same persons <lb/>
            whom they commend. With regard, then, to these pursuits, <lb/>
            I enjoin you not to taint your disposition with them. Live <lb/>
            after my fashion, and according to the ancient manners ; <lb/>
            what I am prescribing to you, the same do you remember <lb/>
            and practise. I have no patience with these fashionable iran­ <lb/>
            ners, upsetting preconceived notions, with which good men <lb/>
            are now disgracing themselves. If you follow these my in­ <lb/>
            junctions to you, many a good maxim will take root in your <lb/>
            breast. <note type="footnote"> 1 To the dead)—Ver. 291. " Ad plures," “ to the many," signifies “ the dead, <lb/>

            rather so as his parents and his relations wish him to be-if <lb/>
            his inclination conquers that man, it is all over with him; he <lb/>

          <p>Lys. I have ever esteemed these maxims as the shield of <lb/>
            my youthful age; never to betake myself to any place where <lb/>
            vice was the order of the dayl, never to go to stroll about <lb/>

            and of my forefathers, and your own, I may say that we <lb/>
            possess much property, honestly obtained. If you do a <lb/>
            service to a friend, it ought not to make you repent that you <lb/>
            have done so; it ought rather to cause you shame if you do <lb/>
            not do it.</p>
          <p>PHIL. If from great wealth you subtract something, does <lb/>
            it become more or less ?</p>

            repeated to the niggardly citizen2 ? " That which thou hast <lb/>
            mayst thou not have, and mayst thou have that misfortune <lb/>
            which thou hast not; since thou canst neither endure it to <lb/>
            be enjoyed by thyself nor by another."</p>
          <p>PHIL. I know, indeed, that so it usually is : but, my son, <lb/>
            he is the truly niggardly man3 that has nought with which <lb/>

            preferable, indeed, by each individual letter it is composed of, or, as we should <lb/>

            Hence, with an extended signification, it means one that will not out of his abun­ <lb/>

            at Rome, which was upon the road to <unclear>Ostia</unclear>. It received its name from the three <lb/>
            twin-born brothers, the Horatii, who passed beneath it when going to fight the <lb/>
            Curiatii. This, being one of the largest and most frequented roads in Rome, was <lb/>
            especially the resort of mendicants; among whom, in the opinion of Philto, the <lb/>
            father of Lesbonicus will have to take his place. Some Commentators would read <lb/>
            “ ponte” instead of “ portâ,” and they think that the allusion is to the Sublician <lb/>

            the “Mensarii” transacted business on behalf of the state. Their shops, or offices, <lb/>
            were situate around the Forum, and were public property. Their principal business <lb/>
            was the exchange of Roman for foreign coin, and the keeping of sums of money for <lb/>
            other persons, which were deposited with or without interest, according to agree­ <lb/>
            ment. They acted as agents for the sale of estates, and a part of their duty was <lb/>
            to test the genuineness of coin, and, in later times, to circulate it from the mint <lb/>
            among the people. Lending money at a profit was also part of their business. It <lb/>
            as supposed that among the Romans there was a higher and a lower class of “ ar­ <lb/>
            gentarii." The more respectable of them probably held the position of the banker <lb/>
            of modern times; while those who did business on a paltry scale, or degraded <lb/>
            themselves by usury, were not held in any esteem. Their shops, being public pro­ <lb/>
            perty, were built under the inspection of the Censors, and by them were let to the <lb/>
            “ argentarii.” “ Trapezitæ,” as they are here called, was properly the Greek <lb/>
            name for these persons, who were so styled from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραπεζα</foreign>, or “ table,” at <lb/>

            bound to perform particular sacrifices, which were not only ordained by the pon­ <lb/>

            ordered to be observed by the law of the Twelve Tables: " Sacra privata perpetua <lb/>
            manento," " Let private sacrifices remain perpetual." This law is quoted and <lb/>
            commented upon by Cicero in his Second Book on the Laws. He there tells us <lb/>
            that " heirs are obliged to continue their sacrifices, be they ever so expensive; and <lb/>
            for this reason, as by the above law these sacrifices were to be maintained, no one <lb/>
            was presumed to be better able to supply the place of the deceased person than <lb/>
            his heir." A property exempt from this necessity, might be truly said to be one <lb/>

            gained by their merit, and that you might become a bar to <lb/>
            the honour of your own posterity ? Your father and your <lb/>
            grandfather made an easy and a level path for you to attain to <lb/>
            honour; whereas you have made it to become a difficult one, <lb/>
            by your extreme recklessness and sloth, and your besotted <lb/>
            ways. You have made your election, to prefer your passions <lb/>
            to virtue. Now, do you suppose that you can cover over <lb/>
            your faults by these means ? Alas! 'tis impossible. Wel­ <lb/>
            come virtue to your mind, if you please, and expel slothful­ <lb/>

            might bring you into crimination and disgrace with the public. <lb/>
            They would say that you were so kind to the girl not with­ <lb/>
            out some good reason; that the dowry which you presented <lb/>
            her was given you by her father ; they would think that you <lb/>
            were portioning her out of that, and that you had not kept <lb/>
            it safe for her just as it was given, and that you had with­ <lb/>
            held some part. Now, if you wish to await the return of <lb/>

            that ?</p>

          <p>MEG. Let him come to the young man as though from <lb/>
            Seleucia, from his father; let him pronounce his salutation <lb/>
            to him in the words of his father, say that he is prospering <lb/>
            in business, and is alive and well, and that he will be shortly <lb/>
            coming back again. Let him bring two letters; let us seal <lb/>
            these, as though they are from his father. Let him give <lb/>
            the one to him, and let him say that he wishes to give the <lb/>
            other to yourself.</p>
          <p>CALL. Go on, and tell me still further.</p>
          <p>MEG. Let him say that he is bringing some gold as a <lb/>
            marriage-portion from her father for the girl, and that his <lb/>
            father has requested him to deliver it to you. Do you un­ <lb/>
            derstand me now ?</p>
          <p>CALL. Pretty nearly; and I listen with great satisfaction.</p>
          <p>MEG. Then, in consequence, you will finally give the gold <lb/>
            to the young man when the girl shall be given in marriage.</p>

            sure, you will have removed all cause for suspicion from the <lb/>
            young man. He will think that the gold has been brought <lb/>
            . to you from his father ; whereas, you will be taking it from <lb/>
            the treasure.</p>
          <p>CALL. Very cleverly and fairly contrived ; although I am <lb/>
            ashamed, at this time of life, for me to be playing a double <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act III </note> <lb/>
            part. But when he shall bring the letters sealed, don't you <lb/>
            suppose that the young man will then recollect the impres­ <lb/>
            sion of his father's signetl ?</p>
          <p>MEG. Will you be silent now? Reasons innumerable <lb/>
            may be found for that circumstance. That which he used <lb/>
            to have he has lost, and he has since had another new one <lb/>
            made. Then, if he should bring them not sealed at all, this <lb/>
            might be said,-that they had been unsealed for him by <lb/>
            the custom-house officers2, and had been examined. On <lb/>
            matters of this kind, however, 'tis mere idleness to spend <lb/>
            the day in talk ; although a long discussion might be spun <lb/>
            out. Go now, at once, privately to the treasure ; send to a <lb/>
            distance the men-servants and the maids; and-do you <lb/>
            hear ?</p>
          <p>CALL. What is it ? LEG. Take care that you conceal <lb/>
            this matter from that same wife of yours as well; for, i' <lb/>
            faith, there is never any subject which they can be silent <lb/>
            upon. Why are you standing now ? Why don't you take <lb/>
            yourself off hence, and bestir yourself? Open the treasure, <lb/>
            take thence as much gold as is requisite for this purpose; at <lb/>
            once close it up again, but secretly, as I have enjoined you ; <lb/>
            turn all out of the house.</p>

            mans was said to have been derived from the Sabines. The stones set in them <lb/>
            were generally engraved with some design, and they were universally used by both <lb/>
            Greeks and Romans for the purpose of a seal. So common was the practice among <lb/>
            the Greeks, that Solon made a very wholesome law which forbade engravers to <lb/>
            keep the form of a seal which they had sold. In some rings the seal was cut in <lb/>
            the metal itself. The designs engraved on rings were various; sometimes portraits <lb/>
            of ancestors or friends, and sometimes subjects connected with the mythology or <lb/>
            the worship of the Gods. The onyx was the stone most frequently used in rings. <lb/>
            The genuineness of a letter was tested, not by the signature, but by the seal ap­ <lb/>

            countries. These " portitores," to whom it was frequently farmed, greatly <lb/>
            annoyed the merchants by their unfair conduct and arbitrary proceedings. At <lb/>
            Rome, all commodities, including slaves, which were imported for the pur <lb/>
            pose of selling again, were subject to the " portorium." The present instance <lb/>
            is an illustration of the license of their proceedings, for we can hardly suppose <lb/>

            served, in Dr. Smith's Dictionary, was “ a happy compound of the common bar­ <lb/>
            rotor, informer, pettifogger, busybody, rogue, liar, and slanderer." In fact, he was <lb/>
            such a person as we mean by the epithet “swindler” or "sharper." Information <lb/>
            being encouraged by the policy of Athens, and the informer gaining half the reward, <lb/>
            it was upon this honourable calling that the " sycophantæ " in general thrived <lb/>
            They were ready, however, for any other job, however dishonorable, and perjury <lb/>
            would not be declined by them if they could obtain their price. They would, conse­ <lb/>
            quently, be much in the neighbourhood of the Courts of justice; and the " Forum," <lb/>
            as in the present instance, would not be an unlikely place to meet with them. </note> <pb n="44"/>

            cerely do I proffer praise, and return my grateful thanks; <lb/>
            to the salt waves, too, with whom lay supreme power over <lb/>
            myself,—one, too, that existed over my property and my life, <lb/>
            -inasmuch as from their realms they have returned me safe <lb/>
            and sound even to my own native city. And, Neptune, be­ <lb/>
            fore the other Deities, do I both give and return to you ex­ <lb/>
            treme thanks. For all people talk of you as being cruel <lb/>
            and severe, of voracious habits, filthy, unsightly, unendurable, <lb/>
            and outrageous; on the other hand, I have experienced your <lb/>
            kindly aid. For, in good sooth, I have found you mild and <lb/>
            merciful upon the deep, even to that degree that I wished. <lb/>
            This commendation, too, I had already heard with these ears <lb/>
            before of you among men,—that you were accustomed to <lb/>
            spare the poor, and to depress and overawe the rich. Adieu! <lb/>
            I commend you; you know how to treat men properly, <lb/>
            according as is just. This is worthy of the Gods; they <lb/>
            should ever prove benignant to the needy; to men of high <lb/>
            station, quite otherwise. Trusty have you proved, though they <lb/>
            are in the habit of saying that you cannot be trusted. For, <lb/>
            without you, it would have happened, I am very sure, that <lb/>
            on the deep your attendants would have shockingly torn in <lb/>
            pieces and rent asunder wretched me, and, together with <lb/>
            me, my property as well, in every direction throughout the <lb/>
            azure surface of ocean. But just now, like raging dogs, and <lb/>
            no otherwise, did the winds in hurricane beset the ship; <lb/>
            storms and waves, and raging squalls were about to roar, to <lb/>
            break the mast, to bear down the yards, to split the sails; had <lb/>
            not your favouring kindness been nigh at hand. Have done <lb/>
            with me, if you please; henceforth have I now determined <lb/>
            to give myself up to ease; enough have I got. With what <lb/>
            pains have I struggled, while I was acquiring riches for my <lb/>
            son. But who is this1 that is coming up the street with <lb/>
            his new-angled garb and appearance ? I' faith, though I <lb/>
            wish to be at home, I'll wait awhile; at the same time, I <lb/>
            will give my attention to see what business this fellow is <lb/>
            about. (He retires aside.) <note type="footnote">1 But who is this)—Ver. 840. It seems at first sight rather absurd that Char­ <lb/>
            mides, who has just returned from a voyage, should wait in the street to gossip <lb/>
            with a stranger who is coming towards him; but we must remember that he sees <lb/>
            that the fellow is making straight for his house, and his curiosity is excited by that <lb/>
            fact, combined with the very extraordinary dress which Megaronides has hired for <lb/>
            him from the playhouse, and has thereby probably much overdone the character <lb/>
            which hn is intended to represent. </note> <pb n="45"/>

          <p>SHARP. To this day I give the name of " The Festival of <lb/>
            the Three Pieces " (Trinummus) ; for, on this day, have I let <lb/>
            out my services in a cheating scheme for three pieces of <lb/>
            money. I am just arrived from Seleucia, Macedonia, Asia, <lb/>
            and Arabia,—places which I never visited either with my eye <lb/>
            or with my foot. See now, what business poverty brings <lb/>
            upon the man that is wretchedly destitute; inasmuch as I <lb/>
            am now obliged, for the sake of three pieces of money, to say <lb/>
            that I received these letters from a certain person, about whom <lb/>
            I don't know, nor have I ever known, who the man is, nor do <lb/>
            I know this for certain, whether he was ever born or not.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (behind). Faith, this fellow's surely of the mush­ <lb/>
            room genus; he covers himself entirely with his top1. The <lb/>
            countenance of the fellow appears to be Illyrian; he comes, <lb/>
            too, in that garb.</p>
          <p>SHARP. He who hired me, when he had hired me, took me <lb/>
            to his house; he told me what he wanted to be done; he <lb/>
            taught and showed me beforehand how I was to do every­ <lb/>
            thing. If, then, I should add anything more, my employer <lb/>
            will on that account the better forward his plan through me. <lb/>
            As he dressed me out, -so am I now equipped; his money <lb/>
            did that. He himself borrowed my costume, at his own risk, <lb/>
            from the theatrical wardrobe2; if I shall be able, now, to <lb/>
            impose on this man through my garb, I will give him occasion <lb/>
            clearly to find that I am a very trickster.</p>
          <p>. CHAR. (behind). The more I look at hint, the less does the <lb/>
            appearance of the fellow please me. 'Tis a wonder if that <note type="footnote"> 1 With his top)—Ver. 851. The Sharper, as personating a foreigner, has on a <lb/>
            “ petasus," or hat with very wide brims, extending straight out on each side. For <lb/>
            this reason Charmides wittily compares him to a mushroom—all head. The <lb/>
            " causia” was a similar hat worn by the Macedonians, with the brims turned up <lb/>
            at the sides. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The theatrical wardrobe)—Ver. 858. “ Chorego ” — literally, “ from the <lb/>
            Choregus." It was the duty of this person at Athens to provide the Choruses for <lb/>
            tragedies and comedies, the Lyric Choruses of men and toys, the dancers for the <lb/>
            Pyrrhic dance, the Cyclic Choruses, and the Choruses of flute-players for the re­ <lb/>
            ligions festivals of Athens. He also had to provide the Chorus with the requisite <lb/>
            dresses, wreaths, and masks-whence the application to him on the present occasion </note> <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act IV. </note> <lb/>
            fellow there is not either a night-robber1 or a cutpurse. He <lb/>
            is viewing the locality; he is looking around him and sur­ <lb/>
            veying the houses; troth, I think he is reconnoitring the spot <lb/>
            for him to come and rob bye and bye. I have a still greater <lb/>
            desire to watch what he is about: I'll give attention to this <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>SHARP. This employer of mine pointed out these localities <lb/>
            to me; at this house are my devices to be put in practice. <lb/>
            I'll knock at the door.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (behind). Surely this fellow is making in a <lb/>
            straight line for my house; i' faith, I think I shall have to <lb/>
            keep watch this night of my arrival.</p>
          <p>SHARP. (knocks at the door of the house of CHARMIDES). <lb/>
            Open this door !—open it! Hallo, there! who now has the <lb/>

            want ? What is it you wish ? Why are you knocking at <lb/>
            this door ?</p>
          <p>SHARP. Eh! old gentleman; I am inquiring here for a <lb/>
            young man named Lesbonicus, where in this quarter he lives <lb/>
            -and likewise for another person, with such white hairs on <lb/>
            his head as yours; he that gave me these letters said his <lb/>
            name was Callicles.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (aside). In fact, this fellow is looking for my own <lb/>
            son Lesbonicus and my friend Callicles, to whom I entrusted <lb/>
            both my children and my property.</p>
          <p>SHARP. Let me know, respected sir8, if you are acquainted <lb/>
            with it, where these persons live. <note type="footnote"> 1 A night-robber)—Ver. 862. “ Dormitator" seems to mean a thief, who slept <lb/>
            during the day and pursued his avocations by night. “ Sector zonarins" is a <lb/>
            “ cutter of girdles," similar to our “ cutpurse." It was the custom of persons of <lb/>
            the middle and lower classes to wear their purses suspended from the “ zona," or <lb/>
            "girdle," round the waist; and sometimes they used the folds of the girdle itself <lb/>
            for the purpose of depositing. their money therein. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Care of this door)—Ver. 870. It was not the usage to enter a house without <lb/>
            giving notice to those within. This was done among the Spartans by shouting, while <lb/>
            the Athenians, and other nations, either used the knocker of the door or rapped <lb/>
            with the knuckles or a stick. In the houses of the rich a porter was always in <lb/>
            attendance to open the door. He was commonly a slave or eunuch, and was, <lb/>
            among the Romans, chained to his post. A dog was also in general chained near <lb/>
            the entrance, and the warning, “ Cave canem," “ Beware of the dog," was some­ <lb/>
            times written near the door. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Respected sir)—Ver 877. “ Pater," literally, “ father." </note> <pb n="47"/>

          <p>SHARP. You ask a number of things in the same breath; <lb/>
            I know not which in especial to inform you upon. If you <lb/>
            will ask each thing singly, and in a quiet manner, I'll both <lb/>

            place, tell me your name.</p>
          <p>SHARP. You begin by demanding an arduous task.</p>
          <p>CHARM. How so ?</p>
          <p>SHARP. Because, respected sir, if you were to begin before <lb/>
            daylight, i' faith, to commence at the first part of my <lb/>
            name2, 'twould be the dead of the night before you could <lb/>
            get to the end of it.</p>
          <p>CHARM. According to your story, a person should have a <lb/>
            long journey's provision crammed tightly in for your name.</p>
          <p>SHARP. I have another name somewhat less,-about the <lb/>
            size of a wine-cask3.</p>
          <p>CHARM. What is this name of yours, young man ?</p>
          <p>SHARP. "Hush," that's my name4; that's my every-day <lb/>
            one.</p>
          <p>CHARM. I' faith, 'tis a scampish name; just as though5 <note type="footnote"> 1 To the Censor)—Ver. 879. “ Juratori.” It was the duty of the Censor, among <lb/>
            the Romans, to make these inquiries of every person when taking the Census. <lb/>
            As the Censors were bound by an oath to the faithful discharge of their duties, <lb/>
            they were, in common with all persons so bound, called “juratores,” "oaths­ <lb/>
            men." The Sharper gives Charmides an impudent answer, saying that he has <lb/>
            answered the Censor on these points, and that is enough. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Beginning ofmy name)—Ver. 855. He probably alludes to his varied calling, <lb/>
            commensurate with everything in the line of roguery. See the Note to line 815. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Size ofa wine cask)—Ver. 888. He alludes, probably, to the “ amphora," or <lb/>
            large earthen jar, in which wine was kept. This was, perhaps, a cant saying, just <lb/>
            as if we should say, "As little as a hogshead." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 " Hush,” that is my name)—Ver. 889. " Pax," This word was used to enjoin <lb/>
            silence, like our word " Hush," or “ Whist.” He seems to allude to his own thieving <lb/>
            avocation, which often required him to be as mute as a mouse. Some of the editions <lb/>
            have " tax," as though from " tango," “ to prig," or " steal." This, Thornton <lb/>
            renders “Touchit.” </note><note type="footnote"> 5Just as though)—Ver. 891. This passage is at obscure signification. A note of <lb/>

            these persons owe you whom you are seeking ?</p>
          <p>SHARP. The father of this young man, Lesbonicus, de­ <lb/>
            livered to me these two letters; he is a friend of mine.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (aside). I have now caught him in the fact; he <lb/>
            says that I gave him the letters. I will have some fine <lb/>
            sport with the fellow.</p>
          <p>SHARP. As I have begun, if you will give attention, I will <lb/>
            say on.</p>
          <p>CHARM. I'll give you my attention.</p>
          <p>SHARP. He bade me give this letter to his son, Lesbonicus, <lb/>
            and this other one, as well, he bade me give to his friend <lb/>
            Callicles.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (aside). Troth, but since he is acting the impostor, <lb/>
            I, on the other hand, have an inclination to act the cheat as <lb/>
            well. Where was he himself?</p>

          <p>CHARM. But where ? SHARP. At Seleucia.</p>

            himself ?</p>
          <p>SHARP. With his own hands he himself delivered them <lb/>
            into my hands.</p>
          <p>CHARM. Of what appearance is this person P</p>
          <p>SHARP. He is a person somewhere about half a foot <lb/>
            taller than you.</p>
          <p>CHARM. (aside). This is an odd matter, if in fact I am <lb/>
            taller when absent than when present. Do you know this <lb/>
            person ? <note type="footnote"> man seems to be, that, as in conversation a stop is instantly put to the discourse <lb/>
            on saying “ hush !” so, if anything is entrusted to him, it is as easily done for <lb/>
            (periisse), and that it vanishes the instant you call him by his name. This is <lb/>
            the explanation given by Lindemann. Ritschel reads “ pax," but most of the old <lb/>
            Commentators have “tax,” which seems the more probable reading. The <lb/>

            unknown region, called “ Apeland," as the Sharper's only aim is to impose upon <lb/>
            the credulity of Charmides, and to hinder him from asking unseasonable questions. <lb/>
            He coins the word upon the spur of the moment, though there really were the <lb/>
            “ Ape Islands," or the isles of Pithecusæ, off the coast of Campania. They are <lb/>
            mentioned by Ovid, in the 14th book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 291: “For the father <lb/>
            of the Gods, once abhorring the frauds and perjuries of the Cercropians, and the <lb/>
            crimes of the fraudulent race, changed these men into ugly animals; that these <lb/>
            same beings might be able to appear unlike men and yet like them. He both <lb/>
            contracted their limbs and flattened their noses, bent back from their foreheads; <lb/>
            and he furrowed their faces with the wrinkles of old age; and he sent them into <lb/>
            this spot with the whole of their bodies covered with long yellow hair. Moreover, <lb/>
            he first took away from them the use of language and of their tongues, made for <lb/>

            them, and Cicero tells us that they were frequented by the slaves and the lower <lb/>
            orders. They sat on stools or benches, while they drank “ calda," or ” calida,” <lb/>
            “ mulled wine," which was always kept hot. It was probably mixed with spices, <lb/>
            and was the favourite drink of the lower classes. It was measured out in “ po­ <lb/>

            bably cant terms for slaves, who carried the marks of punishment on their necks <lb/>
            and legs. “Crepidæ” is from the verb “crepo,” to "crack," and alludes to the <lb/>
            sound of the lashes. “ Ferriterius" was a' slave who bore the marks of the chain <lb/>
            with which he had been fastened for refractory conduct, while " mastigia" was a <lb/>
            name given to a slave who had passed the ordeal of flogging. A liquor-shop was <lb/>
            a likely place for the resort of worthless and refractory slaves. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 From a runningfootman)—Ver. 1023. “ Cursores" were slaves who ran before <lb/>

            however, this is not the meaning of the word here, as the name was given to all <lb/>
            slaves whom their masters employed in carrying letters and messages. Stasimus <lb/>
            hints by this that his boon companions were not only very expert at thieving, but <lb/>
            that they would prey just as readily on a fellow-slave as any other person. </note> <pb n="57"/>

            think that there is a person upon the earth, whose fidelity <lb/>
            and constancy towards his friend equals yours. For without <lb/>
            you, it would have been that he would have ousted me out <lb/>
            of this house.</p>
          <p>CALL. If I have in any way acted well towards my friend, <lb/>
            or have faithfully consulted his advantage, I seem not to be <lb/>
            deserving of praise, but I think I am free from fault. For <lb/>

            so influential.</p>

          <p>Lys. (behind). Why, he is mentioning my name.</p>
          <p>CHARM. He has got into a most worthy family.</p>
          <p>Lys. (behind). Why do I hesitate to address these per­ <lb/>
            sons ? But still, I think, I may wait awhile ; for something <lb/>
            is going to be said to the purpose about this matter.</p>
          <p>CHARM. O— CALL. What's the matter ?</p>
          <p>CHARM. I forgot just now to tell you of it in-doors. As <lb/>
            I was coming hither, a while ago, a certain swindling fellow <lb/>
            met me—a very finished sharper. He told me that he was <lb/>
            carrying a thousand gold pieces, of my giving, to you and my <lb/>
            son Lesbonicus; a fellow, that I know not who he was, nor <lb/>
            have I ever seen him anywhere before. But why do you <lb/>
            laugh?</p>
          <p>CALL. He came by my directions, as though he was one <lb/>
            bringing the gold from you to me, to give as a portion to your <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act V </note> <lb/>
            daughter; that your son, when I should give it to her from <lb/>
            my own hands, might suppose that it had been brought from <lb/>
            you, and that he might not anyhow be enabled to discover the <lb/>
            fact itself-that your treasure was in my possession, and de­ <lb/>
            mand it of mel, as having belonged to his father, by the public <lb/>
            laws.</p>
          <p>CHARM. Cleverly contrived, i' troth. CALL. Megaronides, <lb/>
            a common well-wisher of yours and mine, planned this.</p>
          <p>CHARM. Well, I applaud his device, and approve of it.</p>
          <p>LYS. (behind). Why, in my foolishness, while I fear to <lb/>
            interrupt their discourse, am I standing here alone, and am <lb/>
            not forwarding the business that I was intending to trans­ <lb/>
            act ? I will accost these persons. (He advances.)</p>
          <p>CHARM. Who is this person that is coming this way to­ <lb/>
            wards us ?</p>
          <p>LYS. (going up to CHARMIDES). Lysiteles salutes his <lb/>
            father-in-law Charmides.</p>

          <p>LYS. Yes; health to you, Callicles. It is right that I <lb/>
            should give him the preference: the tunic is nearer2 the skin <lb/>
            than the cloak.</p>
          <p>CALL. I trust that the Gods may direct your plans <lb/>
            aright.</p>
          <p>CHARM. I hear that my daughter has been betrothed to <lb/>
            you?</p>
          <p>LYS. Unless you are unwilling. CHARM. Nay, I am not <lb/>
            unwilling.</p>
          <p>LYS. Do you, then, promise your daughter for my wife ?</p>
          <p>CHARM. I promise a thousand gold Philippean pieces, as <lb/>
            well, for a portion.</p>
          <p>Lys. I care nothing about a portion.</p>
          <p>CHARM. If she pleases you, the portion which she presents <lb/>

          <p>LYS. What have I done ? CHARM. Because you have <lb/>

          <p>CHARM. My heart is tortured, and I fear—</p>
          <p>LTS. What is it now ? CHARM. Because he is such as I <lb/>
            would that he was not,-by that am I tortured. I fear that <lb/>
            if I refuse you what you ask of me, you may suppose that I <lb/>
            am indifferent towards you. I won't make difficulties, how­ <lb/>

          <p>LTS. You are a worthy man. I am going to call him out. <lb/>
            (He goes to the door of the house of CHARMIDES.)</p>

          </head>
          <p>LEUSICLES, a young Athenian, is in love with Philocomasium, a Courtesan of <lb/>
            Athens, who returns his affection. Being sent on public business to Naupactus, <lb/>
            a certain Captain of Ephesus, Pyrgopolinices by name, comes to Athens, and in­ <lb/>
            sinuates himself into the good graces of her mother, in older that he may get <lb/>
            Philocomasium into his power. Having deceived the mother, he places the <lb/>
            daughter on board ship and carries her off to Ephesus. On this, Palæstrio, a <lb/>
            faithful servant of Pleusicles, hastens to embark for Naupactus, with the view of <lb/>
            telling his master what has happened. The ship being taken by pirates, he is <lb/>
            made captive, and by chance is presented as a gift to Pyrgopolinices. He re­ <lb/>
            cognises the mistress of Pleusicles in the Captain's house; but he carefully <lb/>
            conceals from the Captain who he himself is. He then privately writes to <lb/>
            Pleusicles, requesting him to come to Ephesus. On arriving, Pleusicles is <lb/>
            hospitably entertained by Periplecomenus, a friend of his father, an old gentle­ <lb/>
            man who lives next door to the Captain. As Philocomasium has a private <lb/>
            room of her own in the Captain's house, a hole is made through the partition <lb/>
            wall, and by this contrivance she meets Pleusicles in the house of his enter­ <lb/>
            tainer, who gives his sanction to the plan.</p>
          <p>At this juncture, the play begins. A servant of the Captain, named Sceledrus, <lb/>
            has been appointed to be the keeper of Philocomasium. Pursuing a monkey <lb/>
            along the roof of the house, he looks down the skylight of the house next door, <lb/>
            and there sees Pleusicles and Philocomasium conversing and toying with each <lb/>
            other. When this has been discovered to be the case, a plan is arranged, <lb/>
            by which Sceledrus shall not only not divulge to the Captain what he <lb/>
            has seen, but shall even be made to believe that he has not actually seen <lb/>
            it himself. Palæstrio, therefore, persuades him that the twin-sister of Philoco­ <lb/>
            masium has arrived at Ephesus, and with her lover is staying at their neigh­ <lb/>
            bour's house. To forward their designs, Palæstrio then invents another plan. <lb/>
            He persuades the Captain to believe that the wife of his neighbour, Peripleco­ <lb/>
            menus, is in love with him. Through his agency, a Courtesan, named Acrote­ <lb/>
            leutium, pretends that she is the wife so desperately in love with the Captain. <lb/>
            He believes this story, and, that he may the more conveniently receive her in <lb/>
            his house, by the advice of Palæstrio, he sends Philocomasium away, and gives <lb/>
            her into the charge of Pleusicles, who is disguised in the dress of a master of a <lb/>
            ship. They go to the harbour and set sail, accompanied by Palæstrio, whem <lb/>
            the Captain has given to Philocomasium at her request. The Captain, then, at <lb/>
            the invitation of the maid of Acroteleutium, goes to the house next door, to visit <lb/>
            her mistress. On this, Periplecomenus, with his servants, sallies forth upon <lb/>
            him, and, having first threatened to cut him in pieces, and then having beaten <lb/>
            and stripped him, they let him go, after they have exacted from him a confession <lb/>
            that he has been rightly served, and a promise that he will molest no one in re­ <lb/>
            turn for the treatment he has received.</p><pb n="69"/>

          <p>A Captain carries off to Ephesus a Courtesan (Meretricem) from Athens. While <lb/>
            his servant is intending to tell this (Id) to his master, her lover, who is an Am­ <lb/>
            bassador (Legato) abroad, he himself is captured at sea, and (Et) is given as a <lb/>
            present to the same Captain. The servant sends for his (Suum) master from <lb/>
            Athens, and cleverly makes a hole in the party wall, common to the two (Ge­ <lb/>
            minis) houses, that it may be possible (Liceret) for the two lovers secretly to <lb/>
            meet. Wandering about (Oberrans), her keeper sees them from the tiles, but <lb/>
            he is played a trick (Ridiculis) upon, as though it were another person. <lb/>
            Palæstrio, too, as well (Item) persuades the Captain to have his mistress dis­ <lb/>
            missed (Omissam), since the wife of the old man (Senis), his neighbour, wishes <lb/>
            to marry him. He begs that she will go away of her own accord (Ultro), and <lb/>
            gives her many things. He, himself, caught in the house of the old man <lb/>
            (Senis), receives punishment as an adulterer.</p>

            Greece and Rome, first received that name from Alexis, the Greek Comedian. It <lb/>
            has been well remarked, that their chief characteristics were “importunity, love <lb/>
            of sensual pleasures," and “the desire of getting a good dinner without paying for <lb/>
            it." They may be subdivided into the jesting, the officious, and the flattering Pa­ <lb/>
            rasite (assentator), of which latter kind Artotrogus is an admirable specimen <lb/>
            From ancient writers we find that it was their method to frequent the Courts of <lb/>
            justice, market-places, baths, places for exercise, and other objects of public re­ <lb/>
            sort, with the view of obtaining a dinner, at the price of being the butt of their <lb/>

            for the purpose of writing, were pieces of wood, mostly of an oblong shape, covered <lb/>
            with wax, on which an impression was made with the “stylus," or iron pen. They <lb/>
            were sometimes made of ivory, but more frequently of citron-wood, beech, or fir <lb/>
            The inside only of the tablet was covered with wax, the outer consisting of wood. <lb/>
            The leaves were fastened at the back with wires, and opened and shut like the <lb/>
            books of the present day. There was a raised margin to each leaf of the tablet, <lb/>
            for the purpose of preventing the wax of the one from rubbing against the other. <lb/>
            From two to five, six, or even more of these leaves were joined together, which <lb/>
            were accordingly called “diptycha," “triptycha,” and so on. Those tablets which <lb/>
            contained legal documents were pierced through the outer edges with holes, <lb/>
            through which a triple thread or string was passed, on which a seal was placed, <lb/>

            it may appear to be misplaced ; but it really is properly placed here, as the pre­ <lb/>

            the sake of which you are now seated in this mirthful placed <lb/>
            " Alazon" is the name2, in Greek, of this Comedy; the same <lb/>
            we call in Latin, " the Braggart" (Gloriosus). This city is <lb/>
            Ephesus; then, the Captain, my master, who has gone oft <lb/>
            hence to the Forum, a bragging, impudent, stinking fellow, <lb/>
            brimful of lying and lasciviousness, says that all the women <lb/>
            are following him of their own accord. Wherever he goes, he <lb/>
            is the laughing-stock of all; and so, the Courtesans here-since <lb/>
            they make wry mouths at him, you may see the greater part <lb/>
            of them with lips all awry. I wish you now to know this, <lb/>
            how I came to be his slave, from him to whom I was servant <lb/>
            before; for 'tis not long that I have been in slavery to him. <lb/>
            Give your attention, for now I will begin the argument. A <lb/>
            very worthy young man at Athens was my master. He was <lb/>
            in love with a Courtesan, brought up at Athens, in Attica, <lb/>
            and she on the other hand loved him ; such affection is most <lb/>
            worthy to be cherished. In the public service, he was sent <lb/>
            to Kaupactus3 as Ambassador on behalf of that mighty <lb/>
            republic. In the mean time, by chance, this Captain <lb/>
            came to Athens. He introduced himself to this lady of my <lb/>
            master, began to cajole her mother with presents of wine, <lb/>
            trinkets, and costly treats; and so the Captain made himself <lb/>
            on intimate terms with the procuress. As soon as ever an <lb/>
            opportunity was presented for this Captain, he tricked this <lb/>
            procuress, the mother of the damsel, whom my master loved. <lb/>
            For, unknown to her mother, he put the daughter on board <lb/>
            ship, and carried this woman, against her will, hither' to <lb/>
            Ephesus. Soon as I knew that the lady of my master was <lb/>
            carried off from Athens, as quickly as ever I was able, I <lb/>
            procured for myself a ship: I embarked, that I might carry <lb/>
            tidings of this matter to my master at Naupactum. When <lb/>
            we had got out to sea, some pirates, as they had hoped to do, <lb/>
            took that ship on board of which I was ; thus I was undone <lb/>
            before I reached my master, for whom I had commenced to <lb/>
            proceed on my voyage. He that took me, gave me as a pre- <note type="footnote"> I This mirthful place)—Ver. 83. He alludes to the theatres, where scenic re­ <lb/>

            sent to this same Captain. After he had taken me home to <lb/>
            his own house, I saw there that favorite of my master who <lb/>
            lived at Athens. When, on the other hand, she perceived me, <lb/>
            she gave me a sign with her eyes not to address her by name. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when there was an opportunity, the damsel com­ <lb/>
            plained to me of her hard fate. She said that she wished to <lb/>
            escape to Athens from this house, that she was attached to him, <lb/>
            that master of mine who lived at Athens, and that she had <lb/>
            never hated any one more thoroughly than this same Captain. <lb/>
            As I discovered the feelings of the damsel, I took tablets, <lb/>
            sealed them in private, and gave them to a certain merchant <lb/>
            to carry to him (my master, I mean, who was at Athens, and <lb/>
            who had so loved her), in order that he might come hither. <lb/>
            He did not slight the message, for he both is come, and is <lb/>
            lodging here next door, with his host, a friend of his father's, <lb/>
            a nice old man. He, too, gives every assistance to his guest <lb/>
            in his amour, and encourages and seconds us with his help and <lb/>
            his advice. Therefore, here (pointing to the CAPTAIN'S house), <lb/>
            in-doors, I have found a grand contrivance, by which to cause <lb/>
            these lovers, each, to meet the other. For one room, which the <lb/>
            Captain gave to his mistress for no one but herself to set foot <lb/>
            in, in that same room I have dug a hole through the party- <lb/>
            wall, in order that there may secretly be an ingress for the <lb/>
            damsel from the one house to the other. And this I have <lb/>
            done with the knowledge of the old gentleman; 'twas he that <lb/>
            gave the advice. But my fellow-servant, whom the Captain has <lb/>
            given as a keeper to his mistress, is a person of no great worth. <lb/>
            By clever contrivances and ingenious devices, we will throw <lb/>
            dust1 in his eyes, and we will make him so as not to see what <lb/>
            he really does see. And that you may not hereafter make <lb/>
            mistakes, this damsel to-day, in this house and in that, will <lb/>
            perform in turn a double part, and will be the same, but will <lb/>
            pretend to be another, person. Thus will the keeper of the <lb/>
            damsel be gulled. But there is a noise2 at the door here of <note type="footnote"> 1 We will throw dust)—Ver. 148. “ Glaucomam objiciemns;”literally, "we <lb/>

          <p>PERIP. (speaking to his servants within). Faith, if you <lb/>
            don't in future smash his ankle-bones for any stranger that <lb/>
            you see on my tiles, I will cut you so with lashes as to <lb/>
            make thongs of your sides. My neighbours, i' faith, are over­ <lb/>
            lookers of what is going on in my own house; so often are <lb/>
            they peeping down through the skylight1. And now, there­ <lb/>
            fore, I give you all notice, whatever person of this Captain's <lb/>
            household you shall see upon our tiles, except Palæstrio only, <lb/>
            push him headlong here into the street. Suppose he says that <lb/>
            he is following some hen, or pigeon, or monkey; woe be to you, <lb/>
            if you don't badly maul the fellow even to death. And so, that <lb/>
            they may commit no infringement against the laws of dice2, <note type="footnote"> I Through the skylight)—Ver. 159. The “ atrium," or middle hall, of the houses <lb/>
            of the Romans was a large apartment, roofed over, with the exception of an <lb/>
            opening in the centre, which was called “ impluvium,” or “ compluvium," towards <lb/>
            which the roof sloped, so as to throw the rain-water down through pipes into a <lb/>
            cistern below. Vitruvius says that the “ impluvium" was from a fourth to a <lb/>
            third of the size of the “ atrium," or hall below. It was probably glazed, and <lb/>
            thus would form a sort of sloping skylight. In the present instance, it would <lb/>
            seem to have overlooked the upper chamber, into which Philocomasium passed <lb/>
            through the wall of the next house, to meet Pleusicles. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The laws ofdice)—Ver. 164. Commentators are much divided as to what is <lb/>
            the meaning here of “ lex alearia," or, as some editions have it “ lex talaria.” <lb/>
            Some suppose that it simply means “ the rules of the game with the ‘ tali,' or <lb/>
            ‘ dice;’” while others think that Plautus alludes to some recent enactment at <lb/>
            Rome against games of chance. Such laws were repeatedly promulgated, but im­ <lb/>
            mediately became a mere dead letter. “ Talus" means either a person's " ankle­ <lb/>
            bone," or the " knuckle-bone" of an animal, which latter was marked with numbers <lb/>
            on four sides, and used by the Greeks and Romans in sets of four for the purpose <lb/>
            of dice. The old man puns on the two meanings, and says, “ I'll take care that <lb/>
            your ‘ tali' (or ankle-bones) are broken, so that" (if we adopt the first meaning) <lb/>
            "you shall not cheat at dice in future," or (if we take the second interpretation) <lb/>
            ‘ you shall not have an opportunity of infringing the public laws." “ Simia,” <lb/>
            which is translated “monkey," is, strictly speaking, “ a she-ape;” probably a pre­ <lb/>
            sent from tie Captain to Philocomasium. </note> <pb n="77"/>

            done him by our family so far as I can hear, inasmuch as the <lb/>
            old man has ordered the ankles of my fellow-servants to be <lb/>

            my guest as they were toying together.</p>

            I cried: "Hallo! you sir!" said I, "what are you doing <lb/>
            upon the tiles ?" As he went away he replied to me in these <lb/>
            terms, that he was following a stray'd monkey.</p>

          <p>PERIP. When I came out, she was there.</p>
          <p>PAL. If she is, then bid her return to our house as soon as <lb/>
            ever she can, that the servants may see that she is at home; <lb/>
            unless, indeed, she wishes that we, who are slaves, her fellow- <lb/>

            considering with yourself in your mind?</p>
          <p>PAL. Be silent a moment, while I am calling a council in my <lb/>

            I must contrive, on the other hand, as a match for my crafty <lb/>

            Look at him, please (to the AUDIENCE), revolving his cares <lb/>
            with brow severe, how he stands. He strikes his breast withhis <note type="footnote"> of a punishment among the Romans, which was especially inflicted upon slaves. It <lb/>
            was usually in shape like the let er T or X, but there were various other forms of it. <lb/>
            The condemned carried his own cross, and, being first stripped, was either nailed <lb/>
            or bound to it, and in the latter ase was generally left to die of hunger. It must <lb/>
            be remembered that in the time of the Roman Republic the laws did not protect <lb/>
            the person or life of the slaves, who were sometimes very barbarously treated. </note> <note type="footnote"> I Never goes begging)—Ver. 1 0. He uses a rather out-of-the-way simile here; <lb/>
            he means to say, "a woman never needs to go to a gardener's, who has a <lb/>
            garden of her own, with a most plentiful stock of artfulness," &amp;c. Some Com­ <lb/>
            mentators fancy that he means literally to say that women have always at hand <lb/>
            plenty of poisonous plants for the purposes of mischief, and that they need not the <lb/>
            assistance of the gardener or nurseryman when they wish to carry out their <lb/>

            shifts his posture; again he places his left hand upon his left <lb/>
            thigh. His right hand is reckoning down his plans upon his <lb/>
            fingers; in despair he strikes his thigh. His right hand is <lb/>
            moving rapidly1; with difficulty does it suggest what he is to do. <lb/>
            He snaps his fingers now; he's striving hard; full oft he changes <lb/>
            his position. But see how he shakes his head; it pleases <lb/>
            him not what he has hit upon. Whatever it is, nothing <lb/>
            crude will he bring forth, something well-digested will he pro­ <lb/>
            duce. But see, he is building; he has placed his hand as a <lb/>
            pillar2 beneath his chin. Have done with it! in truth, this <lb/>
            mode of building pleases me not; for I have heard say that the <lb/>
            head of a foreign Poets is wont to be supported thus, over <lb/>
            whom two guards are ever at all hours keeping watch. Bravo! <lb/>
            how becomingly he stands,—i’ faith, how like a very slavey <lb/>
            and how faithful to his part. Never, this day, will he rest, before <lb/>
            he has completed that which he is in search of. He has it, I <lb/>
            suspect. Come-to the business you're about: keep wide <lb/>

            motion imparted." “ Micare digitis" properly meant “ to play at a game called <lb/>
            ‘ mora,' " in which two persons suddenly raised or compressed the fingers, and at <lb/>
            the same moment each guessed the number of the other. The expression also <lb/>
            means, “ to determine anything by suddenly raising the fingers," as who is to do <lb/>
            or to have anything. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As a pillar)—Ver. 209. He means that Palæstrio looks up in thought, while <lb/>
            his clenched hand is placed, as though it were a pillar, beneath his chin. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Of a foreign Poet)—Ver. 211. “ Barbaro.” The speaker being supposed to be <lb/>
            a Greek, and a native'of Ionia, he would speak of a Roman as being " barbarus." <lb/>
            It is generally supposed that Plautus here refers to the Roman poet Nævius, who <lb/>
            had a habit of using this posture, and was, as is thought, at that moment in <lb/>
            prison for having offended, in one of his Comedies, the family of the Metelli. He <lb/>
            was afterwards liberated on having apologised in his plays called Kariolus (the <lb/>
            Wizard) and Leo (the Lion). Periplecomenus thinks that this posture bodes no <lb/>

          <p>PAL. Now, thus I would begin upon my plan; this con­ <lb/>

            your device.</p>

          <p>PERIP. Aye, most excellent. I'll say the same, if the <lb/>
            Captain shall inquire of me.</p>
          <p>PAL. But do you say that they are extremely alike; and <lb/>
            this must be imparted in time to Philocomasium, in order <lb/>
            that she may know; that she mayn't be tripping if the <lb/>

          <p>PERIP. I like what you say. PAL. Go in-doors then; and <lb/>
            if the damsel's there, bid her return home directly, and instruct <lb/>
            and tutor her thoroughly in this plan, that she may under­ <lb/>

            “jentaculum,” which, however, was in general confined to sick persons, the very <lb/>
            luxurious, or the labouring classes. From Martial we learn that it was taken <lb/>
            about four in the morning, and it can, therefore, hardly have corresponded with <lb/>
            our breakfast. Bread, with cheese or dried fruit, was used at this meal. The <lb/>
            “ prandium," which is here translated “ breakfast," is supposed to have been a <lb/>
            hasty meal, and tohave been taken from twelve to one o'clock in the day. <lb/>
            Sometimes it was of simple character, while occasionally fish, fruit, and wine formed <lb/>
            part of the repast, in which latter case it would almost correspond with the lun­ <lb/>

            referred to as furnishing one of the excuses to be made. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Is enjoying her rest)—Ver. 252. “ Operse non est" usually signifies "she is not <lb/>

            'tis a thing to be wondered at, how she has been able to re­ <lb/>

          <p>PAL. What did you dream ? PHIL. I'll tell you; but, I <lb/>
            pray you, give attention. Last night, in my sleep, my twin- <lb/>
            sister seemed to have come from Athens to Ephesus with a <lb/>
            certain person, her lover. Both of them seemed to me to be <lb/>
            having their lodgings here next door.</p>
          <p>PAL. (to the AUDIENCE). The dream that's being related <lb/>
            is Palæstrio's-pray, go on.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I seemed to be delighted because my sister had come, <lb/>
            and on her account I seemed to be incurring a most grievous <lb/>
            suspicion. For, in my sleep, my own servant seemed to <lb/>
            accuse me, as you are now doing, of being caressed by a <lb/>
            strange young man, whereas it was that own twin-sister of <lb/>
            mine, who had been toying with her own friend. Thus did <lb/>
            I dream that I was wrongfully accused of a crime.</p>
          <p>PAL. And isn't just the same thing befalling you when <lb/>
            awake, that you speak of as seen in your sleep? Capital; <lb/>
            i' faith, the dream is verified: go in-doors, and pray3. I <lb/>
            should recommend that this be told to the Captain. <note type="footnote"> 1 Do you credit me)-Ver. 364. " Viden ?" Literally, " do you look at me ?" <lb/>
            The Romans, when they wished to impress any one with the belief that they <lb/>
            were speaking seriously and in good faith, used this phrase, or " vide me," " look <lb/>
            at me now." Our expression, "do you look me in the face and say so?" is <lb/>

            out for Philocomasium, who is supposed at that moment to be in the Captain's <lb/>

            in his translation, suggests that he calls through the window, where it is natural to <lb/>
            imagine that Philocomasium might be stationed within hearing to observe all that <lb/>
            passed. He could hardly, however, call " through" the window of the ground- <lb/>

            there were rarely any windows at all on the basement. It is most likelv that <lb/>
            Philocomasium is hidden behind the " clatri" or " lattice" of the window in her <lb/>
            room on the first-floor, whence she observes all that passes. In a future line we <lb/>
            find Acrotelentium and Milphidippa owning that they had been watching from <lb/>

            obscure signification. The two lines probably mean, " The casks (cadi) would <lb/>
            not have fallen down there so very much, had it not been that one part of the <lb/>
            cellar was very slippery indeed." He then shows how (sic) the pot was put <lb/>
            close by the casks, so that, they slipping down, it was filled as often as ten times in <lb/>
            one day; and he concludes by saying, that when the pot acted the Bacchanal <lb/>
            (debacchabatur), the casks slipped down again. Probably by acting the Bac­ <lb/>
            chanal he means to say that the pot got filled and was then emptied, just like the <lb/>
            Bacchanals, who, doubtless, were not particular at vomiting a part of the enor­ <lb/>
            mous quantities of wine which they imbibed; and he naively tells the truth, by say­ <lb/>
            ing that the cask slipping was the result of the pot being emptied, and so laying <lb/>
            the fault more upon the pot than the drinker. </note> <pb n="114"/>

          <p>MIL. (as she enters). My Circus, then2, is before the house, <lb/>
            where my sports are to take place. I'll make pretence, as <lb/>
            though I didn't see them, or knew as yet that they are here.</p>
          <p>PYRG. Hush! let's quietly listen, whether any mention is <lb/>
            made of me.</p>
          <p>MIL. (aloud). Is there no one near at hand here, to attend to <lb/>
            another's business rather than his own?—to prowl after3 me to <lb/>
            see what I'm about P No one who is feeding this evening4 at <lb/>
            his own expense ? I dread such men as these, lest they should <lb/>
            now come in the way, or prove an hindrance somehow, should <lb/>
            my mistress privately pass from her house this way, who is so <lb/>
            enamoured of his person, who so dotes upon this very charming <lb/>
            man with his exceeding beauty-the Captain Pyrgopolinices.</p>
          <p>PYRG. And doesn't she dote upon me, too ? She is praising <lb/>
            my beauty.</p>
          <p>PAL. I' faith, her language stands in need of no ashes5.</p>
          <p>PYRG. For what reason? PAL. Why, because her lan­ <lb/>
            guage is clean spoken and far from slovenly. Whatever she <lb/>
            says about yourself, she handles it in no slovenly way. A ,id, <lb/>
            then, besides, she herself is a very pretty and a very dainty <lb/>

            one of their own at home. These latter persons, she thinks, living at their ease, <lb/>
            and not having to satisfy a hungry stomach, are likely to have more leisure for <lb/>

          <p>PAL. A certain lady loves a certain gentleman. <note type="footnote"> 1 This mackerel)—Ver. 1006. The " lacerta" was probably a delicate fish, <lb/>

            went out of doors. The name does not seem to have been given to every slave <lb/>
            who followed his master, but they belonged to a class which was almost the lowest <lb/>
            in the slave family. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Of these votaries)—Ver. 1016. " Baccharum." Literally, "one of the <lb/>

            had been duly initiated. These had a sign or password called " symbolum," or <lb/>
            " memoraculum," by which they recognised each other, and thus Milphidippa asks <lb/>
            Palæstrio to give her some proof that he is the right person for her to address. <lb/>
            This pretended caution is only assumed in the Captain's presence, in order the <lb/>

          <p>MIL. In the way in which I received it of you a short <lb/>

            and his appearance, and make mention of his prowess.</p>
          <p>MIL. For that purpose I am armed at all points1, as I have <lb/>

          <p>PYRG. What do you advise me now to do, Palæstrio, <lb/>
            about my mistress ? For this lady can by no means be re­ <lb/>
            ceived into my house before I have sent the other away.</p>
          <p>PAL. Why consult me what you are to do ? So far as <lb/>
            I am concerned, I have told you by what method that can <lb/>
            be effected in the gentlest manner. The gold trinkets and <lb/>
            female clothing with which you have furnished her, let her <lb/>
            keep it all for herself: let her take it, be off, and carry it <lb/>
            away: tell her that it is high time for her to go home; say <lb/>
            that her twin-sister and her mother are come, in company <lb/>
            with whom she may go straight home.</p>
          <p>PYRG. How do you know that they are here P</p>
          <p>PAL. Because, with my own eyes, I've seen her sister <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>PYRG. Have you met her ? PAL. I have met her.</p>
          <p>PYRG. And did she seem a brisk wench ?</p>
          <p>PAL. You are wishing to have everything.</p>
          <p>PYRG. Where did the sister say her mother was ?</p>
          <p>PAL. The captain that brought them told me that she was <note type="footnote"> I Overhearing)—Ver. 1090. Probably at the upper window, next door. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Nor touching you, nor)—Ver. 1092. This is an instance of Aposicpesis, it <lb/>

            in bed, on board the ship, with sore and inflamed eyes. <lb/>
            This captain of the ship is lodging with them next door.</p>
          <p>PYRG. And he, too, is he a very fine fellow ?</p>
          <p>PAL. Away with you, if you please. What have you1 to <lb/>
            do with him ? You have your hands quite full enough with <lb/>
            the women. Attend to this for the present.</p>
          <p>PYRG. As to that advice you were giving me, I wish you <lb/>
            to have afew words with her upon that subject. For, really, <lb/>
            a conversation on that subject with her is more becoming2 <lb/>
            for you.</p>
          <p>PAL. What is more advisable than for you to go yourself, <lb/>
            and transact your own concerns ? You must say that it is <lb/>
            absolutely necessary for you to marry: that your relations <lb/>
            are persuading, your friends are urging, you.</p>
          <p>PYRG. And do you think so ? PAL. Why shouldn't I <lb/>
            think so ?</p>
          <p>PYRG. I'll go in, then. Do you, in the mean time, keep <lb/>
            watch here before the house, that when the other woman <lb/>
            comes out you may call me out.</p>
          <p>PAL. Do you only mind the business that you are upon.</p>
          <p>PYRG. That, indeed, is resolved upon. For if she will not <lb/>
            go out of her own accord, I'll turn her out by force.</p>
          <p>PAL. Do you take care how you do that; but rather let her <lb/>
            go from your house with a good graceS, and give her those <lb/>
            things that I mentioned. The gold trinkets and apparel, with <lb/>
            which you furnished her, let her take away.</p>
          <p>PYRG. By my troth, I wish she would.</p>
          <p>PAL. I think you'll easily prevail upon her. But go in- <lb/>
            doors ; don't linger here.</p>
          <p>PYRG. I obey you. ( Goes into his house). PAL. (to the <lb/>
            AUDIENCE). Now, does be really appear to be anything dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from what, awhile ago, I told you he was, this wench­ <lb/>
            ing Captain ? Now it is requisite that Acroteleutium should <lb/>
            come to me, her maid too, and Pleusicles. 0 Jupiter! and <lb/>
            does not opportunity favour me in every respect ? For those <lb/>
            whom I especially wished to see, I perceive at this moment <lb/>
            coming out here from our neighbour's. <note type="footnote"> 1 What have you)—Ver. 1112. This passage is somewhat modified above. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Is more becoming)—Ver. 1116. He thinks it not suitable to his dignity to <lb/>

          <p>PAL. I, the master-plotter ? Nonsense.</p>
          <p>MIL. How so ? PAL. Because, in comparison with your­ <lb/>
            self, I am not worthy to fix a beam in a wall.</p>
          <p>ACROT. Aye, indeed so. PAL. She's a very fluent and a <lb/>
            very clever hand at mischief. How charmingly she did <lb/>
            polish off the Captain.</p>
          <p>MIL. But still, not enough. PAL. Be of good courage <lb/>
            all the business is now prospering under our hands. Only <lb/>
            do you, as you have begun, still give a helping hand; for <lb/>
            the Captain himself has gone in-doors, to entreat his mis­ <lb/>
            tress to leave his house, with her mother and sister, foi <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>PLEUS. Very good-well done. PAL. Besides, all the <lb/>
            gold trinkets and apparel which he himself has provided foi <lb/>
            the damsel, he gives her to keep as a present for herself­ <lb/>
            so have I recommended him.</p>
          <p>PLEUS. Really, it's easily done, if both she wishes it, and <lb/>
            lie desires it as well.</p>
          <p>PAL. Don't you know that when, from a deep well, you <lb/>
            have ascended up to the top, there is the greatest danger <lb/>
            lest you should thence fall back again from the top. This <lb/>
            affair is now being carried on at the top of the well. If the <lb/>
            Captain should have a suspicion of it, nothing whatever of his <lb/>
            will be able to be carried off. Now, most especially, we <lb/>
            have need of clever contrivances.</p>
          <p>PLEUS. I see that there is material enough at home for <lb/>
            that purpose-three women, yourself the fourth, I am the <lb/>
            fifth, the old gentleman the sixth.</p>

            it could be taken by these plans: only do you lend your <lb/>
            assistance.</p>
          <p>ACROT. For that purpose are we come to you, to see if you <lb/>
            wish for anything.</p>
          <p>PAL. You do what's a propos. Now to you do I assign <lb/>
            this departmentl.</p>
          <p>ACROT. General, you shall assign me whatever you please, <lb/>
            so far as I am capable.</p>
          <p>PAL. I wish this Captain to be played off -cleverly and <lb/>
            adroitly.</p>
          <p>ACROT. I' faith, you're assigning me what's a pleasure to <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>PAL. But do you understand how ? ACROT. You mean <lb/>
            that I must pretend that I am distracted with love for him.</p>
          <p>PAL. Right—you have it. ACROT. And as though by <lb/>
            reason of that love I had foregone2 my present marriage, <lb/>
            longing for a match with him.</p>
          <p>PAL. Everything exactly in its due order; except only <lb/>
            this one point; you must say that this house (pointing to <lb/>
            the house of PERIPLECOMENUS) was your marriage-portion : <lb/>
            that the old man had departed hence from you after you had <lb/>
            carried out the divorce, lest he should be afraid just now to , <lb/>
            come here into the house of another man.</p>
          <p>ACROT. You advise me well. PAL. But when he comes <lb/>
            out from in-doors, I wish you—standing at a distance there <lb/>
            -so to make pretence, as though in comparison with his <lb/>
            beauty you despised your own, and as though you were <note type="footnote"> 1 This department)—Ver. 1159. " Impero provinciam." This term was pro­ <lb/>
            perly applied to the Senate when bestowing a province upon a Proconsul or Pro­ <lb/>
            prætor. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ihadforegone)—Ver. 1164. To account for the facility with which the pre­ <lb/>
            tended divorce appears to take place, we must remember that among the Romans <lb/>
            either party was at liberty to dissolve the tie of marriage. Where a husband <lb/>
            divorced his wife, the wife's " dos," or marriage-portion, was in general restored <lb/>
            to her; and the same was the case where the divorce took place by mutual consent. <lb/>
            This will account for Acroteleutium asserting that she had been divorced from <lb/>
            Periplecomenus, and that she had retained possession of the house as having formed <lb/>
            her marriage-portion. As a loss of affection on either side was thought to consti­ <lb/>
            tute a good ground for divorce, is is not to be wondered at if the Captain should <lb/>
            believe the story that his neighbour's wife had obtained a divorce on account of he, <lb/>
            passion for himself. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

            his face. Are you tutored enough ?</p>
          <p>ACROT. I understand it all. Is it enough that I give you my <lb/>

          <p>PAL. I'm content. Now (addressing PLEUSICLES), in <lb/>

            master of a ship. Have on a broad-brimmed hat1 of iron- <lb/>
            grey, a woollen shade2 before your eyes ; have on an iron-grey <lb/>
            cloaks (for that is the seaman's colour) ; have it fastened over <lb/>

            * * * your clothes some way well girded up, pretend as <lb/>
            though you are some master of a ship. And all these re­ <lb/>

            me what I'm to do then ?</p>
          <p>PAL. Come here, and, in the name of her mother, bring <lb/>
            word to Philocomasium, that, if she would return to Athens, <lb/>
            she must go with you to the harbour directly, and that she <note type="footnote"> ' A broad-brimmed hat)—Ver. 1178. " Causia." See the note to 1. 851 of the <lb/>
            " Trinummus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A woollen shade)—Ver. 1178. " Culcitam laneam." The "culcita" here <lb/>
            alluded to was a little cushion padded with wool, which was placed before weak or <lb/>

            against the part affected, or else to have been held in the hand and applied every <lb/>
            now and then. Commentators seem to think that here Pleusicies holds it up to <lb/>
            his eye with his hand when addressing the Captain. They are at a loss to know <lb/>
            why Palæstrio recommends this, as the Captain has never seen Pleusicles, who <lb/>
            was at Naupactus when Philocomasium was carried off. Still, though it is not <lb/>
            mentioned, it may be, because the Captain bad seen Pleusicles before he went to <lb/>
            Naupactus; or, what is more probable, that, affecting to have weak eyes, Pleusicles <lb/>
            may not appear so comely as he really is, and not thereby excite any suspicion in <lb/>
            the Captain's mind as to his intentions. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 An iron-grey cloak)—Ver. 1179. Some think that the " ferrugineus," or iron <lb/>
            colour, here called "colos thalassinus," or "the sea-colour," was dark blue, but <lb/>
            dark grey seems more probable, as the shades of blue were too expensive for <lb/>
            common wear. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Right arm projecting out)—Ver. 1180. This no doubt was the way in which <lb/>

            deemed others more faithful to yourself than me, still do I <lb/>
            owe you many thanks for all things; and if such were your <lb/>

          <p>MNESILOCHUS, when absent at Ephesus, writes and requests his friend, Pisto­ <lb/>
            clerus, to search for his mistress, Bacchis, who has left Athens with a military <lb/>
            Captain. Having discovered her on her return to Athens, Pistoclerus falls in <lb/>
            love with her twin-sister, whose name is also Bacchis, and is severely reproved <lb/>
            by his tutor, Lydus, for so doing. Mnesilochus returns to Athens, and discovers <lb/>
            from Lydus that his friend Pistoclerus is in love with a female of the name of <lb/>
            Bacchis. He thereupon imagines that he has supplanted him with his own <lb/>
            mistress, and in his anger resolves to restore to his father some money of his <lb/>
            which he had gone to Ephesus to recover, and a part of which he had contrived, <lb/>
            through a scheme of the servant Chrysalus, to retain, in order that he might <lb/>
            redeem his mistress from the Captain. Having afterwards discovered the truth, <lb/>
            he greatly repents that he has done so, as the officer threatens to carry Bacchus <lb/>
            off instantly, if the money is not paid. On this, Chrysalus contrives another <lb/>
            stratagem against Nicobulus, his aged master, and makes him, through fear cf <lb/>
            the Captain's threats, pay the required sum. Having gained not only this but a <lb/>
            still further sum of money, the young men regale themselves at the house of <lb/>
            Bacchis. Nicobulus afterwards discovers from the Captain the trick that has <lb/>
            been played upon him, and he and Mnesilochus repair to the house of Bacchis to <lb/>
            demand their sons. The damsels, hereupon, apply themselves to coaxing the <lb/>
            old men, who are at last persuaded to forgive their sons and Chrysalus <lb/>

          <p>MNESILOCHUS is inflamed with love for Bacchis (Bacchidis). But, first of all, <lb/>
            lie goes to Ephesus, to bring back some gold (Aurum). Bacchis sails for <lb/>
            Crete (Cretam), and meets with (Convenit) the other Bacchis; thence she re­ <lb/>
            turns to Athens; upon this (Hinc), Mnesilochus sends a letter to Pistoclerus, <lb/>
            that he may seek for her (Illam). He returns; he makes a quarrel while <lb/>
            (Dum) he supposes that his own mistress is beloved by Pistoclerus; when they <lb/>
            have discovered the mistake as to the twin-sisters, Mnesilochus pays the gold <lb/>
            to that (Ei) Captain; equally are the two in love. The old men (Senes), while <lb/>
            they are looking after their sons, join the women, and carouse.</p>

            understand, allow me now to tell the name of this quiet play; <lb/>
            at the same time, you may learn why I have come to you. <lb/>
            Philemon2 formerly produced a play in Greek; this, those <lb/>
            who speak the Greek language call “Evantides3;” Plautus, <lb/>
            who speaks the Latin, calls it " Bacchides." 'Tis not to be <lb/>
            wondered, then, if hither I have come. Bacchus sends to you <lb/>
            the Bacchides—the Bacchanalian Bacchanals. I am bringing <lb/>
            them unto you. What! Have I told a lie ? It don't become <lb/>
            a God to tell a lie; but the truth I tell—I bring not them; <lb/>
            but the salacious ass, wearied with its journey, is bringing <lb/>
            to you three, if I remember right. One you behold; see <lb/>
            now, what on my lips I bring-to wit, two Samian sisters4, <lb/>
            Bacchanalians, merry Courtesans, born of the same parents, <lb/>
            at one time, at a twin-birth; not less alike than milk to milk, <lb/>
            if you compare it, or water to water; were you to see them <lb/>
            you would think them halved5; so much would you confuse <lb/>
            your sight, that you would not be able to distinguish which <lb/>
            was which. What remains you long to hear. Now give at­ <lb/>

            Samos is, is known to all; for seas, lands, mountains, and <lb/>
            islands, have your legions6 made easy of access. There, Sostrata <lb/>

            invented by the author. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Philemon)—Ver. 36. Philemon was a Greek Comic poet, of considerable merit, <lb/>
            though inferior to Menander, of whom he was a contemporary. This play is more <lb/>
            generally supposed to have been borrowed from a Comedy of Menander, which was <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δὶς Εξαπατω̃ν</foreign>, " the Twice Deceived." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Evantides)—Ver. 37. “Evantides" corresponds with the Latin word “Bac­ <lb/>
            chantes," “followers,” or “namesakes" of Bacchus," as “Evan” was one of the <lb/>
            names by which that God was addressed during the celebration of the orgies. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Samian sisters)—Ver. 46. Samos was an island off the coast of Ionia, near <lb/>

            two names. They have here been introduced either for the sake of the metre, or, <lb/>
            as the Dolphin editor suggests, as meaning “her husband Pyrocles, who was a <lb/>
            regular Pyrgoteles," that is, a most skilful engraver; a celebrated artist of thai <lb/>

            ennial festivall of Bacchus, to call after his name the damsels <lb/>
            of which they were the parents. The parents, as often hap­ <lb/>
            pens, gave a turn to- their future fortunes. A Captain car­ <lb/>
            ried one of them with him to Crete. The other of the twins <lb/>
            sailed for Athens3. As soon as Mnesilochus, the so a of Ni­ <lb/>
            cobulus, beheld her, he began to love her, and frequently <lb/>
            paid her visits. Meantime, his father sent the youth to <lb/>
            Ephesus, to bring back thence some gold, which he himself, <lb/>
            some time before, had deposited with Archidemides, an an­ <lb/>
            cient friend of his, an aged Phœnician. When, for two years <lb/>
            he had stayed at Ephesus, he received the sad news that <lb/>
            Bacchis was gone from Athens, for some sailors of his ac­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            quaintance sent him word that she had set sail. On this, he <lb/>
            writes a letter to Pistoclerus, his only friend, the son of Phi­ <lb/>
            loxenus, entreating him to seek the fugitive with care and ear­ <lb/>
            nestness. While Pistoclerus is devoting his services to his <lb/>
            friend, the twin-sisters, who have just returned to Athens, <lb/>
            arouse a passion in the seeker. The one wins Pistoclerus for <lb/>
            herself; the other longs for the coming of Mnesilochus. What <lb/>
            wonder if two bewitching, merry, pretty Bacchantes, should <lb/>
            attract to themselves two unfledged Bacchanalians, and if <lb/>
            they should ensnare their decrepit, most aged fathers, fit <lb/>

            which occurred every three years, and was called the “Trieterica.” On that occa­ <lb/>
            sion the Bacchantes carried the figure of the God on a chariot, drawn by two tigers <lb/>
            or panthers, and crowned with vine leaves; holding thyrsi in their hands, they <lb/>
            ran in a frantic manner around the chariot, filling the air with the sound of tarn­ <lb/>
            hourines and brazen instruments, shouting “Evoë Bacche," and calling the God <lb/>
            by his several names of Bromius, Lyæus, Evan, Lenæus, and Sabazius. To this <lb/>
            ceremonial, which was derived from the Egyptians, the Greeks added other <lb/>
            rites, replete with licentiousness and repulsive to decency. The author says <lb/>
            that the parents of the Bacchides were initiated at this festival, and that in com­ <lb/>
            pliment to the God they named each of the newly-born twins “Bacchis.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gave a turn to)—Ver. 62. " Fata occupant." “Consider the fact of their <lb/>

            ning of the thirty-fifth line, is translated from the fragments of the beginning of the <lb/>
            play which have been lately discovered by the research of Ritschel. It was gene­ <lb/>
            rally supposed by Commentators that the beginning of the play had been lost, and <lb/>
            that the author of the Prologue, or some other writer, had supplied the hiatus by <lb/>
            adding a first scene of his own composition; in which he represents, somewhat in­ <lb/>
            consistently, Pistoclerus as having been in love with the First Bacchis before the <lb/>
            play began, whereas it is obviously the intention of Plautus to represent him as <lb/>
            drawn into the amour by her allurements during the First Act. It is worthy of <lb/>
            remark, that the learned and ingenious Rost was of opinion that the beginning of <lb/>
            this play had not been lost, and that it properly commenced at line 35, “Quod si <lb/>
            hoc potis est." This opinion, however, is thoroughly controverted by the result of <lb/>
            the researches of Ritschel. Although, for the sake of brevity, these fragments are <lb/>
            here grouped into one Scene, to supply the place of the spurious Scene which for­ <lb/>
            merly occupied their place, it is clear that they are really the remnants of several <lb/>
            Scenes, introductory to the attempt of the First Bacchis to entrap Pistoclerus. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Those who are)—Ver. 1. It is not unlikely that this and the next three ines <lb/>

            the ingenuity shown by the slave Chrysalus throughout the piece, as he is making <lb/>
            reference to the punishment of slaves when speaking of " chains, rods, ani the <unclear/> <lb/>

            First Bacchis, with whom, by this time, he has probably bad an interview on the <lb/>

            he is looking for, but that she is under the protection of a mighty Captain, whose <lb/>
            breast heaves like a pair of blacksmith's bellows. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Is of Præneste)—Ver. 24. He has a hit here at the people of Præneste, whom <lb/>

            sisters, about ?</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. Nothing is there more wretched than a woman.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. What, say you, is there more worthy of it ? What <lb/>
            have you been planning in your consultation ?</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. What's proper ? PISTOC. I' faith, that doesn't <lb/>
            belong to the Courtesan.</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. This sister of mine entreats me so to find some <lb/>
            person to protect her against this Captain; that when she <lb/>
            has served her time2 he may bring her back home. Do you, <lb/>
            I entreat you, be her protector.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Why should I protect her? 1st BACCH. That <lb/>
            she may be brought home again, when she has fulfilled her <lb/>
            engagement to him, so that he may not take her as a servant3 <lb/>
            for himself. But, if she had the gold to pay him back again, <lb/>
            gladly would she do so.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Where now is this person ? 1st BACCH. I expect <note type="footnote"> I May lose her powers)—Ver. 38. The nightingale was supposed to sing con- I <lb/>
            tinually; so that “ lusciniæ deest cantio," “the nightingale has lost her song,' <lb/>
            became a proverb which expressed the happening of anything extraordinary. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Has served her time)—Ver. 43. “ Emeritus" was the term applied to soldiers <lb/>
            who had “ served out their time," or “ got their discharge ” Plautus probably I <lb/>
            uses the term satirically, as applied to the engagement which the Second Bacchis <lb/>
            had made with the Captain. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 As aservant)—Ver. 45. She pretends that her sister is afraid, that when her <lb/>
            time has expired, the Captain-having carried her to a foreign country—may make <lb/>
            a slave of her, and that she s, consequently, desirous to be left at Athens, and to <lb/>
            repay him the money which he had given her upon the making of the engagement. <lb/>
            She feigns that it is necessary for him to protect her sister on behalf of his absenl <lb/>

          <p>PISTOC. Your coaxing is mere birdlime. 1st BACCH. How <lb/>
            so ?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Because, in fact, I understand how you two are <lb/>
            aiming at one poor pigeon, myself; (aside) very nearly is the <lb/>
            limed reed1 breaking my feathers. Madam, I judge that such <lb/>
            deeds befit me not.</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. Why so, I pray ?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Bacchis, it is, because I dread you Bacchantes, and <lb/>
            your Bacchanalian den2.</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. What is it that you dread ? Surely, not that <lb/>
            the couch in my house may lead you into mischief?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Your allurements3, more than your couch, do I <lb/>
            dread. You're a mischievous serpent4. But, madam, a <lb/>
            lurking-place does not befit this youthful age.</p>
          <p>1st BACCH. Should you wish at my house to do anything <lb/>
            that's unwise, I myself should hinder it. But, when the <lb/>
            Captain comes, I wish you. to be at my house for this reason; <lb/>
            because, when you are present, no one will do her and me <lb/>
            any injury. You will prevent that, and by the same means <lb/>
            you will be aiding your friend; this Captain, too, on arriving, <lb/>
            will suspect that I am your mistress. Why are you silent, <lb/>
            pray ?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Because these things are pleasant in the talking <lb/>
            of; but in the practice, and when you make trial, the same <lb/>
            are armed with stings. They pierce the feelings, goad one's <lb/>
            fortune, and wound one's merits and character.</p>
          <p>2nd BACCH. What do you dread from her ?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. What do I dread, do you ask ? Am I a person in <note type="footnote"> 1 The limed reed)—Ver. 51. A reed dipped in birdlime was employed for the <lb/>
            purpose of catching birds. Pistoclerus says to himself that he feels how nearly <lb/>
            he is entrapped. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Your Bacchanalian den)—Ver. 53. "Bacchanal" was properly the place <lb/>
            where the Bacchanalia, or orgies, were celebrated. He styles them “ Bacchantes," <lb/>
            and their house a “ Bacchanal," in allusion both to their names and their habits. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Your allurements)—Ver. 55. There is a play here upon the resemblance of <lb/>
            he words “ illectus,” “ allurement," and “lectus,” a " bed." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Mischievous serpent)—Ver. 55. “ Mala tu's bestia." Literally, “ you are an <lb/>
            vil beast;" which sounds harsh to an English ear, even when applied to such an <lb/>
            animal as Bacchis. </note> <pb n="156"/>

            the coat of mail I should have to assume a soft cloak 6 ; where, <lb/>
            too, in place of a horse a couch must be given me,—for shield, <lb/>

            Captain comes here, I want you8 to embrace me. <note type="footnote"> I A place of exercise)—Ver. 66. He draws a parallel between the life of a per­ <lb/>
            son who for health and rational recreation frequents the “ palæstra,” or <unclear>school</unclear> <lb/>
            for exercise, and of those who frequent the haunts of Courtesans. He alludes in <lb/>
            the following lines to the exercises of throwing the quoit, running, boxing, <lb/>
            fencing, hUlling the lance, and riding. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A turtle-dove)—Ver. 68. The turtle-dove, as being sacred to Venus, would <lb/>
            be an appropriate inmate of a Courtesan's house. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The goblet)—Ver. 69. “ Cantharus " was a kind of drinking-cup, with two <lb/>
            handles. It was considered as peculiarly sacred to Bacchus, the tutelary Divinity <lb/>
            of Bacchis, whom Pistoclerus is addressing. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The drinking-cup)—Ver. 70. “ Scaphium " here probably means a “ drinking. <lb/>
            vessel with a swelling belly." Some Commentators, however, think that it has here <lb/>
            the same meaning as " matula." </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Instead of the crest)—Ver. 70. The " insigne” was the crest, or waving <lb/>
            plume of the helmet. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 A soft cloak)—Ver. 71. It was the custom at entertainments for the re­ <lb/>

            dered. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 For shield, a strumpet)—Ver. 72. “ Scortum pro scuto” There is a play <lb/>

            tain comes, by way of accounting for his presence and interference on behalf o <lb/>

          <p>1st BACCH. Near myself, my life, that with a she wit a he <lb/>

            was written before the Bacchides. With a rather unusual degree of license he seems <lb/>
            to refer to an event that has recently happened, and it is not improbable that the <lb/>
            “ Epidicus," good play as it was, had suffered from the demerits of some contempti­ <lb/>
            ble actor of the day, known as Pollio. Plautus thus excuses his play, and excites a <lb/>
            laugh by the quaintness of the remark. There is a passage in the Nigrinus of <lb/>
            Lucian that throws light on this: " Friend, have you never seen a bad Tragic <lb/>
            or Comic actor ? some of those I mean who are hissed because they spoil a good <lb/>

            his ruin. For had he been without you, I should have had <lb/>
            him trained up to moral rectitude; now, by reason of you and <lb/>

            What means this, that Lydus is thus exciting his master, Pis­ <lb/>
            toclerus ?</p>
          <p>PHILO. 'Tis but a little time, Lydus, that a man has a <lb/>
            desire to indulge his inclinations; the time will soon come, <lb/>
            when he will hate himself even. Humour him; so that care <lb/>

          <p>LYD. I'll suffer him not, nor, for my part, while I'm alive, <lb/>
            will I allow him to be corrupted. But you, who are plead­ <lb/>
            ing his cause for a son so profligate, was this same your own <lb/>
            training, when you were a young man ? I declare that for <lb/>
            your first twenty years you had not even this much liberty, to <lb/>
            move your foot out of the house even a finger's length away <lb/>
            from your tutor. When it did happen so, this evil, too, was <lb/>
            added to the evil; both pupil and preceptor were esteemed <lb/>
            disgraced. Before the rising of the sun had you not come <lb/>
            to the school for exercise 1, no slight punishment would you <lb/>
            have had at the hands of the master of the school. There <lb/>
            did they exercise themselves rather with running, wrestling, <lb/>
            the quoit, the javelin, boxing, the ball, and leaping, rather <lb/>
            than with harlots or with kissing; there did they prolong <lb/>
            their lives2, and not in secret-lurking holes. Then, when <lb/>
            from the hippodromes and school of exercise you had returned <lb/>
            home, clad in your belted frock4, upon a stool by your master5 <lb/>
            would you sit; and there, when you were reading your book, <note type="footnote"> 1 The school for exercise)—Ver. 426. “ Palaestram." This was the school fur <lb/>
            athletic exercise, probably for both youths and men; though it has been contended <lb/>

            the men. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Prolonq their lives)—Ver. 430. “ Extendere aetatem " probably means here, <lb/>

            if you made a mistake in a single syllable, your skin would <lb/>
            be made as spotted as your nurse's gown 1.</p>
          <p>MNES, (aside). I'm sorely vexed, to my sorrow, that on my <lb/>
            account these things should be said about my friend. In his <lb/>
            innocence he incurs this suspicion for my sake.</p>
          <p>PHILO. The manners, Lydus, now are altered.</p>
          <p>LYD, That, for my part, I know full well. For formerly, a <lb/>
            man used to receive public honors by the votes of the people, <lb/>
            before he ceased to be obedient to one appointed' his tutor. <lb/>
            But now-a-days, before he is seven years old, if you touch a <lb/>
            boy with your hand, at once the child breaks his tutor's head <lb/>
            with his tablet. When you go to complain to the father, <lb/>
            thus says the father to the child: “ Be you my own dear boy, <lb/>
            since you can defend yourself from an injury." The tutor then <lb/>
            is called for; " Hallo! you old good-for-nothing2, don't you <lb/>
            be touching the child for this reason, that he has behaved <lb/>
            so boldly;" and thus the despised tutor becomes just like a <lb/>
            lantern3 with his oiled linen rags. Judgment pronounced, <lb/>
            they go away thence. Can this preceptor then, on these terms, <lb/>
            keep up his authority, if he himself is to be beaten the first ?</p>
          <p>MITES, (aside). This is a severe accusation. So far as I <lb/>
            understand his words, 'tis strange if Pistoclerus has never <lb/>
            thumped Lydus with his fists.</p>
          <p>LYD. (seeing MNESILOCIIUS). But who is it that I see stand­ <lb/>
            ing here before the door ? 0 Philoxenus, I would not prefer <lb/>
            for myself to behold even the propitious Gods rather than him.</p>
          <p>PHILO. Who's this ? LYD. Why, he's Mnesilochus, the <lb/>
            friend of your son. He is not of a like turn of mind with <lb/>
            him who reclines and takes his meals in brothels. Fortu­ <lb/>
            nate Nicobulus ! who begot him for himself. <note type="footnote"> I Your nurse's gown)—Ver. 434. It is not known whether the words “ macu­ <lb/>
            losum pallium " refer here to a kind of spotted gown, perhaps of dark pattern, <lb/>
            peculiar to nurses, or to the dirty, soiled appearance which, not improbably, their <lb/>
            gowns usually presented. Some Commentators take a wider range, and think <lb/>
            that the passage refers to the robe of Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, which was <lb/>
            made of the skin of a panther. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 You old good-for-nothing)—Ver. 444. That is, in his capacity as a slave, a <lb/>
            purchaseable commodity. </note><note type="footnote"> a Just like a lantern)—Ver. 446. This passage has been much discussed by <lb/>
            various Commentators. It is, however, most probable that the Romans used <lb/>
            lanterns made of oiled linen cloth; and that lie is comparing his head, when it <lb/>
            has been broken by the tablets, and plaistered over with oiled linen, to one of <lb/>
            these lanterns. In his Epistles to Atticus, B. 4, Ep. 3, Cicero makes mention o <lb/>

            (Aloud.) Health to you, Mnesilochus !</p>
          <p>MNES. Hail ! PISTOC. As you are arrived safe from <lb/>
            abroad, a dinner must be given.</p>
          <p>MNES. A dinner pleases me not, which excites my choler.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Has any vexation befallen you on your arrival ?</p>
          <p>MNES. Aye, and a very grievous one.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. From what quarter ? MNES. From a person <lb/>
            whom heretofore I had supposed to be my friend.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Many live after that manner and method, who, <lb/>
            when you think them to be friends, are found false with their <lb/>
            deceitfulness, strong in their talking, slothful in their doing, <lb/>
            of faith infirm. Not one is there whom they don't envy on their <lb/>
            enjoying prosperity; through their own indolence do they <lb/>
            themselves take right good care that no envy is directed <lb/>
            against them.</p>
          <p>MNES. By my troth, you surely understand their ways most <lb/>
            thoroughly. But still this one misfortune do they find from <lb/>
            their bad disposition ; they are the friends of no one, while <lb/>
            they themselves are all at enmity against themselves; and <lb/>
            these, while they are deceiving themselves, in their foolishness <lb/>
            imagine that others are deceived. Just so is he whom I sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be as much a friend to me as I am to my own self. He, <lb/>
            so far as in him lay, has taken all care to do whatever injury <lb/>
            he could towards me, to turn all my own resources against me.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. This same must me a bad man.</p>
          <p>.SINES. I judge that so he is,</p><pb n="179"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> Sc. VI. </note> PISTOC. Troth now, prithee, do tell me who it is.</p>
          <p>MNES. He lives on good terms with yourself. But were <lb/>
            he not so, I would entreat you to do him whatever harm you <lb/>
            could do.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Only tell me the person, who he is; if I don't do <lb/>
            him an injury, some way or other, do you say that I'm the <lb/>
            greatest of cowards.</p>
          <p>MNES. The person's a bad one, but he's your friend, i' faith.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. So much the rather, then, tell me who he is. In <lb/>
            good sooth, I set no value on the esteem of a worthless per­ <lb/>
            son.</p>
          <p>MNES. I appear, then, not to be able to avoid disclosing to <lb/>
            you his name. Pistoclerus, you have utterly undone me, <lb/>
            your friend.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. How's that ? MNES. How's that ? Did I not <lb/>
            send you a letter from Ephesus about my mistress, that you <lb/>
            should find her out for me ?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. I own you did ; and I have discovered her.</p>
          <p>MNES. How now ? Was there not a choice for you of other <lb/>
            Courtesans in Athens, for you to form engagements with, <lb/>
            instead of with her whom I had recommended to your care ? <lb/>
            Could you yourself begin to love, and to contrive an injury <lb/>
            against myself?</p>
          <p>PISTOC. Are you in your senses ? MNES. I have found <lb/>
            out the whole affair from your tutor ; don't deny it. You've <lb/>
            ruined me.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. What, still upbraiding me without reason with <lb/>
            these rebukes of yours ?</p>
          <p>MNES. Why ? You're in love with Bacchis.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. But look you, two persons of the name of Bacchis <lb/>
            are living here in this house.</p>
          <p>MNES. How, two ? PISTOC. Aye, and the two are sisters.</p>
          <p>MNES. You are now designedly telling idle stories.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. In fine, if you persist in thinking there's but little <lb/>
            confidence in me, I'll take you upon my shoulders, and carry <lb/>
            you hence into their house.</p>
          <p>MNES. Well, I'll go; but stay a moment.</p>
          <p>PISTOC. I will not stay, and you shall not be holding me <lb/>
            under a false suspicion.</p>
          <p>MNES. I follow you then. (They go into the home of <lb/>

            statue of gold should be erected for him. For, this day, two <lb/>
            exploits have I achieved; with twofold spoils have I been <lb/>
            graced. So cleverly have I gulled my elder master this day, <lb/>
            that he has been made a fool of. The crafty old blade, by my <lb/>
            crafty tricks, have I compelled and constrained to believe me <lb/>
            in everything. Then, for the son of the old gentleman, my <lb/>
            master here in love, together with whom I drink, with whom I <lb/>
            cat and go a-courting, I have procured regal and golden trea­ <lb/>
            sures, that he may take from thence at home, and not go <lb/>
            seeking abroad. Those Parmenos2, and those Syruses, please <lb/>
            me not, who filch some two or three minæ from their masters. <lb/>
            There's nothing more worthless than a servant without skill- <lb/>
            worthless, if he has not a breast mightily well-stocked, so that, <lb/>
            whenever there is necessity, he may draw his supply from his <lb/>
            own breast. No one can be a person well to do * * * <lb/>
            unless he understands both how to do good and how to do evil. <lb/>
            With rogues he must be a rogue; with thieves let him filch <lb/>
            whatever he can. It befits him who is truly wise, to be a person <lb/>
            that can shift his very skins. Good with the good let him be, <lb/>
            bad with the bad: just as things are, so let him ever frame <lb/>
            his humour. But I should like to know how much gold my <lb/>
            master has taken for himself, and what he has given up to his <lb/>
            father. If he is a prudent person, he has made a Hercules4 of <lb/>
            his parent: he has given him the tenth part, and has kept back <lb/>
            nine for himself. But, see! the person whom I was looking <lb/>

            And even then two fatalities were remaining, and no further <lb/>
            had I taken this city. Afterwards, when I carried the letter <lb/>

            her, and persuaded her to let him go, so I, by my devices, <lb/>
            have rescued myself from the danger, and have deceived the <lb/>
            old man. Afterwards, I engaged with the blustering Cap­ <lb/>
            tain, who, unarmed, takes cities with his words, and there I <lb/>
            repulsed my man. Then I engaged in fight with the old gen­ <lb/>
            tleman ; straightway by one lying device did I vanquish him ; <lb/>
            by one blow, in a moment, did I take the spoils away from <lb/>
            him. He now will give the two hundred Philippean pieces <lb/>

            to him of old. Not fifty sons only has he, but four hundred, <lb/>
            and all choice ones, without a blemish; all these this day <lb/>

            won't run the risk, that if any mistake is made, you should <lb/>
            say that you had done it by my counsel. But, as I conceive, <lb/>
            if I were in your place, I would rather give the gold than <lb/>
            suffer him to be corrupted. There is a twofold choice ; con­ <lb/>

          <p>THE plot of this Play (which is supposed by some Commentators not to have been <lb/>
            written by Plautus) is extremely meagre. Antipho, a wealthy and jovial old <lb/>
            gentleman of Athens, has two daughters, Philumena and Pamphila. They are <lb/>
            married to two brothers, Epignomus and Pamphilus, who, having run through <lb/>
            their property in the company of idlers and Parasites, have, with the view of <lb/>
            retrieving their fortunes, taken to merchandize. Having been absent three years <lb/>
            from home, and no tidings being heard of them whether they are alive or not <lb/>
            Antipho assumes the prerogative of a father, and requests his daughters to <lb/>
            marry again; who resolve, however, to maintain their fidelity to their absent <lb/>
            husbands. Pbilumena sends the Parasite, Gelasimus, to the harbour to see if <lb/>
            any ships have arrived. In the meantime, the boy, Pinacium, brings her word <lb/>
            that her husband has returned to Athens. He and his brother meet the <lb/>
            Parasite, and resist all his attempts to fasten himself upon them; they then go <lb/>
            home, and become reconciled to Antipho, from whom, in their poverty, they had <lb/>
            become estranged; and who now requests them to make him a present of a <lb/>
            female slave. Stichus, the servant, obtains a day's holiday, together with a <lb/>
            present from his master of a cask of wine. He makes an entertainment for <lb/>
            himself, his friend Sagarinus, and their mistress Stephanium. The Play con­ <lb/>
            eludes with a dance, to the music of the Piper.</p><pb n="213"/>

          <p>PHIL. Sister, I think that Penelope was wretched from <lb/>
            her very soul, who was so long deprived of her husband; for <lb/>
            from our own fortunes, whose husbands are absent from us, we <lb/>
            judge of her feelings; for whose affairs, still, in their absence, <lb/>
            both night and day, sister, as is becoming, we are ever anxious.</p>
          <p>PAM. 'Tis right that we should do our duty; and we do <lb/>
            not that any further than affection bids us.</p>
          <p>PHIL. But, sister, step this way a moment; I want to speak <lb/>
            about the affairs of my husband.</p>
          <p>PAM. Ain't they prospering, pray ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. I hope and wish so, indeed. But, sister, at this am <lb/>
            I vexed, that your and my father, one who is esteemed as espe- <note type="footnote"> I Stichus) Plautus has named this Play " Stichus," from the servant, who is o <lb/>
            of the characters in it, though not the principal one, as Gelasimus, the P <lb/>
            certainly occupies that place. </note> <pb n="214"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act. I. </note> <lb/>
            cially honorable among all his fellow-citizens, should be <lb/>
            now acting the part of a dishonorable man; who is unde­ <lb/>
            servedly doing so great an injustice to our absent husbands, <lb/>
            and is wishing to separate us from them. These things, <lb/>
            sister, render me tired of existence; these things are a care <lb/>
            and a vexation to me. (She sheds tears.)</p>
          <p>PAM. Weep not, sister, nor do that to your feelings which <lb/>
            your father is threatening to do. 'Tis to be hoped1 that he will <lb/>
            act more righteously. I know him well; he says these things <lb/>
            in jest; and he would not earn for himself the mountains of the <lb/>
            Persians, which are said to be of gold2, to do that of which <lb/>
            you are in dread. Still, if he does do it, it befits you by no <lb/>
            means to be angry; nor will it happen without some reason. <lb/>
            For this is the third year since our husbands have been away <lb/>
            from home.</p>
          <p>PHIL. 'Tis as you say; while, in the meantime, they <lb/>
            may be living, and may be wells, they do not make us ac­ <lb/>
            quainted where they are, what they are doing, whether they <lb/>
            are doing well, neither do they return.</p>
          <p>PAM. And do you, sister, regret this, that they do not <lb/>
            observe their duty, whereas you do yours ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. Troth, I do. PAM. Hold your peace, if you please; <lb/>
            take care, please, that I hear not that same thing from you in <lb/>
            future.</p>
          <p>PHIL. And why, pray ? PAM. Because, i' faith, in my <lb/>
            opinion, 'tis proper for all prudent people to observe and to <lb/>
            do their duty. For that reason, sister, although you are the <lb/>
            older, I advise you to remember your duty; and if they are <lb/>
            unjust and act otherwise to us than is right, then, i' faith, in <lb/>
            exactly the same degree, that there may be no further mis­ <lb/>
            chief, it befits us studiously to remember our duty by all <lb/>
            means in our power.</p>
          <p>PHIL. 'Tis good; I'm silenced. PAM. But do take care <lb/>
            and remember it.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I do not wish, sister, to be thought to be unmindful <lb/>
            of my husband; nor has he thrown away the distinction that <note type="footnote"> I 'Tis to be hoped)-Ver. 22. " Spes est." Literally, " there is a hope." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Said to be of gold)-Ver. 25. No doubt, as the Persians were from an early <lb/>

            he conferred upon me. For, by my troth, his kindness is <lb/>
            pleasing and delightful to me ; and, really, this choice of mine <lb/>
            is not now irksome to me, nor is there any reason why I should <lb/>
            wish to abandon this match. But, in fine, 'tis placed in our <lb/>
            father's power1; that must be done by -as which our rela­ <lb/>

          <p>PAM. I know it, and in thinking of it I am overwhelmed with <lb/>
            grief; for already has he almost disclosed his sentiments.</p>

          <p>ANT. The man in condition of a servant who always waits <lb/>
            to be told his duty, and doesn't remember to do it of his <lb/>
            own accord, that servant, I say, is not of a deserving character. <lb/>

            my house is clean, when I return home. I shall soon be back <lb/>
            home; I'm going to her house, to see my eldest daughter. <lb/>

          <p>PHIL. (aside). What are we to do, sister, if our father shall <lb/>
            resolve against us ? <note type="footnote"> 1 In our father's power)-Ver. 53. By the law of the Twelve Tables at Rome, <lb/>
            females were never " sui juris," but under a perpetual guardianship; and even <lb/>
            marriage did not entirely exempt them from parental authority, unless they had <lb/>
            been emancipated from it before. Among the Greeks also, parents exercised great <lb/>
            authority in disposing of their daughters in marriage. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Allotment of provisions)-Ver. 60. The Greeks, it must be borne in mind, <lb/>
            had no Calends (whence the proverb " ad Græcas Calendas," " to-morrow come <lb/>
            never"); the Poet is here alluding to the Roman custom of distributing to the <lb/>

            favour, I trust to obtain it of him. Oppose him we cannot, <lb/>
            without disgrace and extreme criminality; I will neither do <lb/>
            that myself, nor will I give you the advice to do it, but rather <lb/>
            that we should entreat him. I know our family1; he will <lb/>
            yield to entreaty.</p>
          <p>ANT. (speaking to himself). In the first place, in what <lb/>
            manner I should make a beginning with them, about that I <lb/>
            am in doubt; whether I should accost them in language <lb/>
            couched in ambiguous terms, after this fashion, as though I <lb/>
            had never pretended2 anything at all against them, or whether <lb/>
            as though I had heard that they were deserving of some cen­ <lb/>
            sure against them ; whether I should rather try them gently <lb/>
            or with threats. I know that there will be opposition ; I know <lb/>
            my daughters right well. If they should prefer to remain <lb/>
            here rather than to marry afresh, why, let them do so. What <lb/>
            need is there for me, the term of my life run out, to be waging <lb/>
            war with my children, when I think that they don't at all de­ <lb/>
            serve that I should do so ? By no means ; I'll have no dis­ <lb/>
            turbances. But I think that this is the best thing to be <lb/>
            done by me; I'll do thus; I'll pretend as though they had <lb/>
            themselves been guilty of some fault; I'll terribly terrify <lb/>
            their minds this day by some ambiguous expressions; and <lb/>
            then, after that, as I shall feel disposed, I'll disclose my­ <lb/>

            Lexicon, " I am dejected" or " I am in an ill humour." That, however, does <lb/>
            not appear to be the meaning. The father has had kissing enough from his <lb/>
            daughters, but he intends, as it would seem, to compliment them by comparing <lb/>
            their kisses to salt, with its refreshing and vivifying powers; and when Philumena <lb/>
            asks for one kiss more, he says, " No, as it is (ita) their refreshing power has <lb/>
            reached my soul." Host seems to be of this opinion, but be suggests that " animæ <lb/>
            meæ" are vocatives plural; in that case the passage would mean, " as it is, my <lb/>
            loves," or "my delights, the refreshing salt of your affection has reached me." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 On the bench)-Ver. 93. " Subsellium" generally means " a footstool," used <lb/>
            by persons when sitting on a high seat. Here, however, it probably signifies " a <lb/>

            "enough is it thus supported." She has brought out the cushion, and has <lb/>
            placed it upon or at the back of the hard bench, which was perhaps something <lb/>

            By reason of poverty, in fact, did I acquire this name, because <lb/>
            it was poverty that made me to be a droll; for whenever she <lb/>

            set. But on our family such complacence has been bestowed <lb/>
            —I am in the habit of refusing no person, if any one asks me * <lb/>

            died away with people, and one, i' faith, most beseeming and <lb/>
            most elegant to my thinking, which formerly they employed: <lb/>
            " Come here to dinner-do so-really, do promise-don't make <lb/>
            any difficulties-is it convenient ?—I wish it to be so, I say; <lb/>
            I'll not part with you unless you come." But now, in the <lb/>
            present day, they have found a substitute for these expres­ <lb/>
            sions-a saying, by my faith, truly right worthless and <lb/>
            most vile: " I'd invite you to dinner, were I not dining <lb/>
            out myself." I' faith, I wish the very loins of that <lb/>

            " parasitical little perjuries." This is probably meant in reference to the adjura­ <lb/>
            tions so common among the ancients on the most trivial occasions, and of which <lb/>
            the Parasite promises to be lavish in speaking in praise of his entertainer. The <lb/>
            diminutive “ uncula” suits the measure, and also shows the air of self-satisfaction <lb/>
            with which he mentions that which he takes to be of the same harmless nature <lb/>
            which some easy casuists among ourselves attribute to what they choose to call white <lb/>
            lies. Indeed, the ancients esteemed perjury very much according to the subject on <lb/>
            which it was employed. Ovid mentions Mercury as laughing at the perjuries of <lb/>
            cheating tradesmen, and Jupiter as smiling at those of lovers; surely, then, " a little <lb/>
            bit of a perjury" (the true meaning of “ perjeratiuncula") could not be amiss on <lb/>
            an occasion so trivial, and yet, to the Parasite, so all-important, as the acquisition <lb/>
            of a good dinner. </note><note type="footnote"> 4A rustyfresh-scraper)—Ver. 228. The "strigil" was an instrument used by <lb/>
            the Greeks and Romans in the place of the flesh-brush of modern times. It was <lb/>
            made of bone, iron, copper, and sometimes of silver. It was used after taking <lb/>
            the “ sudatorium," or sweating-bath, for the purpose of scraping the perspiration <lb/>
            from the body. These'instruments were of curved form, and in shape somewhat re­ <lb/>
            sembled our tongue-scrapers on a large scale. Rich persons took slaves with them <lb/>
            to the baths for the purpose of scraping them. From Hesychius, Athenæus, and <lb/>
            Theophrastus, we learn that Parasites were much in the habit of spunging for <lb/>
            entertainers at the public baths; and, no doubt, they generally had ready, for an <lb/>

            here recollects that he is addressing a Latin audience. The Greek cosmetics and <lb/>
            perfumes were much esteemed at Rome. Ovid, in the Art of Love, mentions the <lb/>
            Athenian “cesypum,” which was much used by the Roman ladies for making the <lb/>
            complexion clear. It was made from the sweat and grease of the fleeces of the <lb/>
            sheep of Attica. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The sweating-baths)—Ver. 229. The sudatorium,” or "vapour" or "sweating <lb/>
            bath," was also called by the Romans “ Laconicum because it was the habit of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to strip and anoint themselves, without using warm water, after <lb/>
            the perspiration caused by athletic exercises. Cicero styles it “ assa,” because <lb/>
            it produced perspiration by means of a dry hot atmosphere. After it had been <lb/>
            used, and the “.striwl” applied to the skin, the bather was dried with towels, and <lb/>
            then anointed, when the “ unctiones Græcæ” of the Parasite would be in demand. <lb/>
            These were used either to close the pores of the skin and to prevent the person <lb/>
            from catching cold, or to keep the skin from being rough when dried with the <lb/>
            towel. Probably the Parasites were ready to give a hand on an emergency in <lb/>
            assisting to rub down and anoint the bather, especially if he was known to keep <lb/>
            a good “ cuisine." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 After-dinner powders)—Ver. 230. " Crapularios." These were probably soft <lb/>

            embroidered with gold. Pliny speaks of Babylonian cloths of divers colours, <lb/>

            It is supposed to have been a kind of triangular harp. The word " sambucas” <lb/>

            I am returned safe home, thanks do I return to Neptune <lb/>
            and to his tempests; to Mercury as well1, who in my traffic <lb/>

            the latter, in all their amplitude, would have been invaluable to a Parasite, as they <lb/>

            passage is very obscure, and has puzzled the Commentators, who have generally <lb/>
            taken refuge in a various reading, “ Eum strenue obcænavit,” which seems to <lb/>
            make but very poor sense. The research, however, of the indefatigable Ritschel <lb/>
            has set that mode of escape entirely at rest. “ Strena" was the name of a New <lb/>
            Year's gift, which was givpn and received on the Calenus of January, that the <lb/>
            year might be commenced unaer good auspices. Probably from that circum­ <lb/>
            stance, it became synonymous with a good or “ auspicious omen." " Obseævo” <lb/>
            is rendered in the Dictionaries, "to give a bad omen." Such, however, is not <lb/>
            necessarily its meaning, in all instances. “ Scæva” is an " omen" or “ augury," <lb/>
            whether fortunate or not. Consequently, “ obscævo” may very reasonably mean, <lb/>
            ' to fall in one's way as an omen;" if so, the expression, as here used, will mean, <lb/>

          <p>GEL. By my troth, 'tis clear that I'm undone, and by no <lb/>
            fault of my owns. The number is less than it was before by <lb/>
            one Gelasimus. I'm resolved, hereafter, never to believe in <lb/>
            a weasel, for I know of no beast more uncertain than her. <lb/>
            She who herself is ten times a day shifting her place, from <lb/>
            her have I taken my omens in matters of life and death to me! <lb/>
            I'm determined to call my friends together, to take counsel <lb/>
            how by rule I must starve henceforth. (Exit. <note type="footnote"> ancients never admitted to a feast more than nine, the number of the Muses, or <lb/>
            less than three, the number of the Graces. The true reason, however, was that <lb/>
            the three “ triclinia," or couches, made three parts of the square around the table; <lb/>
            and each containing but three, nine was as great a number as could be accommo­ <lb/>
            dated. Epignomus mentions that number here, by way of assuring Gelasimus that <lb/>
            there is really no room for him. On this, the Parasite says that he is “ imi <lb/>
            subseliii vir," “ a man for the lowest stool" or “ bench,” which he can very well <lb/>
            manage with. " Subsellia" was the name of the seats of the Tribunes, Triumvirs, <lb/>
            and Qusestors, who were not honoured with Curule chairs. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 From Ambracia)—Ver. 491. Ambracia was a city of Epirus, on the Western <lb/>

            that he is a pleader too (for the cause of his own stomach), but all to no purpose. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 By no fault of my own)—Ver. 497. “ Nihil obnoxie," “ by reason of no fault <lb/>

            I not see that you are friendly to me; now, since I've found <lb/>
            that you are my friend, I'll give you credence.</p>
          <p>ANT. I would invite you to my house to dinner, had not <lb/>
            your brother told me that you were going to dine at his <lb/>
            house to-day, when he invited myself to his house to dinner. <lb/>
            And it would have been more proper for me to give you an <lb/>
            entertainment on your arrival, than to engage myself to him, <lb/>
            were it not that I didn't wish to disoblige him. Now I don't <lb/>
            wish with words alone to insinuate myself into your favour; <lb/>

            behoves yourselves and persons friendly disposed to wish, let <lb/>
            there be good-will and intercourse between us. Take you care <lb/>

          <p>ANT. (to PAMPHILUS). Before you go away, in your pre­ <lb/>
            sence I wish to relate a single story to him.</p>
          <p>EPIG. By all means. ANT. There was once an old gentle­ <lb/>
            man, just as I now am; he had two daughters, such as mine <lb/>
            now are; they were married to two brothers, just as mine now <lb/>
            are to yourselves.</p>
          <p>PAM. I wonder how the story'is to turn out ?</p>
          <p>ANT. One of these young men had, as you (to PAMPHILUS) <lb/>
            now have, a damsel, a music-girl; he had brought her from <lb/>
            abroad, as you have now done. Now, this old gentleman was <lb/>
            a widower, just as I now am.</p>
          <p>PAM. Do proceed ; this story is really a propos.</p>
          <p>ANT. Then said this old gentleman to him to whom the <lb/>
            music-girl belonged, just as I now say to you</p>
          <p>PAM. I'm listening3, and carefully giving heed. <note type="footnote"> 1 To salute the Gods)—Ver. 534. To thank his household Gods for his escape <lb/>
            from the perils of the sea, and his success in his speculations. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I shall be at your house)—Ver. 537. These words are given, in Ritschel's edition, <lb/>
            to Epignomus, but clearly erroneously, as it is Pamphilus who is promising that, <lb/>
            after he has rnn home, he will be at the house of his brother immediately. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I'm listening)—Ver. 546. Pamphilus says this, as the cld man has probably <lb/>
            touched him, to bespeak his attention. </note> <pb n="240"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">Act IV. </note> ANT. " I gave you my daughter, to be a comfortable bed- <lb/>
            fellow for you; now, I think it fair that one should be given <lb/>
            me in return by you, to be my bed-fellow."</p>
          <p>PAM. Who says that ? Does he say it1 just as though you <lb/>
            were to say it ?</p>
          <p>ANT. Just as I now say it to you. “ Aye, I'll give you <lb/>
            two of them," says this young man, "if one's too little; and <lb/>
            if you are not satisfied with two," says he, " two more shall <lb/>
            be added."</p>
          <p>PAM. Prithee, who says that ? Does he say it just as <lb/>
            though I were to say it ?</p>
          <p>ANT. He says it just as though you were to say it. Then <lb/>
            says this old gentleman, just as though I were to say it, <lb/>
            “ Well, give me four, if you like, so long only as, i' faith, <lb/>
            you find them something to eat as well, that they mayn't <lb/>

          <p>PAM. Why surely it must have been a stingy old chap to <lb/>
            say that, in asking food as well of him who promised them <lb/>
            to him.</p>
          <p>ANT. Why surely, this young man must have been a <lb/>
            good-for-nothing fellow, who forthwith, when the other <lb/>
            asked him, refused to give him a grain of wheat. But, i' <lb/>
            troth, the old gentleman asked what was fair, inasmuch as <lb/>
            the dowry which he had given to his daughter, he wished <lb/>
            him to have as an equivalent for the music-girl.</p>
          <p>PAM. I' faith, for sure I really do think that the young <lb/>
            man was well advised, who wouldn't give a mistress to that <lb/>
            old fellow in return for the dower..</p>
          <p>ANT. The old gentleman wished, indeed, if he could, to <lb/>
            bargain for their maintenance ; because he couldn't, he said <lb/>
            he wished it to be done on what terms it might. " Done," <lb/>
            said this young man. " You do me a kindness," said the old <lb/>
            gentleman. " Have I the thing agreed upon ?" said he. <lb/>
            " I'll do even as you wish it to be done," said the other. But <lb/>
            I'll be off in-doors, and congratulate my daughters on your <lb/>

            nothing else. Take some water5. <note type="footnote"> I How many cups)—Ver. 706. " Cyatlios." The " cyathus" was a cup which <lb/>
            contained a fixed and definite measure. It contained but a small quantity, one­ <lb/>
            twelfth part of a " sextarius," which was not quite an English pint. It seems <lb/>
            most probable that the " cyathus" was used for the purpose of ladling the wine <lb/>
            out of the bowl, or " cratera," in which it was mixed with water, into the <lb/>
            goblets or cups. The question of Sagarinus here seems to apply to the number <lb/>
            of " cyathi" of the pure wine which they had been drinking at each goblet-full <lb/>
            that they took, as otherwise they would be making but slow inroads on the <lb/>
            " cadus," five " cyathi" holding, perhaps, about as much as three of our ordi­ <lb/>
            nary wine-glasses. It is not improbable that a portion of the Play is lost here. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Either your five cups, &amp;c.)—Ver. 707. These words are in Greek. Eustathius <lb/>
            and Athenæus say that this Greek song bears reference to the proportions of <lb/>
            water that should be mixed with the wine. It seems, however, here to mean <lb/>
            that there's " luck in odd numbers" when you are drinking. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 From thefountain)—Ver. 708. The " fons" in this case was probably a <lb/>
            pitcher of water which they had on the table. Sagarinus seems to recommend <lb/>
            him, in mixing, only to take one-tenth part of water. Sober people generally <lb/>
            mixed in the proportion of three-fifths water and two-fifths wine. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 By way of a relish)—Ver. 711. By " pulpamentum" Sagarinus seems to <lb/>
            mean some dainty, by way of a relish; at least, Stichus so understands him, as <lb/>
            he points to the nuts, beans, figs, lupines, and olives on the table, and tells him <lb/>
            that he will get nothing else. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Take some water)—Ver. 712. He probably tells him to take some water if <lb/>
            he feels queer, or, in our vernacular, " seedy," from taking too much wine; which <lb/>
            he has some reason to suppose, from the other calling for a " pulpamentum." <lb/>

            up to the mark. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Take your pipes)—Ver. 716. The " Tibicines," "Pipers" or " flute-players," <lb/>
            among the Greeks and Romans, were in the habit of playing upon two pipes at the <lb/>
            same time. These were perfectly distinct, and were not even, as has been supposed <lb/>
            by some, connected by a common mouth-piece. The Romans were particularly fond <lb/>
            of this music, and it was introduced both at sacrifices, funerals, and entertair.­ <lb/>
            meats. See a comical story about the Roman " Tibicines" in the Fasti of Ovid, <lb/>
            B. 6,1. 670 et seq. From the present specimen they appear to have been merry <lb/>
            souls, occupying much the same place as the country fiddlers of modern tImes. </note><note type="footnote"> a Mind my rules)—Ver. 717. It is pretty clear, that in his zeal, and to show <lb/>
            that there is no flagging in him, Sagarinus has been overdoing it, perhaps helping <lb/>

          <p>CALIDORUS, a young Athenian, the son of Simo, is in love with Phœnicium, a <lb/>
            young woman who belongs to Ballio, a procurer. A bargain has been made by <lb/>
            the procurer, to sell her to a military officer for twenty minæ; fifteen of these have <lb/>
            been paid down, and it has been agreed that when the remaining five and a <lb/>
            certain token, with a letter, shall have been sent by the Captain, the damsel shall <lb/>
            be sent to him in return. Pseudolus, the servant of Simo, promises his master's <lb/>
            son, that, if possible, he will prevent this. They first address Ballio on the <lb/>
            subject; but their attempts to influence him are all in vain. Pseudolus then <lb/>
            devises a plan to get some money out of Simo, by whom, however, it is dis­ <lb/>
            covered; but, after having acknowledged his fault, he prevails upon the old <lb/>
            gentleman to promise him twenty minse if he shall contrive to get the girl <lb/>
            out of the procurer's hands. Harpax, the messenger from the Captain, in <lb/>
            the meantime makes his appearance. Being a stranger to the place, he un­ <lb/>
            wittingly delivers the Captain's letter and the token to Pseudolus, who pretends <lb/>
            that he is the head-servant of the procurer. Charinus, the friend of Calidorus, <lb/>
            iends him five minæ; and, provided with this, Pseudolus equips Simmia, a servant <lb/>
            of Charinus, so as to represent the messenger from the Captain. He finds the <lb/>
            procurer, delivers the letter, pays the five minse, and carries off the damsel. <lb/>
            Balho then makes a bet of twenty minæ with Simo, that Pseudolus shall not <lb/>
            outwit him that day. The real Harpax now applies to Ballio for the girl, and <lb/>
            the trick being discovered, the procurer has to pay back the fifteen minæ to the <lb/>
            Captain, and the twenty for the bet which he has made with Simo. Simo then <lb/>
            pays the twenty minæ, which he has promised to Pseudolus if he should suc­ <lb/>
            ceed in outwitting the procurer. Pseudolus is handsomely entertained by <lb/>
            Calidorus, and engages to return to Simo one-half of the money, if he wil <lb/>
            join the entertainment.</p><pb n="255"/>

            his guard ? And besides, if I could do so, filial affection <lb/>
            forbids.</p>
          <p>BAL. I understand you; do you then at night embrace <lb/>
            filial affection in place of Phœnicium. But since I see you <lb/>
            prefer your filial affection to your love-are all men your <lb/>

            called in their own, paid what they had borrowed to no born <lb/>

            coin of silver; so distractedly am I perishing both through <lb/>
            love and want of money.</p>

            i' faith, even two hundred minæ ready money might be raised.</p>

            meant the system of credit for the purposes of business; where they who purchase <lb/>
            on that principle have an eye only to the present time, but are blind as to the <lb/>
            future consequences of their speculation. The intention of the procurer is to ad­ <lb/>

            also called the Lætorian Law, forbade credit to be given to person under the age <lb/>
            of twenty-five years, and deprived the creditor of all right to recover his money <lb/>

          <p>SIMO. If now a Dictator1 were to be appointed at Athens <lb/>
            of Attica out of the spendthrifts or out of the gallants, <lb/>
            I do think that no one would surpass my son. For now the <lb/>
            only talk of all throughout the city is to the effect that he <lb/>
            is trying to set his mistress free, and is seeking after money <lb/>
            for that purpose. Some people bring me word of this ; and, <lb/>
            in fact, I had long ago perceived it, and had suspected it, <lb/>
            but I dissembled on it.</p>
          <p>PSEUD. (apart). Already is his son suspected by him; this <lb/>
            affair is nipt in the bud, this business is at a stand-still. The <lb/>
            way is now entirely blocked up against me, by which I had <lb/>
            intended to go a-foraging for the money. He has perceived it <lb/>
            beforehand. There's no booty for the marauders. <note type="footnote"> 1 If now a Dictator)—Ver. 416. Though the scene is at Athens, Plautus here I <lb/>

            you shall think it isn't Pseudolus but Socratesl that's talking <lb/>
            to you. What do you say ?</p>

            I know. I see that you have but little confidence in me. <lb/>
            You wish me to be a villain ; still, I will be of strict honesty.</p>

            ears free, Pseudolus, that my words may be enabled to enter <lb/>

            must be on my guard against you in your anger, and you <lb/>
            are thinking of beating me in no other way than I am wont <lb/>
            to beat yourself. What do you think ? (To CALLIPHO.)</p>
          <p>CALL. I' faith, I think that he's angry with good reason, <lb/>
            since you have so little confidence in him.</p>

            this a fault ? Now then, give your attention to the reason <lb/>

            me. For this has been brought as a horn of plenty1, in which <lb/>

            was not enough: while his relentless right hand was holding my stubborn horn, <lb/>

            Just as this servitude has turned out to me, where I am set <lb/>

          <p>BAL. Those who call it the cook's market, call it so <lb/>
            foolishly; for 'tis not a cook's market, but a thieves' market. <lb/>
            For if, upon oath, I were to seek out the worst of men, I <lb/>
            couldn't have brought a worse one than this fellow that l'in <lb/>
            bringing, one, chattering, bragging, silly, and worthless. Why, <lb/>
            for this very reason Orcus has declined2 to take him to him­ <lb/>
            self, that he might be here to cook a banquet for the dead; <lb/>
            for here he is able to cook a thing to please them alone.</p>
          <p>COOK. If you thought of me in this manner that you are <lb/>
            mentioning, why did you hire me ?</p>
          <p>BAL. From scarcity; there wasn't another. But why, if <lb/>
            you were a cook, were you sitting in the market-place, you <lb/>
            alone behind the rest ?</p>
          <p>COOK. I'll tell you. By reason of the avarice of men have <lb/>
            I become an inferior cook, not through my own inclina­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>BAL. For what reason is that? COOK. I'll tell you. <lb/>
            Because, in fact, directly people come to hire a cook, no <lb/>
            one enquires for him that's the best and the highest priced: <lb/>
            rather do they hire him that's the lowest priced. Through <lb/>
            this have I to-day been the only sitter in the market. Those <lb/>
            wretched fellows are for a drachma a-piece; not any person is <lb/>

            don't cook a dinner too, like other cooks, who bring me up <lb/>
            seasoned meadows of grass upon their dishes; who turn the <lb/>
            guests into oxen, and supply the grass. This herbage, too, <lb/>
            do they further season with other herbs: put in coriander, <lb/>
            fennel, garlick, orage; they add, too, sorrel, cabbage, beet, <lb/>
            and spinach. In this they dissolve a pound weight of asafœtida. <lb/>
            The roguish mustard is pounded, which makes the eyes of <lb/>
            those that pound it drop tears before they have pounded it. <lb/>
            These fellows, when they cook dinners, when they do season <lb/>
            them, season them, not with seasonings, but with vampyre <lb/>
            owls1, which eat out the bowels of the guests while still alive. <lb/>
            Through this, in fact, it is, that people here live such short <lb/>
            lives, inasmuch as they heap up these herbs of this sort in <lb/>
            their stomachs, dreadful to be mentioned, not only to be <lb/>
            eaten. Herbage which the cattle eat not, men eat themselves.</p>
          <p>BAL. What do you say ? Do you use divine seasonings, by <lb/>
            which you can prolong the life of men, you, who find fault <lb/>
            with these other seasonings ?</p>
          <p>COOK. I proclaim it boldly; for those who shall eat of my <lb/>
            victuals which I have seasoned will be able to exist two hun­ <lb/>
            dred years even. For when I've put into the saucepan <lb/>
            either cicilendrum, or cepolindrum, or mace2, or saucaptis, the <lb/>
            very dishes become warmed forthwith. These are sauces <lb/>

            thence do they derive their origin. Large are their heads, fixed is their gaze <lb/>
            for plunder are their beaks adapted; on their wings is a greyish colour, crooked <lb/>
            talons are on their claws. By night they fly, and they seek the children unpro­ <lb/>
            tected by the nuise, and pollute their bodies dragged from their cradles. With <lb/>
            their beaks they are said to tear the entrails of the sucklings, and they have their <lb/>
            maws distended with the blood which they have swallowed. ' Striges' are they <lb/>
            called; and the origin of this name is the fact, that they are wont to screech in <lb/>
            the dismal night." It is supposed by some persons that, under this name, the <lb/>

            pilfering anything from me.</p>
          <p>COOK. For a didrachm, if you believe me ; if not, not for <lb/>
            a mina even. But whether are you about to-day to give a <lb/>
            dinner, to your friends or to your enemies ?</p>
          <p>BAL. Why, faith, to my friends surely.</p>
          <p>COOK. But why don't you invite your enemies to it rather <lb/>
            than your friends ? For this day will I present to the <lb/>
            guests a banquet so savoury, and I'll season it with such a <lb/>
            dulcet sweetness, that whoever shall taste each thing that's <lb/>
            seasoned, I'll make that same person to gnaw off the ends <lb/>
            of his own fingers.</p>
          <p>BAL. Troth now, prithee, before you shall present aught <lb/>
            to the guests do you yourself first taste, and give some <note type="footnote"> 1 The old man Pelias)—Ver. 869. The Cook could not be expected to be very <lb/>
            learned in the heathen Mythology; and we accordingly find him making a <lb/>
            blunder. Æson, the father of Jason, was restored to youth by the charms of <lb/>
            Medea; but Pelias being the enemy of Jason, Medea persuaded his daughters to <lb/>
            cut him in pieces, that he might in similar manner restore him to youth; which <lb/>
            was accordingly done, on which, having thus contrived his death, she refused her <lb/>
            assistance. It is much more probable that the Cook should be intended to be <lb/>
            represented as ignorant, than as attempting here to impose on the ignorance of <lb/>
            Ballio. Warner, in his translation, however, thinks otherwise. He says, " The <lb/>
            humour plainly lies in the Cook's promises to restore Ballio to his juvenility by <lb/>
            a cookery—one that would kill him. Ballio's ignorance is, indeed, here meant to <lb/>
            be exposed to ridicule by the Cook, that is by Plautus, as it likewise is in the <lb/>
            names of the spices, which are probably fictitious." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Rather a preserver)—Ver. 874. The " enchanters," who were called "vene­ <lb/>

          <p>BAL. Now, just look, please, at that young offshoot; for he, <lb/>
            too, is a good-for-nothing deputy-scullion for the cook. Truly <lb/>
            I don't know what now first to be on my guard against; <lb/>
            such thieves there are in my house, and there's a robber <lb/>
            close at hand. For my neighbour here, the father of Cali­ <lb/>
            dorus, a short time since, in the market-place, asked me <lb/>
            by all means to be on my guard against his servant Pseu­ <lb/>
            dolus, not to put any trust in him; for that he is on the <lb/>
            hunt this day, if possible to dupe me out of the woman. He <lb/>
            said that he had stoutly promised to him that he would get <lb/>
            away Phoenicium from me by stratagem. I'll now go in- <lb/>
            doors and give notice to my household, that no one must <lb/>

          <p>MOSCHUS, a merchant of Syracuse, had two twin-sons who exactly resemblec <lb/>
            each other. One of these, whose name was Menæchmus, when a child, accom­ <lb/>
            panied his father to Tarentum, at which place he was stolen and carried away to <lb/>
            Epidamnus, where in course of time he has married a wealthy wife. Disagree­ <lb/>
            ments, however, arising with her, he forms an acquaintance with the Courtesan <lb/>
            Erotium, and is in the habit of presenting her with clothes and jewels which he <lb/>
            pilfers from his wife. The original name of the other twin-brother was <lb/>
            Sosicles, but on the loss of Menæchmus, the latter name has been substituted by <lb/>
            their grandfather for Sosicles, in remembrance of the lost child. Menæchmus <lb/>
            Sosicles, on growing to manhood, determines to seek his lost brother. Having <lb/>
            wandered for six years, he arrives at Epidamnus, attended by his servant, <lb/>
            Messenio. In consequence of his resemblance to his brother, many curious and <lb/>

          <p>A SICILIAN merchant (Mercator) who had two sons, on one being stolen from <lb/>
            him (Ei), ended his life. As a name (Nomen) for him who is at home, his <lb/>

            And (Et) he, as soon as he is grown up, goes to seek his brother about (Circum) <lb/>
            all countries. At last he comes to Epidamnus; hither (Huc) the one that was <lb/>
            stolen has been carried. All think that the stranger, Menæchmus (Menœch­ <lb/>
            mum), is their fellow-citizen, and address him (Eum) as such: Courtesan, <lb/>
            wife, and father-in-law. There (Ibi) at last the brothers mutually recognize <lb/>

          <p>IN the first1 place now, Spectators, at the commencement, <lb/>
            do I wish health and happiness2 to myself and to you. I <lb/>
            bring you Plautus, with my tongue, not with my hand: I beg <lb/>
            that you will receive him with favouring ears. Now learn the <lb/>
            argument, and give your attention; in as few words as pos­ <lb/>
            sible will I be brief. And, in fact, this subject is a Greek <lb/>
            one; still, it is not an Attic3, but a Sicilian one. But in <lb/>
            their Comedies the poets do this; they feign that all the <lb/>
            business takes place at Athens4, in order that it may appear <note type="footnote"> 1 In the first)—Ver. 1. This Play was the foundation of Shakspeare's Comedy <lb/>

            these words might be more literally translated, “Græcize,” “Atticize," and <lb/>
            “Sicilicize.” </note><note type="footnote"> * At Athens)—Ver. 10. As the majority of the Greek Comic Poets were either <lb/>
            natives of, or residents at, Athens, they would naturally take that extensive, <lb/>
            opulent, and bustling city as the scene of many of their Comedies. In the time <lb/>
            of Plautus, Greek was yet the language of the Sicilians. In Cicero's time the <lb/>
            language of the Sicilians was a mixture, partly Greek and partly Latin. Apuleius <lb/>
            informs us that in his day they spoke Greek, Latin, and a language peculiar to <lb/>
            themselves, called the Sicilian. </note> <lb/>

            the more Grecian to you. I will not tell you that this matter <lb/>
            happened anywhere except where it is said to have happened. <lb/>
            This has been my preface to the subject of this play. Now <lb/>
            will I give the subject, meted out. to you, not in a measure, <lb/>
            nor yet in a threefold measure1, but in the granary itself; <lb/>
            so great is my heartiness in telling you the plot.</p>
          <p>There was a certain aged man, a merchant at Syracuse2; to <lb/>
            him two sons were born, twins, children so like in appearance <lb/>
            that their own foster-motherS, who gave the breast, was <lb/>
            not able to distinguish them, nor even the mother herself who. <lb/>
            had given them birth ; as a person, indeed, informed me who <lb/>
            had seen the children; I never saw them, let no one of you <lb/>
            fancy so. After the children were now seven years old, the <lb/>
            father freighted a large ship with much merchandize. The <lb/>
            father put one of the twins on board the ship, and took him <lb/>
            away, together with himself, to traffic at Tarentum4; the other <lb/>
            one he left with his mother at home. By accident, there were <lb/>
            games at Tarentum when he came there: many persons, as <lb/>
            generally happens at the games, had met together; the child <lb/>
            strayed away there from his father among the people. A cer­ <lb/>
            tain merchant of Epidamnus was there; he picked up the <lb/>
            child, and carried it away to Epidamnus5. But its father, after <lb/>
            he had lost the child, took it heavily to heart, and through <lb/>
            grief at it he died a few days after at Tarentum. Now, after <lb/>
            news reached the grandfather of the children at home about <lb/>
            this matter, how that one of the children had been stolen, the <lb/>
            grandfather changed the name of that other twin. So much <lb/>
            did he love that one which had been stolen, that he gave his <note type="footnote"> 1 A threefold measure)—Ver. 15. “Trimodius.” This was a measure for <lb/>
            corn, consisting of three “modii." which last contained about a peck of English <lb/>

            its commerce and opulence. <lb/>

            Italy. It was said to have been founded by the Lacedæmonians. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 To Epidamnus)—Ver. 33. Epidamnus, or Epidamnum, was a town of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, situate on the Adriatic Sea. It was much resorted to for the purpose of <lb/>
            transit to the opposite shores of Italy. It received its original name from Epidamnus, <lb/>
            one of its kings: but on falling into the possession of the Romans, they changed its <lb/>
            name, as we are informed by Pliny the Elder, into Dyrrachium, from a superstitious <lb/>
            notion that when they were going to “Epidamnum,” they were going “to their <lb/>
            loss," as " damnum" is the Latin for “loss" or “destruction," and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">επὶ</foreign>, or “epi, <lb/>

            name to the one that was at home. That you may not mis­ <lb/>
            take hereafter, I tell you then this beforehand; the name of <lb/>
            both the twin-brothers is the same. He gave the same <lb/>
            name of Menæchmus to this one as the other had; and by the <lb/>
            same name the grandfather himself was called. I remember <lb/>
            his name the more easily for the reason that I saw him cried <lb/>
            with much noised Now must I speed back on foot to Epi­ <lb/>
            damnus, that I may exactly disclose this matter to you. If <lb/>
            any one of you2 wishes anything to be transacted for him at <lb/>
            Epidamnus, command me boldly and speak out; but on these <lb/>
            terms, that he give me the means by which it may be transacted <lb/>
            for him. For unless a person gives the money, he will be mis­ <lb/>
            taken ; (in a lower tone) except that he who does give it will be <lb/>
            very much more mistaken3. But I have returned to that place <lb/>
            whence I set forth, and yet I am standing in the self-same spot. <lb/>
            This person of Epidamnus, whom I mentioned just now, that <lb/>
            stole that other twin child, had no children, except his wealth. <lb/>
            He adopted as his son the child so carried off, and gave him <lb/>
            a well-portioned wife, and made him his heir when he himself <lb/>
            died. For as, by chance, he was going into the country, when <lb/>
            it had rained heavily, entering, not far from the city, a rapid <lb/>
            stream, in its rapidity4 it threw the ravisher of the child off <lb/>
            his legs, and hurried the man away to great and grievous <lb/>
            destruction. And so a very large fortune fell to that youth. <lb/>
            Here (pointing to the house) does the stolen twin now dwell. <lb/>
            Now that twin, who dwells at Syracuse, has come this day to <lb/>
            Epidamnus with his servant to make enquiry for this own <lb/>
            twin-brother of his. This is the city of Epidamnus while <lb/>
            this play is acting; when another shall be acted, it will <lb/>
            become another town; just as our companies, too, are wont <lb/>
            to be shifted about. The same person now acts the procurer, <lb/>

            The persons who bind captives with chains, and who put <lb/>
            fetters upon runaway slaves, act very foolishly, in my opinion <lb/>
            at least. For if bad usage is added to his misfortune for a <lb/>
            wretched man, the greater is his inclination to run away and <lb/>
            to do amiss. For by some means or other do they release them­ <lb/>
            selves from the chains; while thus fettered, they either wear <lb/>
            away a link with a file, or else with a stone they knock out <lb/>
            the nail; 'tis a mere trifle this. He whom you wish to keep <lb/>
            securely that he may not run away, with meat and with drink <lb/>
            ought he to be chained.; do you bind down the mouth of a <lb/>
            man to a full table. So long as you give him what to eat and <lb/>
            what to drink at his own pleasure in abundance every day, <lb/>
            i' faith he'll never run away, even if be, has committed an <lb/>
            offence that's capital; easily will you secure him so long as <lb/>
            you shall bind him with such chains. So very supple are <lb/>
            these chains of food, the more you stretch them so much <lb/>
            the more tightly do they bind. But now I'm going directly <lb/>
            to Menæchmus; whither for this long time I have been sen­ <lb/>
            tenced, thither of my own accord I am going, that he may <lb/>
            enchain me. For, by my troth, this man does not nourish <lb/>
            persons, but he quite rears and reinvigorates them; no one <lb/>
            administers medicine more agreably. Such is this young <lb/>
            man; himself with a very well-stocked larder, he gives dinners <lb/>
            fit for Ceres2; so does he heap the tables up, and piles so vast <lb/>
            of dishes does he arrange, you must stand on your couch if you <lb/>

            your husband, you would deem to be so to yourself as well. <lb/>
            Moreover, if after this day you do any such thing to me, I'll <lb/>
            force you, a divorced woman, turned out of my doors to go visit <lb/>
            your father. For as often as I wish to go out of the house, <lb/>
            you are detaining me, calling me back, asking me questions: <lb/>
            whither I am going, what matter I am about, what business <lb/>
            I am transacting, what I am wanting, what I am bringing, <lb/>
            what I have been doing out of doors ? I've surely brought <lb/>

            your husband. (In a lower voice.) And therefore, that you <lb/>
            mayn't be watching me in vain, for your pains I shall find me a <lb/>

          <p>PEN. (apart). This fellow pretends that he's upbraiding <lb/>
            his wife, but he's addressing myself; for if he does dine out of <lb/>

            purchased at his own cost; he has been consuming these victuals, and right dear <lb/>

            a gross nature. Ganymede was the son of Tros, King of Troy. Jupiter was said, <lb/>
            in the form of an eagle, to have carried him off, and made him cupbearer to the <lb/>

            do without the risk of being seen by his wife, as on the Roman stage a number <lb/>

            followed by " potatio" or " drinking," which by such characters as Menæchmus <lb/>

          <p>MEN. Sos. There's no greater pleasure to voyagers, in my <lb/>
            notion, Messenio, than at the moment when from sea they <lb/>
            espy the land afar.</p>
          <p>MESS. There is a greater, I'll say it without subterfuge,­ <lb/>
            if on your arrival you see the land that is your own. But, <lb/>
            prithee, why are we now come to Epidamnus ? Why, like <lb/>
            the sea, are we going round all the islands ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Sos. To seek for my own twin-brother born ?</p>
          <p>MESS. Why, what end is there to be of searching for him ? <lb/>
            This is the sixth year that we've devoted our attention to this <lb/>
            business. We have been already carried round the Istriansl, <lb/>
            the Hispanians, the Massilians, the Illyrians, all the Upper <lb/>
            Adriatic Sea, and foreign Greece2, and all the shores of <lb/>
            Italy, wherever the sea reaches them. If you -had been <lb/>
            searching for a needle, I do believe you would, long ere this, <lb/>
            have found the needle, if it were visible. Among the living <lb/>
            are we seeking a person that's dead; for long ago should we <lb/>
            have found him if he had been alive.</p>
          <p>MEN. Sos. For that reason I am looking for a person to <lb/>
            give me that information for certain, who can say that he <lb/>
            knows that he really is dead; after that I shall never take <lb/>
            any trouble in seeking further. But otherwise I shall never, <lb/>
            while I'm alive, desist; I know how dear he is to my heart.</p>
          <p>MESS. You are seeking a knot in a bulrush3. Why don't <lb/>
            we return homeward hence, unless we are to write a history4 ? <note type="footnote"> I The Istrians)—Ver. 235. The Istrians were a people of the north of Italy, <lb/>
            near the Adriatic Sea, and adjoining to Illyricum. The Illyrians inhabited the <lb/>

            of the city of Massilia, now called Marseilles, in the south of France, where <lb/>

            are a great admirer of the women, Messenio, and I'm. a pas­ <lb/>

            Diodorus Siculus, assumed the government at Agrigentum after the death of Aga­ <lb/>

            that Hiero received the government from Liparo, but, on the contrary, that his <lb/>
            virtuous character was the sole ground for his election to the sovereignty. Lipara <lb/>
            was the name of one of the Æolian islands (now called the Isles of Lipari), not far <lb/>

            property is more enquired about, than what the reputation of <lb/>
            their clients is for honor. If any person is poor and not <lb/>
            dishonest, he is considered worthless; but if a rich man is <lb/>

            who takes care of his master's business, looks after it, arranges <lb/>
            it, thinks about it, in the absence of his master diligently to <lb/>
            attend to the affairs of his master, as much so as if he himself <lb/>

            should be of more consequence than his appetite, his legs <lb/>
            than his stomach, whose heart is rightly placed. Let him <lb/>
            bear in mind, those who are good for nothing, what reward <lb/>
            is given them by their masters-lazy, worthless fellows. <lb/>

            are the rewards of idleness. This evil do I terribly stand in <lb/>
            awe of. Wherefore 'tis sure that to be good is better than <lb/>
            to be bad. Much more readily do I submit to words, <lb/>
            stripes I do detest; and I eat what is ground much more <lb/>
            readily than supply it ground by myself2. Therefore do I <lb/>
            obey the command of my master, carefully and diligently do <lb/>
            I observe it; and in such manner do I pay obedience, as I <lb/>
            think is for the interest of my back. And that course does <lb/>
            profit me. Let others be just as they take it to be their <lb/>

          <p>MESS. Why, I just now rescued you before this house, <lb/>
            when four men were carrying you off upon their shoulders. <lb/>
            You invoked the aid of all Gods and men, when I ran <lb/>
            up and delivered you by main force, fighting, and in spite of <lb/>
            them. For this reason, because I rescued you, you set me <lb/>
            at liberty. When I said that I was going for the money and <lb/>
            the luggage, you ran before to meet me as quickly as you <lb/>
            could, in order that you might deny what you did. <note type="footnote"> I Ifhe does bring it)-Ver. 1044. He contemplates robbing even the man wlia <lb/>

            Are you Menaechmus ?</p>

          <p>MEN. Aye, I really am, young man, of my own father. I <lb/>
            don't want to claim your father, nor to take possession of <lb/>
            him from you.</p>
          <p>MESS. Immortal Gods, what unhoped-for hope do you be­ <lb/>
            stow on me, as I suspect. For unless my mind misleads me, <lb/>
            these are the two twin-brothers; for. they mention alike <lb/>

          <p>MEN. SOS. I've stepped aside now. What's.the matter?</p>
          <p>MESS. This man is either an impostor, or he is your twin- <lb/>
            brother. But I never beheld one person more like another <lb/>

            nor milk to milk, than he is to you, and you likewise to him ; <lb/>
            besides, he speaks of the same native country and father. 'Tis. <lb/>

            I think you said that you are called Menæchmus ?</p>
          <p>MEN. I did so indeed. MESS. (pointing to his master). His <lb/>
            name, too, is Menæchmus. You said that you were born at <lb/>
            Syracuse, in Sicily; he was born there. You said that Moschus <lb/>
            was your father ; he was his as well. Now both of you can <lb/>
            be giving help to me and to yourselves at the same time.</p>
          <p>MEN. You have deserved that you should beg nothing but <lb/>

            and afterwards how I strayed away from my father among <lb/>
            the people, and was carried away thence.</p>
          <p>MEN. Sos. Supreme Jupiter, preserve me!</p>
          <p>MESS. (to MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES). Why do you exclaim? <lb/>
            Why don't you hold your peace ? (To MENÆCHMUS.) How <lb/>
            many years old were you when your father took you from <lb/>

            changing for the first time. And never since then have I <lb/>
            seen my father.</p>

          <p>MESS, (coming forward, and speaking in a loud voice). An <lb/>
            auction of the property of Menæchmus will certainly take <lb/>

            furniture, house, and farms, will be sold. All will go for <lb/>

          <p>EUCLIO, a miserly old Athenian, has a daughter named Phædra, who has <unclear/> <lb/>
            ravished by a young man named Lyconides, but is ignorant from whom she <lb/>
            has received that injury. Lyconides has an uncle named Megadorus, who, <lb/>
            being ignorant of these circumstances, determines to ask Phædra of her father, <lb/>
            in marriage for himself. Euclio has discovered a pot of gold in his house, <lb/>
            which he watches with the greatest anxiety. In the meantime, Megadorus <lb/>
            asks his daughter in marriage, and his proposal is accepted; and while pre­ <lb/>
            parations are making for the nuptials, Enclio conceals his treasure, first in on <lb/>
            place and then in another. Strobilus, the servant of Lyconides, watches his <lb/>
            movements, and, having discovered it, carries off the treasure. While Euclio is <lb/>
            lamenting his loss, Lyconides accosts him, with the view of confessing the <lb/>
            outrage he nas committed on his daughter, and of announcing to him that his <lb/>
            uncle, Megadorus, has cancelled his agreement to marry her, in favour of him­ <lb/>
            self. Euclio at first thinks that he is come to confess the robbery of the treasure. <lb/>
            After much parleying, his mistake is rectified, and the matter is explained; on <lb/>
            which Lyconides forces Strobilus to confess the theft; and (although the rest <lb/>
            of the Play in its original form is lost) we learn from the acrostic Argument <lb/>
            that Strobilus gives up the treasure, and Lyconides marries the daughter of <lb/>

          <p>Lest any one should wonder who I am, I will tell you in a <lb/>
            few words. I am the household God of this family, from whose <lb/>
            house you have seen me coming forth. It is now many years <lb/>
            that I have been occupying this house, and I inhabited it for <lb/>
            the father and the grandfather of this person who now dwells <lb/>
            here. But beseeching me, his grandfather entrusted to me a <lb/>
            treasure of gold, unknown to all. He deposited it in the midst <lb/>
            of the hearth2, praying me that I would watch it for him. He, <lb/>
            when he died, was of such an avaricious disposition, that he <note type="footnote"> 1 Auluria This word is derived from the old Latin word " aula," the same <lb/>
            with the more recent form " olla," signifying "a pot," and whose diminutive <lb/>
            was " aulula," which had the same signification. It will be seen how conspicuous <lb/>
            a part the " aula" performs in the Play. Warner says, in a Note to his Transla­ <lb/>
            tion, that Molière took a great part of his Comedy, called L'Avare, from this play <lb/>
            of Plautus; and that there are two English Comedies on the same plan, one by <lb/>
            Shadwell, the other by Fielding, called the Miser. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Midst of the hearth)-Ver. 7. The Lares, or household Gods, were kept in the <lb/>
            "lararium," which was a recess near the " focus," or " hearth,'' and in which <lb/>
            prayers were offered up by the Romans on rising in the morning. The hearth <unclear/> <lb/>
            fireplace was in the middle of the house, and was sacred to the Lares </note> <pb n="376"/>
            <note type="margin"> Act I. </note> <lb/>
            would never disclose it to his own son, and preferred rather to <lb/>
            leave him in want than to show that treasure to that son. He <lb/>
            left him no large quantity of land, on which to live with great <lb/>
            laboriousness and in wretchedness. When he died who had <lb/>
            entrusted that gold to me, I began to take notice whether his <lb/>
            son would any how pay greater honor to me than his father <lb/>
            had paid me. But he was in the habit of venerating me still <lb/>
            less and less by very much, and gave me a still less share of <lb/>
            devotion. So in return was it done by me ; and he likewise <lb/>
            ended his life. He left this person who now dwells here, his <lb/>
            son, of the same disposition as his father and grandfather <lb/>
            were. He has an only daughter; she is always every day <lb/>
            making offerings to me, either with incense, or wine, or some­ <lb/>
            thing or other; she presents me, too, with chaplets. Out of <lb/>
            regard for her, I have caused this Euclio to find this treasure, <lb/>
            in order that he might more readily give her in marriage if he <lb/>
            should wish; for a young man of very high rank has ravished <lb/>
            her; this young man knows who it is that he has ravished; <lb/>
            she knows him not, nor yet does her father know that she has <lb/>
            been ravished. This day I shall cause the old gentleman here, <lb/>
            our neighbour, to ask her as his wife; that will I do for this <lb/>
            reason, that he may the more easily marry her who has ravished <lb/>
            her. And this old gentleman who shall ask her as his wife, <lb/>
            the same is the uncle of that young man who debauched her <lb/>
            in the night time at the festival of Ceresl. But this old fel­ <lb/>
            low is now making an uproar in the house, as usual; he is <lb/>
            thrusting the old woman out of doors, that she may not be <lb/>
            privy to the secret. I suppose he wants to look at the gold, <lb/>
            if it be not stolen.</p>

            the maidens took some part in a portion of the ceremonial. It was said to bare <lb/>

            a torch in her hand, for her daughter Proserpine, when ravished by Pluto. No <lb/>

            worship, which was also called " curia;" and was presided over by the " Curio," <lb/>
            who is here called the " Magister curiæ," or " master of the ward." At first the <lb/>
            Patricians and Equites had the sole influence in the " curiæ," and alone electec <lb/>

          <p>MEG. Because, sister, your words are knocking out the <lb/>
            brains of unfortunate me ; you are speaking stolles2.</p>
          <p>EUN. Well, well, do this that your sister requests you.</p>

          <p>EUN. I am able, brother, to provide you with a wife with a <lb/>
            very large marriage-portion. But she's somewhat aged; she's <lb/>
            of the middle-age of woman. If you request me, brother, to <lb/>
            ask her for you, I'll ask her.</p>
          <p>AEG. Would you like me to ask you a question ?</p>
          <p>EUN. Yes, if you like, ask it.</p>
          <p>AEG. Suppose any old man, past mid-age, brings home a <lb/>
            middle-aged wife, if by chance he should have a child by this <lb/>
            old woman, do you doubt at all but that the name of that <lb/>

            was a proverbial expression with the ancients. Erasmus says that it was ap­ <lb/>

            time were doing him mischief; and that it was borrowed from persons enticing a <lb/>
            dog with a piece of bread, and, when it had come sufficiently near, pelting it <lb/>
            with a stone. The expression is used in the New Testament. “ If a son shall <lb/>
            ask bread of any of yon that is a father, will he give him a stone?” St. Luke, c. xi., <lb/>
            v.11. The bread, as we learn from specimens found at Pompeii, was often made <lb/>
            into cakes, which somewhat resembled large stones. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These polypi)—Ver. 155. Ovid says in his Halieuticon, or Treatise on Fishes: <lb/>

            place which it has lighted upon; and when it has greedily seized the prey hanging <lb/>
            from the fishing-line, it likewise deceives the angler on his raising the rod, when, <lb/>

          <p>Buc. Heyday! Megadorus, you are doing a deed that's <lb/>
            not becoming to your usual actions, in laughing at me, a poor <lb/>
            man, and guiltless towards yourself and towards your family <lb/>
            For neither in act, nor in words, have I ever deserved it of <lb/>
            you, that you should do what you are now doing.</p>
          <p>lEG. By my troth, I neither am come to laugh at you, <lb/>
            nor am I laughing at you, nor do I think you deserving <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>Buc. Why then do you ask for my daughter for your <lb/>
            self?</p>
          <p>MEG. That through me it may be better for you, and <lb/>
            through you and yours for me.</p>
          <p>Buc. This suggests itself to my mind, Megadorus, that you <lb/>
            are a wealthy man, a man of rank; that I likewise am a person, <lb/>
            the poorest of the poor; now, if I should give my daughter in <lb/>
            marriage to you, it suggests itself to my mind that you are the <lb/>
            ox, and that I am the ass; when I'm yoked to you, and when <lb/>
            I'm not able to bear the burden equally with yourself, I, the <lb/>
            ass, must lie down in the mire; you, the ox, would regard me <lb/>
            no more than if I had never been born; and I should both find <lb/>
            you unjust, and my own class would laugh at me ; in neither <lb/>
            direction should I have a fixed stall, if there should be any <lb/>
            separationl; the asses would tear me with their teeth, the <lb/>
            oxen would butt at me with their horns. This is the great <lb/>
            hazard, in my passing over from the asses to the oxen.</p>
          <p>MEG. The nearer you can unite yourself in alliance with <lb/>
            the virtuous, so much the better. Do you receive this pro­ <lb/>
            posal, listen to me, and promise her to me.</p>
          <p>Euc. But indeed there is no marriage-portion.</p>
          <p>MEG. You are to give none; so long as she comes with <lb/>
            good principles, she is sufficiently portioned.</p>
          <p>Euc. I say so for this reason, that you mayn't be sup­ <lb/>
            posing that I have found any treasures. <note type="footnote"> 1 Be any separation)—Ver. 190. “ Si quid divortii fuat." By the use of the <lb/>

            or a separation or divorce of the latter from his intended wife, which of course <lb/>
            would lead to the same consequences. The facilities for divorce among the Romare <lb/>

            Euclio intends to play upon the words of Megadorus, “ ludos facias," which may <lb/>

            shops of Rome. </note> <note type="footnote"> I To the Prœtor)—Ver. 272. The “ Prætor” was a magistrate at Rome, who <lb/>
            administered justice, and ranked next to the Consuls. There were eight Prætors <lb/>
            in the time of Cicero. Two of them were employed in adjudicating " in causis <lb/>
            privatis," “disputes concerning private property." One of these was called <lb/>
            “ Prætor urbanus,” or " the city Prætor,” who administered justice when the parties <lb/>
            were “ cives," or possessed the rights of Roman citizenship. The other was called <lb/>
            “ Prætor peregrinus," or “ the foreigners' Prætor,” who administered justice when <lb/>
            both the litigating parties, or only one of them, were “ peregrini," or “ foreigners," <lb/>
            and had not the right of Roman citizenship. The other six Prætors had juris­ <lb/>
            diction in criminal cases, such as murder, adultery, and violence. The Prætors <lb/>
            committed the examination of causes to subordinate judges, who were called <lb/>
            “judices selecti," and they published the sentences of the judges so appointed by <lb/>
            them. The Prætors wore the “ toga prætexta,” or “ magisterial robe," sat on the <lb/>
            “ sella curulis," and were preceded by six lictors. Their duties lasted for a year, <lb/>
            after which they went as governors to such provinces as had no army, which were <lb/>
            assigned to them by lot. There they administered justice in the same way as <lb/>
            they had done as Proctors at Rome, and were called by the name of " Proprætores <lb/>
            though, as such governors, they were also sometimes called " Prætores.” The <lb/>
            office of Prætor was first instituted at Rome A.U.C. 388, partly because the Consuls, <lb/>
            on account of the many wars in which the Romans were engaged, could no longer <lb/>
            administer justice; partly that the Patricians might thereby have a compensation <lb/>
            for admitting the Plebeians to a share in the Consulate. At first there was only <lb/>
            one Prætor; Rylla made their number six; Julius Cæsar eight; and Augustus <lb/>
            increased them to sixteen. It will not escape observation, that Plautus, as usual, <lb/>
            mentions a Roman officer in a Play, the scene of which is supposed to be <lb/>
            Athens. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Not a thief)—Ver. 277. Because " celer," " sharp" or " nimble,” would <lb/>

            cook who only gets employment on the “ Nundinæ,” when the influx of country- <lb/>
            people into the city called the services of even the worst cooks into requisition, <lb/>
            and the eaters were not of the most fastidious description. The " Nundinæ”(so <lb/>
            called from “nonæ,” "ninth," and "dies," “ day") returned every eighth day, <lb/>
            according to our mode of reckoning; but according to the Romans, who, in count­ <lb/>
            ing, reckoned both extremet every ninth day, whence the name. On this day the <lb/>
            country-people came into the city to sell their wares, make their purchases, hear <lb/>
            the new laws read, and learn the news. By the Hortensian law, the “ Nundinæ,” <lb/>
            which before were only “ feriæ,” or “ holidays," were made ” fasti," or “ court­ <lb/>
            days," that the country-people then in town might have their lawsuits deter­ <lb/>
            mined. Lipsius thinks that reference is here made to the feast called ” noven­ <lb/>
            diale," which was sometimes given to the poorer classes on the ninth day after the <lb/>
            funeral of a person of affluence. Probably, the cooking of these banquets was not <lb/>
            of the highest order; but the former seems the more probable explanation of the <lb/>
            passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Three-letteredfellow)—Ver. 280. “ Trium literarum homo;" literally, "man <lb/>

            bilus gives him the leanest one. Hildyard suggests that Congrio fancies that <lb/>
            Strobilus is asking which is the fattest cook, and not the fattest lamb, and ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly says, " Very well," thereby admitting that he is the fattest of the two. <lb/>

          <p>Euc. I wished at length to screw up my courage to-day, <lb/>
            so as to enjoy myself at the wedding of my daughter. I <lb/>
            come to the market, I enquire about fish; they tell me that <lb/>
            it is dear, that lamb is dear, beef is dear, veal, large fish4, <note type="footnote"> 1 You unpurified fellow)-Ver. 313. " Impurate." ' You that are unpurified, <lb/>

            mean the black hole or dungeon alluded to in 1. 301, whence there was no <lb/>
            means of egress but by being drawn up. He means to say that such a place will be <lb/>
            the only one for preventing the cooks from thieving whatever comes in their way. <lb/>

            a rage, since I had nothing wherewithal to make a purchase <lb/>
            and thus did I baulkl all those rascals. Then I began to <lb/>
            think with myself upon the road, " If you are guilty of any <lb/>
            extravagance on a festive day, you may be wanting on a <lb/>
            common day, unless you are saving." After I disclosed this <lb/>
            reasoning to my heart and appetite, my mind came over to <lb/>
            my opinion, that I ought to give my daughter in marriage at <lb/>
            as little expense as possible. Now I've bought a bit of <lb/>
            frankincense, and these chaplets of flowers; these shall be <lb/>
            placed upon the hearth for our household God, that he may <lb/>
            grant a propitious marriage to my daughter. But what <lb/>
            do I? Do I behold my house open? There's a noise, <lb/>
            too, within; is it that I'm robbed, wretch that I am ?</p>

            if this law is laid down for the poor ?" Let them marry <lb/>

            men hiring Congrio, Anthrax, and the “ tibicinæ.” In the “ dramatis personæ” <unclear/> <lb/>

            in some instances, as “ the servant ofMegadorus,” and in others (evidently by mis­ <lb/>

            for this. Eunomia (most probably a widow) is living, together with her son Lyco­ <lb/>

            says in 1. 684, where, speaking of the house of his uncle, he calls it “ ædes nostras," <lb/>
            "our house," which he would not have said had he not been residing there. By <lb/>
            the indulgence of his uncle, who has no children, we may presume that Strobilus <lb/>
            has been permitted to consider him as " his young master." After hiring the cooks, <lb/>
            he has communicated the bad news to Lyconides, who tells him to keep a good <lb/>

          <p>HEGIO, a wealthy native of Ætolia, had two sons, one of which was stolen by a slave <lb/>
            when four years old, and being carried away to Elis, was sold there; the father <lb/>
            being unable for many years to learn what has become of him. A war having <lb/>
            commenced between the Eleans and the Ætolians, Philopolemus, the other son <lb/>
            of Hegio, is taken prisoner by the Eleans. The Ætolians having taken many <lb/>
            Elean prisoners, Hegio commences to traffic in captives, with the view of thereb <lb/>
            redeeming his son from the Eleans, in exchange for some prisoner of rank. A <lb/>
            this conjuncture the Play commences. Among the captives whom Hegio has pur­ <lb/>
            chased, Philocrates is one, having been taken prisoner, together with his ser­ <lb/>
            vant, Tyndarus. With the object of deceiving Hegio, Philocrates and Tyndarus <lb/>
            change their clothes, and having exchanged names as well, Philocrates pretends <lb/>
            to be the servant of Tyndarus. Hegio being desirous to procure the ex­ <lb/>
            change of his son, Philocrates (in the character of the servant of his fellow- <lb/>
            captive) is sent to Elis for that purpose. After his departure, Aristophontes, <lb/>
            another captive, accidentally puts Hegio in the way of discovering the manner <lb/>
            in which he has been deceived. On this, the old man, losing all hope of obtaining <lb/>
            the liberation of his son, sends Tyndarus in chains to the stone-quarries. <lb/>
            Shortly after, Philocrates returns, and brings with him Philopolemus, theson <lb/>
            of Hegio, and Stalagmus, the runaway slave, that had stolen his other son. <lb/>
            It is then discovered that Sta*lagmus had sold the child to the father of Phi­ <lb/>
            locrates, and that he is no other than Tyndarns, the slave; on which, Tyndarus <lb/>
            is sent for, and is informed that he is the lost son of Hegio. Stalagmus is then <lb/>
            condemned to the chains from which Tyndarus is liberated.</p><pb n="425"/>

            humour, in catching or baulking the audience. He begins as though he was <lb/>
            going to explain why the captives are standing there, and ends his explanation <lb/>
            with saying that they are standing because they are not sitting. A similar <lb/>
            truism is uttered by Pamphila, in the Stichus, 1. 120. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 In Elis)—Ver. 9. Elis, or, as it is called by Plautus, “ Alis," was a city of <lb/>
            Achaia, in the north-western part of the Peloponnesus. Near it the Olympic <lb/>
            games were celebrated </note> <lb/>

            captive (pointing to PHILOCRATES). Now, do you under. <lb/>
            stand this ? Very good. I' faith, that man at a distance1 <lb/>
            there (pointing) says, no. Come nearer then. If there isn't <lb/>
            room for you to sit down, there is for you to walk; since <lb/>
            you'd be compelling an actor to bawl like a beggar2. I'm <lb/>
            not going to burst myself for your sake, so don't you be mis­ <lb/>
            taken. You who are enabled by your means to pay your <lb/>
            taxes3, listen to the rest4; I care not to be in debt to another. <lb/>
            This runaway slave, as I said before, sold his young master, <lb/>
            whom, when he fled, he had carried off, to this one's father. <lb/>
            He, after he bought him, gave him as his own private slave5 <note type="footnote"> 1 That man at a distance)—Ver. 11. One of the audience, probably a plebeian <lb/>
            who has no seat, but is standing in a remote part of the theatre, is supposed to <lb/>
            exclaim in a rude manner that he cannot hear what the actor says. On this the <lb/>
            speaker tells him that he had better come nearer ; and if he cannot find a seat, <lb/>
            there is room for him to walk away. Possibly the verb “ambulo” may be in­ <lb/>
            tended to signify in this case either “ to walk" or “ to stand," in contradistinction <lb/>
            to sitting. Rost, with some reason, suggests " abscedito," " walk out," in place of <lb/>
            “ accedito," " come nearer." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To bawl like a beggar)—Ver. 13. Commentators have differed as to the <lb/>
            meaning of this passage. Some think that he means that with the view of <lb/>
            pleasing the plebeian part of the audience, he shall not bawl out like a beggar <lb/>
            asking alms; while others suppose that the meaning is, that he will not run the <lb/>
            risk of cracking his voice, after which be will be hissed off the stage, and so be <lb/>
            reduced to beggary. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To pay your taxes)—Ver. 15. By this he shows that the party whom he <lb/>
            is addressing, is either one of the lowest plebeians or a slave. In the assess­ <lb/>
            ment or census, which was made by the Censors, the slaves were not numbered <lb/>
            at all, being supposed to have no “caput,” or “civil condition." The lowest cen­ <lb/>
            tury were the “ proletarii," whose only qualification was the being heads offami­ <lb/>
            lies, or fathers of children. In addressing those who are reckoned in the census <lb/>
            “ ope vestra," “ by your means" or “ circumstances," he seems to be rebuking the </note><note type="footnote"> “ proletarii," who had no such standing, and who probably formed the most noisy <lb/>
            part of the audience. As these paid no part of the taxes with which the theatres <lb/>
            were in part supported, of course they would be placed at a greater distance from <lb/>
            the stage, and probably were not accommodated with seats. It was just about <lb/>
            this period that the elder Scipio assigned different places in the theatres to the <lb/>
            various classes of the people. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Listen to the rest)—Ver. 16. “ Reliquum” was a term which either signified <lb/>
            generally, “ what is left," or money borrowed and still unpaid. He plays upon <lb/>
            these different meanings—“ Accipite reliquum," which may either signify “ hear <lb/>
            the rest" or “ take what is due and owing," and he then makes the observation, <lb/>
            parenthetically, "alieno uti nil moror," " I don't care to be in debt." </note><note type="footnote"> 5 His own private slave)—Ver. 20. “ Peculiaris" means for his own private <lb/>

            so this son of his, because they were of about the same age. <lb/>
            He is now the slave at home of his own father, nor does his <lb/>
            father know it. Verily, the Gods do treat us men just like <lb/>
            footballs1. You hear the manner now how he lost one sun. <lb/>
            Afterwards, the Ætolians2 are waging war with the people of <lb/>
            Elis, and, as happens in warfare, the other son is taken pri­ <lb/>
            soner. The physician Menarchus buys him there in Elis. <lb/>
            On this, this .legio begins to traffic in Elean captives, if, per­ <lb/>
            chance, he may be able to find one to change for that captive <lb/>
            son of his. He knows not that this one who is in his house <lb/>
            is his own son. And as he heard yesterday that an Elean <lb/>
            knight of very high rank and very high family was taken <lb/>
            prisoner, he has spared no expense to rescue his son3. In <lb/>
            order that he may more easily bring him back home, he buys <lb/>
            both of these of the Quæstors4 out of the spoil.</p>
          <p>Now they, between themselves, have contrived this plan, <lb/>
            that, by means of it, the servant may send away hence his <lb/>
            master home. And therefore among themselves they change <lb/>
            their garments and their names. He, there (pointing), is <lb/>
            called Philocrates; this one (pointing), Tyndarus ; he this <lb/>
            day assumes the character of this one, this one of him. And <lb/>
            this one to-day will cleverly carry out this plot, and cause <lb/>
            his master to gain his liberty ; and by the same means he will <note type="footnote"> son's “ peculium," or cut of his own private purse. The " peculium" was the sum <lb/>
            of money which a son in his minority was allowed by his father to be in possessIOn <lb/>
            of. The word also signified the savings of the slave. </note> <note type="footnote"> I Just like footballs)—Ver. 22. “ Pilas.” Among the ancients, games with <lb/>
            the “ pila" were those played with the “ pila trigonalis," so called, probably, from <lb/>
            he players standing in a triangle, and those with the “ follis," which was a larger <lb/>
            all, inflated with air and struck with the hands, or used for a football. " Paga­ <lb/>
            ica" was a similar ball, but harder, being stuffed with feathers, and was used by <lb/>
            he country-people. “ Harpastum” was a small ball used by the Greeks, which <lb/>
            as scrambled for as soon as it came to the ground, whence it received its name. <lb/>
            the Greeks had a proverb similar to this expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῶν παίγνια ἐνθρωποὶ</foreign>, <lb/>
            ' men are the playthings of the Gods." So Plato called mankind <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέων ἀθύρ</foreign>­ <lb/>

            is living in servitude with his own father. And thus now, <lb/>
            in ignorance, he is the slave of his own father. What poor <lb/>
            creatures are men, when I reflect upon it! This plot will be <lb/>
            performed by us—a play for your entertainment. But there <lb/>
            is, besides, a thing which, in a few words, I would wish to <lb/>
            inform you of. Really, it will be worth your while to give <lb/>

            between the Ætolians and the Eleans. There (pointing), at <lb/>
            a distance, beyond the scenes, the battles will be fought. For <lb/>

            from Thornton's Translation of this Play:—“ The reader's indulgence for the coin­ <lb/>
            age of a new term (and perhaps not quite so much out of character from the mouth <lb/>
            of a Parasite) is here requested in the use of the word ' invocated' in a sense, which </note> <pb n="429"/>
            <note type="margin"> Sc. I. </note> <lb/>
            to attend at the banquet. I know that buffoons1 say that this <lb/>
            is absurdly said, but I affirm that it is rightly said. For at <lb/>
            the banquet the lover, when he throws the dice, invokes his <lb/>
            mistress2. Is she then invocated, or is she not ? She is, <lb/>
            most clearly. But, i' faith, we Parasites with better reason <lb/>
            are so called, whom no person ever either invites or in­ <lb/>
            vokes, and who, like mice, are always eating the victuals of an­ <lb/>
            other person. When business is laid asides, when people <lb/>
            repair to the country, at that same moment is business laid <lb/>
            aside for our teeth. Just as, when it is hot weather, snails <lb/>
            lie hidden in secret, and live upon their own juices, if the <lb/>
            dew doesn't fall; so, when business is laid aside, do Parasites <lb/>
            lie hidden in retirement, and miserably live upon their <lb/>
            own juices, while in the country the persons are rusticating <lb/>
            whom they sponge upon. When business is laid aside, we <lb/>
            Parasites are greyhounds ; when business recommences, like <lb/>
            mastiffs4, we are annoying-like and very troublesome-like5. <note type="footnote"> it is owned, there is no authority for, but without it no way occurs to explain the <lb/>
            poet's meaning-which, such as it is, and involved in such a pun, is all that can <lb/>
            be aimed at. The word ' invocatus' means both ' called upon' and ' not called <lb/>
            upon.' Ergasilus here quibbles upon it; for, though at entertainments he at­ <lb/>
            tends, as it is the common character of Parasites to do, without invitation, that <lb/>
            is 'not called upon;' and as mistresses are 'called upon' that their names so in­ <lb/>
            voked may make their lovers throw the dice with success; still, according to <lb/>
            the double sense of the word, they may be compared to each other, as they axe <lb/>
            both, according to the Latin idiom, ' invocati.'” </note><note type="footnote"> 1 That buffoons)—Ver. 71. "Derisores," "buffoons." By this word he means, <lb/>
            that particular class of Parasites who earned their dinners by their repartees and <lb/>
            bon-mots. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Invokes his mistress)—Ver. 73. It was the Grecian custom, when they threw <lb/>
            dice at an entertainment, for the thrower to call his mistress by name, which in­ <lb/>
            vocation was considered to bring good luck. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 When business is laid aside)—Ver. 78. " Ubi res prolatæ sunt." Meaning <lb/>
            thereby “ in vacation-time." In the heat of summer the courts of justice were <lb/>
            closed, and the more wealthy portion of the Romans retired into the country or to <lb/>
            the seaside. Cicero mentions this vacation as “ rerum prolatio." The allusion in <lb/>
            the previous line is probably derived from a saying of the Cynic Diogenes: when <lb/>
            he saw mice creeping under the table, he used to say, " See the Parasites of Dio­ <lb/>
            genes." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Like mastiffs)—Ver. 86. “ Molossici." Literally, “ dogs of Molossus," a <lb/>

            And here, indeed, unless, i' faith, any Parasite is able to en­ <lb/>
            dure cuffs with the fist, and pots to be brokenl about his <lb/>
            head, why he may e'en go with his wallet outside the Trige­ <lb/>

            danger. For since my patron3 has fallen into the hands of <lb/>
            the enemy—(such warfare are the Ætolians now waging with <lb/>
            the Eleans; for this is Ætolia; this Philopolemus has been <lb/>
            made captive in Elis, the SOIl of this old man Hegio who lives <lb/>
            here (pointing to the house)—a house which to me is a house <lb/>
            of woe, and which so oft as I look upon, I weep). Now, for <lb/>
            the sake of his son, has he commenced this dishonorable <lb/>
            traffic, very much against his own inclination. He buys up <lb/>
            men that have been made captives, if perchance he may be <lb/>
            able to find some one for whom to gain his son in exchange. <lb/>
            An object which I really do much desire that he may gain; <lb/>
            for unless he finds him, there's nowhere for me to find myself. <lb/>
            I have no hopes in the young men; they are all too fond of <lb/>
            themselves. He, in fine, is a youth with the old-fashioned <lb/>
            manners, whose countenance I never rendered cheerful with­ <lb/>
            out a return. His father is worthily matched, as endowed <lb/>
            with like manners. Now I'll go to him;—but his door is <lb/>
            opening, the door from which full oft I've sallied forth drunk <lb/>
            with excess of cheer. (He stands aside.)</p>

            of their fellow-guests. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Trigeminian Gate)—Ver. 90. The Ostian Gate was so called because the <lb/>
            Horatii left the city by that gate to fight the Curiatii. The brothers being born <lb/>
            at one birth were " trigemini," whence the gate received its name. The beggars <lb/>
            with their wallets were seated there. See the Trinummus, 1. 423, and the Note <lb/>

            it is nothing but a meagre repast of vegetables, of which possibly capers formed a <lb/>
            part, which grow plentifully in Italy, in old ruins and craggy spots. Some suggest <lb/>

            entreat you, Hegio, let not my riches make your mind too <lb/>
            prone to avarice, lest it should seem to my father, although <lb/>
            I am his only son, more suitable that I should be a slave <lb/>

            your clothing, rather than be living the life of a beggar where <lb/>

            this, Tyndarus, how well-disposed you have proved towards <lb/>
            his son and himself, he will never be so avaricious but that <lb/>
            he'll give you your liberty for nothing. And by my own <lb/>
            endeavours, if I return hence, I'll make him do so the more <lb/>
            readily. For by your aid and kindness, and good disposition <lb/>
            and prudence, you have caused me to be allowed to return <lb/>
            to my parents once again, inasmuch as to .legio you have <lb/>
            confessed both my rank and my wealth ; by means of which, <lb/>
            through your wisdom, you have liberated your master from <lb/>
            his chains.</p>
          <p>PHIL. The things which you mention I have done, and I <lb/>
            am pleased that you remember this. Deservedly have they <lb/>
            been done for you by me; for now, Philocrates, if I, too, were <lb/>
            to mention the things that you have kindly done for me, the <lb/>
            night would cut short the day. For, had you been my slave <lb/>
            even, no otherwise were you always obliging to me.</p>
          <p>HEG. Ye Gods, by our trust in you! behold the kindly dis­ <lb/>
            position of these persons! How they draw the very tears <lb/>
            from me! See how cordially they love each other, and with <lb/>
            what praises the servant has commended his master.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I' troth, he hasn't commended me the one hun­ <lb/>
            dredth part of what he himself deserves to be commended in <lb/>
            mv praises.</p>
          <p>HEG. (to PHILOCRATES). Since, then, you have acted most <lb/>
            becomingly, now there's an opportunity to add to your good <lb/>
            deeds in managing this matter with fidelity towards him.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I am not able more to wish it done, than by my en <pb n="445"/>

            deavours to try to bring it about. That you may know this, <lb/>
            Hegio, with praises do I call supreme Jove to witness that I <lb/>
            will not prove unfaithful to Philocrates1</p>
          <p>HEa. You are a worthy fellow. PHIL. And that I will <lb/>
            never in anything act otherwise towards him than towards <lb/>
            my own self.</p>
          <p>TYND. I wish you to put these speeches to the test, both <lb/>
            by your deeds and your actions ; and inasmuch as I have said <lb/>
            the less about you than I had wished, I wish you the more <lb/>
            to give me your attention, and take you care not to be angry <lb/>
            with me by reason of these words. But, I beseech you, re­ <lb/>
            flect that you are sent hence home with a price set upon <lb/>
            you at my risk, and that my life is here left as a pledge for <lb/>
            you. Do not you forget me the very moment that you <lb/>
            have left my presence, since you will have left me here <lb/>
            behind a captive in captivity for yourself, and don't consider <lb/>
            yourself as free, and forsake your pledge2, and not use your <lb/>
            endeavours for you to bring his son home again, in return <lb/>
            for me. Understand that you are sent hence valued at <lb/>
            twenty minæ. Take care to prove scrupulously faithful; take <lb/>
            care that you show not a wavering fidelity. For my father, <lb/>
            I am sure, will do everything that he ought to do. Preserve <lb/>
            me as a constant friend to you, and find out3 this person so <lb/>
            lately discovered. These things, by your right hand, holding <lb/>
            you with my own right hand, do I beg of you; do not prove <lb/>
            less true to me than I have proved to you. This matter do you <lb/>
            attend to; you are now my master, you my patron, you my <lb/>
            father; to you do I commend my hopes and my fortunes.</p>

          <p>TYND. Satisfied. PHIL. (to HEGIO). According to your <lb/>

            playing on the worthy old man, Tyndarus shows some alarm on hearing a pass­ <lb/>

            he should express such alarm. It is difficult to say, but, probably, as there was in <lb/>
            the passport a description of the bearer, who would be Philocrates under the name <lb/>
            of Tyndarus, it suddenly comes to the recollection of Tyndarus that they were <lb/>
            originally made prisoners under their proper names, and that possibly Philocrates <lb/>

            these whipping-posts, who have their clever sayings without <lb/>

            who, when they've eaten at their pleasure, may give them a <lb/>
            return at their own houses. They go themselves to market, <lb/>
            which formerly was the province of the Parasites. They go <lb/>
            themselves from the Forum to the procurers with face as ex­ <lb/>

            those who are found guilty; nor do they now value buffoons at <lb/>
            one farthing6; all are so much in love with themselves. For, <lb/>
            when, just now, I went away from here, I came to some young <lb/>
            men in the Forum: " Good morrow," said I; " whither are <lb/>
            we going together to breakfast ?" On this, they were silent. <note type="footnote"> I Filled with hunger)—Ver. 471. This paradoxical expression is similar to the <lb/>

            or “ benches," at the bottom of the table. This was like the custom of the <lb/>
            Spartans, or Laconians, who, eschewing the luxury of reclining, always persisted <lb/>
            in sitting at meals. The Spartans, also, endured pain with the greatest firmness; <lb/>
            a virtue much required by Parasites, in order to put up with the indignities which <lb/>

            where the Tribunes and Ædiles acted as the accusers. The offences for which <lb/>
            persons were summoned before the tribes, were, bad conduct of a magistrate in per­ <lb/>
            formance of his duties, neglect of duty, mismanagement of a war, embezzlement of <lb/>
            the public money, breaches of the peace, usury, adultery, and some other crimes. <lb/>
            The “ Comitia Tributa” were used as courts of appeal, when a person protested <lb/>

            said one funny saying out of my best bon mots, by which I <lb/>
            formerly used to get feasting for a month; not an individual <lb/>

            I was thus made sport of. I went to some others; then to <lb/>
            some others I came ; then to some others-the same the result. <lb/>
            All treat the matter in confederacy, just like the oil-mer­ <lb/>

            I see myself made sport of there. In like manner do other <lb/>

            Now, after the foreign fashions, I'm determined to enforce <lb/>
            all my rights. Those who have entered into a confederacy, by <lb/>

            “ Velabrum” lay between the Palatine and the Capitoline Hills, where fruits and <lb/>
            other commodities were sold in booths, or under awnings, from which (" vela") the <lb/>
            streets probably derived their name. Varro, however, says that they were so called <lb/>
            from the verb “ veho," " to carry;" because in early times those spots were tra­ <lb/>
            versed in boats, which mode of carriage was called “ velatura." From the present <lb/>
            passage, it appears that the oil-merchants in the “ Velabra" acted in confederacy <lb/>
            not to sell their oils under a certain price. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 After the foreign fashion)—Ver. 497. Some suppose that " harbaricâ, lege" <lb/>
            here means “ the foreign" or “ Roman law," and that he refers to the “ Lex <lb/>
            Vinnia, introduced at Rome by Quintus Vinnius, which was said to have been <lb/>
            passed against those persons who confederated for the purpose of keeping up the <lb/>
            high prices of provisions. It is, however, somewhat doubtful if there really was <lb/>
            such a law; and the better opinion seems to be that the word “lege" means <lb/>
            “ fashion” or " custom ;" and that he refers to the Roman method of trial. He will <lb/>
            accuse his former entertainers of a conspiracy to starve him. He will name a day <lb/>

            the Romans. “ Salus," “ Safety" or “ Salvation," was worshipped as a Goddess <lb/>
            at Rome. It is well observed, in Thornton's translation, that the word “ Salus” <lb/>
            may, without ineverence, be translated "Salvation," on no less authority than <lb/>
            that of Archbishop Tillotson. “ If,” says he, “ men will continue in their sins, <lb/>
            the redemption brought by Christ will be of no advantage to them; such as obsti­ <lb/>

            you are slighting me as a stranger, as though you had never <lb/>

            at home I was a free man, you, even from your childhood, <lb/>
            have always served in slavery in Elis.</p>

            Tyndarus, instead of Philocrates.</p>
          <p>TYND. Hegio, this person was accounted a madman in <lb/>
            Elis. Don't you give ear to what he prates about; for at <lb/>
            home he has pursued his father and mother with spears, and <lb/>
            that malady sometimes comes upon him which is spit out1. <lb/>
            Do you this instant stand away at a distance from him.</p>
          <p>HEG. (to the SLAVES). Away with him further off from me. <lb/>
            ARIST. Do you say, you whipp'd knave, that I am mad, <lb/>
            and do you declare that I have followed my own father with <lb/>
            spears ? And that I have that malady, that it's necessary for <lb/>
            me to be spit upon2 ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Which is spit out)—Vcr. 566. Some would render the words “ qui sputatur," <lb/>
            " which is spit upon," and fancy that they find authorities in the ancient writers for <lb/>
            thinking that epilepsy was treated by spitting upon the patient. However, it seems <lb/>
            much more probable, that the notion was that epilepsy was cured by the patient <lb/>
            himself spitting out the noxious saliva; and that the word " sputatur" means, “ is <lb/>
            spit out," i. e. " is cured by spitting." Celsus thus describes the “ comitialis mor­ <lb/>
            bus," " epilepsy," or “ falling sickness:" The person seized, suddenly falls down; <lb/>
            foam drops from the mouth; then, after a little time, he comes to himself, and <lb/>
            gets up again without any assistance." Pliny, in his Natural History, B. 38, <lb/>
            c. 4, says: “ Despuimus comitiales morbos, hoc est, contagia regerimus," “ We <lb/>
            spit out the epilepsy, that is, we avert the contagion." This is said, probably, in <lb/>
            reference to a belief, that on seeing an epileptic person, if we spit, we shall avoid <lb/>
            the contagion; but it by no means follows that the person so doing must spit upon <lb/>
            the epileptic person. We read in the first Book of Samuel, ch. xxi., ver. 12: <lb/>
            “ And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish, the <lb/>
            King of Oath. And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself <lb/>
            mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall <lb/>
            down on his beard." He probably pretended to be attacked with epileptic fits. <lb/>
            In fact, after due examination, there seems little doubt that it was a common <lb/>
            notion with the ancients that the distemper was discharged with the saliva. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To be spit upon)—Ver. 559. Aristophontes has understood the words, “ qui <lb/>
            sputatur," in the sense of " which is spit upon," and asks Tyndarus if he affirms <lb/>
            that he is afflicted with a disease which requires such treatment. Hegio, to pacif, </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 G 2 </note> <pb n="452"/>

          <p>ARIST. Why, what do you say ? Do you, too, credit him ?</p>
          <p>HEG. Credit him in what ? ARIST. That I am mad ?</p>

            his frenzy grows apace; have a care for yourself.</p>
          <p>HEG. I thought that he was mad, the moment that he <lb/>
            called you Tyndarus.</p>
          <p>TYND. Why, he's sometimes ignorant of his own name; <lb/>
            and doesn't know what it is.</p>
          <p>HEG. But he even said that you were his intimate friend.</p>

            Do I not know you ?</p>
          <p>HEG. I' faith, it really is very clear that you don't know <lb/>
            him, who are calling him Tyndarus, instead of Philocrates. <lb/>
            Him whom you see, you don't know; you are addressing him <lb/>
            as the person whom you don't see. <note type="footnote"> him, and to show off his medical knowledge, tells him that it has proved beneficial <lb/>
            in some diseases to be so treated; but he does not go so far as to say what those <lb/>
            diseases were. One malady, called “ herpes," or “ spreading ulcer," was said tc <lb/>
            be highly contagious, but capable of being cured by applications of saliva. Some <lb/>
            Commentators here quote the method which our Saviour adopted in curing the <lb/>
            blind man at Bethsaida: " And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him <lb/>
            out of the town: and when he bad spat on his eyes and put his hands upon him, <lb/>
            he asked him if he saw aught." St. Mark, ch. viii., ver. 23. And again, the ac­ <lb/>
            count given in the ninth chapter of St. John, ver. 6: " When he had thus spoken, <lb/>
            he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of <lb/>
            the blind man with the clay." It may be possible that our Saviour thought fit to <lb/>
            adopt these forms, in imitation of some of the methods of treating diseases in those <lb/>
            times; though, of course, his transcendant power did not require their agency <lb/>

            tacked with frenzy. Orestes slew his mother, Clytemnestra; Alcmæon killed <lb/>
            his mother, Eriphyle; and Lycurgus, King of Thrace, on slighting the worship of <lb/>

          <p>TYND. And so are you a slave, and yet you were a free <lb/>

            that he was born a free man, “ liber." As " Liber" was also a name of Bacchus, <lb/>
            Tyndarus quibbles, and says, " I did not assert that I am Liber, but that I am Phi­ <lb/>
            locrates." In consequence of the idiom of the Latin language, his answer (non <lb/>
            equidem me Liberum, sed Philocratem esse aio) will admit of another quibble, <lb/>
            and may be read as meaning, “ I did not say that I am a free man, but that <lb/>
            Philocrates is." This may be readily seen by the Latin scholar, but is not so easily <lb/>

            name was perhaps derived from the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλεὺς</foreign>, as the title of the <lb/>
            second Athenian Archon, who had his tribunal or court of justice. The building <lb/>
            was probably, in its original form, an insulated portico. The first edifice of this <lb/>
            kind at Rome was erected B.C. 184; probably about the period when this Play was <lb/>
            composed. It was situate in the Forum, and was built by Porcius Cato, from whom <lb/>
            it was called the “ Porcian Basilica." Twenty others were afterwards erected at <lb/>
            different periods in the city. The loungers here mentioned, in the present in­ <lb/>
            stance, were probably sauntering about under the porticos of the Basilica, when <lb/>
            their olfactory nerves were offended by the unsavoury smell of the fishermen's <lb/>

            outchers of three faults-cruelty, knavery, and extortion. The general reading is <lb/>
            “ duplam," but Host suggests “ dupla," " at double the price." If “ duplam " is <lb/>
            retained, might it not possibly mean that the butchers agree to kill lamb for yon, <lb/>
            and bring to you "duplam agninam," "double lamb," or, in other words, lamb <lb/>
            twice as old as it ought to be ? No doubt there was some particular age at which <lb/>

            through a mist, that my father was called Hegio.</p>
          <p>HEG. I am he. PHIL. I pray that your son may be light­ <lb/>

          <p>HEG. I'm resolved that that shall be the first thing at­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">The COMPANY of PLAYERS coming forward.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Spectators, this play is founded on chaste manners. No <lb/>
            wenching is there in this, and no intriguing, no exposure of a <lb/>
            child, no cheating out of money; and no young man in <lb/>
            love here make his mistress free without his father's know <lb/>
            ledge. The Poets find but few Comediesl of this kind, where <lb/>
            good men might become better. Now, if it pleases you, and <lb/>
            if we have pleased you, and have not been tedious, do you <lb/>
            give this sign of it: you who wish that chaste manners should <lb/>
            have their reward, give us your applause. <note type="footnote"> " may give," used by Hegio in its literal sense, and surlily replies, " I have no­ <lb/>
            thing of my own by way of savings, ' peculium,' so I am the very person to Whom <lb/>
            you ought to give." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Find but few Comedies)—Ver. 1038. He here confesses that he does not <lb/>
            pretend to frame the plots of his Plays himself, but that lie goes to Greek sources <lb/>
            for them; and forgetting that beggars must not be choosers," he complains <lb/>
            that so very few of the Greek Comedies are founded upon chaste manners. In­ <lb/>
            deed, this Play is justly deemed the most pure and innocent of all the Plays of <lb/>
            Plautns; and the Company are quite justified in the commendations which, in <lb/>
            their Epilogue, they bestow on it, as the author has carried out the promise which <lb/>
            he made in the Prologue (with only four slight exceptions), of presenting <unclear>them</unclear> <unclear/> <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>ARGYRIPPUS, tne son of Demænetus, is violently in love with Philenium: a <lb/>
            young woman, who is living with her mother, Cleæreta, a procuress. The latter <lb/>
            has made an agreement with a Captain, of the name of Diabolus, to transfer <lb/>
            Philenium to him for twenty minæ, on condition, however, that if Argyrippus <lb/>
            shall first pay that sum, he shall have her. Argyrippus, having exhausted all <lb/>
            his own resources, applies to his father, Demænetus, an over-indulgent and <lb/>
            immoral old man, and requests him to furnish him with twenty minæ. Demæ­ <lb/>
            netus is married to Artemona, a rich woman, and is totally dependant on the <lb/>
            will of herself and her favourite slave, the chamberlain Saurea. Being desti­ <lb/>
            tute of money, Demænetus orders his servant, Libanus, by some means or <lb/>
            other to cheat his mistress or the chamberlain out of that sum. Just then an <lb/>
            ass-dealer arrives, to pay to Saurea twenty minæ, the price of some asses which <lb/>
            he has previously purchased. Libanus then arranges with his fellow-servant, <lb/>
            Leonida, that the latter shall personate Saurea, and so receive the money from <lb/>
            the ass-dealer. This is done, and the money is paid to Leonida, in the presence of <lb/>
            Demænetus, who assures the dealer that Leonida really is the person to whom <lb/>
            the money is payable. This sum is then given to Argyrippus, but with the <lb/>
            disgraceful stipulation that for one day his father shall enjoy the company of <lb/>
            Philenium. This he submits to, and the three sit down to a banquet. The <lb/>
            Captain discovers this, and sends his Parasite to inform Artemona of her <lb/>
            husband's conduct. She accordingly accompanies the Parasite, and discovers <lb/>
            her husband in the company of his son and the young woman; after soundly <lb/>
            rating him, she leads him off; whIle Argyrippus remains in possession of Phi­ <lb/>

            Adelphi of Terence, and was a Comic Poet, contemporary with Menander. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Marcus)—Ver. 11. Marcus is the word used here. It is supposed to be a <lb/>

            of this passage is obvious, that “ trusting is bad ;” but the signification of the word <lb/>
            “cccio" has puzzled the Commentators. Gronovius, with some probibility, <lb/>

            the hangman's days will be rendered famous by ourselves. <lb/>
            Libanus, now have we occasion to find some boldness and <lb/>
            inventiveness. An exploit so great have I thought of just <lb/>
            now, that we two may be pronounced the most deserving of <lb/>
            all for torture to befall us.</p>
          <p>LIB. 'Twas on that account I was wondering why my <lb/>
            shoulder-blades were aching just now, which were beginning <lb/>
            to prognosticate that there was some danger for them at <lb/>
            home. Whatever it is, speak out.</p>
          <p>LEON. 'Tis great booty with great risk.</p>
          <p>LIB. If indeed all persons by compact were to collect all <lb/>
            the tortures, I have, I fancy, a back at home, so that I need <lb/>
            not seek it out of doors.</p>
          <p>LEON. If you maintain such firmness of resolve, then we <lb/>
            are all right.</p>
          <p>LIB. Why, if the matter were to be atoned for by my back, <lb/>
            I could wish to seize the public money: I'll persist in my <lb/>
            denial, and I'll endure all; in fine, I'll forswear myself.</p>
          <p>LEON. Ah! that's true valour, when occasion is, for one to <lb/>
            endure misfortune with boldness. He that endures misfor­ <lb/>

            to tempt the scourge.</p>
          <p>LEON. (breathing hard). Ask deliberately each particular <lb/>
            then, that I may rest me. Don't you see that I'm still out <lb/>

            At once I made myself courteous, and a person of con­ <lb/>
            sequence. I said that I was the chamberlain. Thus, in <lb/>
            these terms did he answer me: " Upon my faith, I don't know <lb/>
            Saurea, nor yet of what appearance he is. It isn't fair for you <lb/>
            to blame me; but if you like, bring here Demænetus, your mas­ <lb/>
            ter, whom I do know; I'll not prevent you taking the money <lb/>
            then." I said that I would bring him, and that I should <lb/>
            be at home immediately. He's about to go to the baths1, <lb/>
            from there he'll afterwards come here. What plan do you <lb/>
            think, now, I ought to adopt ? Tell me.</p>
          <p>LIB. Why, I'm thinking of this, how to get between the <lb/>
            money, and the stranger, and Saurea. At present this matter <lb/>
            is rough-hewn; but if this stranger brings here the money <lb/>
            first, then are we both at once shut out from it. But the <lb/>
            old man to-day took me apart at a distance from the <lb/>
            house, and threatened me and yourself that we should be <lb/>
            tasters of the elm twigs, if Argyrippus didn't this very day <lb/>
            get twenty minæ of silver. He commanded that we should <lb/>
            cheat either the chamberlain or his own wife, and said that he <lb/>
            would give the aid he promised. Now, do you go to the <lb/>
            Forum to our master, and tell him this, how we are going to <lb/>
            manage; that you, from Leonida, are going to be the cham­ <lb/>
            berlain Saurea, until the dealer has brought the money for <lb/>
            the asses.</p>

            he should come first.</p>

          <p>LiE. Why I thought that you had touched it, because you <lb/>

            has a similar passage in his Amores, B. 1, El. 6, l. 74. In his address to the <lb/>
            "janitor," he says, " Duraqne conserve, ligna, valete, fores," " And you, ye doors <lb/>

            with me, and nowhere have I anything to bestow upon her ; <lb/>
            for that reason has her mother expelled me with all my <lb/>
            affection from her house. The twenty minæ of silver have <lb/>
            brought me to my end, which the young man, Diabolus, de­ <lb/>
            clared that he would give her this day, in order that she <lb/>
            mightn't send her anywhere, for this whole year, except to <lb/>
            himself. Don't you see of what force are twenty minæ of <lb/>

          <p>PHÆDROMUS is desperately in love with Planesium, wiio is in the possession of <lb/>
            Cappadox, an avaricious Procurer. Not having the means of obtaining her <lb/>
            freedom, Phædromus sends Curculio, his Parasite, to Caria, to borrow the <lb/>
            money from a friend. The friend being unable to lend it, Curculio by accident <lb/>
            meets a military officer, named Therapontigonus, and is invited by him to dinner. <lb/>
            The Captain accidentally mentionsto him that he has agreed to purchase Plane­ <lb/>
            sium of the Procurer, and that the money is deposited with Lyco, the banker, who <lb/>
            has been ordered, on receiving a letter signed with the Captain's signet, to have <lb/>
            the young woman delivered to the bearer. While the Captain is overpowered <lb/>
            with wine, Curculio steals his signet, and hastens back to Epidaurus, where he <lb/>
            forges a letter by means of it, which he delivers to Lyco, as though from the <lb/>
            Captain. The money is paid to the Procurer, and Planesium is banded over to <lb/>
            Curculio; a condition having been previously made, that if she should turn out to <lb/>
            be a free woman by birth, the money shall be repaid to the purchaser. Curculio <lb/>
            then delivers Planesium to Phædromus. The same day, the Captain arrives at <lb/>
            Epidaurus, and is soon after recognized by Planesium as her brother, through <lb/>
            the medium of the ring, which had belonged to her father. To corroborate her <lb/>
            assertion, Planesium produces another ring, which Therapontigonus had pre. <lb/>
            sented to her when a child as a birthday present. On this, she is given by ber <lb/>

            “ foreigners." The metaphor is borrowed from the fact that dancing, leaping, and <lb/>
            gestures, were the especial features of their performances. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pour a little water)—Ver. 160. To prevent their creaking, so that Cappadox <lb/>

            legal phrase here. “ Vadimonium legere" was, “ to call a person on his bail" or <lb/>
            “ recognizances.” When the Prætor had granted an action, the plaintiff required <lb/>
            the defendant to give security for his appearance on the day named. The de­ <lb/>
            fondant, on finding a surety, was said “ vadem dare," or “ vadimonium facere <lb/>

            the surety, was said "vadari rerum," "to let the defendant go on his sureties." <lb/>

            Caria; I saw your friend; I asked him to make me a loan <lb/>
            of some money. In answer, you were to know that he was <lb/>
            willing to oblige you; he didn't wish to disappoint you, as it <lb/>
            is only proper that a person who is a friend should be ready, and <lb/>
            should assist his friend. In a few words he answered me, <lb/>
            and quite in confidence, that he also was in the same extreme <lb/>
            want of money as yourself.</p>
          <p>PHÆD. By your words you ensure my undoing.</p>
          <p>CUR. Why no; I'm saving you, and wish you to be saved. <lb/>
            After this answer was given me, I went away from him to <lb/>
            the Forum, in sorrow that I had applied to him in vain. By <lb/>
            accident I espied a military officer; this person I accosted, <lb/>
            and as I approached I saluted him. " Save you," said he to <lb/>
            me, took my right hand, drew me aside, and asked me why I <lb/>
            had come to Caria. I said that I had come there for the sake <lb/>
            of amusement. Upon this he asked me whether I knew <lb/>
            a certain Lyco, a banker of Epidaurus. I said I knew <lb/>
            him. " Well, and the Procurer Cappadox?” I answered <lb/>
            yes, that I had seen him. “ But what do you want of him ?" <lb/>
            said I. "Because," said he, "I bought of him a girl for <lb/>
            thirty minæ, her clothes and golden jewels too ; and for these <lb/>
            last ten minæ more are added “ Have you paid the money ?’ <lb/>
            said I. " No,” said he; " it is lodged with this Lyco the <lb/>
            banker, whom I was mentioning, and I've instructed him that <note type="footnote"> 2 x </note> <pb n="546"/>

            receive the damsel, with her jewels of gold and her clothes, <lb/>
            from the Procurer." After he told me this, I was going away <lb/>
            from him. At once he called me back, invited me to dinner; <lb/>
            it was a point of conscience, I was unwilling to refuse him. <lb/>
            " What if we go off home, and take our places at table <lb/>
            said he. The suggestion pleased me; it is neither proper to <lb/>
            lengthen out the day, nor to curtail the night. Everything <lb/>
            was prepared, and we, for whom it was prepared, were at our <lb/>
            places. After we had dined and well drunk, he asked for <lb/>
            the dice to be fetched him. He challenged me to play with <lb/>
            him a game of hazard. I staked my cloak, he staked his <lb/>
            ring against it; he called on the name1 of Planesium.</p>

            He threw a most losing cast2. I took up the dice, and <lb/>
            invoked Hercules as my genial patron3; I threw a first-rate <lb/>
            cast4, and pledged him in a bumping cup; in return he drank <lb/>
            it off, reclined his head, and fell fast asleep. I slily took away <lb/>
            from him the ring, and took my legs quietly from off the couch, <lb/>
            so that the Captain mightn't perceive it. The servants en­ <lb/>
            quired whither I was going; I said that I was going whither <lb/>
            persons when full are wont to go. When I beheld the door, <lb/>

            rendered their effects to the Prætor, and by doing so, contrived to make a purse, <lb/>
            as is too often done by bankrupts and insolvents at the present day. In 1. 684 <lb/>

            a general term, “ the family of one-eyed men." Horatius, who, single-handed, <lb/>
            opposed the army of Porsenna, was called “ Cocles," from having but one eye. <lb/>

          <p>LYC. For what reason this? CUR. I'll tell you; why, <lb/>

            " Thirsty-land." By Centauromachia he perhaps means Thessaly, the country <lb/>

            used for “ classis," “ an army." “ Unomammia," “ the land of the one-breasted <lb/>
            people," may perhaps be an allusion to the Amazons, who were feigned to be in the <lb/>
            habit of cutting off one breast, for the purpose of using the bow with greater <lb/>

            It was near the " Puteal Libonis," or “ Scribonianum," where witnesses were <lb/>

            market. In the lower part of the Forum good men2 and <lb/>
            opulent do walk; in the middle, near the canal3, there are <lb/>
            the mere puffers-off. Beyond the lake4 of Ourtius are impu­ <lb/>
            dent, talkative, and malevolent fellows, who boldly, without <lb/>
            reason, utter calumnies about another, and who, themselves, <lb/>
            have sufficient that might with truth be said against them. <lb/>
            There, at the old shops6, are those who lend and those who <lb/>
            borrow at interest. Behind the Temple of Castor there <lb/>
            are those to whom unguardedly you may be lending to your <lb/>
            cost. There, in the Etrurian street, are those men who hold <lb/>

            baker, or butcher, or soothsayer; either those who sell <lb/>

            by walkers. It is not accurately known in what part of Rome it was situate. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Beyond the lake)—Ver. 477. He probably alludes to the former site of the <lb/>
            Curtian Lake, which, in his time, was dried up. Ovid says, in the Fasti, B. vi., <lb/>
            l. 401, “ This place, where now are the markets, formerly fenny marshes covered; <lb/>
            a ditch was here swimming with water from the overflowing of the river. That <lb/>
            spot formed the Curtian Lake, which now supports the altars on dry ground: 'tis <lb/>
            now dry ground, but once it was a lake." It is not a little amusing, that though <lb/>
            the Scene is in Epidaurus, Plautus is here discussing Roman scenes and manners. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The old shops)—Ver. 481. He probably alludes to the old shops in the Forum, <lb/>

            mortals, in my way of thinking at least, are just like flies, <lb/>
            gnats, bugs, lice, and fleas—a plague, a mischief, and a nui­ <lb/>

            whom it is lost outright. As for example, before this Lyco <lb/>

            counter. After there were no proceeds, I summoned the <lb/>
